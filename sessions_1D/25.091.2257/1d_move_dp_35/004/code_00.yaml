task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1 row, N columns)
component_identification:
  - object: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: static_area
  - object: anchor_pixel
    properties:
      color: magenta (6)
      shape: single_pixel
      count: 1
      role: stationary_reference_point
      location: fixed_column_index (within the single row)
  - object: movable_block
    properties:
      color: non-white, non-magenta (variable: yellow(4), azure(8), blue(1) in examples)
      shape: contiguous_horizontal_block (within the single row)
      count: 1
      role: object_to_be_moved
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  affected_object: movable_block
  shift_rule: Shift the movable_block rightwards within its row until its rightmost pixel is located at the column index immediately preceding the column index of the anchor_pixel.
  post_action:
    - Fill the original column indices occupied by the movable_block with the background color (white, 0).
relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency (horizontal)
    object1: movable_block (rightmost pixel)
    object2: anchor_pixel
    condition_in_output: object1 is in the column immediately to the left of object2.
invariants:
  - grid_dimensions (1xN)
  - row_index (always 0)
  - position_of_anchor_pixel (column index)
  - color_of_anchor_pixel
  - color_of_movable_block
  - length_of_movable_block
  - position_of_background_pixels (excluding those affected by the block move)
assumptions:
  - Input is always a 2D grid with exactly one row.
  - There is always exactly one anchor_pixel (magenta, 6).
  - There is always exactly one movable_block (contiguous, non-white, non-magenta).
