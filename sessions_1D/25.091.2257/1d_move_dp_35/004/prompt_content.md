"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by:
1. Identifying a single 'anchor' pixel (magenta, color 6) which remains stationary.
2. Identifying a contiguous horizontal block of a single color (neither white 0 nor magenta 6).
3. Shifting this block horizontally to the right so that its rightmost pixel is positioned immediately to the left of the anchor pixel.
4. Filling the original location of the shifted block with the background color (white, 0).
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
