task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
grid_properties:
  width: variable (e.g., 21 in examples)
  height: 1
component_identification:
  - object: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: static_area_filler
  - object: anchor_pixel
    properties:
      color: magenta (6)
      shape: single_pixel
      count: 1
      role: fixed_reference_point
      state: static_position
  - object: movable_block
    properties:
      color: non-white, non-magenta (variable: yellow(4), azure(8), blue(1) in examples)
      shape: contiguous_horizontal_block
      count: 1
      role: object_to_be_moved
      state: position_changes
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  affected_object: movable_block
  shift_rule: Move the movable_block rightwards such that its rightmost pixel occupies the grid index immediately preceding the index of the anchor_pixel.
  implicit_action: fill_original_location
  details: The grid cells originally occupied by the movable_block become background (white) pixels in the output grid.

  - length_of_movable_block
  - color_of_background_pixels (except where overwritten by moved block or previously occupied by it)
derived_properties:
  - output_start_index_of_movable_block: `(index_of_anchor_pixel - length_of_movable_block)`
  - output_end_index_exclusive_of_movable_block: `index_of_anchor_pixel`
