Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels.
Each input grid contains:
1.  A background of white pixels (color 0).
2.  A single magenta pixel (color 6).
3.  A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of *another* color (yellow, azure, or blue in the examples).

The transformation involves moving the contiguous block horizontally.
Specifically, the block shifts to the right.
The final position of the block is such that its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left side of the single magenta pixel.
The space originally occupied by the block becomes white (background color).
The magenta pixel and all other white pixels (that were not part of the moved block's original location) remain in their original positions.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
component_identification:
  - object: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: static_area
  - object: target_pixel
    properties:
      color: magenta (6)
      shape: single_pixel
      count: 1
      role: anchor_point
  - object: movable_block
    properties:
      color: non-white, non-magenta (variable: yellow, azure, blue in examples)
      shape: contiguous_horizontal_block
      count: 1
      role: object_to_be_moved
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  affected_object: movable_block
  shift_rule: Move the movable_block rightwards until its rightmost pixel is located at the column index immediately preceding the column index of the target_pixel.
  post_action:
    - Fill the original location of the movable_block with background (white) pixels.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    object1: movable_block (rightmost pixel)
    object2: target_pixel
    condition_in_output: object1 is immediately to the left of object2.
invariants:
  - grid_dimensions
  - position_of_target_pixel
  - position_of_background_pixels (excluding those replaced by the moved block or those filling the block's original space)
  - color_of_target_pixel
  - color_of_movable_block
  - length_of_movable_block
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the grid dimensions (which remain constant).
2.  Locate the position (column index) of the single magenta pixel (color 6). This is the target position's right boundary.
3.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white, non-magenta pixels. Note its color, starting column index, and ending column index (length).
4.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Place the magenta pixel (color 6) in the new grid at its original column index.
6.  Determine the new starting column index for the identified block. This will be `(magenta_pixel_index - block_length)`.
7.  Place the block (using its original color and length) into the new grid starting at this new calculated index and ending at the index immediately before the magenta pixel (`magenta_pixel_index - 1`).
8.  Fill any remaining positions in the new grid with the background color (white, 0), ensuring positions already filled by the block or the magenta pixel are not overwritten. (Step 4 handles most of this, this is just a clarification).
9.  The resulting grid is the output.
