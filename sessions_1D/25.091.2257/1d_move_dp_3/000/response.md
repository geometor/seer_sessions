*   **Perception:** The input and output are represented as 1D arrays or sequences of pixels. Each input sequence contains three main components: a background of white pixels (0), a single contiguous block of a specific color (e.g., red '2', orange '7', magenta '6'), and a single blue pixel (1). The blue pixel always appears to the right of the colored block. The transformation involves shifting the colored block horizontally to the right until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left of the blue pixel. The blue pixel itself and the background pixels not involved in the shift remain unchanged. The space originally occupied by the colored block becomes white.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - object: background
        color: white (0)
        role: static space
      - object: colored_block
        color: varies (non-white, non-blue)
        shape: contiguous horizontal segment
        count: 1
        role: moving element
      - object: target_pixel
        color: blue (1)
        shape: single pixel
        count: 1
        role: destination marker

    actions:
      - action: identify
        target: colored_block
        attributes: [color, start_index, end_index]
      - action: identify
        target: target_pixel

      - action: calculate
        variable: shift_distance
        description: Number of background pixels between the end_index of colored_block and the index of target_pixel.
        formula: target_pixel.index - colored_block.end_index - 1

        description: Generate the output sequence.
        steps:
          - step: Initialize output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
          - step: Change pixels in the output sequence from colored_block.start_index to colored_block.end_index to white (0).
          - step: Change pixels in the output sequence from (colored_block.start_index + shift_distance) to (colored_block.end_index + shift_distance) to the color of the colored_block.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of pixels that are not white (0) and not blue (1). Record its color, start index, and end index.
    2.  Identify the single blue pixel (1) and record its index.
    3.  Calculate the distance to shift the colored block: subtract the end index of the colored block from the index of the blue pixel, then subtract 1.
    4.  Create the output sequence by copying the input sequence.
    5.  In the output sequence, change the pixels from the original start index to the original end index of the colored block to white (0).
    6.  In the output sequence, change the pixels from (original start index + shift distance) to (original end index + shift distance) to the original color of the colored block.
    7.  Leave all other pixels (including the blue pixel) unchanged.
