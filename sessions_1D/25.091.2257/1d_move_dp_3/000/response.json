Each input sequence contains three main components: a background of white pixels (0), a single contiguous block of a specific color (e.g., red '2', orange '7', magenta '6'), and a single blue pixel (1). The blue pixel always appears to the right of the colored block. The transformation involves shifting the colored block horizontally to the right until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left of the blue pixel. The blue pixel itself and the background pixels not involved in the shift remain unchanged. The space originally occupied by the colored block becomes white.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
