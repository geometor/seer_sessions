Identifies a contiguous horizontal line of a single color (not white 0 or azure 8) and a single azure pixel (8) in a 1D input grid.
Moves the colored line horizontally so that its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left of the azure pixel.
The background remains white (0), and the azure pixel's position is unchanged. The length and color of the line are preserved.
