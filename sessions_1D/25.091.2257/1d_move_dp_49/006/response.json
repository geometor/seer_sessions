            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code attempted to implement the observed transformation: locating an anchor pixel (azure, 8) and a colored line (non-white, non-azure), then repositioning the line so its right end is adjacent to the left of the anchor. However, the execution results show that for all training examples, the function returned the original input grid instead of the transformed one. The code included a `try...except` block that returns the original `input_grid` upon encountering a `ValueError` or `IndexError`. This indicates that an assumption made by the code (e.g., finding exactly one anchor, finding a line, or placing the line within bounds) failed during execution, triggering the exception handler.\n\nThe core logic identified (find anchor, find line, calculate new position `anchor_index - line_length`, place line and anchor in new grid) appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples. The failure suggests a potential issue in the implementation of the helper functions (`_find_anchor`, `_find_colored_line`) or in the bounds checking/placement logic within the main `transform` function, causing an unexpected error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-evaluate the helper functions and placement logic for potential edge cases or errors missed in the initial analysis.\n2.  Use `tool_code` to precisely quantify the differences between the expected output and the actual (failed) output for each example.\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on the confirmed logic, ensuring clarity on object identification and the repositioning action.\n4.  Modify the python code to be more robust or to explicitly raise errors instead of returning the input, which might help pinpoint the failure point if tested again.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"

Calculate the target end index (exclusive) for the colored line: `new_line_end_index = anchor_index`.\n9.  Verify that the calculated placement range (`new_line_start_index` to `new_line_end_index`) is valid within the grid boundaries (i.e., `new_line_start_index >= 0`).
