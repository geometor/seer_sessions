"""
Identifies a contiguous horizontal line of a single color (not white 0 or azure 8) 
and a single azure pixel (8) in a 1D input grid (represented as a list). 
Creates a new grid of the same size, filled with white (0). Places the azure 
pixel (8) at its original position in the new grid. Moves the identified 
colored line horizontally so that its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent 
to the left of the azure pixel's position. The line's color and length are 
preserved. Assumes exactly one anchor pixel and one contiguous colored line 
segment exist in the input.
