            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code attempted to implement the observed transformation: moving a colored horizontal line so its right end is adjacent to the left side of a static azure anchor pixel. The test results indicate that the `transform` function consistently returned the original input grid instead of the transformed one for all three training examples.\n\nThis failure mode, where the input is returned unchanged, strongly suggests that the function exited prematurely. Reviewing the provided \"Previous Code\", this likely happened within one of the `try...except ValueError` blocks designed to handle cases where the anchor or colored line couldn't be found as expected. However, based on visual inspection and the task description, the training inputs *do* contain the expected anchor and colored line.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is:\n\n1.  **Verify Assumptions:** Use `tool_code` to programmatically confirm the presence and properties (location, color, length) of the anchor pixel and the colored line in each input and output example. This ensures the underlying assumptions about the data structure are correct.\n2.  **Refine Implementation:** Re-implement the core logic. While the previous logic *appeared* correct on manual tracing, there might have been a subtle implementation error or an issue with how the error handling was structured. The refined implementation will focus on clarity and ensure the transformation steps (identify anchor, identify line, create output grid, place anchor, calculate new line position, place line) are executed correctly. Error handling will be adjusted to potentially allow errors to propagate for better debugging if assumptions about the input format are violated unexpectedly.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the confirmed understanding of the objects, properties, and transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
