"""
Identifies a contiguous horizontal line of a single color (not white 0 or azure 8) 
and a single azure pixel (8) in a 1D input grid. Creates a new grid where the 
colored line is moved horizontally so that its rightmost pixel is immediately 
adjacent to the left of the azure pixel's original position. The background is 
white (0), and the azure pixel's position, line color, and line length are 
preserved in the output.
