Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data are presented as flat lists of integers. Given the context of ARC tasks and the lengths of the arrays (29, a prime number), it's highly likely they represent 1x29 grids (single rows).
2.  **Colors & Objects:**
    *   Each example features a background of white (0).
    *   There is always a single azure (8) pixel, acting as a fixed point or anchor.
    *   There is a contiguous horizontal segment (line) of a single non-white, non-azure color (orange=7, yellow=4, red=2). This colored line is the primary object being manipulated.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves repositioning the colored horizontal line relative to the azure pixel. The azure pixel itself does not change its position between input and output. The colored line is moved horizontally so that its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the azure pixel. The length and color of the line remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: 1D array (likely representing a 1xN grid)
  colors_present:
    - white (0): background
    - azure (8): static anchor point
    - variable color (C): forms a contiguous horizontal line (e.g., orange=7, yellow=4, red=2)
objects:
  - object_type: anchor_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - static position between input and output
  - object_type: colored_line
    color: variable (C), non-white, non-azure
    count: 1
    shape: contiguous horizontal segment
    properties:
      - constant length
      - constant color
      - dynamic position
relationships:
  - relation_type: spatial_adjacency
    object1: colored_line (right end)
    object2: anchor_pixel (left side)
    state_in_output: adjacent (object1 immediately to the left of object2)
actions:
  - action_type: identify
    target: anchor_pixel
    result: location (index)
  - action_type: identify
    target: colored_line
    result: color (C), length (L), location (start/end indices)
  - action_type: reposition
    target: colored_line
    constraint: move the line such that its right end index = anchor_pixel_index - 1
    details: maintain color (C) and length (L)
  - action_type: reconstruct
    target: output_grid
    steps:
      - create blank grid (all white)
      - place anchor_pixel at its original location
      - place colored_line at its new calculated location
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid (represented as a 1D array).
2.  Locate the single azure pixel (color 8) and remember its index (`anchor_index`).
3.  Locate the contiguous sequence of pixels that are neither white (0) nor azure (8). Record its color (`line_color`) and its length (`line_length`).
4.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
5.  Place the azure pixel (8) back into the output grid at its original `anchor_index`.
6.  Calculate the starting index for the repositioned line: `new_line_start_index = anchor_index - line_length`.
7.  Fill the segment of the output grid starting at `new_line_start_index` and ending just before `anchor_index` (for a total of `line_length` pixels) with the `line_color`.
8.  The resulting grid is the final output.
