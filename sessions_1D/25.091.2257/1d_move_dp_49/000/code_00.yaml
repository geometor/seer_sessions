task_context:
  grid_representation: 1D array (likely representing a 1xN grid)
  colors_present:
    - white (0): background
    - azure (8): static anchor point
    - variable color (C): forms a contiguous horizontal line (e.g., orange=7, yellow=4, red=2)
objects:
  - object_type: anchor_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - static position between input and output
  - object_type: colored_line
    color: variable (C), non-white, non-azure
    count: 1
    shape: contiguous horizontal segment
    properties:
      - constant length
      - constant color
      - dynamic position
relationships:
  - relation_type: spatial_adjacency
    object1: colored_line (right end)
    object2: anchor_pixel (left side)
    state_in_output: adjacent (object1 immediately to the left of object2)
actions:
  - action_type: identify
    target: anchor_pixel
    result: location (index)
  - action_type: identify
    target: colored_line
    result: color (C), length (L), location (start/end indices)
  - action_type: reposition
    target: colored_line
    constraint: move the line such that its right end index = anchor_pixel_index - 1
    details: maintain color (C) and length (L)
  - action_type: reconstruct
    target: output_grid
    steps:
      - create blank grid (all white)
      - place anchor_pixel at its original location
      - place colored_line at its new calculated location
