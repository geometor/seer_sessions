Given the context of ARC tasks and the lengths of the arrays (29, a prime number), it's highly likely they represent 1x29 grids (single rows).\n2.  **Colors & Objects:**\n    *   Each example features a background of white (0).\n    *   There is always a single azure (8) pixel, acting as a fixed point or anchor.\n    *   There is a contiguous horizontal segment (line) of a single non-white, non-azure color (orange=7, yellow=4, red=2). This colored line is the primary object being manipulated.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves repositioning the colored horizontal line relative to the azure pixel. The azure pixel itself does not change its position between input and output. The colored line is moved horizontally so that its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the azure pixel. The length and color of the line remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Locate the single azure pixel (color 8) and remember its index (`anchor_index`).\n3.  Locate the contiguous sequence of pixels that are neither white (0) nor azure (8). Record its color (`line_color`) and its length (`line_length`).\n4.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).\n5.  Place the azure pixel (8) back into the output grid at its original `anchor_index`.\n6.  Calculate the starting index for the repositioned line: `new_line_start_index = anchor_index - line_length`.\n7.  Fill the segment of the output grid starting at `new_line_start_index` and ending just before `anchor_index` (for a total of `line_length` pixels) with the `line_color`.\n8.
