task_description: Reposition a colored block to be adjacent to a fixed green pixel.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    identifier: anchor_pixel
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      count: 1
      position: fixed relative to grid boundaries between input and output
  - object_type: block
    identifier: main_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-green (3)
      shape: contiguous horizontal line
      count: 1
      length: preserved between input and output
      color_value: preserved between input and output
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: anchor_pixel
    details: Find the index of the green (3) pixel.
  - action: identify
    target: main_block
    details: Find the contiguous block of non-white, non-green pixels. Note its color, starting index, and length.
  - action: calculate_new_position
    target: main_block
    details: Determine the target end index for the main_block, which is (index_of_anchor_pixel - 1). Determine the target start index, which is (target_end_index - length_of_main_block + 1).
  - action: reconstruct_output
    details: Create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0). Place the main_block (with original color and length) at the calculated target start index. Place the anchor_pixel (green, 3) at its original index.
relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [main_block, anchor_pixel]
    details: In the output, the right end of the main_block must be immediately to the left of the anchor_pixel.
