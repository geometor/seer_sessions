Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (single rows) of pixels.
2.  **Colors**: The grids primarily use white (0) as a background. Each grid contains exactly one green (3) pixel. Each grid also contains a contiguous block of another single color (yellow (4) in example 1, orange (7) in example 2, gray (5) in example 3).
3.  **Objects**: We can identify two main objects in each input grid:
    *   A single green pixel (color 3).
    *   A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of a single color, which is neither white nor green. Let's call this the "main block".
4.  **Transformation**: Comparing inputs and outputs, the key change is the position of the main block. The green pixel appears to stay in the same absolute position within the grid. The main block moves horizontally so that its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the green pixel in the output grid. The color and length of the main block remain unchanged.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_description: Reposition a colored block to be adjacent to a fixed green pixel.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    identifier: anchor_pixel
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      count: 1
      position: fixed relative to grid boundaries between input and output
  - object_type: block
    identifier: main_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-green (3)
      shape: contiguous horizontal line
      count: 1
      length: preserved between input and output
      color_value: preserved between input and output
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: anchor_pixel
    details: Find the index of the green (3) pixel.
  - action: identify
    target: main_block
    details: Find the contiguous block of non-white, non-green pixels. Note its color, starting index, and length.
  - action: calculate_new_position
    target: main_block
    details: Determine the target end index for the main_block, which is (index_of_anchor_pixel - 1). Determine the target start index, which is (target_end_index - length_of_main_block + 1).
  - action: reconstruct_output
    details: Create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0). Place the main_block (with original color and length) at the calculated target start index. Place the anchor_pixel (green, 3) at its original index.
relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [main_block, anchor_pixel]
    details: In the output, the right end of the main_block must be immediately to the left of the anchor_pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find the index (position) of the single green pixel (3). Store this index.
3.  Scan the input grid to find the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not green (3). Identify its color, its starting index, and its length.
4.  Calculate the target ending index for this block in the output grid: it should be the index immediately preceding the green pixel's index (i.e., `green_pixel_index - 1`).
5.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output grid: it should be `target_ending_index - block_length + 1`.
6.  Place the identified block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated target starting index.
7.  Place the green pixel (3) into the output grid at its original index (found in step 2).
8.  The resulting grid is the final output.
