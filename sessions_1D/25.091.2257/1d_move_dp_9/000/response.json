Each grid contains exactly one green (3) pixel. Each grid also contains a contiguous block of another single color (yellow (4) in example 1, orange (7) in example 2, gray (5) in example 3).\n3.  **Objects**: We can identify two main objects in each input grid:\n    *   A single green pixel (color 3).\n    *   A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of a single color, which is neither white nor green. Let's call this the \"main block\".\n4.  **Transformation**: Comparing inputs and outputs, the key change is the position of the main block. The green pixel appears to stay in the same absolute position within the grid. The main block moves horizontally so that its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the green pixel in the output grid. The color and length of the main block remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
