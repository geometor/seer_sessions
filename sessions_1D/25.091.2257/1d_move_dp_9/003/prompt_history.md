Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (single rows) of pixels.
2.  **Colors**: The grids primarily use white (0) as a background. Each grid contains exactly one green (3) pixel. Each grid also contains a contiguous block of another single color (yellow (4) in example 1, orange (7) in example 2, gray (5) in example 3).
3.  **Objects**: We can identify two main objects in each input grid:
    *   A single green pixel (color 3).
    *   A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of a single color, which is neither white nor green. Let's call this the "main block".
4.  **Transformation**: Comparing inputs and outputs, the key change is the position of the main block. The green pixel appears to stay in the same absolute position within the grid. The main block moves horizontally so that its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the green pixel in the output grid. The color and length of the main block remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find the index (position) of the single green pixel (3). Store this index.
3.  Scan the input grid to find the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not green (3). Identify its color, its starting index, and its length.
4.  Calculate the target ending index for this block in the output grid: it should be the index immediately preceding the green pixel's index (i.e., `green_pixel_index - 1`).
5.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output grid: it should be `target_ending_index - block_length + 1`.
6.  Place the identified block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated target starting index.
7.  Place the green pixel (3) into the output grid at its original index (found in step 2).
8.  The resulting grid is the final output.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components (a colored block, a green pixel, background) and the basic transformation (moving the block adjacent to the green pixel). However, the Python code failed during execution on all examples with a "truth value of an array is ambiguous" error. This error strongly indicates that a NumPy array was used in a boolean context where a single True/False value was expected (e.g., `if some_array:`). This commonly happens when code expecting a 1D array receives a 2D array (even a 1xN array) and attempts element-wise comparison within a conditional statement intended for scalars. The most probable cause is that the input grids, while visually 1D, were passed to the function as 2D NumPy arrays (shape `(1, N)`), and the helper functions (`find_pixel`, `find_block`) iterated over rows instead of elements, leading to comparisons like `if row_array == color:`.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the dimensionality assumption using `tool_code`.
2.  Adjust the code to explicitly handle 1xN 2D arrays by selecting the first row for processing.
3.  Refine the understanding of object properties and transformations based on this.

**Metrics Gathering:**

8.  Place the green pixel (3) into the output row at the `anchor_index`.
9.  Construct the final output grid as a 2D array containing only the generated output row.
