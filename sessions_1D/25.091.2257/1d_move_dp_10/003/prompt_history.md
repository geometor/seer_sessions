*   **Perception:**
    The input and output are 1D arrays (representing rows of a grid) containing integer values representing colors. Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a single color (magenta, yellow, or red in the examples, but generally non-white and non-blue) and exactly one 'blue' pixel (value 1). The rest of the pixels are 'white' (value 0). The 'blue' pixel always appears to the right of the colored block. The transformation involves shifting the colored block to the right so that it becomes adjacent to the 'blue' pixel, effectively closing the gap of 'white' pixels that existed between them in the input. The 'blue' pixel itself does not move.

    elements:

        properties:
          - color: The color value (e.g., 6, 4, 2).
          - start_index: The starting position (0-based index) of the block in the input array.
          - end_index: The ending position (0-based index) of the block in the input array.

          - gap_length: The count of white pixels between the end of the 'colored_block' and the 'blue_marker' (blue_marker.index - colored_block.end_index - 1).

    relationships:
      - The 'colored_block' always appears to the left of the 'blue_marker' in the input.
      - There is always at least one 'white_space' pixel between the 'colored_block' and the 'blue_marker' in the input.

    actions:
      - Identify the 'colored_block' (its color, start_index, end_index).
      - Identify the 'blue_marker' (its index).
      - Calculate the 'gap_length' of the 'white_space' between them.
      - Determine the shift amount: shift_amount = gap_length.
      - Create the output array (same size as input, initially all white).
      - Place the 'colored_block' into the output array, shifted right by 'shift_amount'. Its new start index will be (colored_block.start_index + shift_amount).
      - Place the 'blue_marker' into the output array at its original index.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.

    3.  Scan the input array to find the index of the blue (1) pixel (the "blue marker").
    4.  Calculate the number of white (0) pixels strictly between the end index of the colored block and the index of the blue marker. This is the shift distance.
    5.  Determine the new start index for the colored block in the output array by adding the shift distance to its original start index.
    6.  Fill the corresponding segment in the output array with the color of the colored block, starting at the new start index and having the same length as the original block.
    7.  Place the blue marker (1) in the output array at its original index.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a colored block rightwards to abut a blue marker. The Python code implemented this logic. However, the `ValueError` encountered during testing indicates a discrepancy between the expected input format (1D `List[int]`) and the actual format provided by the testing environment (likely a 2D structure like a NumPy array or a list of lists, even if it only contains one row).

The strategy is to adapt the code to handle a 2D input, extract the relevant row, apply the existing shifting logic to that row, and then return the result in the original 2D format. The core logic of finding the block, finding the marker, calculating the shift, and reconstructing the row remains valid.

relationships:

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row.
2.  Extract the row of pixels from the input grid.
3.  Initialize a new row for the output, having the same length as the input row and filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
4.  Scan the input row to find the contiguous block of non-white (0), non-blue (1) pixels (the "colored block"). Record its color, starting column index, and ending column index.
5.  Scan the input row to find the column index of the blue (1) pixel (the "blue marker").
6.  Calculate the number of white (0) pixels strictly between the ending column index of the colored block and the column index of the blue marker. This distance represents the required rightward shift.
7.  Calculate the new starting column index for the colored block in the output row by adding the calculated shift distance to its original starting column index.
8.  Fill the corresponding segment in the output row with the color of the colored block, starting at the new starting column index and extending for the original length of the block.
9.  Place the blue marker (1) in the output row at its original column index.
10. Construct the final output grid by placing the modified row as the single row within a grid of the original input dimensions.
