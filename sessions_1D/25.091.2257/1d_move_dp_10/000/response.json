Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a single color (magenta, yellow, or red in the examples, but generally non-white and non-blue) and exactly one 'blue' pixel (value 1). The rest of the pixels are 'white' (value 0). The 'blue' pixel always appears to the right of the colored block. The transformation involves shifting the colored block to the right so that it becomes adjacent to the 'blue' pixel, effectively closing the gap of 'white' pixels that existed between them in the input. The 'blue' pixel itself does not move.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
