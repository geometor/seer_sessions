## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a colored block rightwards to abut a blue marker. The Python code implemented this logic. However, the `ValueError` encountered during testing indicates a discrepancy between the expected input format (1D `List[int]`) and the actual format provided by the testing environment (likely a 2D structure like a NumPy array or a list of lists, even if it only contains one row).

The strategy is to adapt the code to handle a 2D input, extract the relevant row, apply the existing shifting logic to that row, and then return the result in the original 2D format. The core logic of finding the block, finding the marker, calculating the shift, and reconstructing the row remains valid.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored block rightwards within its row to abut a stationary blue marker in the same row.

input_format: A 2D grid containing exactly one row.
output_format: A 2D grid with the same dimensions as the input.

elements:
  - object: grid_row
    description: The single row of pixels present in the input grid. Contains all relevant elements for the transformation.
    properties:
        - index: 0 (always the first row).
        - length: The width of the grid.
  - object: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels within the grid_row having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not blue (1). There is exactly one such block per grid_row.
    properties:
        - color: The color value (e.g., 6, 4, 2).
        - start_col: The starting column index of the block within the grid_row.
        - end_col: The ending column index of the block within the grid_row.
        - length: The number of pixels in the block (end_col - start_col + 1).
  - object: blue_marker
    description: A single pixel within the grid_row with the color blue (1). There is exactly one such pixel per grid_row.
    properties:
        - col_index: The column index of the blue pixel within the grid_row.
  - object: white_space
    description: Pixels with the color white (0) within the grid_row.
    properties:
        - location: Specifically refers to the white pixels located between the 'colored_block' and the 'blue_marker'.
        - gap_length: The count of white pixels between the end_col of the 'colored_block' and the 'blue_marker' (blue_marker.col_index - colored_block.end_col - 1).

relationships:
  - The 'colored_block' always appears to the left of the 'blue_marker' in the grid_row.
  - There is always at least one 'white_space' pixel (gap_length >= 1) between the 'colored_block' and the 'blue_marker' in the input grid_row.

actions:
  - Identify the 'colored_block' within the first row of the input grid (its color, start_col, end_col).
  - Identify the 'blue_marker' within the first row (its col_index).
  - Calculate the 'gap_length' of the 'white_space' between them.
  - Determine the shift amount: shift_amount = gap_length.
  - Create the output grid (same dimensions as input, initially all white in the first row).
  - Place the 'colored_block' into the first row of the output grid, shifted right by 'shift_amount'. Its new start column index will be (colored_block.start_col + shift_amount).
  - Place the 'blue_marker' into the first row of the output grid at its original col_index.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row.
2.  Extract the row of pixels from the input grid.
3.  Initialize a new row for the output, having the same length as the input row and filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
4.  Scan the input row to find the contiguous block of non-white (0), non-blue (1) pixels (the "colored block"). Record its color, starting column index, and ending column index.
5.  Scan the input row to find the column index of the blue (1) pixel (the "blue marker").
6.  Calculate the number of white (0) pixels strictly between the ending column index of the colored block and the column index of the blue marker. This distance represents the required rightward shift.
7.  Calculate the new starting column index for the colored block in the output row by adding the calculated shift distance to its original starting column index.
8.  Fill the corresponding segment in the output row with the color of the colored block, starting at the new starting column index and extending for the original length of the block.
9.  Place the blue marker (1) in the output row at its original column index.
10. Construct the final output grid by placing the modified row as the single row within a grid of the original input dimensions.
