task_description: Shift a colored block rightwards within its row to abut a stationary blue marker in the same row.

input_format: A 2D grid containing exactly one row.
output_format: A 2D grid with the same dimensions as the input.

elements:
  - object: grid_row
    description: The single row of pixels present in the input grid. Contains all relevant elements for the transformation.
    properties:
        - index: 0 (always the first row).
        - length: The width of the grid.
  - object: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels within the grid_row having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not blue (1). There is exactly one such block per grid_row.
    properties:
        - color: The color value (e.g., 6, 4, 2).
        - start_col: The starting column index of the block within the grid_row.
        - end_col: The ending column index of the block within the grid_row.
        - length: The number of pixels in the block (end_col - start_col + 1).
  - object: blue_marker
    description: A single pixel within the grid_row with the color blue (1). There is exactly one such pixel per grid_row.
    properties:
        - col_index: The column index of the blue pixel within the grid_row.
  - object: white_space
    description: Pixels with the color white (0) within the grid_row.
    properties:
        - location: Specifically refers to the white pixels located between the 'colored_block' and the 'blue_marker'.
        - gap_length: The count of white pixels between the end_col of the 'colored_block' and the 'blue_marker' (blue_marker.col_index - colored_block.end_col - 1).

relationships:
  - The 'colored_block' always appears to the left of the 'blue_marker' in the grid_row.
  - There is always at least one 'white_space' pixel (gap_length >= 1) between the 'colored_block' and the 'blue_marker' in the input grid_row.

actions:
  - Identify the 'colored_block' within the first row of the input grid (its color, start_col, end_col).
  - Identify the 'blue_marker' within the first row (its col_index).
  - Calculate the 'gap_length' of the 'white_space' between them.
  - Determine the shift amount: shift_amount = gap_length.
  - Create the output grid (same dimensions as input, initially all white in the first row).
  - Place the 'colored_block' into the first row of the output grid, shifted right by 'shift_amount'. Its new start column index will be (colored_block.start_col + shift_amount).
  - Place the 'blue_marker' into the first row of the output grid at its original col_index.
