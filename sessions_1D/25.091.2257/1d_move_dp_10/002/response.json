            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a colored block rightwards to abut a blue marker. The Python code implemented this logic. However, the `ValueError` encountered during testing indicates a discrepancy between the expected input format (1D `List[int]`) and the actual format provided by the testing environment (likely a 2D structure like a NumPy array or a list of lists, even if it only contains one row).\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the code to handle a 2D input, extract the relevant row, apply the existing shifting logic to that row, and then return the result in the original 2D format. The core logic of finding the block, finding the marker, calculating the shift, and reconstructing the row remains valid.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the analysis and code execution:\n"
