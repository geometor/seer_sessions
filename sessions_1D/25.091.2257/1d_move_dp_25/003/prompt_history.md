Okay, let's analyze the examples provided.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are 1D grids (or 1xN grids).
*   Each grid contains sequences of pixels of various colors.
*   A key element appears to be the orange pixel (7), which is present in all examples.
*   White pixels (0) also play a significant role, particularly those located near the orange pixel and at the beginning of the grid.
*   Other colored pixels (red 2, azure 8, magenta 6) form contiguous blocks.
*   The transformation involves rearranging the pixels within the grid. Specifically, it looks like a segment of white pixels located just before the orange pixel is moved to the beginning of the grid.

**YAML Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to find the index (position) of the single orange pixel (7).
2.  Starting from the position immediately to the left of the orange pixel, identify the contiguous sequence of white pixels (0) moving leftwards. Let this sequence be the "target segment".
3.  If no white pixels are found immediately to the left of the orange pixel, the target segment is empty.
4.  Create a new grid by:
    a. Taking the identified target segment (which might be empty).
    b. Appending all pixels from the original grid that were *before* the target segment.
    c. Appending all pixels from the original grid that were *after* the target segment (including the orange pixel and everything after it).
5.  The resulting grid is the output.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'

## Example 2:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'

## Example 3:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous attempt failed because the code assumed the input grid was a standard Python list and used list methods (`.index()`) which are not available for NumPy arrays. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'` clearly indicates the input data type is `numpy.ndarray`.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input data type using `tool_code`.
2.  Modify the code to use NumPy functions and indexing suitable for `ndarray` objects instead of list-specific methods.
3.  Verify that the core transformation logic (identifying the orange pixel, finding the preceding white block, and moving it to the start) remains correct based on the examples.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's confirm the input type and check the location of the orange pixel in the first training example.


*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Recreate the input from train_1
input_1_str = "2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 7 0"
input_1_list = [int(x) for x in input_1_str.split()]
# Assuming the actual input is a 1xN numpy array
input_1_np = np.array([input_1_list]) 

print(f"Input 1 Type: {type(input_1_np)}")
print(f"Input 1 Shape: {input_1_np.shape}")

# Find the orange pixel (7)
orange_indices = np.where(input_1_np == 7)
print(f"Orange pixel indices (row, col): {orange_indices}")

# Access the 1D array representation if shape is (1, N)
if input_1_np.shape[0] == 1:
    grid_1d = input_1_np[0]
    print(f"Input 1 (1D): {grid_1d}")
    # Find orange pixel index in 1D array
    try:
        orange_idx_1d = np.where(grid_1d == 7)[0][0]
        print(f"Orange pixel index in 1D array: {orange_idx_1d}")
    except IndexError:
        print("Orange pixel not found in 1D array.")
else:
    # Handle other potential shapes if necessary
    print("Input shape is not (1, N)")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Input 1 Type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
Input 1 Shape: (1, 23)
Orange pixel indices (row, col): (array([0]), array([21]))
Input 1 (1D): [2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 7 0]
Orange pixel index in 1D array: 21

```
**Observations from Metrics:**

*   The input is indeed a `numpy.ndarray`.
*   The shape is `(1, N)`, confirming it's effectively a 1D array represented as a 2D NumPy array with one row.
*   The orange pixel (7) was successfully located using `np.where`. Its index in the flattened 1D representation is 21.

This confirms the need to adapt the code for NumPy arrays and suggests the core logic might still be applicable if we operate on the flattened or single-row representation.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Given a 1xN input grid (represented as a `numpy.ndarray`).
2.  Access the single row of the grid to operate on it as a 1D sequence of pixels.
3.  Find the column index (position) of the single orange pixel (7) within this 1D sequence.
4.  Starting from the position immediately to the left of the orange pixel's index, identify the contiguous sequence of white pixels (0) moving leftwards. Determine the start and end indices of this "target segment". If no white pixels are found immediately to the left, the target segment is empty (start index equals end index).
5.  Extract three parts from the 1D sequence:
    a.  The "prefix": pixels from the beginning up to (but not including) the start index of the target segment.
    b.  The "target segment": the contiguous block of white pixels identified in step 4.
    c.  The "suffix": pixels from the orange pixel's index to the end of the sequence.
6.  Construct a new 1D sequence by concatenating these parts in the order: target segment, prefix, suffix.
7.  Reshape the new 1D sequence back into a 1xN `numpy.ndarray`. This is the output grid.
