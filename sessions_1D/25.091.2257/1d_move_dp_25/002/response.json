The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'` clearly indicates the input data type is `numpy.ndarray`.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input data type using `tool_code`.\n2.  Modify the code to use NumPy functions and indexing suitable for `ndarray` objects instead of list-specific methods.\n3.  Verify that the core transformation logic (identifying the orange pixel, finding the preceding white block, and moving it to the start) remains correct based on the examples.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's confirm the input type and check the location of the orange pixel in the first training example.\n"
