Okay, let's analyze the examples provided.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are 1D grids (or 1xN grids).
*   Each grid contains sequences of pixels of various colors.
*   A key element appears to be the orange pixel (7), which is present in all examples.
*   White pixels (0) also play a significant role, particularly those located near the orange pixel and at the beginning of the grid.
*   Other colored pixels (red 2, azure 8, magenta 6) form contiguous blocks.
*   The transformation involves rearranging the pixels within the grid. Specifically, it looks like a segment of white pixels located just before the orange pixel is moved to the beginning of the grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move the contiguous block of white pixels preceding the single orange pixel to the beginning of the grid.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 1D sequence of pixels.
  - type: pixel
    value: 7 (orange)
    role: marker
    description: A unique pixel used as a reference point. Always occurs exactly once.
  - type: pixel
    value: 0 (white)
    role: movable_segment / target_segment / prefix
    description: Pixels forming segments that are potentially moved or define the insertion point.
  - type: pixel
    value: other (non-zero, non-orange)
    role: context / background
    description: Pixels forming the main content blocks that get shifted due to the movement of white pixels.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation targets a contiguous block of white pixels immediately to the left of the orange pixel.
  - type: position
    description: The identified white block is moved from its position before the orange pixel to the absolute start of the grid.

actions:
  - action: find
    target: orange pixel (7)
  - action: find_segment
    target: contiguous block of white pixels (0)
    condition: immediately preceding the orange pixel.
  - action: remove
    target: the identified white segment.
  - action: prepend
    target: the removed white segment to the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to find the index (position) of the single orange pixel (7).
2.  Starting from the position immediately to the left of the orange pixel, identify the contiguous sequence of white pixels (0) moving leftwards. Let this sequence be the "target segment".
3.  If no white pixels are found immediately to the left of the orange pixel, the target segment is empty.
4.  Create a new grid by:
    a. Taking the identified target segment (which might be empty).
    b. Appending all pixels from the original grid that were *before* the target segment.
    c. Appending all pixels from the original grid that were *after* the target segment (including the orange pixel and everything after it).
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
