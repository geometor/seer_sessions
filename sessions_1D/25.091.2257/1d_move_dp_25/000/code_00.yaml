task_description: Move the contiguous block of white pixels preceding the single orange pixel to the beginning of the grid.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 1D sequence of pixels.
  - type: pixel
    value: 7 (orange)
    role: marker
    description: A unique pixel used as a reference point. Always occurs exactly once.
  - type: pixel
    value: 0 (white)
    role: movable_segment / target_segment / prefix
    description: Pixels forming segments that are potentially moved or define the insertion point.
  - type: pixel
    value: other (non-zero, non-orange)
    role: context / background
    description: Pixels forming the main content blocks that get shifted due to the movement of white pixels.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation targets a contiguous block of white pixels immediately to the left of the orange pixel.
  - type: position
    description: The identified white block is moved from its position before the orange pixel to the absolute start of the grid.

actions:
  - action: find
    target: orange pixel (7)
  - action: find_segment
    target: contiguous block of white pixels (0)
    condition: immediately preceding the orange pixel.
  - action: remove
    target: the identified white segment.
  - action: prepend
    target: the removed white segment to the grid.
