The initial white block (if present) remains at the beginning. The \"middle zero block\" is moved to immediately follow the initial white block. The \"color block\" is moved to immediately follow the relocated \"middle zero block\". The final blue-white sequence `[1, 0]` remains at the very end of the grid.\n    *   The transformation is essentially swapping the positions of the \"color block\" and the \"middle zero block\" relative to each other, while keeping the start and end segments fixed.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
