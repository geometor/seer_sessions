            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided code (`code_00.py`) aims to solve the task by identifying four contiguous segments in the input row: `InitialPart`, `ColorBlock`, `MiddleZeroBlock`, and `EndSequence`. It then rearranges them to `InitialPart + MiddleZeroBlock + ColorBlock + EndSequence`.\n\nThe test results indicate that for all training examples, the `Transformed Output` was identical to the `Input`, and thus did not match the `Expected Output`. This suggests that the rearrangement part of the logic (`output_row = initial_part + middle_zero_block + color_block + end_sequence`) either did not run correctly, or the segments were identified in such a way that their concatenation resulted in the original sequence (e.g., one or more key segments were incorrectly identified as empty or covering the wrong portion).\n\nA manual trace of the code's logic against the examples suggests the segment identification and concatenation *should* produce the correct output. The helper function `find_contiguous_block_before` correctly identifies blocks by scanning backwards, and the main function uses the indices returned by the helper to define the segments and then concatenates them in the desired order.\n\nPossible reasons for the discrepancy between the trace and the execution results include:\n1.  A subtle bug missed in the manual trace, perhaps related to edge cases like empty blocks or blocks at the start/end of the relevant section.\n2.  An issue with how the code was executed in the test harness (e.g., incorrect version, environment problem).\n3.  A flaw in the final length validation check causing it to revert to the input unnecessarily.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Verify the segment identification logic using `tool_code` based on the manual trace.\n2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language program to be extremely clear about the definitions of the segments and the rearrangement rule.\n3.  Assume the core logic derived (identifying the four segments and swapping the middle two) is correct and that the implementation in `code_00.py`, as written, should work. The focus will be on ensuring the description of this logic is precise.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the segment identification for each example according to the logic in `code_00.py`.\n\n"
