GridType: 1D Array (List of Integers)
InputStructure:
  Segments:
    - Name: InitialPart
      Definition: Sequence of elements from the beginning of the grid up to the start of the ColorBlock. Can be empty. Primarily contains white (0) in examples, but definition depends only on position relative to ColorBlock.
      Position: Start of the grid.
    - Name: ColorBlock
      Definition: A contiguous sequence of a single color C, where C is not white (0) and not blue (1). Must immediately precede the MiddleZeroBlock. Can be empty if the element preceding MiddleZeroBlock is white, blue, or does not exist.
      Position: Between InitialPart and MiddleZeroBlock.
    - Name: MiddleZeroBlock
      Definition: A contiguous sequence of white pixels (0). Must immediately precede the EndSequence. Can be empty.
      Position: Between ColorBlock and EndSequence.
    - Name: EndSequence
      Definition: A fixed sequence of [blue (1), white (0)].
      Position: End of the grid.
  Order: InitialPart -> ColorBlock -> MiddleZeroBlock -> EndSequence
OutputStructure:
  Segments: Same as InputStructure segments.
  Order: InitialPart -> MiddleZeroBlock -> ColorBlock -> EndSequence
Transformation:
  Action: Reorder segments.
  Details: The positions of the ColorBlock and MiddleZeroBlock are swapped relative to each other. The InitialPart remains at the beginning, and the EndSequence remains at the end.
Constraints:
  - Input and Output grids have the same length.
  - The EndSequence [1, 0] must be present at the end of the input for the transformation to apply.
  - The ColorBlock consists of a single color, which cannot be 0 or 1.
