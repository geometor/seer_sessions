"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by rearranging identified segments based on their content and position.

The input grid is expected to be a single row with the structure:
[InitialPart][ColorBlock][MiddleZeroBlock][EndSequence]

1.  **EndSequence**: Always [1, 0] (Blue, White) at the very end.
2.  **MiddleZeroBlock**: A contiguous block of 0s (White) immediately preceding the EndSequence. Can be empty.
3.  **ColorBlock**: A contiguous block of a single color C (where C is not 0 or 1) immediately preceding the MiddleZeroBlock. Can be empty if the preceding element is 0, 1, or the start of the grid.
4.  **InitialPart**: All elements before the ColorBlock (or before MiddleZeroBlock if ColorBlock is absent). Can be empty.

The transformation swaps the positions of the ColorBlock and the MiddleZeroBlock, resulting in the output structure:
[InitialPart][MiddleZeroBlock][ColorBlock][EndSequence]
