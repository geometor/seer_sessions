*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of the same length.
    *   Each input grid contains a distinct structure: an optional initial block of white pixels (0), followed by a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-blue color (the "color block"), followed by a contiguous block of white pixels (the "middle zero block"), and finally ending with a fixed sequence of a blue pixel (1) followed by a white pixel (0).
    *   The output grid rearranges these blocks. The initial white block (if present) remains at the beginning. The "middle zero block" is moved to immediately follow the initial white block. The "color block" is moved to immediately follow the relocated "middle zero block". The final blue-white sequence `[1, 0]` remains at the very end of the grid.
    *   The transformation is essentially swapping the positions of the "color block" and the "middle zero block" relative to each other, while keeping the start and end segments fixed.

*   **YAML Facts:**

        Position: Immediately precedes the MiddleZeroBlock in the input.
        Transformation: Moved later in the sequence in the output (after the MiddleZeroBlock).

        Pattern: Any sequence of elements preceding the ColorBlock (can be empty or contain only 0s).
        Position: At the beginning of the grid, before the ColorBlock.
        Transformation: Remains fixed at the beginning.
    Relationships:
      - Input Order: InitialPart -> ColorBlock -> MiddleZeroBlock -> EndSequence
      - Output Order: InitialPart -> MiddleZeroBlock -> ColorBlock -> EndSequence
    Action:
      - Reorder the identified blocks according to the Output Order.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the fixed sequence `[1, 0]` (blue, white) at the end of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (0) located immediately before the `[1, 0]` sequence. Call this the `MiddleZeroBlock`.
    3.  Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white, non-blue color located immediately before the `MiddleZeroBlock`. Call this the `ColorBlock`.
    4.  Identify all elements preceding the `ColorBlock`. Call this the `InitialPart`.
    5.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the `InitialPart`, followed by the `MiddleZeroBlock`, followed by the `ColorBlock`, and finally followed by the fixed `[1, 0]` sequence.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Input format not recognized. Expected List[List[int]] or List[int].

## Example 2:
Error: Input format not recognized. Expected List[List[int]] or List[int].

## Example 3:
Error: Input format not recognized. Expected List[List[int]] or List[int].
## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed due to an input format error. The `transform` function was designed with checks that incorrectly rejected the input provided by the testing harness. The core logic of identifying the four segments (`InitialPart`, `ColorBlock`, `MiddleZeroBlock`, `EndSequence`) and rearranging them (`InitialPart` -> `MiddleZeroBlock` -> `ColorBlock` -> `EndSequence`) appears sound based on manual analysis of the examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the input handling within the `transform` function to strictly expect the standard ARC format (`List[List[int]]`).
2.  Verify the segment identification and rearrangement logic against all examples.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for clarity and accuracy, ensuring they reflect the standard input format and the identified transformation.

## Metrics

Since the code failed before processing, metrics are derived from manual analysis of the provided examples:

**Example 1:**
*   Input Grid: `[[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]]` (1x21)
*   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0]]` (1x21)
*   `InitialPart`: `[]` (length 0)
*   `ColorBlock`: `[7]*17` (length 17, color orange)
*   `MiddleZeroBlock`: `[0, 0]` (length 2)
*   `EndSequence`: `[1, 0]` (length 2)

**Example 2:**
*   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0]]` (1x21)
*   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0]]` (1x21)
*   `InitialPart`: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (length 4)
*   `ColorBlock`: `[3]*13` (length 13, color green)
*   `MiddleZeroBlock`: `[0, 0]` (length 2)
*   `EndSequence`: `[1, 0]` (length 2)

**Example 3:**
*   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]` (1x21)
*   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]]` (1x21)
*   `InitialPart`: `[0]*9` (length 9)
*   `ColorBlock`: `[4]*5` (length 5, color yellow)
*   `MiddleZeroBlock`: `[0]*5` (length 5)
*   `EndSequence`: `[1, 0]` (length 2)

All examples involve 1x21 grids. The transformation preserves the grid dimensions and rearranges internal segments.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
GridFormat:
  Input: List[List[int]] representing a 1xN grid.
  Output: List[List[int]] representing a 1xN grid.
GridDimensions:
  Input: 1xN
  Output: 1xN (N is preserved)
Segments:
  - Name: EndSequence
    Description: A fixed sequence of two pixels.
    Pattern: Always [1, 0] (Blue, White).
    Position: Always the last two elements of the input row.
    Transformation: Remains fixed as the last two elements of the output row.
  - Name: MiddleZeroBlock
    Description: A contiguous block of white pixels.
    Pattern: One or more 0s (White).
    Position: Immediately precedes the EndSequence in the input row.
    Transformation: Moved earlier in the sequence in the output row.
  - Name: ColorBlock
    Description: A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-blue color.
    Pattern: One or more pixels of color C, where C is not 0 (White) and C is not 1 (Blue).
    Position: Immediately precedes the MiddleZeroBlock in the input row.
    Transformation: Moved later in the sequence in the output row.
  - Name: InitialPart
    Description: All elements preceding the ColorBlock. Can be empty or contain only white pixels (0s).
    Pattern: Any sequence of elements (observed only as empty or 0s in examples).
    Position: At the beginning of the input row, before the ColorBlock.
    Transformation: Remains fixed at the beginning of the output row.
Relationships:
  - Input Order: InitialPart | ColorBlock | MiddleZeroBlock | EndSequence
  - Output Order: InitialPart | MiddleZeroBlock | ColorBlock | EndSequence
Action:
  - Decompose the input row into the four segments based on their patterns and relative positions.
  - Reconstruct the output row by concatenating the segments in the specified Output Order.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a list containing a single list of integers (representing a 1xN grid). Let this inner list be the `input_row`.
2.  Identify the fixed `EndSequence`, which consists of the last two elements of the `input_row` and must be `[1, 0]` (blue, white).
3.  Working backwards from the element before the `EndSequence`, identify the contiguous block of white pixels (0). This is the `MiddleZeroBlock`. Determine its start and end indices.
4.  Working backwards from the element before the `MiddleZeroBlock`, identify the contiguous block of identical, non-white (0) and non-blue (1) pixels. This is the `ColorBlock`. Determine its start and end indices. The color of this block is unique within the non-initial part of the sequence.
5.  Identify the sequence of elements from the beginning of the `input_row` up to (but not including) the start of the `ColorBlock`. This is the `InitialPart`.
6.  Construct the `output_row` by concatenating the segments in the following order: `InitialPart`, `MiddleZeroBlock`, `ColorBlock`, `EndSequence`.
7.  Return the `output_row` wrapped in a list, maintaining the standard `List[List[int]]` format.
