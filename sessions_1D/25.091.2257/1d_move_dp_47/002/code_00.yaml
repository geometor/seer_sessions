GridFormat:
  Input: List[List[int]] representing a 1xN grid.
  Output: List[List[int]] representing a 1xN grid.
GridDimensions:
  Input: 1xN
  Output: 1xN (N is preserved)
Segments:
  - Name: EndSequence
    Description: A fixed sequence of two pixels.
    Pattern: Always [1, 0] (Blue, White).
    Position: Always the last two elements of the input row.
    Transformation: Remains fixed as the last two elements of the output row.
  - Name: MiddleZeroBlock
    Description: A contiguous block of white pixels.
    Pattern: One or more 0s (White).
    Position: Immediately precedes the EndSequence in the input row.
    Transformation: Moved earlier in the sequence in the output row.
  - Name: ColorBlock
    Description: A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-blue color.
    Pattern: One or more pixels of color C, where C is not 0 (White) and C is not 1 (Blue).
    Position: Immediately precedes the MiddleZeroBlock in the input row.
    Transformation: Moved later in the sequence in the output row.
  - Name: InitialPart
    Description: All elements preceding the ColorBlock. Can be empty or contain only white pixels (0s).
    Pattern: Any sequence of elements (observed only as empty or 0s in examples).
    Position: At the beginning of the input row, before the ColorBlock.
    Transformation: Remains fixed at the beginning of the output row.
Relationships:
  - Input Order: InitialPart | ColorBlock | MiddleZeroBlock | EndSequence
  - Output Order: InitialPart | MiddleZeroBlock | ColorBlock | EndSequence
Action:
  - Decompose the input row into the four segments based on their patterns and relative positions.
  - Reconstruct the output row by concatenating the segments in the specified Output Order.
