*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of the same length.
    *   Each input grid contains a distinct structure: an optional initial block of white pixels (0), followed by a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-blue color (the "color block"), followed by a contiguous block of white pixels (the "middle zero block"), and finally ending with a fixed sequence of a blue pixel (1) followed by a white pixel (0).
    *   The output grid rearranges these blocks. The initial white block (if present) remains at the beginning. The "middle zero block" is moved to immediately follow the initial white block. The "color block" is moved to immediately follow the relocated "middle zero block". The final blue-white sequence `[1, 0]` remains at the very end of the grid.
    *   The transformation is essentially swapping the positions of the "color block" and the "middle zero block" relative to each other, while keeping the start and end segments fixed.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    GridDimensions:
      Input: 1xN
      Output: 1xN
    Objects:
      - Name: EndSequence
        Pattern: [1, 0] (Blue, White)
        Position: Always the last two elements of the grid.
        Transformation: Remains fixed at the end.
      - Name: MiddleZeroBlock
        Pattern: Contiguous sequence of 0 (White)
        Position: Immediately precedes the EndSequence in the input.
        Transformation: Moved earlier in the sequence in the output.
      - Name: ColorBlock
        Pattern: Contiguous sequence of a single color C (where C is not 0 or 1).
        Position: Immediately precedes the MiddleZeroBlock in the input.
        Transformation: Moved later in the sequence in the output (after the MiddleZeroBlock).
      - Name: InitialPart
        Pattern: Any sequence of elements preceding the ColorBlock (can be empty or contain only 0s).
        Position: At the beginning of the grid, before the ColorBlock.
        Transformation: Remains fixed at the beginning.
    Relationships:
      - Input Order: InitialPart -> ColorBlock -> MiddleZeroBlock -> EndSequence
      - Output Order: InitialPart -> MiddleZeroBlock -> ColorBlock -> EndSequence
    Action:
      - Reorder the identified blocks according to the Output Order.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the fixed sequence `[1, 0]` (blue, white) at the end of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (0) located immediately before the `[1, 0]` sequence. Call this the `MiddleZeroBlock`.
    3.  Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white, non-blue color located immediately before the `MiddleZeroBlock`. Call this the `ColorBlock`.
    4.  Identify all elements preceding the `ColorBlock`. Call this the `InitialPart`.
    5.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the `InitialPart`, followed by the `MiddleZeroBlock`, followed by the `ColorBlock`, and finally followed by the fixed `[1, 0]` sequence.

"""
Identifies segments within a 1D input grid and rearranges them.

The input grid is expected to have the structure:
[InitialPart][ColorBlock][MiddleZeroBlock][EndSequence]
where:
- EndSequence is always [1, 0] (blue, white) at the very end.
- MiddleZeroBlock is a contiguous block of 0s (white) immediately preceding the EndSequence.
- ColorBlock is a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-blue color immediately preceding the MiddleZeroBlock.
- InitialPart is everything before the ColorBlock (can be empty or contain only 0s).

The transformation swaps the positions of the ColorBlock and the MiddleZeroBlock:
Output = [InitialPart][MiddleZeroBlock][ColorBlock][EndSequence]
