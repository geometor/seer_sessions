            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt failed due to an input format error. The `transform` function was designed with checks that incorrectly rejected the input provided by the testing harness. The core logic of identifying the four segments (`InitialPart`, `ColorBlock`, `MiddleZeroBlock`, `EndSequence`) and rearranging them (`InitialPart` -> `MiddleZeroBlock` -> `ColorBlock` -> `EndSequence`) appears sound based on manual analysis of the examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Correct the input handling within the `transform` function to strictly expect the standard ARC format (`List[List[int]]`).\n2.  Verify the segment identification and rearrangement logic against all examples.\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for clarity and accuracy, ensuring they reflect the standard input format and the identified transformation.\n\n## Metrics\n\nSince the code failed before processing, metrics are derived from manual analysis of the provided examples:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid: `[[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]]` (1x21)\n*   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0]]` (1x21)\n*   `InitialPart`: `[]` (length 0)\n*   `ColorBlock`: `[7]*17` (length 17, color orange)\n*   `MiddleZeroBlock`: `[0, 0]` (length 2)\n*   `EndSequence`: `[1, 0]` (length 2)\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0]]` (1x21)\n*   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0]]` (1x21)\n*   `InitialPart`: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (length 4)\n*   `ColorBlock`: `[3]*13` (length 13, color green)\n*   `MiddleZeroBlock`: `[0, 0]` (length 2)\n*   `EndSequence`: `[1, 0]` (length 2)\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]` (1x21)\n*   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]]` (1x21)\n*   `InitialPart`: `[0]*9` (length 9)\n*   `ColorBlock`: `[4]*5` (length 5, color yellow)\n*   `MiddleZeroBlock`: `[0]*5` (length 5)\n*   `EndSequence`: `[1, 0]` (length 2)\n\nAll examples involve 1x21 grids. The transformation preserves the grid dimensions and rearranges internal segments.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify the sequence of elements from the beginning of the `input_row` up to (but not including) the start of the `ColorBlock`. This is the `InitialPart`.\n6.
