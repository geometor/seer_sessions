"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by rearranging identified segments based on their content and position.

The input grid is expected to be a single row with the structure:
[InitialPart][ColorBlock][MiddleZeroBlock][EndSequence]

1.  **EndSequence**: Always [1, 0] (Blue, White) at the very end.
2.  **MiddleZeroBlock**: A contiguous block of 0s (White) immediately preceding the EndSequence.
3.  **ColorBlock**: A contiguous block of a single color C (where C is not 0 or 1) immediately preceding the MiddleZeroBlock.
4.  **InitialPart**: All elements before the ColorBlock (can be empty or only contain 0s).

The transformation swaps the positions of the ColorBlock and the MiddleZeroBlock, resulting in the output structure:
[InitialPart][MiddleZeroBlock][ColorBlock][EndSequence]
