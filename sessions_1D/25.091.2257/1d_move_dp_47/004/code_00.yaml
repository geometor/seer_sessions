InputGrid:
  Type: 1D Array (List of numbers)
  Structure: Composed of four contiguous segments in order:
    1. InitialPart
    2. ColorBlock
    3. MiddleZeroBlock
    4. EndSequence
GridProperties:
  Size: 1xN (where N >= 3)
  OutputSize: Same as Input (1xN)
  ColorPalette: Preserved between input and output.
Segments:
  - Name: EndSequence
    Definition: A fixed sequence of [1, 0] (Blue, White).
    Position: Always the last two elements of the input grid.
    Properties:
      Length: 2
    Transformation: Remains fixed at the end of the output grid.
  - Name: MiddleZeroBlock
    Definition: A contiguous sequence of only 0 (White).
    Position: Located immediately before the EndSequence in the input grid.
    Properties:
      Length: Variable (can be zero or more). Must contain only 0s.
    Transformation: Moved to the position immediately after InitialPart in the output grid.
  - Name: ColorBlock
    Definition: A contiguous sequence of a single color C, where C is not 0 (White) and not 1 (Blue).
    Position: Located immediately before the MiddleZeroBlock in the input grid.
    Properties:
      Length: Variable (must be at least 1, based on examples).
      Color: Uniform, non-White, non-Blue.
    Transformation: Moved to the position immediately after MiddleZeroBlock in the output grid.
  - Name: InitialPart
    Definition: The sequence of all elements preceding the ColorBlock.
    Position: At the beginning of the input grid.
    Properties:
      Length: Variable (can be zero or more).
      Content: Can contain any colors, but in examples, only contains 0 (White) or is empty.
    Transformation: Remains fixed at the beginning of the output grid.
TransformationRule:
  Action: Reorder the identified segments.
  InputOrder: [InitialPart, ColorBlock, MiddleZeroBlock, EndSequence]
  OutputOrder: [InitialPart, MiddleZeroBlock, ColorBlock, EndSequence]
ConsistencyChecks:
  - The sum of the lengths of the four identified segments must equal the total length of the input grid.
  - The input grid must end with the EndSequence [1, 0].
  - A ColorBlock (non-0, non-1) must exist before the MiddleZeroBlock for a swap to occur. If no such block exists, the order remains unchanged.
