This block's color and length vary between examples but are preserved within each example's transformation.\n    *   **Marker:** A single yellow pixel (color 4).\n3.  **Spatial Relationship:** In all inputs, the Marker pixel is located somewhere to the right of the Main Block, separated by one or more white background pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves shifting both the Main Block and the Marker pixel horizontally (to the right). The amount of shift seems dependent on the initial distance (gap) between the Main Block and the Marker. The final state always places the right end of the Main Block immediately to the left of the Marker's final position. The Marker itself shifts right by 0 or 1 position.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
