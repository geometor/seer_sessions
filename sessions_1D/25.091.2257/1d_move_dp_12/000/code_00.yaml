Grid:
  dimensionality: 1
Objects:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
    description: Fills the grid where other objects are not present.
  - type: Main Block
    color: variable (not white/yellow)
    shape: contiguous horizontal segment
    properties:
      - color: constant within transformation
      - length: constant within transformation
    location: variable, left of Marker
  - type: Marker
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: single pixel
    location: variable, right of Main Block
Relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Main Block is to the left of Marker in both input and output.
  - type: spatial
    description: A gap of white pixels exists between the right end of the Main Block and the Marker in the input.
    property: gap_size (number of white pixels)
  - type: spatial
    description: In the output, the right end of the Main Block is immediately adjacent (left) to the Marker.
Actions:
  - action: identify
    target: Main Block (color, start_index, end_index, length)
  - action: identify
    target: Marker (index)
  - action: calculate
    value: gap_size (Marker.index - MainBlock.end_index - 1)
  - action: determine_shift
    target: Marker
    based_on: gap_size
    rule: shift = 1 if gap_size >= 3 else 0
  - action: determine_shift
    target: Main Block
    based_on: gap_size, Marker.shift
    rule: shift = gap_size + Marker.shift
  - action: reconstruct
    target: output grid
    steps:
      - Initialize grid with white (0).
      - Place Marker at (input_index + marker_shift).
      - Place Main Block (original color, original length) starting at (input_start_index + block_shift).
