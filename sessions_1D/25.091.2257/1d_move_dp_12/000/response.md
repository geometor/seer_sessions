Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are one-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Key Objects:**
    *   **Background:** White pixels (color 0) form the background.
    *   **Main Block:** A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (green '3' in train\_1, gray '5' in train\_2, blue '1' in train\_3). This block's color and length vary between examples but are preserved within each example's transformation.
    *   **Marker:** A single yellow pixel (color 4).
3.  **Spatial Relationship:** In all inputs, the Marker pixel is located somewhere to the right of the Main Block, separated by one or more white background pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves shifting both the Main Block and the Marker pixel horizontally (to the right). The amount of shift seems dependent on the initial distance (gap) between the Main Block and the Marker. The final state always places the right end of the Main Block immediately to the left of the Marker's final position. The Marker itself shifts right by 0 or 1 position.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  dimensionality: 1
Objects:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
    description: Fills the grid where other objects are not present.
  - type: Main Block
    color: variable (not white/yellow)
    shape: contiguous horizontal segment
    properties:
      - color: constant within transformation
      - length: constant within transformation
    location: variable, left of Marker
  - type: Marker
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: single pixel
    location: variable, right of Main Block
Relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Main Block is to the left of Marker in both input and output.
  - type: spatial
    description: A gap of white pixels exists between the right end of the Main Block and the Marker in the input.
    property: gap_size (number of white pixels)
  - type: spatial
    description: In the output, the right end of the Main Block is immediately adjacent (left) to the Marker.
Actions:
  - action: identify
    target: Main Block (color, start_index, end_index, length)
  - action: identify
    target: Marker (index)
  - action: calculate
    value: gap_size (Marker.index - MainBlock.end_index - 1)
  - action: determine_shift
    target: Marker
    based_on: gap_size
    rule: shift = 1 if gap_size >= 3 else 0
  - action: determine_shift
    target: Main Block
    based_on: gap_size, Marker.shift
    rule: shift = gap_size + Marker.shift
  - action: reconstruct
    target: output grid
    steps:
      - Initialize grid with white (0).
      - Place Marker at (input_index + marker_shift).
      - Place Main Block (original color, original length) starting at (input_start_index + block_shift).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of a uniform color that is not white (0) or yellow (4). Record its color (C), length (L), start index (S_in), and end index (E_in).
2.  Identify the single yellow (4) pixel. Record its index (Y_in).
3.  Calculate the number of white pixels between the end of the block and the yellow pixel: `Gap = Y_in - E_in - 1`.
4.  Determine the shift distance for the yellow pixel (`YellowShift`): If `Gap` is 3 or more, `YellowShift` is 1; otherwise, `YellowShift` is 0.
5.  Calculate the final position of the yellow pixel: `Y_out = Y_in + YellowShift`.
6.  Determine the shift distance for the main block (`BlockShift`): `BlockShift = Gap + YellowShift`.
7.  Calculate the final starting position of the main block: `S_out = S_in + BlockShift`.
8.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
9.  Place the yellow pixel (4) at index `Y_out` in the output grid.
10. Place the main block, using its original color (C) and length (L), starting at index `S_out` in the output grid.
