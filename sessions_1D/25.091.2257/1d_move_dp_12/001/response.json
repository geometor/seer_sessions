Identifies a contiguous block of a single color (not white '0' or yellow '4'). Records its color, start/end indices, and length.\n2.  Identifies the single yellow '4' marker pixel and records its index.\n3.  Calculates the gap (number of white '0' pixels) between the right end of the block and the yellow marker.\n4.  The yellow marker remains in its original position in the output grid.\n5.  The identified block is shifted horizontally to the right by a distance equal to the calculated gap. Its color and length remain unchanged. This places the right end of the block immediately to the left of the marker.\n6.  Constructs the output grid of the same size as the input, filled with white '0', then places the shifted block and the stationary marker.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid_1d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main block (contiguous, uniform color != 0 and != 4)\n    and the marker (color 4) in a 1D grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_1d: A list or 1D numpy array representing the grid row.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple: (block_color, block_start, block_end, block_length, marker_index)\n        Returns -1 or 0 for values if objects are not found as expected.\n    \"\"\"\n    marker_index = -1\n    block_start = -1\n    block_end = -1\n    block_color = -1\n    block_length = 0\n\n    # Find marker (color 4)\n    # Iterate through the grid to find the first occurrence of the marker color.\n    for i, color in enumerate(grid_1d):\n        if color == 4:\n            marker_index = i\n            break # Assume only one marker based on examples\n\n    # Find block (contiguous non-zero, non-4 color)\n    in_block = False\n    current_block_start = -1\n    found_block = False\n    # Iterate through the grid to find the contiguous block.\n    for i, color in enumerate(grid_1d):\n        is_block_candidate_color = (color != 0 and color != 4)\n\n        if is_block_candidate_color and not in_block:\n            # Start of a potential block\n            in_block = True\n            current_block_start = i\n            block_color = color\n            block_length = 1\n        elif is_block_candidate_color and in_block:\n            # Potentially continuing the block\n            if color == block_color:\n                # It's the same block, increment length\n                block_length += 1\n            else:\n                # Color changed - this means the previous block ended at i-1\n                block_start = current_block_start\n                block_end = i - 1\n                found_block = True\n                break # Assume only one primary block based on examples\n        elif not is_block_candidate_color and in_block:\n            # End of the block (hit 0 or 4) at i-1\n            block_start = current_block_start\n            block_end = i - 1\n            found_block = True\n            break # Assume only one primary block\n\n    # Handle case where block runs to the very end of the grid\n    if in_block and not found_block:\n        block_start = current_block_start\n        block_end = len(grid_1d) - 1\n        found_block = True\n\n    # If"
