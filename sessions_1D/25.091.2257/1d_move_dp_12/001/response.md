"""
Transforms a 1D grid by shifting a contiguous block of color adjacent to a stationary yellow marker.

1.  Identifies a contiguous block of a single color (not white '0' or yellow '4'). Records its color, start/end indices, and length.
2.  Identifies the single yellow '4' marker pixel and records its index.
3.  Calculates the gap (number of white '0' pixels) between the right end of the block and the yellow marker.
4.  The yellow marker remains in its original position in the output grid.
5.  The identified block is shifted horizontally to the right by a distance equal to the calculated gap. Its color and length remain unchanged. This places the right end of the block immediately to the left of the marker.
6.  Constructs the output grid of the same size as the input, filled with white '0', then places the shifted block and the stationary marker.
