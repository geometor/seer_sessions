Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (single rows) of pixels with the same length (9 in all examples).
2.  **Key Pixel:** The gray pixel (value 5) appears consistently in all examples and seems to play a crucial role.
3.  **Transformation Area:** The changes between input and output occur primarily *before* the gray pixel. The gray pixel and the pixel(s) following it appear to remain fixed relative to the end of the array.
4.  **Rearrangement Logic:** In the section before the gray pixel, the white pixels (value 0) seem to be moved to the beginning of that section. The other colored pixels in that section retain their original relative order but are shifted rightward to accommodate the moved white pixels.
5.  **Example Breakdown (train_1):**
    *   Input: `0 3 3 3 3 0 0 | 5 | 0`
    *   Prefix: `0 3 3 3 3 0 0`
    *   Suffix: `5 0`
    *   Prefix rearrangement:
        *   Whites: `0 0 0`
        *   Non-whites (ordered): `3 3 3 3`
        *   New Prefix: `0 0 0 3 3 3 3`
    *   Output = New Prefix + Suffix: `0 0 0 3 3 3 3 5 0`

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
constraints:
  - Input and output arrays have the same length.
  - Input contains exactly one gray pixel (value 5).
objects:
  - name: input_array

  - name: output_array
    type: 1D_array_of_pixels

  - name: suffix_subarray

    definition: elements in input_array from gray_pixel to the end
  - name: prefix_white_pixels
    type: list_of_pixels
    definition: all pixels with value 0 within the prefix_subarray
  - name: prefix_non_white_pixels
    type: list_of_pixels

    actor: transformation_rule
    inputs:
      - new_prefix_subarray
      - suffix_subarray
    operation: concatenate
    result: output_array
relationships:
  - suffix_subarray in input_array is identical to suffix_subarray in output_array.
  - The relative order of elements in prefix_non_white_pixels is preserved in the new_prefix_subarray.
  - All elements from prefix_white_pixels appear before elements from prefix_non_white_pixels in the new_prefix_subarray.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the position (index) of the gray pixel (value 5) within the input array.
2.  Separate the input array into two parts:
    *   The "prefix": the sequence of pixels *before* the gray pixel.
    *   The "suffix": the sequence starting with the gray pixel and including all subsequent pixels.
3.  Process the "prefix":
    *   Create a list of all white pixels (value 0) found in the prefix.
    *   Create another list of all non-white pixels found in the prefix, ensuring their original relative order is maintained.
    *   Form a "new prefix" by concatenating the list of white pixels followed by the list of non-white pixels.
4.  Construct the final output array by concatenating the "new prefix" and the original "suffix".
