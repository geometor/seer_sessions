## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: swapping a contiguous block of non-white/non-magenta pixels with an immediately adjacent block of white pixels, constrained by a magenta barrier pixel. The natural language program and the initial code accurately reflected this logic.

The reported errors ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly suggest an issue not with the core transformation logic, but with how the input data (likely a NumPy array in the testing environment) is handled, specifically in conditional checks. The check `if not input_grid:` in the original code is the likely culprit when `input_grid` is a NumPy array.

The strategy is to:
1.  Assume the input will always be a valid grid structure (list of lists or NumPy array equivalent) as per ARC task definitions.
2.  Remove or modify the potentially problematic input validation check that causes the NumPy boolean ambiguity error.
3.  Maintain the core transformation logic, which appears correct based on manual re-examination and the metrics gathered below.

## Metrics

The following metrics were gathered by analyzing the components identified by the transformation logic for each training example:


``` python
import numpy as np

WHITE = 0
MAGENTA = 6

# Helper functions (simplified from original code for analysis)
def find_first_occurrence(items, target_value):
    try:
        return items.index(target_value)
    except ValueError:
        return -1

def find_movable_block(items, end_index):
    start_index = -1
    for i in range(end_index):
        pixel = items[i]
        if start_index == -1 and pixel != WHITE and pixel != MAGENTA:
            start_index = i
        elif start_index != -1:
            if pixel == WHITE or pixel == MAGENTA or i == end_index or pixel != items[start_index]:
                 return start_index, i
    if start_index != -1: return start_index, end_index
    return -1, -1

def find_adjacent_white_block(items, start_search_index, end_index):
    end_white_index = start_search_index
    for i in range(start_search_index, end_index):
        if items[i] == WHITE: end_white_index = i + 1
        else: break
    return start_search_index, end_white_index

**Observations from Metrics:**
*   All inputs are 1x9 grids.
*   A single magenta (6) barrier pixel is always present.
*   A single contiguous block of a color other than white (0) or magenta (6) exists before the barrier.
*   A contiguous block of white (0) pixels immediately follows the movable block and precedes the barrier.
*   In these examples, there are no pixels between the end of the white block and the barrier ('rest_before_barrier_len' is 0).
*   The transformation swaps the movable block and the adjacent white block.
*   The prefix (pixels before the movable block) and the suffix (barrier pixel and any pixels after it) remain unchanged in their relative positions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Take the input grid (which is a single row).
2.  Find the index of the magenta pixel (color 6). This is the barrier index.
3.  Consider the portion of the row *before* the barrier index.
4.  Within this portion, identify the following segments sequentially from the left:
    *   **Prefix:** Any leading pixels before the first non-white, non-magenta pixel (can be empty).
    *   **Movable Block:** The first contiguous block of identical pixels that are not white (0) and not magenta (6).
    *   **Adjacent White Space:** The contiguous block of white pixels (0) immediately following the Movable Block (can be empty).
    *   **Intermediate Segment:** Any remaining pixels between the Adjacent White Space and the barrier index (can be empty).
5.  Identify the **Suffix:** The segment starting from the barrier index to the end of the row.
6.  Construct the output row by concatenating the identified segments in this order: Prefix, Adjacent White Space, Movable Block, Intermediate Segment, Suffix.
7.  Return the result as a grid (list containing the single output row).
