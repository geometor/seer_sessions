Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays). Each grid contains sequences of pixels.
Key colors observed are white (0), red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6).
In each input grid, there is a contiguous block of a single non-white color (red or azure), preceded and followed by white pixels. A single magenta pixel (6) appears towards the right end, possibly followed by a white pixel.
The transformation involves rearranging the pixels. Specifically, the contiguous block of non-white (red or azure) pixels shifts to the right, swapping positions with the block of white pixels immediately to its right, up until the magenta pixel. The magenta pixel and any pixels to its right seem to maintain their position relative to the right end of the grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the index of the magenta pixel (color 6), which acts as a barrier.
2.  Consider the subgrid consisting of all pixels *before* the barrier index.
3.  Within this subgrid, locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-magenta pixels (the "movable block").
4.  Locate the contiguous block of white pixels (color 0) that immediately follows the movable block within the subgrid.
5.  Swap the positions of the movable block and the adjacent white block within the subgrid. Leave any other pixels in the subgrid (e.g., leading white pixels) in their original positions relative to the start.
6.  Construct the output grid by concatenating:
    *   The pixels from the original subgrid that were *before* the movable block.
    *   The block of white pixels identified in step 4 (now moved left).
    *   The movable block identified in step 3 (now moved right).
    *   The pixels from the original grid starting from the barrier index to the end.
