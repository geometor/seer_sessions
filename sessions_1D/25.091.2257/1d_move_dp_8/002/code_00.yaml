task_description: Rearrange segments of a 1D grid based on a color block, adjacent white space, and a barrier pixel.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 1xN array of pixels (represented as a list of lists or NumPy array). Always 1 row in examples.
  - type: segment
    name: prefix
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels from the start of the grid up to the beginning of the movable_block. Can be empty.
    properties:
      - content: The sequence of pixel values.
      - length: Number of pixels.
  - type: segment
    name: movable_block
    description: The first contiguous sequence of identical pixels with color != white (0) and color != magenta (6), located before the barrier.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block.
      - content: The sequence of pixel values.
      - length: Number of pixels.
  - type: segment
    name: adjacent_white_space
    description: A contiguous sequence of white pixels (value == 0) immediately following the movable_block and preceding the barrier. Can be empty (though not seen in examples).
    properties:
      - color: white (0).
      - content: The sequence of pixel values.
      - length: Number of pixels.
  - type: segment
    name: intermediate_segment
    description: Any pixels located between the end of adjacent_white_space and the barrier. Empty in observed examples.
    properties:
      - content: The sequence of pixel values.
      - length: Number of pixels.
  - type: segment
    name: suffix
    description: The segment starting from the magenta barrier pixel (value == 6) to the end of the grid.
    properties:
      - content: The sequence of pixel values including the barrier.
      - length: Number of pixels.
  - type: pixel
    name: barrier
    description: A single magenta pixel (value == 6) that marks the end of the region where swapping occurs. Assumed to exist.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The segments appear in the input grid in the order: [prefix][movable_block][adjacent_white_space][intermediate_segment][suffix]. Some segments (prefix, adjacent_white_space, intermediate_segment) can be empty.

actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    description: Parse the input grid row to identify the prefix, movable_block, adjacent_white_space, intermediate_segment, and suffix based on pixel values and contiguity, using the magenta pixel as the key delimiter (barrier).
  - name: swap_segments
    description: Exchange the positions of the movable_block and the adjacent_white_space.
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    description: Assemble the output grid row by concatenating the segments in the new order: [prefix][adjacent_white_space][movable_block][intermediate_segment][suffix].

constraints:
  - The grid is 1D (single row).
  - There is exactly one magenta barrier pixel.
  - There is exactly one movable_block before the barrier.
