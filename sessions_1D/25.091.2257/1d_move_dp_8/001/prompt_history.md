Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays). Each grid contains sequences of pixels.
Key colors observed are white (0), red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6).
In each input grid, there is a contiguous block of a single non-white color (red or azure), preceded and followed by white pixels. A single magenta pixel (6) appears towards the right end, possibly followed by a white pixel.
The transformation involves rearranging the pixels. Specifically, the contiguous block of non-white (red or azure) pixels shifts to the right, swapping positions with the block of white pixels immediately to its right, up until the magenta pixel. The magenta pixel and any pixels to its right seem to maintain their position relative to the right end of the grid.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D grid based on color blocks and a barrier pixel.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 1xN array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - type: object
    name: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white (value > 0), non-magenta (value != 6) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., red, azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - position: The starting and ending indices of the block in the input grid.
  - type: object
    name: adjacent_white_space
    description: A contiguous sequence of white pixels (value == 0) immediately following the movable_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - position: The starting and ending indices of the block in the input grid.
  - type: object
    name: barrier
    description: A single magenta pixel (value == 6).
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6).
      - position: The index of the magenta pixel. Acts as a boundary for rearrangement.
  - type: object
    name: fixed_suffix
    description: The portion of the grid including the barrier pixel and any pixels to its right.
    properties:
      - content: The sequence of pixels starting from the barrier.
      - position: Relative to the end of the grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The adjacent_white_space is located immediately to the right of the movable_block.
  - type: spatial
    description: The barrier is located to the right of the adjacent_white_space.

actions:
  - name: identify_elements
    description: Locate the movable_block, adjacent_white_space, barrier, and fixed_suffix within the input grid.
  - name: swap_blocks
    description: Exchange the positions of the movable_block and the adjacent_white_space within the portion of the grid preceding the barrier.
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    description: Combine the pixels preceding the movable_block, the swapped adjacent_white_space, the swapped movable_block, and the fixed_suffix to form the output grid.

constraints:
  - The grid is always 1D (a single row).
  - There is exactly one movable_block.
  - There is exactly one magenta barrier pixel.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the index of the magenta pixel (color 6), which acts as a barrier.
2.  Consider the subgrid consisting of all pixels *before* the barrier index.
3.  Within this subgrid, locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-magenta pixels (the "movable block").
4.  Locate the contiguous block of white pixels (color 0) that immediately follows the movable block within the subgrid.
5.  Swap the positions of the movable block and the adjacent white block within the subgrid. Leave any other pixels in the subgrid (e.g., leading white pixels) in their original positions relative to the start.
6.  Construct the output grid by concatenating:
    *   The pixels from the original subgrid that were *before* the movable block.
    *   The block of white pixels identified in step 4 (now moved left).
    *   The movable block identified in step 3 (now moved right).
    *   The pixels from the original grid starting from the barrier index to the end.
