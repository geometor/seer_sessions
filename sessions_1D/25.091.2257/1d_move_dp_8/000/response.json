Each grid contains sequences of pixels.\nKey colors observed are white (0), red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6).\nIn each input grid, there is a contiguous block of a single non-white color (red or azure), preceded and followed by white pixels. A single magenta pixel (6) appears towards the right end, possibly followed by a white pixel.\nThe transformation involves rearranging the pixels. Specifically, the contiguous block of non-white (red or azure) pixels shifts to the right, swapping positions with the block of white pixels immediately to its right, up until the magenta pixel. The magenta pixel and any pixels to its right seem to maintain their position relative to the right end of the grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
