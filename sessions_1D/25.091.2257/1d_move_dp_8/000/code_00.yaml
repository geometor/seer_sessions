task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D grid based on color blocks and a barrier pixel.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 1xN array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - type: object
    name: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white (value > 0), non-magenta (value != 6) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., red, azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - position: The starting and ending indices of the block in the input grid.
  - type: object
    name: adjacent_white_space
    description: A contiguous sequence of white pixels (value == 0) immediately following the movable_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - position: The starting and ending indices of the block in the input grid.
  - type: object
    name: barrier
    description: A single magenta pixel (value == 6).
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6).
      - position: The index of the magenta pixel. Acts as a boundary for rearrangement.
  - type: object
    name: fixed_suffix
    description: The portion of the grid including the barrier pixel and any pixels to its right.
    properties:
      - content: The sequence of pixels starting from the barrier.
      - position: Relative to the end of the grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The adjacent_white_space is located immediately to the right of the movable_block.
  - type: spatial
    description: The barrier is located to the right of the adjacent_white_space.

actions:
  - name: identify_elements
    description: Locate the movable_block, adjacent_white_space, barrier, and fixed_suffix within the input grid.
  - name: swap_blocks
    description: Exchange the positions of the movable_block and the adjacent_white_space within the portion of the grid preceding the barrier.
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    description: Combine the pixels preceding the movable_block, the swapped adjacent_white_space, the swapped movable_block, and the fixed_suffix to form the output grid.

constraints:
  - The grid is always 1D (a single row).
  - There is exactly one movable_block.
  - There is exactly one magenta barrier pixel.
