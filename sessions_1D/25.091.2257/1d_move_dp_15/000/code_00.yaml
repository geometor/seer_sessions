task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: space to be rearranged
  - type: target_object
    color: orange (7)
    count: 1
    role: anchor point for rearrangement
  - type: moving_object
    color: variable (blue, azure, gray in examples)
    structure: contiguous block
    count: 1
    role: object to be repositioned
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The moving object becomes left-adjacent to the target object in the output.
  - type: ordering
    description: White pixels maintain their relative order concerning the target object (before or after) but are grouped together at the start or end respectively.
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: orange pixel (7)
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous block of non-white, non-orange pixels (moving object)
  - action: identify
    target: white pixels (0) before the orange pixel
  - action: identify
    target: white pixels (0) after the orange pixel
  - action: construct_output
    steps:
      - place all identified 'before' white pixels at the beginning.
      - place the identified moving object immediately after the white pixels.
      - place the identified orange pixel immediately after the moving object.
      - place all identified 'after' white pixels at the end.
