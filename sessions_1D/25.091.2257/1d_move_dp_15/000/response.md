Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 1D arrays (or grids of height 1).
*   Each array contains pixels of three types: white (0), orange (7), and one other color (blue (1), azure (8), or gray (5)).
*   In each example, there is exactly one orange pixel (7).
*   There is a single contiguous block of pixels of the *other* color (non-white, non-orange).
*   The remaining pixels are white (0).
*   The transformation rearranges the pixels within the array. The length and the counts of each color remain the same.
*   The orange pixel (7) acts as an anchor or target.
*   The block of the *other* color moves to be positioned immediately to the left of the orange pixel.
*   All the white pixels (0) that were originally positioned *before* the orange pixel are collected and placed at the beginning of the output array.
*   All the white pixels (0) that were originally positioned *after* the orange pixel are collected and placed at the end of the output array, after the orange pixel.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: space to be rearranged
  - type: target_object
    color: orange (7)
    count: 1
    role: anchor point for rearrangement
  - type: moving_object
    color: variable (blue, azure, gray in examples)
    structure: contiguous block
    count: 1
    role: object to be repositioned
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The moving object becomes left-adjacent to the target object in the output.
  - type: ordering
    description: White pixels maintain their relative order concerning the target object (before or after) but are grouped together at the start or end respectively.
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: orange pixel (7)
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous block of non-white, non-orange pixels (moving object)
  - action: identify
    target: white pixels (0) before the orange pixel
  - action: identify
    target: white pixels (0) after the orange pixel
  - action: construct_output
    steps:
      - place all identified 'before' white pixels at the beginning.
      - place the identified moving object immediately after the white pixels.
      - place the identified orange pixel immediately after the moving object.
      - place all identified 'after' white pixels at the end.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input array to find the single orange pixel (color 7) and note its position (index).
2.  Scan the input array to find the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor orange (7). Store this block (the 'moving object').
3.  Create three lists: `leading_whites`, `trailing_whites`.
4.  Iterate through the input array:
    *   If a pixel is white (0) and its index is less than the index of the orange pixel, add it to the `leading_whites` list.
    *   If a pixel is white (0) and its index is greater than the index of the orange pixel, add it to the `trailing_whites` list.
5.  Construct the output array by concatenating: the `leading_whites` list, the stored 'moving object' block, the single orange pixel, and the `trailing_whites` list.
