The length and the counts of each color remain the same.\n*   The orange pixel (7) acts as an anchor or target.\n*   The block of the *other* color moves to be positioned immediately to the left of the orange pixel.\n*   All the white pixels (0) that were originally positioned *before* the orange pixel are collected and placed at the beginning of the output array.\n*   All the white pixels (0) that were originally positioned *after* the orange pixel are collected and placed at the end of the output array, after the orange pixel.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
