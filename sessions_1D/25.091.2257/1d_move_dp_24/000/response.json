            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or flattened grids of integers representing colors. The length of the arrays remains constant between input and output in the examples (26 elements).\n2.  **Colors Involved:**\n    *   `0` (white): Appears to be the background color.\n    *   `8` (azure): Appears as a single, stationary pixel in each example. Let's call this the \"marker\".\n    *   `2` (red), `7` (orange), `5` (gray): These appear as contiguous blocks of a single color in each example. Let's call this the \"main block\".\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a horizontal shift of the \"main block\". The direction of the shift is consistently rightward in the examples. The \"marker\" pixel (`8`) remains in its original position. The background pixels (`0`) fill the space vacated by the shift and are replaced by the main block's color in the new positions.\n4.  **Shift Determinant:** The amount of the shift varies between examples (2, 5, 7). By comparing the input and output in each case, the shift distance corresponds exactly to the number of background (`0`) pixels located between the right end of the main block and the position of the marker pixel (`8`) in the input.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
