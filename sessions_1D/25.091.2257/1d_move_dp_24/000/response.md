Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or flattened grids of integers representing colors. The length of the arrays remains constant between input and output in the examples (26 elements).
2.  **Colors Involved:**
    *   `0` (white): Appears to be the background color.
    *   `8` (azure): Appears as a single, stationary pixel in each example. Let's call this the "marker".
    *   `2` (red), `7` (orange), `5` (gray): These appear as contiguous blocks of a single color in each example. Let's call this the "main block".
3.  **Key Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a horizontal shift of the "main block". The direction of the shift is consistently rightward in the examples. The "marker" pixel (`8`) remains in its original position. The background pixels (`0`) fill the space vacated by the shift and are replaced by the main block's color in the new positions.
4.  **Shift Determinant:** The amount of the shift varies between examples (2, 5, 7). By comparing the input and output in each case, the shift distance corresponds exactly to the number of background (`0`) pixels located between the right end of the main block and the position of the marker pixel (`8`) in the input.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a contiguous block of color towards a stationary marker pixel based on the number of background pixels between them.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1D array of pixels representing colors.
  - element: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: Fills empty space, defines separation.
  - element: main_block
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (0) or azure (8).
      - shape: A single contiguous horizontal block.
      - role: The object being moved.
  - element: marker
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one instance.
      - role: A stationary reference point determining the shift distance.

transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: background pixel (0)
  - action: identify
    target: marker pixel (8) and its position.
  - action: identify
    target: main_block (contiguous, non-background, non-marker color) and its start and end positions.
  - action: calculate_distance
    inputs:
      - end position of main_block
      - position of marker pixel
    method: Count the number of background pixels strictly between the main_block's end and the marker's position.
    output: shift_distance
  - action: shift
    target: main_block
    direction: Rightward (towards the marker in these examples)
    distance: shift_distance
  - action: update_grid
    details:
      - Create the output grid, initially identical to the input.
      - Move the pixels of the main_block rightward by shift_distance.
      - Fill the original starting positions of the main_block (equal to shift_distance) with the background color.
      - Ensure the marker pixel remains unchanged.
      - Ensure other background pixels remain unchanged.

assumptions:
  - The input is a 1D array.
  - There is exactly one marker pixel (azure, 8).
  - There is exactly one contiguous main_block of a single color (not white or azure).
  - The marker pixel is located to the right of the main_block.
  - There are sufficient background pixels between the block and the marker to accommodate the shift without overlapping the marker.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the color of the background (white, 0).
3.  Find the position (index) of the unique marker pixel (azure, 8).
4.  Scan the input grid to find the contiguous block of pixels that are not the background color (0) and not the marker color (8). Record its color, start index, and end index.
5.  Count the number of background pixels (0) located strictly between the end index of the main block and the index of the marker pixel. This count is the `shift_distance`.
6.  Iterate from `0` up to `shift_distance - 1`:
    a.  Change the pixel in the output grid at `start_index + i` to the background color (0).
    b.  Change the pixel in the output grid at `end_index + 1 + i` to the color of the main block.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
