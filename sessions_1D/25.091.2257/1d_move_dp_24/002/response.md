**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D Python list, while the execution environment uses 2D NumPy arrays (specifically shape `(1, N)` for these examples). The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" arose from attempting boolean checks (like `if pixel == color:`) where `pixel` was incorrectly treated as a whole row array instead of a scalar value.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge the input is a 2D NumPy array of shape `(1, N)`.
2.  Modify the code to access individual pixel values using `grid[0, column_index]`.
3.  Update the helper functions and the main `transform` function accordingly.
4.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 1xN grid structure.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a contiguous block of color horizontally rightward within a single-row grid towards a stationary marker pixel. The magnitude of the shift is determined by the count of background pixels situated strictly between the block's right edge and the marker pixel.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D NumPy array representing a single row of pixels (shape 1xN).
    properties:
      - rows: 1
      - columns: Variable (e.g., 26 in examples)
  - element: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: Fills empty space, defines separation distance for shifting.
  - element: main_block
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (0) or azure (8).
      - shape: A single contiguous horizontal block within the row.
      - role: The object being moved rightward.
      - location: Always appears to the left of the marker pixel in the input.
  - element: marker
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one instance per grid.
      - role: A stationary reference point; the shift target and distance determinant.
      - location: Always appears to the right of the main_block in the input.

transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: background pixel color (0)
  - action: identify
    target: marker pixel color (8)
  - action: locate
    target: marker pixel
    output: marker_index (column index)
  - action: locate
    target: main_block
    constraints: Contiguous run of pixels that are not background (0) and not marker (8), located to the left of marker_index.
    outputs:
      - block_color
      - block_start_index (column index)
      - block_end_index (column index)
  - action: calculate_distance
    inputs:
      - grid row
      - block_end_index
      - marker_index
      - background_color
    method: Count the number of background pixels in the grid row at column indices strictly greater than block_end_index and strictly less than marker_index.
    output: shift_distance
  - action: shift_block
    target: main_block
    parameters:
      - direction: Right
      - distance: shift_distance
    process:
      - Create a copy of the input grid for the output.
      - For i from 0 to shift_distance - 1:
        - Set the pixel at output_grid[0, block_start_index + i] to background_color (0).
        - Set the pixel at output_grid[0, block_end_index + 1 + i] to block_color.
  - action: return
    target: modified output grid

assumptions:
  - Input is always a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N).
  - There is exactly one marker pixel (8).
  - There is exactly one contiguous main_block (color != 0 and != 8) located entirely to the left of the marker.
  - The space between the block and the marker contains only background pixels (0) or is empty.
  - There is enough space (filled with background pixels) to the right of the original block to accommodate the shift without overwriting the marker.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array with a single row (shape 1xN).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Define the background color as `0` and the marker color as `8`.
4.  Scan the first (and only) row of the input grid to find the column index of the marker pixel (`marker_index`).
5.  Scan the first row *up to* `marker_index` to find the contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither the background color nor the marker color. Record its color (`block_color`), starting column index (`block_start_index`), and ending column index (`block_end_index`).
6.  Initialize a counter `shift_distance` to 0.
7.  Iterate through the column indices from `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `marker_index`. For each index, if the pixel in the input grid's first row at that index is the background color (0), increment `shift_distance`.
8.  If `shift_distance` is greater than 0, modify the output grid:
    a.  Iterate `i` from 0 up to `shift_distance - 1`.
    b.  In the output grid's first row, set the pixel at column `block_start_index + i` to the background color (0).
    c.  In the output grid's first row, set the pixel at column `block_end_index + 1 + i` to `block_color`.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
