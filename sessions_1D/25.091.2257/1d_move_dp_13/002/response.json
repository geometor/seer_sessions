            "text": "**Assessment**\n\nThe provided code failed during execution due to a `NameError: name '__file__' is not defined`. This error stems from the attempt to dynamically modify the system path using `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` to import a `grid_utils` module. This approach is unsuitable for the execution environment and unnecessary because the required object-finding logic for this specific 1D task was manually implemented in the `find_movable_block` function.\n\nThe strategy is to remove the problematic `sys.path.append` line and the unused `from grid_utils import find_objects` import. The core transformation logic described in the previous natural language program and implemented in the helper functions (`find_boundary_column`, `find_movable_block`) appears consistent with all training examples upon manual re-inspection.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nCode execution failed, so no runtime metrics are available. Manual verification of the logic against the examples:\n\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2]` (Length 20)\n    *   Boundary (Red, 2) Column: 19\n    *   Block (Orange, 7): Columns 2-10 (Length 9)\n    *   Target End Column: 19 - 1 = 18\n    *   Target Start Column: 18 - 9 + 1 = 10\n    *   Expected Output: Block of 7s at columns 10-18. Original location (2-10) becomes 0. Other pixels unchanged. Matches provided output.\n*   **Train 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 2]` (Length 20)\n    *   Boundary (Red, 2) Column: 19\n    *   Block (Yellow, 4): Columns 9-15 (Length 7)\n    *   Target End Column: 19 - 1 = 18\n    *   Target Start Column: 18 - 7 + 1 = 12\n    *   Expected Output: Block of 4s at columns 12-18. Original location (9-15) becomes 0. Other pixels unchanged. Matches provided output.\n*   **Train 3:**\n    *   Input: `[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 2 0]` (Length 20)\n    *   Boundary (Red, 2) Column: 18\n    *   Block (Yellow, 4): Columns 0-15 (Length 16)\n    *   Target End Column: 18 - 1 = 17\n    *   Target Start Column: 17 - 16 + 1 = 2\n    *   Expected Output: Block of 4s at columns 2-17. Original location (0-15) becomes 0. Other pixels unchanged. Matches provided output.\n\nThe logic holds for all training examples.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
