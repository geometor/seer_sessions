**Assessment**

The provided code failed during execution due to a `NameError: name '__file__' is not defined`. This error stems from the attempt to dynamically modify the system path using `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` to import a `grid_utils` module. This approach is unsuitable for the execution environment and unnecessary because the required object-finding logic for this specific 1D task was manually implemented in the `find_movable_block` function.

The strategy is to remove the problematic `sys.path.append` line and the unused `from grid_utils import find_objects` import. The core transformation logic described in the previous natural language program and implemented in the helper functions (`find_boundary_column`, `find_movable_block`) appears consistent with all training examples upon manual re-inspection.

**Metrics**

Code execution failed, so no runtime metrics are available. Manual verification of the logic against the examples:

*   **Train 1:**
    *   Input: `[0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2]` (Length 20)
    *   Boundary (Red, 2) Column: 19
    *   Block (Orange, 7): Columns 2-10 (Length 9)
    *   Target End Column: 19 - 1 = 18
    *   Target Start Column: 18 - 9 + 1 = 10
    *   Expected Output: Block of 7s at columns 10-18. Original location (2-10) becomes 0. Other pixels unchanged. Matches provided output.
*   **Train 2:**
    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 2]` (Length 20)
    *   Boundary (Red, 2) Column: 19
    *   Block (Yellow, 4): Columns 9-15 (Length 7)
    *   Target End Column: 19 - 1 = 18
    *   Target Start Column: 18 - 7 + 1 = 12
    *   Expected Output: Block of 4s at columns 12-18. Original location (9-15) becomes 0. Other pixels unchanged. Matches provided output.
*   **Train 3:**
    *   Input: `[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 2 0]` (Length 20)
    *   Boundary (Red, 2) Column: 18
    *   Block (Yellow, 4): Columns 0-15 (Length 16)
    *   Target End Column: 18 - 1 = 17
    *   Target Start Column: 17 - 16 + 1 = 2
    *   Expected Output: Block of 4s at columns 2-17. Original location (0-15) becomes 0. Other pixels unchanged. Matches provided output.

The logic holds for all training examples.

      - color: variable (e.g., orange, yellow)
      - length: variable
      - location: defined by start and end column indices

    description: A single pixel of red color (2).
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - position: fixed column index within the transformation

    properties:
      - color: white (0)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation goal is to place the 'block' object such that its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the 'boundary' object's column.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Identify the single red pixel (color 2) in the input grid and record its column index (`boundary_col`).
4.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of pixels in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor red (2). Record its color (`block_color`), its length (`block_length`), and its starting and ending column indices (`input_start_col`, `input_end_col`).
5.  In the output grid, overwrite the pixels from `input_start_col` to `input_end_col` (inclusive) with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Calculate the target ending column for the block in the output grid: `target_end_col = boundary_col - 1`.
7.  Calculate the target starting column for the block: `target_start_col = target_end_col - block_length + 1`.
8.  In the output grid, set the pixels from `target_start_col` to `target_end_col` (inclusive) to `block_color`.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
