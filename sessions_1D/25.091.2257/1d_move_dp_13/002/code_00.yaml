task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are 1xN grids
objects:
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and red (2).
    properties:
      - color: variable (e.g., orange, yellow)
      - length: variable
      - location: defined by start and end column indices
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: boundary
    description: A single pixel of red color (2).
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - position: fixed column index within the transformation
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: background
    description: Pixels of white color (0).
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation goal is to place the 'block' object such that its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the 'boundary' object's column.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: block object
    attributes: color, length, start_column, end_column
  - action: identify
    target: boundary object
    attributes: column_position
  - action: create_copy
    source: input grid
    destination: output grid
  - action: erase
    target: block object's original position in output grid
    method: fill with background color (white)
  - action: calculate_target_position
    target: block object
    based_on: boundary object's column_position, block object's length
    result: target_start_column, target_end_column
  - action: draw
    target: block object in output grid
    location: target_start_column to target_end_column
    color: block object's color
