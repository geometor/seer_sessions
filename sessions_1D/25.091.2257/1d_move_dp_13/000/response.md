Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: All examples show a 1-row grid (a horizontal strip).
2.  **Key Colors**: Three colors seem important:
    *   White (0): Appears to be the background color.
    *   Red (2): Appears exactly once in each example and seems to act as a fixed boundary or stop point.
    *   Another Color (Orange 7, Yellow 4): Forms a single contiguous block in each input. This block changes position in the output.
3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation is a horizontal shift of the contiguous block of non-white, non-red pixels.
4.  **Movement Rule**: The block moves to the right.
5.  **Stopping Condition**: The movement stops when the rightmost pixel of the moving block is immediately to the left of the single red pixel.
6.  **Overwriting/Filling**: The space originally occupied by the moving block becomes white (background). The final position of the block overwrites whatever was there previously (which was always white in the space the block moved into in the examples). Pixels not part of the moving block and not the red boundary pixel seem to retain their original color and position (e.g., the trailing white pixel in train\_3).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are 1xN grids
objects:
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and red (2).
    properties:
      - color: variable (e.g., orange, yellow)
      - length: variable
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: boundary
    description: A single pixel of red color (2).
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - position: fixed within the transformation
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: background
    description: Pixels of white color (0).
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation goal is to make the 'block' object adjacent to the left side of the 'boundary' object.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: block object
    attributes: color, length, start_column, end_column
  - action: identify
    target: boundary object
    attributes: column_position
  - action: move
    target: block object
    direction: right
    termination_condition: The rightmost pixel of the block object is in the column immediately preceding the boundary object's column.
  - action: update_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Erase the original position of the block object by setting its pixels to the background color (white).
      - Draw the block object in its new position, determined by the termination condition.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Identify the single red pixel (color 2) and note its column index (let's call it `boundary_col`).
3.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not red (2). Note its color (`block_color`), its length (`block_length`), and its starting and ending column indices in the input (`input_start_col`, `input_end_col`).
4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5.  Set the pixels in the output grid from `input_start_col` to `input_end_col` (inclusive) to white (0), effectively erasing the block from its original position.
6.  Calculate the target ending column index for the block in the output grid: `target_end_col = boundary_col - 1`.
7.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block: `target_start_col = target_end_col - block_length + 1`.
8.  Set the pixels in the output grid from `target_start_col` to `target_end_col` (inclusive) to `block_color`, drawing the block in its final position.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
