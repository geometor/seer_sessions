This block changes position in the output.\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation is a horizontal shift of the contiguous block of non-white, non-red pixels.\n4.  **Movement Rule**: The block moves to the right.\n5.  **Stopping Condition**: The movement stops when the rightmost pixel of the moving block is immediately to the left of the single red pixel.\n6.  **Overwriting/Filling**: The space originally occupied by the moving block becomes white (background). The final position of the block overwrites whatever was there previously (which was always white in the space the block moved into in the examples). Pixels not part of the moving block and not the red boundary pixel seem to retain their original color and position (e.g., the trailing white pixel in train\\_3).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the single red pixel (color 2) and note its column index (let's call it `boundary_col`).\n3.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not red (2). Note its color (`block_color`), its length (`block_length`), and its starting and ending column indices in the input (`input_start_col`, `input_end_col`).\n4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n5.  Set the pixels in the output grid from `input_start_col` to `input_end_col` (inclusive) to white (0), effectively erasing the block from its original position.\n6.  Calculate the target ending column index for the block in the output grid: `target_end_col = boundary_col - 1`.\n7.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block: `target_start_col = target_end_col - block_length + 1`.\n8.  Set the pixels in the output grid from `target_start_col` to `target_end_col` (inclusive) to `block_color`, drawing the block in its final position.\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
