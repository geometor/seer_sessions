task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are 1xN grids
objects:
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and red (2).
    properties:
      - color: variable (e.g., orange, yellow)
      - length: variable
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: boundary
    description: A single pixel of red color (2).
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - position: fixed within the transformation
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: background
    description: Pixels of white color (0).
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation goal is to make the 'block' object adjacent to the left side of the 'boundary' object.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: block object
    attributes: color, length, start_column, end_column
  - action: identify
    target: boundary object
    attributes: column_position
  - action: move
    target: block object
    direction: right
    termination_condition: The rightmost pixel of the block object is in the column immediately preceding the boundary object's column.
  - action: update_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Erase the original position of the block object by setting its pixels to the background color (white).
      - Draw the block object in its new position, determined by the termination condition.
