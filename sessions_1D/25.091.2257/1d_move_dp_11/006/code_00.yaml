task_description: In a 1D grid, locate a single magenta pixel and a single contiguous block of another color (non-white, non-magenta). Move the colored block so its right end is immediately to the left of the magenta pixel.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    count: variable
  - type: colored_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not magenta (6).
    properties:
        color: variable (e.g., azure, green, orange)
        length: variable (e.g., 4, 17, 3)
        original_position: variable start index
    count: 1
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel used as a reference point.
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: single pixel
    properties:
        position: fixed index within the row.
    count: 1
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: In the input, the colored_block may be separated from the marker_pixel by white pixels.
  - type: target_spatial
    description: In the output, the colored_block's rightmost pixel must be at index `marker_pixel_index - 1`.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: marker_pixel
    details: Find the index of the magenta (6) pixel. Store as `marker_index`.
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block
    details: Find the start index (`original_start`), length (`block_length`), and color (`block_color`) of the first contiguous block of non-white, non-magenta pixels.
  - action: calculate
    target: new_position
    details: Determine the required start index for the colored_block in the output: `new_start_index = marker_index - block_length`.
  - action: construct_output
    target: grid
    details:
      - Create a new grid (row) of the same width as the input, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
      - Place the marker_pixel (color 6) into the new grid at `marker_index`.
      - Place the colored_block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) into the new grid, starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure the placement is within grid bounds. If the calculated position is valid, fill the range `new_start_index` to `new_start_index + block_length` with `block_color`.
