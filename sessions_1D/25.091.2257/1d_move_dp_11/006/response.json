            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe core logic identified previously (find a colored block, find a magenta marker, move the block adjacent to the marker) appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The Python code implements this logic.\n\nThe error `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` occurring consistently across all examples suggests a problem not with the high-level logic, but with its implementation, specifically how boolean conditions involving NumPy arrays are handled. This typically arises from using standard Python `and`, `or`, `if array:` on NumPy arrays instead of element-wise operators (`&`, `|`) or array methods (`.any()`, `.all()`).\n\nAlthough a review of the previous code didn't reveal an obvious instance of this error, it's the most likely cause. The strategy is to:\n1.  **Re-verify Core Parameters:** Use code execution to confirm the identified properties (block location, marker location, block size) for each example.\n2.  **Refine Implementation Logic:** Rewrite the transformation steps, potentially simplifying the process (e.g., building the output grid from scratch instead of modifying a copy) to minimize complex NumPy interactions. Pay close attention to any conditional logic.\n3.  **Update YAML & Program:** Refine the documentation and natural language program to reflect the verified parameters and the slightly adjusted (safer) implementation logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
