Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples consist of a single row (1D grid).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0), magenta (6), and one other non-zero color per example (azure (8), green (3), orange (7)).
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is a background of white pixels (0).
    *   There is a single, contiguous horizontal block of a non-zero, non-magenta color. Let's call this the "colored block".
    *   There is a single magenta pixel (6).
4.  **Relationships:** In the input grid, the colored block always appears to the left of the magenta pixel, separated by one or more white pixels.
5.  **Transformation:** In the output grid, the colored block has moved. Its new position is immediately to the left of the magenta pixel, with no white pixels between them. The magenta pixel itself does not change position. The relative order of the colored block and the magenta pixel is preserved. The pixels originally occupied by the colored block become white pixels, unless they are reoccupied by the shifted block.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored block horizontally to be adjacent to a fixed magenta pixel.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    count: variable
  - type: colored_block
    color: non-zero, non-magenta (e.g., azure, green, orange)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line
    count: 1
    properties:
      - is always left of the magenta pixel in the input.
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: single pixel
    count: 1
    properties:
      - position is fixed between input and output.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: In the input, the colored_block is separated from the marker_pixel by one or more white pixels.
  - type: spatial
    description: In the output, the colored_block is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the marker_pixel.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block
    details: Find the start index, end index, and color of the contiguous block of non-zero, non-magenta color.
  - action: identify
    target: marker_pixel
    details: Find the index of the magenta (6) pixel.
  - action: calculate
    target: new_position
    details: Determine the required start index for the colored_block in the output so its rightmost pixel is at index (marker_pixel_index - 1).
  - action: transform
    target: grid
    details:
      - Create a new grid initialized with white pixels (or copy the input).
      - Place the marker_pixel at its original index.
      - Place the colored_block at its calculated new position.
      - Fill any remaining positions with white pixels, effectively removing the colored_block from its original input position.
    alternative_details: # simpler approach
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - Set the original positions of the colored_block to white (0).
      - Place the colored_block starting at the calculated new position (marker_pixel_index - length_of_colored_block).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of pixels that are not white (0) and not magenta (6). Record its color, starting index, and length.
2.  Identify the index of the single magenta (6) pixel.
3.  Create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  Place the identified magenta (6) pixel into the new grid at its original index.
5.  Calculate the starting index for the colored block in the new grid: `new_start_index = magenta_pixel_index - length_of_colored_block`.
6.  Place the colored block (using its identified color and length) into the new grid, starting at the `new_start_index`.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.
