"""
Rearrange elements in a 1D grid by moving a colored block adjacent to a fixed marker pixel.

Identifies a contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white (0), non-magenta (6) color 
and a single magenta (6) pixel in a 1D grid (single row).
Moves the colored block horizontally so that its rightmost pixel is positioned 
immediately to the left of the magenta pixel. The magenta pixel's position 
remains unchanged. The original location of the colored block is filled with 
white (0) pixels.
