task_description: Move a colored block horizontally to be adjacent to a fixed magenta pixel.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    count: variable
  - type: colored_block
    color: non-zero, non-magenta (e.g., azure, green, orange)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line
    count: 1
    properties:
      - is always left of the magenta pixel in the input.
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: single pixel
    count: 1
    properties:
      - position is fixed between input and output.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: In the input, the colored_block is separated from the marker_pixel by one or more white pixels.
  - type: spatial
    description: In the output, the colored_block is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the marker_pixel.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block
    details: Find the start index, end index, and color of the contiguous block of non-zero, non-magenta color.
  - action: identify
    target: marker_pixel
    details: Find the index of the magenta (6) pixel.
  - action: calculate
    target: new_position
    details: Determine the required start index for the colored_block in the output so its rightmost pixel is at index (marker_pixel_index - 1).
  - action: transform
    target: grid
    details:
      - Create a new grid initialized with white pixels (or copy the input).
      - Place the marker_pixel at its original index.
      - Place the colored_block at its calculated new position.
      - Fill any remaining positions with white pixels, effectively removing the colored_block from its original input position.
    alternative_details: # simpler approach
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - Set the original positions of the colored_block to white (0).
      - Place the colored_block starting at the calculated new position (marker_pixel_index - length_of_colored_block).
