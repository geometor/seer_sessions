Let's call this the \"colored block\".\n    *   There is a single magenta pixel (6).\n4.  **Relationships:** In the input grid, the colored block always appears to the left of the magenta pixel, separated by one or more white pixels.\n5.  **Transformation:** In the output grid, the colored block has moved. Its new position is immediately to the left of the magenta pixel, with no white pixels between them. The magenta pixel itself does not change position. The relative order of the colored block and the magenta pixel is preserved. The pixels originally occupied by the colored block become white pixels, unless they are reoccupied by the shifted block.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
