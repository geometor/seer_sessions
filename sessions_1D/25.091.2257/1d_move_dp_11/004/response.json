            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" indicates that a NumPy array is being used in a context where a single boolean value (True/False) is expected. This typically happens in `if` statements or other boolean operations involving array comparisons (`array1 == array2` produces an array of booleans, not a single boolean). Given that this error occurs for all examples, it likely points to an issue within the Python code's logic or how it interacts with the testing harness, rather than a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation rule, which appears consistent across examples.\n\nThe core logic identified previously (find colored block, find magenta marker, erase old block, place block next to marker) seems correct and applicable to all training examples. The error likely arises during the implementation, possibly in a conditional check involving arrays or during the comparison of the generated output with the expected output by the testing framework if either is inadvertently kept as a NumPy array.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-examine the Python code, specifically looking for any implicit or explicit boolean evaluation of NumPy arrays.\n2.  Ensure the function strictly returns data in the standard Python list-of-lists format, as the current code (`[output_row.tolist()]`) intends.\n3.  Verify the properties (block characteristics, marker position) extracted from each example using code execution to confirm the initial analysis.\n4.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be precise and consistent with all examples, assuming the core transformation logic holds.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"
