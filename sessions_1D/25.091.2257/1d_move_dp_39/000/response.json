            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids). The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use a limited palette: white (0), green (3), and one other color per example (magenta (6) or red (2)).\n3.  **Key Elements:**\n    *   There is always exactly one green pixel (3). This pixel's position seems important.\n    *   There is always one contiguous block of a single color (other than white or green). Let's call this the \"colored block\".\n    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0), acting as background.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The position of the green pixel remains unchanged from input to output.\n    *   The colored block (its color and length) is preserved from input to output.\n    *   The position of the colored block changes. In the output, the rightmost pixel of the colored block is always positioned immediately to the left of the green pixel.\n    *   The white pixels fill the remaining space in the output grid, effectively shifting to accommodate the repositioned colored block.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
