task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN arrays
objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    color: green (3)
    count: 1
    role: anchor # Position remains fixed and determines the placement of other objects
  - object_type: block # Contiguous sequence of same-colored pixels
    color: non-white, non-green (e.g., magenta(6), red(2))
    count: 1
    properties:
      - length: variable (preserved from input)
      - color: variable (preserved from input)
    role: movable_object
  - object_type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: filler # Fills space not occupied by other objects
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: movable_object
    object2: anchor (green pixel)
    condition: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the movable_object is immediately to the left of the anchor pixel.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: anchor (green pixel)
    result: store its position
  - action: identify
    target: movable_object
    result: store its color, length, and original position (optional)
  - action: create_grid
    properties: same dimensions as input, filled with background color (white)
  - action: place
    target: anchor (green pixel)
    location: same position as in the input grid
  - action: calculate_position
    target: movable_object
    based_on: position of anchor, length of movable_object
    calculation: new_start_position = anchor_position - movable_object_length
  - action: place
    target: movable_object
    location: calculated start position, extending for its length
