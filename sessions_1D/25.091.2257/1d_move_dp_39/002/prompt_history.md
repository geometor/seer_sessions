Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids). The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use a limited palette: white (0), green (3), and one other color per example (magenta (6) or red (2)).
3.  **Key Elements:**
    *   There is always exactly one green pixel (3). This pixel's position seems important.
    *   There is always one contiguous block of a single color (other than white or green). Let's call this the "colored block".
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0), acting as background.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The position of the green pixel remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   The colored block (its color and length) is preserved from input to output.
    *   The position of the colored block changes. In the output, the rightmost pixel of the colored block is always positioned immediately to the left of the green pixel.
    *   The white pixels fill the remaining space in the output grid, effectively shifting to accommodate the repositioned colored block.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency

    condition: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the movable_object is immediately to the left of the anchor pixel.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: anchor (green pixel)
    result: store its position
  - action: identify
    target: movable_object
    result: store its color, length, and original position (optional)
  - action: create_grid
    properties: same dimensions as input, filled with background color (white)
  - action: place
    target: anchor (green pixel)
    location: same position as in the input grid
  - action: calculate_position
    target: movable_object
    based_on: position of anchor, length of movable_object
    calculation: new_start_position = anchor_position - movable_object_length
  - action: place
    target: movable_object
    location: calculated start position, extending for its length
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Find the position (index) of the single green pixel (3) in the input grid.
3.  Place a green pixel (3) at that same position in the output grid.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor green (3). Determine its color and its length (number of pixels).
5.  Calculate the starting position for this block in the output grid: subtract the length of the block from the position of the green pixel.
6.  Place the identified block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated position.
