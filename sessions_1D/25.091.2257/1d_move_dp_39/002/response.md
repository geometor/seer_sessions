**Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: locate a fixed anchor (green pixel) and a movable object (colored block), then reposition the movable object so its right edge is adjacent to the anchor. However, the assumption that the input/output grids were strictly 1-dimensional lists seems incorrect based on the runtime error. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" typically arises in NumPy when a comparison operation results in a boolean array (e.g., `[True, False, True]`) which is then used in a context expecting a single boolean value (like an `if` statement). This strongly suggests the input grids are 2D arrays (likely 1xN matrices represented as lists of lists), and the initial code didn't properly handle this structure during pixel comparisons or indexing.

**Strategy:**

1.  Confirm the exact structure (dimensionality) of the input/output grids using `tool_code`.
2.  Adjust the helper functions (`find_green_pixel`, `find_colored_block`) and the main `transform` function to correctly handle 2D array indexing and operations. The logic will likely operate primarily on the single row within the 2D structure.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 2D structure, even if it's just 1xN.

    count: 1
    properties:
      - length: L (variable, preserved from input)

    color: white (0)
    role: filler
relationships:
  - type: adjacency

    object2: anchor (green pixel)
    condition: In the output grid, the rightmost pixel of the movable_object (at column `new_S + L - 1`) is immediately to the left of the anchor pixel (at column `G`). Therefore, `new_S + L - 1 = G - 1`, which simplifies to `new_S = G - L`.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (width N) of the input grid, which will be a 1xN grid.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions (1xN), initially filled with white pixels (0).
3.  Locate the column index `G` of the single green pixel (3) in the input grid's first (and only) row.
4.  Place a green pixel (3) in the output grid at row 0, column `G`.
5.  Scan the input grid's first row to find the contiguous horizontal block of pixels whose color `C` is neither white (0) nor green (3). Record its color `C` and its length `L`.
6.  Calculate the target starting column index `S_new` for this block in the output grid using the formula: `S_new = G - L`.
7.  Fill the cells in the output grid's first row from column `S_new` to `S_new + L - 1` (inclusive) with the color `C`.
