Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids). The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use a limited palette: white (0), green (3), and one other color per example (magenta (6) or red (2)).
3.  **Key Elements:**
    *   There is always exactly one green pixel (3). This pixel's position seems important.
    *   There is always one contiguous block of a single color (other than white or green). Let's call this the "colored block".
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0), acting as background.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The position of the green pixel remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   The colored block (its color and length) is preserved from input to output.
    *   The position of the colored block changes. In the output, the rightmost pixel of the colored block is always positioned immediately to the left of the green pixel.
    *   The white pixels fill the remaining space in the output grid, effectively shifting to accommodate the repositioned colored block.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Find the position (index) of the single green pixel (3) in the input grid.
3.  Place a green pixel (3) at that same position in the output grid.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor green (3). Determine its color and its length (number of pixels).
5.  Calculate the starting position for this block in the output grid: subtract the length of the block from the position of the green pixel.
6.  Place the identified block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated position.

## Example 3:

**Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: locate a fixed anchor (green pixel) and a movable object (colored block), then reposition the movable object so its right edge is adjacent to the anchor. However, the assumption that the input/output grids were strictly 1-dimensional lists seems incorrect based on the runtime error. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" typically arises in NumPy when a comparison operation results in a boolean array (e.g., `[True, False, True]`) which is then used in a context expecting a single boolean value (like an `if` statement). This strongly suggests the input grids are 2D arrays (likely 1xN matrices represented as lists of lists), and the initial code didn't properly handle this structure during pixel comparisons or indexing.

**Strategy:**

1.  Confirm the exact structure (dimensionality) of the input/output grids using `tool_code`.
2.  Adjust the helper functions (`find_green_pixel`, `find_colored_block`) and the main `transform` function to correctly handle 2D array indexing and operations. The logic will likely operate primarily on the single row within the 2D structure.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 2D structure, even if it's just 1xN.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (width N) of the input grid, which will be a 1xN grid.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions (1xN), initially filled with white pixels (0).
3.  Locate the column index `G` of the single green pixel (3) in the input grid's first (and only) row.
4.  Place a green pixel (3) in the output grid at row 0, column `G`.
5.  Scan the input grid's first row to find the contiguous horizontal block of pixels whose color `C` is neither white (0) nor green (3). Record its color `C` and its length `L`.
6.  Calculate the target starting column index `S_new` for this block in the output grid using the formula: `S_new = G - L`.
7.  Fill the cells in the output grid's first row from column `S_new` to `S_new + L - 1` (inclusive) with the color `C`.
