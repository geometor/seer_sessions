"""
Identify a contiguous block of pixels of a single color (not white 0 or yellow 4).
Locate the single yellow (4) pixel.
Shift the colored block so that its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the yellow pixel.
Fill the original location of the block with white (0) pixels.
Maintain the position of the yellow pixel and any other pixels relative to the grid boundaries, unless overwritten by the shifted block.
