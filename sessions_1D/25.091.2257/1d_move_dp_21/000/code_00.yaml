task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1 # Input/Output are single rows
  grid_size_input: [1, 16] # Fixed size in examples
  grid_size_output: [1, 16] # Fixed size in examples
  colors_present:
    - white (0)
    - yellow (4)
    - one_other (variable: 7, 5, 6 in examples)
objects:
  - object_type: block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels.
    properties:
      color: Not white (0) and not yellow (4). Variable per example (7, 5, 6).
      length: Variable (7, 6, 12 in examples).
    count: 1
  - object_type: marker
    description: A single pixel acting as a reference point.
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
    count: 1
  - object_type: background
    description: Filler pixels.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
    count: Variable
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: In the input, the 'block' object appears somewhere to the left of the 'marker' object.
actions:
  - action_type: move
    object: block
    details: The 'block' is shifted horizontally to the right.
  - action_type: position
    object: block
    details: The final position of the 'block' is determined by the 'marker'. The rightmost pixel of the 'block' becomes adjacent to the left of the 'marker' pixel.
  - action_type: fill
    details: The original position vacated by the moved 'block' is filled with 'background' (white) pixels.
  - action_type: preserve
    object: marker
    details: The 'marker' pixel maintains its original absolute position in the grid.
  - action_type: preserve
    object: background
    details: Background pixels not overwritten by the moved block maintain their original positions (particularly those after the marker).
transformation_goal: Reposition the colored 'block' immediately before the yellow 'marker'.
