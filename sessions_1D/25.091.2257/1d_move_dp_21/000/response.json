This block varies in color and length.\n    *   A single yellow pixel (4) is present in each input.\n    *   White pixels (0) act as background or filler.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves repositioning the colored block. Its final position appears dictated by the location of the yellow pixel. The relative order of the colored block and the yellow pixel changes: in the input, the colored block appears *before* the yellow pixel (reading left-to-right); in the output, the colored block is immediately *adjacent to the left* of the yellow pixel. The space originally occupied by the colored block (if it moves) is filled with white pixels. Pixels other than the colored block (specifically the yellow pixel and any trailing white pixels) seem to retain their original positions relative to the grid boundaries or each other.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Locate the index of the single yellow (4) pixel.\n4.  Create a new output row grid of the same length as the input, initially filled with white (0) pixels.\n5.  Copy all pixels from the input grid to the output grid *except* for the pixels belonging to the identified colored block (leave those positions as white for now).\n6.  Calculate the target starting index for the colored block in the output grid: `yellow_pixel_index - length_of_colored_block`.\n7.  Place the colored block (using its recorded color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated target starting index."
