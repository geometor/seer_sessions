Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently 1-dimensional grids (single rows) of the same length (16 pixels in all examples).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), yellow (4), and one other distinct color per example (orange (7), gray (5), magenta (6)).
3.  **Objects:**
    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-yellow color exists in each input. This block varies in color and length.
    *   A single yellow pixel (4) is present in each input.
    *   White pixels (0) act as background or filler.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves repositioning the colored block. Its final position appears dictated by the location of the yellow pixel. The relative order of the colored block and the yellow pixel changes: in the input, the colored block appears *before* the yellow pixel (reading left-to-right); in the output, the colored block is immediately *adjacent to the left* of the yellow pixel. The space originally occupied by the colored block (if it moves) is filled with white pixels. Pixels other than the colored block (specifically the yellow pixel and any trailing white pixels) seem to retain their original positions relative to the grid boundaries or each other.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1 # Input/Output are single rows
  grid_size_input: [1, 16] # Fixed size in examples
  grid_size_output: [1, 16] # Fixed size in examples
  colors_present:
    - white (0)
    - yellow (4)
    - one_other (variable: 7, 5, 6 in examples)
objects:
  - object_type: block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels.
    properties:
      color: Not white (0) and not yellow (4). Variable per example (7, 5, 6).
      length: Variable (7, 6, 12 in examples).
    count: 1
  - object_type: marker
    description: A single pixel acting as a reference point.
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
    count: 1
  - object_type: background
    description: Filler pixels.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
    count: Variable
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: In the input, the 'block' object appears somewhere to the left of the 'marker' object.
actions:
  - action_type: move
    object: block
    details: The 'block' is shifted horizontally to the right.
  - action_type: position
    object: block
    details: The final position of the 'block' is determined by the 'marker'. The rightmost pixel of the 'block' becomes adjacent to the left of the 'marker' pixel.
  - action_type: fill
    details: The original position vacated by the moved 'block' is filled with 'background' (white) pixels.
  - action_type: preserve
    object: marker
    details: The 'marker' pixel maintains its original absolute position in the grid.
  - action_type: preserve
    object: background
    details: Background pixels not overwritten by the moved block maintain their original positions (particularly those after the marker).
transformation_goal: Reposition the colored 'block' immediately before the yellow 'marker'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input row grid.
2.  Locate the contiguous block of pixels having the same color, where this color is neither white (0) nor yellow (4). Record its color, its length, and its starting index.
3.  Locate the index of the single yellow (4) pixel.
4.  Create a new output row grid of the same length as the input, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
5.  Copy all pixels from the input grid to the output grid *except* for the pixels belonging to the identified colored block (leave those positions as white for now).
6.  Calculate the target starting index for the colored block in the output grid: `yellow_pixel_index - length_of_colored_block`.
7.  Place the colored block (using its recorded color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated target starting index.
