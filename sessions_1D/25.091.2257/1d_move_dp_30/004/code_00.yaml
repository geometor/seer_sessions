InputGrid:
  Type: 2D List (List of Lists)
  Dimensions: 1xN (Always a single row)
  Content: Integer values representing colors (0-9)
OutputGrid:
  Type: 2D List (List of Lists)
  Dimensions: 1xN (Same as input)
  Content: Transformed integer values
Objects:
  - Type: ColorBlock
    ExistsIn: Input and Output Grids (potentially shifted)
    Attributes:
      - Color: Non-white(0), Non-gray(5) pixel value (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal sequence of identical pixels in the single row
      - Count: Exactly one per grid row
  - Type: AnchorPixel
    ExistsIn: Input and Output Grids (fixed position)
    Attributes:
      - Color: Gray(5)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Count: Exactly one per grid row
  - Type: SeparatorPixel
    ExistsIn: Input Grid (potentially displaced in Output)
    Attributes:
      - Color: White(0)
      - Location: Positioned between ColorBlock's right edge and AnchorPixel
      - Role: Determines the magnitude of the ColorBlock shift
  - Type: BackgroundPixel
    ExistsIn: Input and Output Grids
    Attributes:
      - Color: White(0)
      - Location: All other positions not occupied by ColorBlock or AnchorPixel
Relationships:
  - Type: Spatial (Input)
    Objects: [ColorBlock, AnchorPixel]
    Relation: ColorBlock is to the left of AnchorPixel.
    Separation: Defined by the count of SeparatorPixels (White(0)) between ColorBlock's rightmost pixel and AnchorPixel.
Transformation:
  - Action: Identify
    Target: AnchorPixel
    Result: Column index (AnchorIndex)
  - Action: Identify
    Target: ColorBlock
    Result: Color, Start Column Index (BlockStart), End Column Index (BlockEnd)
  - Action: Count
    Target: SeparatorPixels
    Condition: Located between BlockEnd and AnchorIndex
    Result: SeparationCount
  - Action: Calculate
    Inputs: [BlockStart, SeparationCount]
    Operation: Addition
    Result: NewBlockStart = BlockStart + SeparationCount
  - Action: ConstructOutput
    Steps:
      1. Create a 1xN grid initialized with White(0).
      2. Place AnchorPixel at AnchorIndex in the output row.
      3. Place ColorBlock (using original Color and length) starting at NewBlockStart in the output row.
Invariant:
  - AnchorPixel position remains unchanged between Input and Output.
  - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
