GridProperties:
  Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  Homogeneity: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
Objects:
  - Type: ColorBlock
    Attributes:
      - Color: Variable (non-white, non-gray)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal line
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
  - Type: AnchorPixel
    Attributes:
      - Color: Gray (5)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
  - Type: Background
    Attributes:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Role: Fills remaining space, acts as separator
Relationships:
  - Type: Spatial
    Object1: ColorBlock
    Object2: AnchorPixel
    Relation: ColorBlock is always to the left of AnchorPixel in the input.
    Separation: Defined by the count of white pixels between the rightmost pixel of ColorBlock and the AnchorPixel.
Actions:
  - Identify AnchorPixel: Locate the single gray pixel.
  - Identify ColorBlock: Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-gray color (start and end indices).
  - Count Separation: Determine the number (N) of white pixels between ColorBlock and AnchorPixel.
  - Shift ColorBlock: Move the ColorBlock N positions to the right.
TransformationRule:
  - The AnchorPixel (gray) position is invariant.
  - The ColorBlock moves rightwards until it is adjacent to the AnchorPixel.
  - The number of white pixels originally separating the ColorBlock and AnchorPixel determines the shift distance.
  - White pixels to the left of the original ColorBlock remain in place relative to the left grid edge.
  - White pixels originally between the ColorBlock and AnchorPixel are effectively moved to occupy the space vacated by the ColorBlock's original position.
  - Any pixels to the right of the AnchorPixel (if any) remain in place relative to the AnchorPixel.
