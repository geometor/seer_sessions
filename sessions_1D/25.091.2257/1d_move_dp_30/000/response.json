The width varies but seems consistent within a single example pair (input and output have the same dimensions).\n2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain white (0), gray (5), and one other primary color (green=3, red=2, blue=1) per example.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white, non-gray color.\n    *   There is always a single gray pixel (5).\n    *   The remaining pixels are white (0).\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The position of the gray pixel remains unchanged between the input and output.\n    *   The contiguous block of color shifts horizontally to the right.\n    *   The amount of the shift appears related to the number of white pixels initially separating the colored block and the gray pixel. Specifically, the block shifts right by exactly the number of white pixels that were between its right edge and the gray pixel in the input.\n    *   The white pixels that were originally between the colored block and the gray pixel effectively end up to the left of the shifted block in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

This position will remain unchanged in the output.\n3.  Locate the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor gray (5). Record its color, its starting index, and its ending index.\n4.  Count the number of white pixels (`N`) situated strictly between the ending index of the colored block and the index of the gray pixel.\n5.  Create a new grid for the output, initially filled with white pixels and having the same dimensions as the input grid.\n6.  Place the gray pixel (value 5) in the output grid at the same index it occupied in the input grid.\n7.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block by adding `N` to its original starting index.\n8.  Place the colored block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the newly calculated starting index.\n9.  Fill any remaining positions in the output grid that were to the left of the *original* starting position of the colored block with white pixels. (This step is implicitly handled by starting with a white grid and drawing the objects, but clarifies the final state).\n10. Ensure any pixels that were to the right of the gray pixel in the input are also placed at their corresponding positions in the output grid (relative to the gray pixel). (Again, often implicitly handled if those pixels were white, but good to state for completeness)."
