"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies a single contiguous block of a primary color (non-white 0, non-gray 5) and a single gray (5) pixel within the single row.
2. Determines the number of white (0) pixels separating the right edge of the primary color block from the gray pixel.
3. Creates an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with white (0).
4. Places the gray (5) pixel in the output grid at its original position.
5. Shifts the primary color block to the right by the calculated number of separating white pixels, placing it in the output grid immediately adjacent to the left of the gray pixel.
