GridProperties:
  InputDimensionality: 2D (List[List[int]])
  OutputDimensionality: 2D (List[List[int]])
  EffectiveDimensionality: 1D (Operation occurs on the single row within the grid)
  Homogeneity: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions (height=1, width varies per task but consistent within example).
Objects:
  - Type: ColorBlock
    Location: Within the first (only) row.
    Attributes:
      - Color: Variable (non-white (0), non-gray (5))
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal line
      - Count: Exactly one per grid row.
      - Properties: Start Index, End Index, Length, Color Value.
  - Type: AnchorPixel
    Location: Within the first (only) row.
    Attributes:
      - Color: Gray (5)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Count: Exactly one per grid row.
      - Properties: Index (Column Position).
  - Type: BackgroundPixel
    Location: Within the first (only) row.
    Attributes:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Role: Fills remaining space, acts as a separator between ColorBlock and AnchorPixel.
Relationships:
  - Type: Spatial (Input)
    Scope: Within the first (only) row.
    Object1: ColorBlock
    Object2: AnchorPixel
    Relation: ColorBlock is always to the left of AnchorPixel.
    Separation: Defined by the count of white (0) pixels between the rightmost pixel of ColorBlock (End Index) and the AnchorPixel (Index). Let this count be N.
Actions:
  - Input: Read the 2D input grid.
  - IdentifyRow: Select the first (and only) row for processing.
  - LocateAnchor: Find the column index of the gray (5) pixel in the row.
  - LocateBlock: Find the start index, end index, and color of the contiguous block of non-white, non-gray color in the row.
  - CountSeparation: Count the number (N) of white (0) pixels strictly between the block's end index and the anchor's index.
  - CreateOutputGrid: Initialize a new 2D grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0) pixels.
  - PlaceAnchor: Place the gray (5) pixel in the first row of the output grid at its original column index.
  - CalculateNewBlockPosition: Determine the new start index for the ColorBlock by adding N to its original start index.
  - PlaceBlock: Place the ColorBlock (using its original color and length) into the first row of the output grid, starting at the new calculated start index.
  - Output: Return the modified 2D grid.
TransformationRule:
  - Focus on the single row within the 2D grid.
  - The position of the AnchorPixel (gray, 5) remains invariant between the input row and the output row.
  - The ColorBlock moves rightwards within the row.
  - The distance of the rightward shift is equal to the number of white (0) pixels initially located between the right edge of the ColorBlock and the AnchorPixel.
  - As a result of the shift, the ColorBlock becomes immediately adjacent to the left of the AnchorPixel in the output row.
  - All other positions in the output row are filled with white (0) pixels.
  - The final result is presented as a 2D grid containing this single modified row.
