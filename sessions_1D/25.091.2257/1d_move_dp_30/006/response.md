**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the key objects (Color Block, Anchor Pixel) and the core transformation logic (shifting the Color Block rightwards based on the count of intervening white pixels until adjacent to the stationary Anchor Pixel). However, the generated code failed to implement this shift, resulting in the output being identical to the input for all training examples. The comparison shows that the expected outputs indeed involve shifting the Color Block.

The failure likely stems from an implementation error in applying the calculated shift, rather than a fundamental misunderstanding of the rule. Specifically, the code might not be correctly calculating the number of separating white pixels or might be failing to update the output grid with the shifted block. The strategy is to re-verify the calculation of the shift distance (`separation_count`) and ensure the output grid is correctly populated with the shifted block at its new position.

**Metrics:**
Let's re-verify the logic for Example 1 using code execution.

``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 1 Input
input_row_list = [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
input_row_np = np.array(input_row_list, dtype=int)
grid_width = len(input_row_np)

# --- Analysis Functions (copied from previous attempt for consistency) ---
def find_pixel_index_in_row(row_1d, color):
    indices = np.where(row_1d == color)[0]
    if len(indices) > 0:
        return indices[0]
    return -1

def find_color_block_in_row(row_1d):
    block_color = -1
    block_start = -1
    block_end = -1
    in_block = False
    for i, pixel in enumerate(row_1d):
        is_primary_color = pixel != 0 and pixel != 5
        if is_primary_color and not in_block:
            block_color = pixel
            block_start = i
            block_end = i
            in_block = True
        elif in_block and pixel == block_color:
            block_end = i
        elif in_block and pixel != block_color:
            break
    if block_start != -1:
        return block_color, block_start, block_end
    else:
        return None, -1, -1

def count_white_separation(row_1d, block_end_idx, gray_idx):
    separation_count = 0
    if block_end_idx != -1 and gray_idx != -1 and block_end_idx < gray_idx - 1:
       for i in range(block_end_idx + 1, gray_idx):
           if row_1d[i] == 0:
               separation_count += 1
    return separation_count

# --- Re-run Analysis for Example 1 ---
gray_idx = find_pixel_index_in_row(input_row_np, 5)
block_color, block_start, block_end = find_color_block_in_row(input_row_np)
separation_count = count_white_separation(input_row_np, block_end, gray_idx)
block_length = block_end - block_start + 1
new_block_start = block_start + separation_count
new_block_end = new_block_start + block_length - 1

print(f"Example 1 Analysis:")
print(f"Input: {input_row_list}")
print(f"Gray Pixel Index: {gray_idx}")
print(f"Color Block: Color={block_color}, Start={block_start}, End={block_end}, Length={block_length}")
print(f"Separating White Pixels: Count={separation_count}")
print(f"Calculated New Block Start: {new_block_start}")
print(f"Calculated New Block End: {new_block_end}")

# --- Simulate Output Construction ---
output_row_np = np.zeros(grid_width, dtype=int)
output_row_np[gray_idx] = 5
# Apply the calculated shift
if new_block_start >= 0 and new_block_end < grid_width: # Basic bounds check
    output_row_np[new_block_start : new_block_start + block_length] = block_color

print(f"Simulated Output: {output_row_np.tolist()}")

# --- Compare with Expected Output ---
expected_output = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
print(f"Expected Output:  {expected_output}")
print(f"Match: {output_row_np.tolist() == expected_output}")
```
```
Example 1 Analysis:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Gray Pixel Index: 8
Color Block: Color=3, Start=3, End=5, Length=3
Separating White Pixels: Count=2
Calculated New Block Start: 5
Calculated New Block End: 7
Simulated Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Expected Output:  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Match: True

```
The analysis confirms the logic for calculating the shift and the resulting block position is correct. The previous code's failure was due to an overly restrictive condition (`if new_block_end == gray_idx - 1`) before placing the block, which prevented the correctly calculated placement from happening.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
GridProperties:
  Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  Homogeneity: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions (width).
Objects:
  - Type: ColorBlock
    Attributes:
      - Color: Variable (any color except white=0 and gray=5)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal line (1 or more pixels)
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
      - Identifier: block_color, block_start, block_end
  - Type: AnchorPixel
    Attributes:
      - Color: Gray (5)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
      - Identifier: gray_idx
  - Type: Background
    Attributes:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Role: Fills remaining space, acts as separator between ColorBlock and AnchorPixel.
      - Identifier: separation_count (count of white pixels strictly between block_end and gray_idx)
Relationships:
  - Type: Spatial (Input)
    Object1: ColorBlock
    Object2: AnchorPixel
    Relation: ColorBlock is to the left of AnchorPixel.
    Separation: Defined by `separation_count` (number of white pixels).
Actions:
  - Find AnchorPixel: Locate the index (`gray_idx`) of the gray pixel (5).
  - Find ColorBlock: Locate the color (`block_color`), start index (`block_start`), and end index (`block_end`) of the contiguous non-white, non-gray block.
  - Count Separation: Determine the number (`separation_count`) of white pixels (0) between `block_end` and `gray_idx`.
  - Calculate Shift: Determine the new start index for the ColorBlock (`new_block_start = block_start + separation_count`).
  - Construct Output: Create a new grid of the same size, initially all white (0). Place the AnchorPixel at `gray_idx`. Place the ColorBlock (with `block_color` and original length) starting at `new_block_start`.
TransformationRule:
  - The position of the AnchorPixel (gray, 5) remains invariant between input and output.
  - The ColorBlock is shifted horizontally to the right.
  - The distance of the shift is equal to the number of white pixels (`separation_count`) initially located between the rightmost pixel of the ColorBlock (`block_end`) and the AnchorPixel (`gray_idx`).
  - In the output, the ColorBlock becomes immediately adjacent to the left of the AnchorPixel.
  - All other pixels in the output grid are white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Initialize an output grid of the same width, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Find the index (column position) of the single gray pixel (5) in the input grid. Let this be `gray_idx`.
4.  Place the gray pixel (5) into the output grid at index `gray_idx`.
5.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor gray (5). Record its color (`block_color`), its starting index (`block_start`), and its ending index (`block_end`).
6.  Count the number of white pixels (0) located strictly between the end of the colored block (`block_end`) and the gray pixel (`gray_idx`) in the input grid. Let this count be `separation_count`.
7.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block in the output grid: `new_block_start = block_start + separation_count`.
8.  Determine the length of the colored block: `block_length = block_end - block_start + 1`.
9.  Place the colored block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) into the output grid, starting at `new_block_start` and ending at `new_block_start + block_length - 1`.
10. Return the completed output grid.
