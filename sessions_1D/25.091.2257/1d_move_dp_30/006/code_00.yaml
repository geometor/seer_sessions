GridProperties:
  Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  Homogeneity: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions (width).
Objects:
  - Type: ColorBlock
    Attributes:
      - Color: Variable (any color except white=0 and gray=5)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal line (1 or more pixels)
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
      - Identifier: block_color, block_start, block_end
  - Type: AnchorPixel
    Attributes:
      - Color: Gray (5)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
      - Identifier: gray_idx
  - Type: Background
    Attributes:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Role: Fills remaining space, acts as separator between ColorBlock and AnchorPixel.
      - Identifier: separation_count (count of white pixels strictly between block_end and gray_idx)
Relationships:
  - Type: Spatial (Input)
    Object1: ColorBlock
    Object2: AnchorPixel
    Relation: ColorBlock is to the left of AnchorPixel.
    Separation: Defined by `separation_count` (number of white pixels).
Actions:
  - Find AnchorPixel: Locate the index (`gray_idx`) of the gray pixel (5).
  - Find ColorBlock: Locate the color (`block_color`), start index (`block_start`), and end index (`block_end`) of the contiguous non-white, non-gray block.
  - Count Separation: Determine the number (`separation_count`) of white pixels (0) between `block_end` and `gray_idx`.
  - Calculate Shift: Determine the new start index for the ColorBlock (`new_block_start = block_start + separation_count`).
  - Construct Output: Create a new grid of the same size, initially all white (0). Place the AnchorPixel at `gray_idx`. Place the ColorBlock (with `block_color` and original length) starting at `new_block_start`.
TransformationRule:
  - The position of the AnchorPixel (gray, 5) remains invariant between input and output.
  - The ColorBlock is shifted horizontally to the right.
  - The distance of the shift is equal to the number of white pixels (`separation_count`) initially located between the rightmost pixel of the ColorBlock (`block_end`) and the AnchorPixel (`gray_idx`).
  - In the output, the ColorBlock becomes immediately adjacent to the left of the AnchorPixel.
  - All other pixels in the output grid are white (0).
