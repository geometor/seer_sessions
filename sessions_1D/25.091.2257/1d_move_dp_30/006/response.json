            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the key objects (Color Block, Anchor Pixel) and the core transformation logic (shifting the Color Block rightwards based on the count of intervening white pixels until adjacent to the stationary Anchor Pixel). However, the generated code failed to implement this shift, resulting in the output being identical to the input for all training examples. The comparison shows that the expected outputs indeed involve shifting the Color Block.\n\nThe failure likely stems from an implementation error in applying the calculated shift, rather than a fundamental misunderstanding of the rule. Specifically, the code might not be correctly calculating the number of separating white pixels or might be failing to update the output grid with the shifted block. The strategy is to re-verify the calculation of the shift distance (`separation_count`) and ensure the output grid is correctly populated with the shifted block at its new position.\n\n**Metrics:**\nLet's re-verify the logic for Example 1 using code execution.\n"
