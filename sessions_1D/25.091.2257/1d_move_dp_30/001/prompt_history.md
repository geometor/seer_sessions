Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (a single row). The width varies but seems consistent within a single example pair (input and output have the same dimensions).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain white (0), gray (5), and one other primary color (green=3, red=2, blue=1) per example.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white, non-gray color.
    *   There is always a single gray pixel (5).
    *   The remaining pixels are white (0).
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The position of the gray pixel remains unchanged between the input and output.
    *   The contiguous block of color shifts horizontally to the right.
    *   The amount of the shift appears related to the number of white pixels initially separating the colored block and the gray pixel. Specifically, the block shifts right by exactly the number of white pixels that were between its right edge and the gray pixel in the input.
    *   The white pixels that were originally between the colored block and the gray pixel effectively end up to the left of the shifted block in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
GridProperties:
  Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  Homogeneity: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
Objects:
  - Type: ColorBlock
    Attributes:
      - Color: Variable (non-white, non-gray)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal line
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
  - Type: AnchorPixel
    Attributes:
      - Color: Gray (5)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
  - Type: Background
    Attributes:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Role: Fills remaining space, acts as separator
Relationships:
  - Type: Spatial
    Object1: ColorBlock
    Object2: AnchorPixel
    Relation: ColorBlock is always to the left of AnchorPixel in the input.
    Separation: Defined by the count of white pixels between the rightmost pixel of ColorBlock and the AnchorPixel.
Actions:
  - Identify AnchorPixel: Locate the single gray pixel.
  - Identify ColorBlock: Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-gray color (start and end indices).
  - Count Separation: Determine the number (N) of white pixels between ColorBlock and AnchorPixel.
  - Shift ColorBlock: Move the ColorBlock N positions to the right.
TransformationRule:
  - The AnchorPixel (gray) position is invariant.
  - The ColorBlock moves rightwards until it is adjacent to the AnchorPixel.
  - The number of white pixels originally separating the ColorBlock and AnchorPixel determines the shift distance.
  - White pixels to the left of the original ColorBlock remain in place relative to the left grid edge.
  - White pixels originally between the ColorBlock and AnchorPixel are effectively moved to occupy the space vacated by the ColorBlock's original position.
  - Any pixels to the right of the AnchorPixel (if any) remain in place relative to the AnchorPixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Locate the index (column position) of the single gray pixel (value 5). This position will remain unchanged in the output.
3.  Locate the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor gray (5). Record its color, its starting index, and its ending index.
4.  Count the number of white pixels (`N`) situated strictly between the ending index of the colored block and the index of the gray pixel.
5.  Create a new grid for the output, initially filled with white pixels and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  Place the gray pixel (value 5) in the output grid at the same index it occupied in the input grid.
7.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block by adding `N` to its original starting index.
8.  Place the colored block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the newly calculated starting index.
9.  Fill any remaining positions in the output grid that were to the left of the *original* starting position of the colored block with white pixels. (This step is implicitly handled by starting with a white grid and drawing the objects, but clarifies the final state).
10. Ensure any pixels that were to the right of the gray pixel in the input are also placed at their corresponding positions in the output grid (relative to the gray pixel). (Again, often implicitly handled if those pixels were white, but good to state for completeness).
