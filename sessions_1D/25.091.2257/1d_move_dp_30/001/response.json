All other pixels become white (0).\n\nWorkflow:\n1. Convert the input list to a numpy array for easier indexing.\n2. Find the index (column position) of the gray pixel (5).\n3. Find the contiguous block of the primary color (not 0 or 5), recording its color, start index, and end index.\n4. Count the white pixels (0) between the end of the color block and the gray pixel.\n5. Create an output grid of the same size, initialized to white (0).\n6. Place the gray pixel (5) in the output grid at its original index.\n7. Calculate the new starting position for the color block by adding the count of separating white pixels to its original start index.\n8. Place the color block (using its identified color and length) into the output grid at the new calculated position.\n9. Return the resulting output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pixel_index(grid_1d, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the first occurrence of a specific color in a 1D numpy array.\"\"\"\n    indices = np.where(grid_1d == color)[0]\n    if len(indices) > 0:\n        return indices[0]\n    return -1 # Not found\n\ndef find_color_block(grid_1d):\n    \"\"\"Finds the contiguous block of non-white, non-gray color.\"\"\"\n    block_color = -1\n    block_start = -1\n    block_end = -1\n    in_block = False\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid_1d):\n        # Check if the pixel is the start of a potential block\n        if pixel != 0 and pixel != 5 and not in_block:\n            block_color = pixel\n            block_start = i\n            block_end = i # Initialize end index\n            in_block = True\n        # Check if we are continuing the block\n        elif in_block and pixel == block_color:\n            block_end = i # Update end index\n        # Check if we just exited the block\n        elif in_block and pixel != block_color:\n            break # Block ended\n            \n    if block_start != -1:\n        return block_color, block_start, block_end\n    else:\n        # Should not happen based on task description, but handle gracefully\n        return None, -1, -1\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Shifts a color block rightwards to be adjacent to a stationary gray pixel.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier processing\n    # Assuming input_grid is a single list representing the row\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    grid_width = len(input_np)\n\n    # Initialize output grid with white (0)\n    output_np = np.zeros(grid_width, dtype=int)\n\n    # Find the gray pixel's index\n    gray_idx = find_pixel_index(input_np, 5)\n    if gray_idx == -1:\n        # Handle error: Gray pixel not found (shouldn't happen per examples)\n        return input_grid # Or raise an error\n\n    # Find the color block details\n    block_color, block_start, block_end = find_color_block(input_np)\n    if block_color is None:\n        # Handle error: Color block not found (shouldn't happen per examples)\n        # If no block, maybe just return the grid with only the gray pixel?\n        # For now, just place gray and return zeros elsewhere\n        output_np[gray_idx] = 5\n        return output_np.tolist() # Convert back to list format if needed\n\n    # Count the number of white pixels between the block and the gray pixel\n    separation_count = 0\n    if block_end < gray_idx -1: # Check if there's space between them\n       for i in range(block_end + 1, gray_idx):\n           if input_np[i] == 0:\n               separation_count += 1\n\n    # Calculate the new starting position for the block\n    new_block_start = block_start + separation_count\n    block_length = block_end - block_start + 1\n\n    # Place the gray pixel in the output\n    output_np[gray_idx] = 5\n\n    # Place the color block in the output at its new position\n    # Ensure the block doesn't overwrite the gray pixel or go out of bounds\n    # (Though the logic implies it ends right before the gray pixel)\n    new_block_end = new_block_start + block_length -1\n    if new_block_end < gray_idx: # Check if new position is valid\n        output_np[new_block_start : new_block_start + block_length] = block_color\n    else:\n        # Handle potential collision or unexpected state if logic is flawed\n        # For now, assume the logic holds and this else won't be needed\n        # Based on examples, block should end exactly at gray_idx - 1\n        output_np[new_block_start : new_block_start + block_length] = block_color\n\n\n    # Convert numpy array back to list for the final output\n    return output_np.tolist()\n```"
