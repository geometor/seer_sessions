Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (a single row). The width varies but seems consistent within a single example pair (input and output have the same dimensions).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain white (0), gray (5), and one other primary color (green=3, red=2, blue=1) per example.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white, non-gray color.
    *   There is always a single gray pixel (5).
    *   The remaining pixels are white (0).
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The position of the gray pixel remains unchanged between the input and output.
    *   The contiguous block of color shifts horizontally to the right.
    *   The amount of the shift appears related to the number of white pixels initially separating the colored block and the gray pixel. Specifically, the block shifts right by exactly the number of white pixels that were between its right edge and the gray pixel in the input.
    *   The white pixels that were originally between the colored block and the gray pixel effectively end up to the left of the shifted block in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
GridProperties:
  Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  Homogeneity: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
Objects:
  - Type: ColorBlock
    Attributes:
      - Color: Variable (non-white, non-gray)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal line
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
  - Type: AnchorPixel
    Attributes:
      - Color: Gray (5)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
  - Type: Background
    Attributes:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Role: Fills remaining space, acts as separator
Relationships:
  - Type: Spatial
    Object1: ColorBlock
    Object2: AnchorPixel
    Relation: ColorBlock is always to the left of AnchorPixel in the input.
    Separation: Defined by the count of white pixels between the rightmost pixel of ColorBlock and the AnchorPixel.
Actions:
  - Identify AnchorPixel: Locate the single gray pixel.
  - Identify ColorBlock: Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-gray color (start and end indices).
  - Count Separation: Determine the number (N) of white pixels between ColorBlock and AnchorPixel.
  - Shift ColorBlock: Move the ColorBlock N positions to the right.
TransformationRule:
  - The AnchorPixel (gray) position is invariant.
  - The ColorBlock moves rightwards until it is adjacent to the AnchorPixel.
  - The number of white pixels originally separating the ColorBlock and AnchorPixel determines the shift distance.
  - White pixels to the left of the original ColorBlock remain in place relative to the left grid edge.
  - White pixels originally between the ColorBlock and AnchorPixel are effectively moved to occupy the space vacated by the ColorBlock's original position.
  - Any pixels to the right of the AnchorPixel (if any) remain in place relative to the AnchorPixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Locate the index (column position) of the single gray pixel (value 5). This position will remain unchanged in the output.
3.  Locate the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor gray (5). Record its color, its starting index, and its ending index.
4.  Count the number of white pixels (`N`) situated strictly between the ending index of the colored block and the index of the gray pixel.
5.  Create a new grid for the output, initially filled with white pixels and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  Place the gray pixel (value 5) in the output grid at the same index it occupied in the input grid.
7.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block by adding `N` to its original starting index.
8.  Place the colored block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the newly calculated starting index.
9.  Fill any remaining positions in the output grid that were to the left of the *original* starting position of the colored block with white pixels. (This step is implicitly handled by starting with a white grid and drawing the objects, but clarifies the final state).
10. Ensure any pixels that were to the right of the gray pixel in the input are also placed at their corresponding positions in the output grid (relative to the gray pixel). (Again, often implicitly handled if those pixels were white, but good to state for completeness).

**General Assessment**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: a colored block shifts rightward to become adjacent to a stationary gray pixel, with the shift distance determined by the number of white pixels initially separating them. However, the implementation failed because it treated the input as a 1D list (`[... ]`) instead of a 2D grid (a list containing one row: `[[...]]`). The traceback indicates a numpy error arising from this dimensional mismatch when applying boolean logic or indexing intended for 1D arrays to the actual 2D structure or derived multi-element results.

The strategy is to adapt the logic and implementation to correctly handle the 2D grid structure, specifically by operating on the single row contained within the input grid.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
GridProperties:
  InputDimensionality: 2D (List[List[int]])
  OutputDimensionality: 2D (List[List[int]])
  EffectiveDimensionality: 1D (Operation occurs on the single row within the grid)
  Homogeneity: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions (height=1, width varies per task but consistent within example).
Objects:
  - Type: ColorBlock
    Location: Within the first (only) row.
    Attributes:
      - Color: Variable (non-white (0), non-gray (5))
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal line
      - Count: Exactly one per grid row.
      - Properties: Start Index, End Index, Length, Color Value.
  - Type: AnchorPixel
    Location: Within the first (only) row.
    Attributes:
      - Color: Gray (5)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Count: Exactly one per grid row.
      - Properties: Index (Column Position).
  - Type: BackgroundPixel
    Location: Within the first (only) row.
    Attributes:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Role: Fills remaining space, acts as a separator between ColorBlock and AnchorPixel.
Relationships:
  - Type: Spatial (Input)
    Scope: Within the first (only) row.
    Object1: ColorBlock
    Object2: AnchorPixel
    Relation: ColorBlock is always to the left of AnchorPixel.
    Separation: Defined by the count of white (0) pixels between the rightmost pixel of ColorBlock (End Index) and the AnchorPixel (Index). Let this count be N.
Actions:
  - Input: Read the 2D input grid.
  - IdentifyRow: Select the first (and only) row for processing.
  - LocateAnchor: Find the column index of the gray (5) pixel in the row.
  - LocateBlock: Find the start index, end index, and color of the contiguous block of non-white, non-gray color in the row.
  - CountSeparation: Count the number (N) of white (0) pixels strictly between the block's end index and the anchor's index.
  - CreateOutputGrid: Initialize a new 2D grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0) pixels.
  - PlaceAnchor: Place the gray (5) pixel in the first row of the output grid at its original column index.
  - CalculateNewBlockPosition: Determine the new start index for the ColorBlock by adding N to its original start index.
  - PlaceBlock: Place the ColorBlock (using its original color and length) into the first row of the output grid, starting at the new calculated start index.
  - Output: Return the modified 2D grid.
TransformationRule:
  - Focus on the single row within the 2D grid.
  - The position of the AnchorPixel (gray, 5) remains invariant between the input row and the output row.
  - The ColorBlock moves rightwards within the row.
  - The distance of the rightward shift is equal to the number of white (0) pixels initially located between the right edge of the ColorBlock and the AnchorPixel.
  - As a result of the shift, the ColorBlock becomes immediately adjacent to the left of the AnchorPixel in the output row.
  - All other positions in the output row are filled with white (0) pixels.
  - The final result is presented as a 2D grid containing this single modified row.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a 2D array (list of lists) containing exactly one row.
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid for processing. Let its width be `W`.
3.  Identify the column index (`anchor_col`) of the single gray pixel (value 5) within this row.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels within the row whose color is not white (0) and not gray (5). Record its color (`block_color`), its starting column index (`block_start_col`), and its ending column index (`block_end_col`).
5.  Count the number of white pixels (`N`) located in the columns strictly between `block_end_col + 1` and `anchor_col - 1`.
6.  Create a new row of width `W`, initially filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).
7.  Place the gray pixel (value 5) into the new row at column index `anchor_col`.
8.  Calculate the new starting column index for the colored block: `new_block_start_col = block_start_col + N`.
9.  Calculate the length of the colored block: `block_length = block_end_col - block_start_col + 1`.
10. Place the colored block into the new row: set the pixels from column `new_block_start_col` to `new_block_start_col + block_length - 1` to `block_color`.
11. Create the final output grid as a 2D array (list of lists) containing only the newly created row.
12. Return the output grid.
