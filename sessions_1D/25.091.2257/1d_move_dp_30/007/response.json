Identifies a single contiguous block of a primary color (non-white 0, non-gray 5) and a single gray (5) pixel within the single row.\n2. Determines the number of white (0) pixels separating the right edge of the primary color block from the gray pixel.\n3. Creates an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with white (0).\n4. Places the gray (5) pixel in the output grid at its original position (invariant).\n5. Shifts the primary color block to the right by the calculated number of separating white pixels, placing it in the output grid immediately adjacent to the left of the gray pixel. All other positions remain white (0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Helper Functions ---\n\ndef find_pixel_index_in_row(row_1d, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the first occurrence of a specific color in a 1D numpy array.\"\"\"\n    indices = np.where(row_1d == color)[0]\n    if len(indices) > 0:\n        # Assuming only one gray pixel exists per task description\n        return indices[0]\n    return -1 # Not found\n\ndef find_color_block_in_row(row_1d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the contiguous block of non-white (0), non-gray (5) color in a 1D numpy array.\n    Returns the block's color, start index, and end index.\n    Returns (None, -1, -1) if no such block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_color = -1\n    block_start = -1\n    block_end = -1\n    in_block = False\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(row_1d):\n        # Check if the pixel is the start of a potential block\n        is_primary_color = pixel != 0 and pixel != 5\n        if is_primary_color and not in_block:\n            block_color = pixel\n            block_start = i\n            block_end = i # Initialize end index\n            in_block = True\n        # Check if we are continuing the block\n        elif in_block and pixel == block_color:\n            block_end = i # Update end index\n        # Check if we just exited the block\n        elif in_block and pixel != block_color:\n            break # Block ended\n\n    if block_start != -1:\n        return block_color, block_start, block_end\n    else:\n        return None, -1, -1\n\ndef count_white_separation(row_1d, block_end_idx, gray_idx):\n    \"\"\"Counts white (0) pixels strictly between the block end and the gray pixel.\"\"\"\n    separation_count = 0\n    # Ensure there's space between block and gray, and indices are valid\n    if block_end_idx != -1 and gray_idx != -1 and block_end_idx < gray_idx - 1:\n       # Iterate through the pixels strictly between the block end index + 1 and gray index\n       for i in range(block_end_idx + 1, gray_idx):\n           if row_1d[i] == 0:\n               separation_count += 1\n    return separation_count\n\n# --- Main Transformation Function ---\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Input Processing ---\n    # Expecting a 1xN grid (list of one list)\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or len(input_grid) != 1 or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):\n        print(\"Warning: Unexpected input format.
