Each input grid contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel, one contiguous block of another color (yellow '4' or green '3' in the examples), and the remaining pixels are white (0). The transformation involves moving the colored block horizontally. The maroon pixel acts as a fixed anchor or target. The colored block slides rightwards until its rightmost edge is immediately adjacent to the left side of the maroon pixel. The original position of the colored block is filled with white pixels, and essentially, a new grid is constructed with the maroon pixel in its original place, the colored block shifted next to it, and everything else white.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
