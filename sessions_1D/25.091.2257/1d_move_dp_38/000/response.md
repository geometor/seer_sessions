*   **Perception:**
    The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel, one contiguous block of another color (yellow '4' or green '3' in the examples), and the remaining pixels are white (0). The transformation involves moving the colored block horizontally. The maroon pixel acts as a fixed anchor or target. The colored block slides rightwards until its rightmost edge is immediately adjacent to the left side of the maroon pixel. The original position of the colored block is filled with white pixels, and essentially, a new grid is constructed with the maroon pixel in its original place, the colored block shifted next to it, and everything else white.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_manipulation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # effectively 1xN grids
    objects:
      - type: anchor_pixel
        color: maroon (9)
        count: 1
        properties:
          - position: fixed_index # its index remains constant between input and output
      - type: movable_block
        color: variable (non-white, non-maroon; e.g., yellow(4), green(3))
        count: 1
        properties:
          - contiguity: horizontal
          - length: variable
          - initial_position: variable_index
          - final_position: calculated_index
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        properties:
          - fills_remaining_space
    actions:
      - identify: locate the anchor_pixel (maroon 9) and record its index.
      - identify: locate the contiguous movable_block, record its color, length, and starting index.
      - calculate: determine the target starting index for the movable_block in the output.
          target_start_index = (anchor_pixel_index - block_length)
      - construct: create a new grid of the same size as the input, initially filled with the background color (white 0).
      - place: put the anchor_pixel (maroon 9) at its original index in the new grid.
      - place: put the movable_block (using its identified color and length) into the new grid starting at the calculated target_start_index.
    relationships:
      - final_state: The rightmost pixel of the movable_block is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the anchor_pixel.
        (movable_block_end_index == anchor_pixel_index - 1)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white (0) pixels.
    2.  Find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel within the input grid.
    3.  Place a maroon (9) pixel at this same index in the output grid.
    4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Note the color of this block and its length (number of pixels).
    5.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output grid by subtracting the block's length from the index of the maroon (9) pixel found in step 2.
    6.  Place the identified colored block into the output grid, starting at the calculated target starting index and extending for its noted length, using its identified color.
    7.  Return the constructed output grid.
