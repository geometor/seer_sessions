task_type: array_manipulation
input_output_type: 1D numpy array of integers (pixels)
components:
  - type: marker_pixel
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      role: partition_point
      occurrence: typically one instance per array
  - type: pre_marker_segment
    description: The subarray of pixels preceding the green marker.
    contains:
      - type: white_pixels
        properties:
          color: white (0)
      - type: non_white_pixels
        properties:
          color: any color except white (1-9)
          relative_order: preserved among themselves
  - type: post_marker_segment
    description: The subarray of pixels following the green marker.
    properties:
      content_and_order: unchanged
actions:
  - action: find_index
    target: green marker pixel (3)
    using: numpy.where
  - action: partition_array
    target: input array
    based_on: index of the green marker
    outputs:
      - pre_marker_segment
      - marker_pixel (value 3)
      - post_marker_segment
  - action: filter_and_collect
    target: pre_marker_segment
    condition_1: pixel value is white (0)
    condition_2: pixel value is non-white (!= 0)
    using: numpy boolean indexing
    outputs:
      - array_of_white_pixels
      - array_of_non_white_pixels (maintaining relative order)
  - action: concatenate_arrays
    inputs:
      - array_of_white_pixels
      - array_of_non_white_pixels
      - marker_pixel (as a single-element array or list)
      - post_marker_segment
    using: numpy.concatenate
    output: final output array
relationships:
  - type: positional_separation
    description: The green pixel divides the array into functionally distinct parts.
  - type: sorting_grouping
    description: Pixels in the pre-marker segment are grouped based on being white or non-white. White pixels are moved to the start of this segment.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: |-
      The relative order of non-white pixels within the pre-marker segment is preserved.
      The content and order of the post-marker segment are preserved.
