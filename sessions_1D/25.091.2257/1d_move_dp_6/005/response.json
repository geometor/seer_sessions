Locate the column index of the first occurrence of the green pixel (value 3) within the row. This marker acts as a separator.\n3. Partition the input grid row into three parts based on this column index:\n    *   `segment_before`: The sub-grid containing columns from the beginning up to (but not including) the marker's column.\n    *   `marker_pixel_value`: The single green pixel value (3) at the marker's column index.\n    *   `segment_after`: The sub-grid containing columns from the one after the marker's column to the end of the row.\n4. Process the `segment_before`:\n    *   Extract all white pixels (value 0) into a new 1D array.\n    *   Extract all non-white pixels (values 1-9) into another new 1D array, ensuring their original relative order is maintained.\n5. Construct the final output grid by horizontally concatenating (along axis 1) the following components, ensuring each is a 2D array with 1 row:\n    *   The 1D array of white pixels, reshaped to (1, number_of_white_pixels).\n    *   The 1D array of non-white pixels, reshaped to (1, number_of_non_white_pixels).\n    *   The `marker_pixel_value`, reshaped to (1, 1).\n    *   The `segment_after` sub-grid (which is already 1xM).\n6.
