Transformation Rule:
1. Locate the green pixel (color 3) which acts as a separator.
2. Separate the input sequence into three parts: the subsequence before the green pixel, the green pixel itself, and the subsequence after the green pixel.
3. For the subsequence before the green pixel:
    a. Collect all white pixels (color 0).
    b. Collect all non-white pixels (colors 1-9), preserving their relative order.
4. Construct the output sequence by concatenating:
    a. The collected white pixels.
    b. The collected non-white pixels.
    c. The green pixel (3).
    d. The subsequence that originally came after the green pixel.
