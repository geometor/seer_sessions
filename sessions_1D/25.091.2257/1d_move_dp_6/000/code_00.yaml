task_type: sequence_manipulation
components:
  - type: sequence
    description: A 1D array of pixels.
  - type: marker_pixel
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      role: separator
  - type: subsequence_before_marker
    description: All pixels preceding the green (3) marker.
    contains:
      - type: white_pixels
        properties:
          color: white (0)
          count: variable
      - type: non_white_pixels
        properties:
          color: any color except white (1-9)
          count: variable
          relative_order: preserved among non-white pixels
  - type: subsequence_after_marker
    description: All pixels following the green (3) marker (inclusive of the marker itself in some interpretations, exclusive in others, but kept together with the marker).
    properties:
      position: unchanged relative to the end of the sequence.
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: green (3) marker pixel
  - action: partition
    target: input sequence
    based_on: position relative to the green marker (before, marker, after)
  - action: separate_and_collect
    target: subsequence_before_marker
    outputs:
      - collection_1: all white pixels
      - collection_2: all non-white pixels (maintaining relative order)
  - action: concatenate
    inputs:
      - collection_1 (white pixels)
      - collection_2 (non-white pixels)
      - green (3) marker
      - subsequence_after_marker (excluding the marker)
    output: final output sequence
relationships:
  - type: positional
    description: The green pixel divides the sequence into parts.
  - type: grouping
    description: Pixels before the marker are grouped by color type (white vs. non-white) in the output.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: Relative order of non-white pixels before the marker is kept. Content and position of elements including and after the marker are kept.
