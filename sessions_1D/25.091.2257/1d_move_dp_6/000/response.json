This green pixel seems to act as a separator or pivot point.\n3.  **Transformation Area:** The transformation primarily affects the pixels *before* the green (3) pixel. The pixels *after* the green pixel (if any) appear unchanged in the output, maintaining their position relative to the green pixel.\n4.  **Pixel Rearrangement:** Before the green pixel, there's a rearrangement. In the input, white (0) pixels and non-white pixels (e.g., red '2', gray '5', azure '8') are intermixed or grouped. In the output, all the white (0) pixels from that section are grouped together at the beginning, followed by all the non-white pixels from that section.\n5.  **Conservation:** The total count of each color *before* the green pixel remains the same between input and output. The relative order of the non-white pixels among themselves is also preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
