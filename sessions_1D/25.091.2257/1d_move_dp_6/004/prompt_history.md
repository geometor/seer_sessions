Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The examples present 1D sequences (or 1xN grids) of colored pixels.
2.  **Key Marker:** A green (3) pixel appears in each sequence, often near the right end. This green pixel seems to act as a separator or pivot point.
3.  **Transformation Area:** The transformation primarily affects the pixels *before* the green (3) pixel. The pixels *after* the green pixel (if any) appear unchanged in the output, maintaining their position relative to the green pixel.
4.  **Pixel Rearrangement:** Before the green pixel, there's a rearrangement. In the input, white (0) pixels and non-white pixels (e.g., red '2', gray '5', azure '8') are intermixed or grouped. In the output, all the white (0) pixels from that section are grouped together at the beginning, followed by all the non-white pixels from that section.
5.  **Conservation:** The total count of each color *before* the green pixel remains the same between input and output. The relative order of the non-white pixels among themselves is also preserved.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the green pixel (color 3) in the input sequence.
2.  Separate the input sequence into three parts: the subsequence *before* the green pixel, the green pixel itself, and the subsequence *after* the green pixel.
3.  Take the subsequence *before* the green pixel.
4.  Create a new empty sequence for the rearranged part.
5.  Iterate through the subsequence identified in step 3. Append all white pixels (color 0) encountered to the new sequence.
6.  Iterate through the subsequence identified in step 3 again. Append all non-white pixels (colors 1-9) encountered to the new sequence, maintaining their original relative order.
7.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating: the rearranged sequence (from steps 4-6), the green pixel, and the subsequence *after* the green pixel.
