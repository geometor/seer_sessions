**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: locating a green marker pixel (3), splitting the sequence based on this marker, and rearranging the segment *before* the marker by moving all white pixels (0) to the front while preserving the relative order of other colors. The error occurred because the code assumed 1D arrays based on the textual representation, while ARC uses 2D grids (even for single rows/columns). The `np.concatenate` function failed due to mixing arrays of different dimensions (implicitly 1D results from boolean indexing being combined with 2D slices or potentially empty arrays).

The strategy is to adapt the code to handle 2D NumPy arrays explicitly, ensuring all slicing, indexing, and concatenation operations are performed correctly along the appropriate axis (axis 1 for columns in this 1xN grid case).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 2D grid, which consists of a single row (1xN shape).
2.  Locate the column index of the first occurrence of the green pixel (value 3) within the row.
3.  Partition the input grid row into three parts based on this column index:
    *   `segment_before`: The sub-grid containing columns from the beginning up to (but not including) the marker's column.
    *   `marker_pixel`: The single green pixel (value 3) at the marker's column index.
    *   `segment_after`: The sub-grid containing columns from the one after the marker's column to the end of the row.
4.  Process the `segment_before`:
    *   Extract all white pixels (value 0) into a new sequence.
    *   Extract all non-white pixels (values 1-9) into another new sequence, ensuring their original relative order is maintained.
5.  Construct the final output grid row by concatenating horizontally (along axis 1) the following components in order:
    *   The sequence of white pixels extracted in step 4.
    *   The sequence of non-white pixels extracted in step 4.
    *   The `marker_pixel` (value 3).
    *   The `segment_after`.
6.  Ensure the output is a 2D grid with the same number of rows (1) and columns (N) as the input.
