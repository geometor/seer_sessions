task_type: grid_manipulation_1d_row
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  shape: 1 row, variable columns (N)
components:
  - type: grid_segment
    description: The entire input grid (1xN).
  - type: marker_pixel
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      location: Within the grid row, variable column index.
      role: separator
  - type: subsequence_before_marker
    description: All pixels in the row preceding the green (3) marker column.
    contains:
      - type: white_pixels
        properties:
          color: white (0)
          count: variable
      - type: non_white_pixels
        properties:
          color: any color except white (1-9)
          count: variable
          relative_order: preserved among non-white pixels
  - type: subsequence_after_marker
    description: All pixels in the row following the green (3) marker column.
    properties:
      content: unchanged
      position: maintained relative to the marker and end of the row.
actions:
  - action: locate_column
    target: first green (3) marker pixel in the row
    output: column_index
  - action: partition_row
    target: input grid row
    based_on: column_index of the green marker
    outputs:
      - segment_before: grid columns from 0 to marker_index-1
      - marker_pixel_value: grid value at marker_index
      - segment_after: grid columns from marker_index+1 to end
  - action: separate_and_collect
    target: segment_before
    outputs:
      - collection_1: all white pixels (0) from the segment
      - collection_2: all non-white pixels (1-9) from the segment (maintaining relative order)
  - action: concatenate_horizontal
    axis: 1 (columns)
    inputs:
      - collection_1 (as 1xK array)
      - collection_2 (as 1xL array)
      - marker_pixel_value (as 1x1 array)
      - segment_after (as 1xM array)
    output: final output grid (1xN)
relationships:
  - type: positional
    description: The green pixel's column index divides the grid row into parts.
  - type: grouping_and_sorting
    description: Pixels before the marker are grouped by color type (white vs. non-white) in the output, with white pixels coming first.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: Relative order of non-white pixels before the marker is kept. Content and position of elements including and after the marker are kept.
