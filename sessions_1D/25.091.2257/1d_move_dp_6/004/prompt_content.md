Transformation Rule:
1. Receive the input as a 1D NumPy array of pixel values.
2. Locate the index of the first occurrence of the green pixel (value 3) in the input array. This marker acts as a separator.
3. Partition the input array into three conceptual parts: the segment *before* the green pixel, the green pixel itself, and the segment *after* the green pixel.
4. Process the segment *before* the green pixel:
    a. Collect all white pixels (value 0) from this segment into a new array.
    b. Collect all non-white pixels (values 1-9) from this segment into another new array, preserving their original relative order.
5. Construct the final output array by concatenating the following NumPy arrays/elements in order:
    a. The array of collected white pixels.
    b. The array of collected non-white pixels.
    c. The green marker pixel (value 3).
    d. The segment originally *after* the green pixel.
6. Return the constructed output array.
