"""
Shift the first contiguous block of non-background (non-zero) pixels found before a magenta marker (color 6) rightwards, placing it immediately before the marker. The background pixels (color 0) originally located between this block and the marker are moved to fill the space vacated by the block at its original starting position. Pixels before the block's original start and after the marker remain in their relative positions. If no marker or no payload block before the marker is found, the input remains unchanged.
