task_description: "Shift the first contiguous block of non-background pixels found before a marker pixel rightwards, swapping its position with the contiguous block of background pixels immediately following it."
elements:

    identifier: prefix
    properties:
      - "Can be empty."

      - "Remains at the beginning of the output array."
  - type: object # Changed from 'object' to segment for consistency
    description: "The first contiguous block of pixels with colors other than white (0), located before the marker pixel."
    identifier: payload_block
    properties:
      - "Can be of various non-background colors."
      - "Can be of various lengths."
      - "Must exist before the marker for transformation to occur."
  - type: segment
    description: "A contiguous block of white (0) pixels located between the end of the payload_block and the marker pixel."
    identifier: gap_block
    properties:
      - "Can be of various lengths (including zero)."
      - "Contains only background pixels (0)."
  - type: segment

    identifier: suffix
    properties:
      - "Can be empty."
      - "Can contain any color."
