task_description: "Shift the first contiguous block of non-background pixels found before a magenta marker rightwards, placing it immediately before the marker. The background pixels originally between this block and the marker fill the space vacated by the block."
elements:
  - type: array
    description: "A 1D array of pixel colors representing the input and output grids."
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background
    description: "Represents empty space. Blocks of this color may be moved."
  - type: pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    role: marker/anchor
    description: "A single pixel acting as a fixed reference point for the transformation."
    properties:
      - "Appears exactly once in each array."
      - "Defines the right boundary for the payload block's final position."
      - "Its absolute position can change between examples, but relative position to suffix elements is maintained."
  - type: object
    identifier: payload_block
    description: "The first contiguous sequence of non-white (0), non-magenta (6) pixels encountered when scanning the input array from left to right, up to the marker pixel."
    properties:
      - "Identified by color != 0 and color != 6."
      - "Variable length and color."
      - "Is moved in the transformation."
      - "Exists entirely before the marker pixel in the input."
  - type: object
    identifier: gap_block
    description: "The contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels located between the end of the payload_block and the marker pixel in the input array."
    properties:
      - "Composed exclusively of white (0) pixels."
      - "Its length determines the distance the payload_block effectively shifts."
      - "Can be empty (length 0) if the payload_block is immediately before the marker."
      - "Is moved to the original starting position of the payload_block."
  - type: object
    identifier: prefix_block
    description: "The sequence of pixels from the start of the input array up to the beginning of the payload_block."
    properties:
      - "Can be empty."
      - "Remains at the beginning of the output array."
      - "Content is unchanged."
  - type: object
    identifier: suffix_block
    description: "The sequence of pixels from the position immediately after the marker pixel to the end of the input array."
    properties:
      - "Can be empty."
      - "Remains at the end of the output array (after the marker)."
      - "Content is unchanged."
