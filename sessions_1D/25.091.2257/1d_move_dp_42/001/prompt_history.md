Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Data Structure:** The input and output data appear to be one-dimensional arrays or lists of integers, representing pixel colors.
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   White (0) seems to function as a background or empty space.
    *   Magenta (6) appears in every example and seems to be a fixed marker or anchor point. Its position relative to the end of the array seems consistent within each example pair (though its absolute index might differ if the array length changes).
    *   Other colors (Red=2, Orange=7, Blue=1) form contiguous blocks.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The central action is the movement of a contiguous block of non-white, non-magenta pixels. This block shifts rightwards.
4.  **Shift Target:** The block moves until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left side of the magenta (6) pixel.
5.  **Space Filling:** The space between the original position of the colored block and the magenta pixel, which initially contained white pixels (0), appears to be swapped with the colored block. Essentially, the colored block moves right, displacing the white pixels to its left.
6.  **Boundary Pixels:** Pixels to the left of the colored block's original position and pixels to the right of the magenta pixel (if any) seem to remain unchanged in their positions.

**YAML Facts:**

    identifier: "gap_block"
    properties:
      - "Its length determines the shift distance of the payload_block."

      - "Append payload_block_pixels."
      - "Append the magenta (6) pixel."
      - "Append pixels from input that were originally after the magenta pixel."

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input array of pixels.
2.  Locate the single magenta pixel (color 6) and note its index (`marker_index`).
3.  Scan the array from the beginning up to `marker_index` to find the contiguous sequence of pixels that are *not* white (color 0). This is the "payload block". Record the pixels in this block (`payload_pixels`), its starting index (`payload_start`), and its ending index (`payload_end`).
4.  Identify the sequence of white pixels (color 0) that exists in the input array between `payload_end + 1` and `marker_index - 1`. This is the "gap block". Record the pixels in this block (`gap_pixels`).
5.  Create a new output array.
6.  Copy the pixels from the input array from index 0 up to (but not including) `payload_start` into the output array.
7.  Append the `gap_pixels` to the output array.
8.  Append the `payload_pixels` to the output array.
9.  Append the magenta pixel (color 6) to the output array.
10. Copy any remaining pixels from the input array (from index `marker_index + 1` to the end) and append them to the output array.
11. Return the completed output array.
