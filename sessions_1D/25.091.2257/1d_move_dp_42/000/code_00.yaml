task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-background pixels rightwards until it touches a specific marker pixel."
elements:
  - type: array
    description: "A 1D array of pixel colors."
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background/empty_space
  - type: pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    role: marker/anchor
    properties:
      - "Appears once in each array."
      - "Acts as the target boundary for the shift operation."
      - "Its position relative to surrounding non-moving elements remains fixed."
  - type: object
    description: "A contiguous block of pixels with colors other than white (0) and magenta (6)."
    identifier: "payload_block"
    properties:
      - "Can be of various colors (red, orange, blue observed)."
      - "Can be of various lengths."
      - "Is the primary element being moved."
  - type: object
    description: "A contiguous block of white (0) pixels located between the payload_block and the magenta marker."
    identifier: "gap_block"
    properties:
      - "Its length determines the shift distance of the payload_block."
      - "It is moved to the original starting position of the payload_block."
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: magenta (6) pixel
    result: marker_index
  - action: identify
    target: payload_block
    result: payload_block_pixels, payload_start_index, payload_end_index
  - action: identify
    target: gap_block (white pixels between payload_end_index and marker_index)
    result: gap_block_pixels
  - action: rearrange
    description: "Construct the output array by reordering segments of the input array."
    steps:
      - "Take pixels from start of input up to payload_start_index."
      - "Append gap_block_pixels."
      - "Append payload_block_pixels."
      - "Append the magenta (6) pixel."
      - "Append pixels from input that were originally after the magenta pixel."
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The payload_block is initially separated from the magenta marker by the gap_block."
  - type: spatial
    description: "In the output, the payload_block is immediately adjacent to the left of the magenta marker."
  - type: positional_swap
    description: "The payload_block and the gap_block effectively swap their positions relative to the start of the array and the marker pixel."
