Its position relative to the end of the array seems consistent within each example pair (though its absolute index might differ if the array length changes).\n    *   Other colors (Red=2, Orange=7, Blue=1) form contiguous blocks.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The central action is the movement of a contiguous block of non-white, non-magenta pixels. This block shifts rightwards.\n4.  **Shift Target:** The block moves until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left side of the magenta (6) pixel.\n5.  **Space Filling:** The space between the original position of the colored block and the magenta pixel, which initially contained white pixels (0), appears to be swapped with the colored block. Essentially, the colored block moves right, displacing the white pixels to its left.\n6.  **Boundary Pixels:** Pixels to the left of the colored block's original position and pixels to the right of the magenta pixel (if any) seem to remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
