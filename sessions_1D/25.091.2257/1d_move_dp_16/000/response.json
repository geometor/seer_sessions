Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color (red or gray) and a single maroon pixel, with the rest being white pixels. The output grid shows the same non-white block and the maroon pixel, but the position of the non-white block has changed. The block appears to have moved horizontally to the right until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left side of the maroon pixel. The size and color of the block, the position of the maroon pixel, and the overall grid dimensions remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
