            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core pattern: swapping a contiguous block of non-white pixels (BlockA) with an immediately following contiguous block of white pixels (BlockB), located just before a maroon (9) separator pixel. The error messages (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...\") strongly indicate a type mismatch between the expected input format (List of Lists) and the actual input format provided by the ARC framework, which uses NumPy arrays.\n\nThe strategy is to adjust the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs while preserving the identified transformation logic. This involves modifying the input validation and sequence extraction steps to work with NumPy arrays and ensuring subsequent operations are compatible. The fundamental logic of identifying BlockA, BlockB, the Separator, and performing the swap remains unchanged.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze the structure assuming NumPy inputs.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `np.array([[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))\n    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))\n    *   BlockA: `[7, 7, 7]` (Color: orange, Length: 3, Indices: 0-2)\n    *   BlockB: `[0, 0, 0]` (Color: white, Length: 3, Indices: 3-5)\n    *   Separator: `9` (Index: 6)\n    *   Prefix: Empty\n    *   Suffix: `[9]`\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `np.array([[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]])` (Shape: (1, 7))\n    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]])` (Shape: (1, 7))\n    *   BlockA: `[3, 3, 3]` (Color: green, Length: 3, Indices: 0-2)\n    *   BlockB: `[0, 0]` (Color: white, Length: 2, Indices: 3-4)\n    *   Separator: `9` (Index: 5)\n    *   Prefix: Empty\n    *   Suffix: `[9, 0]`\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `np.array([[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))\n    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))\n    *   BlockA: `[8, 8, 8]` (Color: azure, Length: 3, Indices: 0-2)\n    *   BlockB: `[0, 0, 0]` (Color: white, Length: 3, Indices: 3-5)\n    *   Separator: `9` (Index: 6)\n    *   Prefix: Empty\n    *   Suffix: `[9]`\n\nThe pattern holds consistently across examples. The primary issue was technical (input type handling) rather than logical.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
