**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core pattern: swapping a contiguous block of non-white pixels (BlockA) with an immediately following contiguous block of white pixels (BlockB), located just before a maroon (9) separator pixel. The error messages ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly indicate a type mismatch between the expected input format (List of Lists) and the actual input format provided by the ARC framework, which uses NumPy arrays.

The strategy is to adjust the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs while preserving the identified transformation logic. This involves modifying the input validation and sequence extraction steps to work with NumPy arrays and ensuring subsequent operations are compatible. The fundamental logic of identifying BlockA, BlockB, the Separator, and performing the swap remains unchanged.

**Metrics:**

Let's analyze the structure assuming NumPy inputs.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `np.array([[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   BlockA: `[7, 7, 7]` (Color: orange, Length: 3, Indices: 0-2)
    *   BlockB: `[0, 0, 0]` (Color: white, Length: 3, Indices: 3-5)
    *   Separator: `9` (Index: 6)
    *   Prefix: Empty
    *   Suffix: `[9]`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `np.array([[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   BlockA: `[3, 3, 3]` (Color: green, Length: 3, Indices: 0-2)
    *   BlockB: `[0, 0]` (Color: white, Length: 2, Indices: 3-4)
    *   Separator: `9` (Index: 5)
    *   Prefix: Empty
    *   Suffix: `[9, 0]`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `np.array([[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   BlockA: `[8, 8, 8]` (Color: azure, Length: 3, Indices: 0-2)
    *   BlockB: `[0, 0, 0]` (Color: white, Length: 3, Indices: 3-5)
    *   Separator: `9` (Index: 6)
    *   Prefix: Empty
    *   Suffix: `[9]`

The pattern holds consistently across examples. The primary issue was technical (input type handling) rather than logical.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input is technically 2D (1xN), but functionally 1D sequence.
input_format: numpy.ndarray (shape: 1xN)
output_format: numpy.ndarray (shape: 1xN)
color_palette: [white(0), green(3), orange(7), azure(8), maroon(9)] # Colors observed in examples
objects:
  - type: block
    description: The first contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels in the input row. Denoted as BlockA.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (orange, green, azure in examples)
      - length: Varies (3 in examples)
      - position: Starts at index 0 in examples.
  - type: block
    description: The contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels immediately following BlockA. Denoted as BlockB.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: Varies (2 or 3 in examples)
      - position: Immediately follows BlockA.
  - type: separator
    description: A single maroon (9) pixel.
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - position: Immediately follows BlockB.
  - type: prefix
    description: Sequence of pixels preceding BlockA.
    properties:
      - content: Empty in all examples.
  - type: suffix
    description: Sequence of pixels including and following the Separator.
    properties:
      - content: Contains the Separator and any subsequent pixels. Can be just the Separator or include other pixels (e.g., white(0) in Example 2).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: BlockA is immediately followed by BlockB.
  - type: adjacency
    description: BlockB is immediately followed by the Separator.
action:
  - type: swap
    description: The positions of BlockA and BlockB are swapped relative to each other.
    operands: [BlockA, BlockB]
  - type: concatenation
    description: The output sequence is constructed by concatenating Prefix, BlockB, BlockA, and Suffix in that order.
    operands: [Prefix, BlockB, BlockA, Suffix]
constraints:
  - The specific pattern (BlockA -> BlockB -> Separator) must exist for the transformation to occur. BlockA must be non-white, BlockB must be white, and the Separator must be maroon(9).
  - If the pattern is not found, the input is returned unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 1xN NumPy array. Extract the sequence of pixels from the first (and only) row.
2.  Identify the start and end indices of the first contiguous block of identical non-white pixels (`BlockA`). If none exists, return the original input.
3.  Check if the pixels immediately following `BlockA` form a contiguous block of white (0) pixels (`BlockB`). Identify its start and end indices. If not, return the original input.
4.  Check if the pixel immediately following `BlockB` is the maroon (9) separator pixel (`Separator`). If not, return the original input.
5.  Identify the sequence portion *before* `BlockA` (`Prefix`). (This is empty in the examples).
6.  Identify the sequence portion *including and after* the `Separator` (`Suffix`).
7.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating `Prefix`, `BlockB`, `BlockA`, and `Suffix` in that order.
8.  Format the resulting sequence as a 1xN NumPy array and return it.
