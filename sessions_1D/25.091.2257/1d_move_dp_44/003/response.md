```python
"""
Transforms an input 1xN sequence (represented as a list containing a single list of integers)
by identifying a specific adjacent pattern: a contiguous block of identical non-white pixels (BlockA),
immediately followed by a contiguous block of white (0) pixels (BlockB), immediately followed by
a maroon (9) pixel (Separator). If this pattern (BlockA -> BlockB -> Separator) is found,
the positions of BlockA and BlockB are swapped, while the portion of the sequence before BlockA (Prefix)
and the portion including and after the Separator (Suffix) remain in their relative positions.
If the pattern is not found, the original input sequence is returned unchanged.
