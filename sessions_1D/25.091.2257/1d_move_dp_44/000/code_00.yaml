task_type: sequence_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D
color_palette: [white(0), green(3), orange(7), azure(8), maroon(9)] # Colors observed in examples
objects:
  - type: block
    description: Contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels. Denoted as BlockA.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (orange, green, azure in examples)
      - position: Immediately precedes BlockB.
  - type: block
    description: Contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels. Denoted as BlockB.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - position: Immediately follows BlockA.
  - type: separator
    description: A single maroon (9) pixel.
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - position: Immediately follows BlockB.
  - type: remainder
    description: Sequence of pixels following the separator.
    properties:
      - position: Follows the separator.
      - content: Can be empty or contain other pixels.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: BlockA is immediately followed by BlockB.
  - type: adjacency
    description: BlockB is immediately followed by the Separator.
action:
  - type: swap
    description: The positions of BlockA and BlockB are swapped.
    operands: [BlockA, BlockB]
  - type: maintain_relative_position
    description: The Separator and Remainder maintain their positions relative to the end of the swapped blocks.
    operands: [Separator, Remainder]
constraints:
  - The swap operation occurs only on the portion of the sequence *before* the maroon (9) separator.
