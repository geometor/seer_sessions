The core pattern involves identifying two adjacent blocks of colors before a specific separator color (maroon, 9). One block consists of a repeated non-white color, and the other block consists of repeated white colors (0). These two blocks swap their positions in the output sequence, while the separator color (maroon, 9) and any subsequent colors remain in their relative positions after the swapped blocks.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
