**Perception:**

The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays). Each example shows a sequence of colors. The core pattern involves identifying two adjacent blocks of colors before a specific separator color (maroon, 9). One block consists of a repeated non-white color, and the other block consists of repeated white colors (0). These two blocks swap their positions in the output sequence, while the separator color (maroon, 9) and any subsequent colors remain in their relative positions after the swapped blocks.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D
color_palette: [white(0), green(3), orange(7), azure(8), maroon(9)] # Colors observed in examples
objects:
  - type: block
    description: Contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels. Denoted as BlockA.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (orange, green, azure in examples)
      - position: Immediately precedes BlockB.
  - type: block
    description: Contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels. Denoted as BlockB.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - position: Immediately follows BlockA.
  - type: separator
    description: A single maroon (9) pixel.
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - position: Immediately follows BlockB.
  - type: remainder
    description: Sequence of pixels following the separator.
    properties:
      - position: Follows the separator.
      - content: Can be empty or contain other pixels.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: BlockA is immediately followed by BlockB.
  - type: adjacency
    description: BlockB is immediately followed by the Separator.
action:
  - type: swap
    description: The positions of BlockA and BlockB are swapped.
    operands: [BlockA, BlockB]
  - type: maintain_relative_position
    description: The Separator and Remainder maintain their positions relative to the end of the swapped blocks.
    operands: [Separator, Remainder]
constraints:
  - The swap operation occurs only on the portion of the sequence *before* the maroon (9) separator.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the first contiguous block of identical non-white pixels (`BlockA`) in the input sequence.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of white (0) pixels (`BlockB`) that immediately follows `BlockA`.
3.  Identify the index of the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel (`Separator`). This marks the end of the section to be modified.
4.  Construct the output sequence by first placing `BlockB`, followed immediately by `BlockA`.
5.  Append the rest of the original input sequence starting from the maroon (9) pixel (`Separator`) to the end.
