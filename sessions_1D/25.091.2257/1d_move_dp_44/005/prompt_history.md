**Perception:**

The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays). Each example shows a sequence of colors. The core pattern involves identifying two adjacent blocks of colors before a specific separator color (maroon, 9). One block consists of a repeated non-white color, and the other block consists of repeated white colors (0). These two blocks swap their positions in the output sequence, while the separator color (maroon, 9) and any subsequent colors remain in their relative positions after the swapped blocks.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core pattern: swapping a contiguous block of non-white pixels (BlockA) with an immediately following contiguous block of white pixels (BlockB), located just before a maroon (9) separator pixel. The error messages ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly indicate a type mismatch between the expected input format (List of Lists) and the actual input format provided by the ARC framework, which uses NumPy arrays.

The strategy is to adjust the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs while preserving the identified transformation logic. This involves modifying the input validation and sequence extraction steps to work with NumPy arrays and ensuring subsequent operations are compatible. The fundamental logic of identifying BlockA, BlockB, the Separator, and performing the swap remains unchanged.

**Metrics:**

Let's analyze the structure assuming NumPy inputs.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `np.array([[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   BlockA: `[7, 7, 7]` (Color: orange, Length: 3, Indices: 0-2)
    *   BlockB: `[0, 0, 0]` (Color: white, Length: 3, Indices: 3-5)
    *   Separator: `9` (Index: 6)
    *   Prefix: Empty
    *   Suffix: `[9]`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `np.array([[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   BlockA: `[3, 3, 3]` (Color: green, Length: 3, Indices: 0-2)
    *   BlockB: `[0, 0]` (Color: white, Length: 2, Indices: 3-4)
    *   Separator: `9` (Index: 5)
    *   Prefix: Empty
    *   Suffix: `[9, 0]`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `np.array([[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9]])` (Shape: (1, 7))
    *   BlockA: `[8, 8, 8]` (Color: azure, Length: 3, Indices: 0-2)
    *   BlockB: `[0, 0, 0]` (Color: white, Length: 3, Indices: 3-5)
    *   Separator: `9` (Index: 6)
    *   Prefix: Empty
    *   Suffix: `[9]`

The pattern holds consistently across examples. The primary issue was technical (input type handling) rather than logical.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 1xN NumPy array. Extract the sequence of pixels from the first (and only) row.
2.  Identify the start and end indices of the first contiguous block of identical non-white pixels (`BlockA`). If none exists, return the original input.
3.  Check if the pixels immediately following `BlockA` form a contiguous block of white (0) pixels (`BlockB`). Identify its start and end indices. If not, return the original input.
4.  Check if the pixel immediately following `BlockB` is the maroon (9) separator pixel (`Separator`). If not, return the original input.
5.  Identify the sequence portion *before* `BlockA` (`Prefix`). (This is empty in the examples).
6.  Identify the sequence portion *including and after* the `Separator` (`Suffix`).
7.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating `Prefix`, `BlockB`, `BlockA`, and `Suffix` in that order.
8.  Format the resulting sequence as a 1xN NumPy array and return it.
