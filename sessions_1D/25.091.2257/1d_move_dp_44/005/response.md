"""
Transforms an input 1xN NumPy array by identifying a specific adjacent pattern:
the first contiguous block of identical non-white pixels (BlockA), immediately
followed by a contiguous block of white (0) pixels (BlockB), immediately followed
by a maroon (9) pixel (Separator). If this pattern (BlockA -> BlockB -> Separator)
is found, the positions of BlockA and BlockB are swapped, while the portion of
the sequence before BlockA (Prefix) and the portion including and after the
Separator (Suffix) remain in their relative positions. The output is returned as
a 1xN NumPy array. If the pattern is not found, the original input array is
returned unchanged.
