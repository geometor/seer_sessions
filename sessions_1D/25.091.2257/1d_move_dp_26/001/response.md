"""
Identify a contiguous horizontal block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels (the 'main block') and a single maroon (9) pixel (the 'marker') in the input grid (which is a single row).
Create an output grid of the same size, initially filled with white (0).
Shift the main block horizontally to the right so that its rightmost pixel is positioned immediately to the left of the marker pixel's original position.
Place the marker pixel in the output grid at its original position.
The color and length of the main block are preserved.
