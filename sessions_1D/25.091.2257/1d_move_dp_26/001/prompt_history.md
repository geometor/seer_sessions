Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1x30 grid (a single row).
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   White (0) acts as the background.
    *   A single contiguous block of a non-white, non-maroon color is present in each input (azure=8, orange=7, blue=1). I'll call this the "main block".
    *   A single maroon pixel (9) is present in each input.
3.  **Arrangement:** In the input grids, the main block always appears first (reading left to right), followed by some white pixels, and then the maroon pixel.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal shift of the main block to the right. The maroon pixel remains stationary.
5.  **Shift Determinant:** The final position of the main block in the output seems directly related to the position of the maroon pixel. Specifically, the rightmost pixel of the shifted main block ends up immediately to the left of the maroon pixel's position.
6.  **Properties Preservation:** The color and the length (number of pixels) of the main block remain unchanged during the transformation.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensions: Single row (1xN, where N=30 in examples).
  background_color: white (0)
  significant_pixels:
    - color: maroon (9), quantity: 1
    - color: any non-white, non-maroon color, forms a single contiguous block (main block)

input_elements:
  - object: main_block
    attributes:
      - color: [azure (8), orange (7), blue (1)]
      - shape: contiguous horizontal line
      - length: variable (15, 11, 8 in examples)
      - position: left part of the grid
  - object: marker_pixel
    attributes:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - shape: single pixel
      - position: right of the main_block, separated by white pixels

transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  target: main_block
  direction: right
  constraint: The rightmost pixel of the shifted main_block must be adjacent (left side) to the original position of the marker_pixel.
  preserved_properties:
    - main_block color
    - main_block length
    - marker_pixel position
    - background color (white) fills the space vacated by the main_block

output_elements:
  - object: main_block (shifted)
    attributes:
      - color: same as input main_block
      - shape: same as input main_block
      - length: same as input main_block
      - position: shifted right, ending immediately before the marker_pixel
  - object: marker_pixel
    attributes:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - position: same as input marker_pixel
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) or maroon (9). Record its color, start index, end index, and length.
2.  Identify the index of the single maroon pixel (9).
3.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Determine the target end index for the shifted block by subtracting 1 from the index of the maroon pixel.
5.  Determine the target start index for the shifted block by subtracting the block's length minus 1 from the target end index.
6.  Place the identified block (using its original color and length) into the new grid starting at the target start index and ending at the target end index.
7.  Place the maroon pixel (9) into the new grid at its original index.
8.  The resulting grid is the output.
