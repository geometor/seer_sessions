task_context:
  grid_dimensions: Single row (1xN, where N=30 in examples).
  background_color: white (0)
  significant_pixels:
    - color: maroon (9), quantity: 1
    - color: any non-white, non-maroon color, forms a single contiguous block (main block)

input_elements:
  - object: main_block
    attributes:
      - color: [azure (8), orange (7), blue (1)]
      - shape: contiguous horizontal line
      - length: variable (15, 11, 8 in examples)
      - position: left part of the grid
  - object: marker_pixel
    attributes:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - shape: single pixel
      - position: right of the main_block, separated by white pixels

transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  target: main_block
  direction: right
  constraint: The rightmost pixel of the shifted main_block must be adjacent (left side) to the original position of the marker_pixel.
  preserved_properties:
    - main_block color
    - main_block length
    - marker_pixel position
    - background color (white) fills the space vacated by the main_block

output_elements:
  - object: main_block (shifted)
    attributes:
      - color: same as input main_block
      - shape: same as input main_block
      - length: same as input main_block
      - position: shifted right, ending immediately before the marker_pixel
  - object: marker_pixel
    attributes:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - position: same as input marker_pixel
