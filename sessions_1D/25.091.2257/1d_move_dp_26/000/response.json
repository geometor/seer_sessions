I'll call this the \"main block\".\n    *   A single maroon pixel (9) is present in each input.\n3.  **Arrangement:** In the input grids, the main block always appears first (reading left to right), followed by some white pixels, and then the maroon pixel.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal shift of the main block to the right. The maroon pixel remains stationary.\n5.  **Shift Determinant:** The final position of the main block in the output seems directly related to the position of the maroon pixel. Specifically, the rightmost pixel of the shifted main block ends up immediately to the left of the maroon pixel's position.\n6.  **Properties Preservation:** The color and the length (number of pixels) of the main block remain unchanged during the transformation.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
