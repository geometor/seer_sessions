task_description: Rearrange segments of a 1D pixel row based on specific color patterns, assuming the input is a grid containing a single row.

components:
  - id: row
    description: The single row of pixels within the input grid that undergoes transformation.
  - id: main_colored_block
    description: The first contiguous sequence of identical pixels within the row with a color other than white (0) or orange (7).
  - id: intermediate_whites
    description: A contiguous sequence of only white (0) pixels located immediately after the 'main_colored_block' and immediately before the 'orange_marker'.
  - id: orange_marker
    description: A single orange (7) pixel that appears after the 'intermediate_whites'.
  - id: leading_whites
    description: Any white (0) pixels at the beginning of the input row, before the 'main_colored_block'.
  - id: trailing_elements
    description: Any pixels following the 'orange_marker' to the end of the row.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    subject: main_colored_block
    object: intermediate_whites
    details: 'intermediate_whites' immediately follows 'main_colored_block'.
  - type: adjacency
    subject: intermediate_whites
    object: orange_marker
    details: 'orange_marker' immediately follows 'intermediate_whites'.
  - type: order
    subject: [leading_whites, main_colored_block, intermediate_whites, orange_marker, trailing_elements]
    details: The sequence of components in the input row. Note that 'leading_whites' or 'trailing_elements' can be empty.

actions:
  - id: identify_segments
    description: Locate the indices defining 'leading_whites', 'main_colored_block', 'intermediate_whites', 'orange_marker', and 'trailing_elements' within the input row.
  - id: extract_segments
    description: Create distinct lists or references for each identified segment.
  - id: move_segment
    description: Designate the 'intermediate_whites' segment to be moved to the beginning of the output row.
  - id: reconstruct_row
    description: Assemble the output row by concatenating the segments in the following order - 'intermediate_whites', 'leading_whites', 'main_colored_block', 'orange_marker', 'trailing_elements'.
  - id: format_output
    description: Place the reconstructed row into a list to match the grid output format (list of lists).

properties:
  - component: intermediate_whites
    property: color
    value: All pixels must be white (0).
  - component: intermediate_whites
    property: count
    description: The number of pixels in the 'intermediate_whites' sequence. In the examples, this count is consistently 3, determining the number of leading whites in the output.
  - component: row
    property: length
    description: The total number of pixels in the row remains constant between input and output.
  - component: input_grid
    property: dimensions
    description: Assumed to contain exactly one row.
