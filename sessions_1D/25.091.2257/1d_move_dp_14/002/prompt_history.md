**Perception of the elements of the task**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The data consists of pairs of 1-dimensional grids (rows of pixels).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The relevant colors are white (0), magenta (6), green (3), gray (5), and orange (7).
3.  **Input Structure:** Each input row appears composed of several distinct segments:
    *   Optional leading white pixels (0).
    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-orange color (e.g., magenta, green, gray). Let's call this the "main colored block".
    *   A sequence of one or more white pixels (0).
    *   A single orange pixel (7).
    *   Optional trailing pixels (can be white or other colors, though only white is seen after orange in the examples).
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves rearranging the segments. Specifically, the sequence of white pixels located *between* the main colored block and the orange pixel is relocated to the very beginning of the row. The relative order of the main colored block, the orange pixel, and any subsequent pixels remains unchanged. The total length of the row remains constant.
5.  **Key Elements:** The main colored block, the sequence of white pixels immediately following it, and the subsequent orange pixel are the key elements driving the transformation. The number of white pixels in this intermediate sequence determines how many white pixels are added to the beginning of the output row. In all provided examples, this number is 3.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the main contiguous block of pixels having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not orange (7).
2.  Find the single orange (7) pixel that appears later in the sequence than the main colored block.
3.  Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels located strictly between the end of the main colored block and the position of the orange (7) pixel. Call this sequence the "intermediate whites".
4.  Extract the "intermediate whites" sequence from its original position.
5.  Construct the output row by concatenating the following segments in order:
    a.  The extracted "intermediate whites" sequence.
    b.  All pixels from the beginning of the original input row up to (but not including) the start of the main colored block (these are the original leading whites).
    c.  The main colored block itself.
    d.  The orange (7) pixel.
    e.  All pixels from the original input row that came *after* the orange (7) pixel.
