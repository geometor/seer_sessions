task_description: Rearrange segments of a 1D pixel row based on specific color patterns.

components:
  - id: row
    description: A 1-dimensional grid of pixels.
  - id: main_colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels with a color other than white (0) or orange (7).
  - id: intermediate_whites
    description: A contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels located immediately after the 'main_colored_block' and immediately before the 'orange_marker'.
  - id: orange_marker
    description: A single orange (7) pixel that appears after the 'intermediate_whites'.
  - id: leading_whites
    description: Any white (0) pixels at the beginning of the input row, before the 'main_colored_block'.
  - id: trailing_elements
    description: Any pixels following the 'orange_marker'.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    subject: main_colored_block
    object: intermediate_whites
    details: 'intermediate_whites' immediately follows 'main_colored_block'.
  - type: adjacency
    subject: intermediate_whites
    object: orange_marker
    details: 'orange_marker' immediately follows 'intermediate_whites'.

actions:
  - id: identify_segments
    description: Locate 'leading_whites', 'main_colored_block', 'intermediate_whites', 'orange_marker', and 'trailing_elements' within the input row.
  - id: move_segment
    description: Relocate the 'intermediate_whites' segment from its original position to the beginning of the row.
  - id: reconstruct_row
    description: Assemble the output row by concatenating the moved 'intermediate_whites', the original 'leading_whites', the 'main_colored_block', the 'orange_marker', and the 'trailing_elements' in that specific order.

properties:
  - component: intermediate_whites
    property: count
    description: The number of pixels in the 'intermediate_whites' sequence. In the examples, this count is consistently 3.
  - component: row
    property: length
    description: The total number of pixels in the row remains constant between input and output.
