Let's call this the \"main colored block\".\n    *   A sequence of one or more white pixels (0).\n    *   A single orange pixel (7).\n    *   Optional trailing pixels (can be white or other colors, though only white is seen after orange in the examples).\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves rearranging the segments. Specifically, the sequence of white pixels located *between* the main colored block and the orange pixel is relocated to the very beginning of the row. The relative order of the main colored block, the orange pixel, and any subsequent pixels remains unchanged. The total length of the row remains constant.\n5.  **Key Elements:** The main colored block, the sequence of white pixels immediately following it, and the subsequent orange pixel are the key elements driving the transformation. The number of white pixels in this intermediate sequence determines how many white pixels are added to the beginning of the output row. In all provided examples, this number is 3.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
