Let's call this the \"colored block\".\n*   Each example also contains a contiguous block of white (0) pixels immediately following the \"colored block\". Let's call this the \"white gap\".\n*   There are other pixels present:\n    *   Sometimes a white pixel at the very beginning (train_3).\n    *   Always a magenta (6) pixel somewhere after the \"white gap\".\n    *   Sometimes one or more white pixels after the magenta pixel.\n*   The core transformation seems to involve the \"colored block\" and the \"white gap\".\n*   In the output, the positions of the \"colored block\" and the \"white gap\" appear to be swapped relative to each other.\n*   Pixels preceding the \"colored block\" (if any) remain at the beginning.\n*   Pixels following the \"white gap\" (including the magenta pixel and any subsequent pixels) remain at the end, maintaining their relative order after the swapped blocks.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
