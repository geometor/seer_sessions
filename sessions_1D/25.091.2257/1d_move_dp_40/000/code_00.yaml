task_description: Swap the positions of a contiguous non-white block and the immediately following contiguous white block.

grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - colors_present: white (0), blue (1), green (3), magenta (6), azure (8)

objects:
  - name: initial_segment
    description: Optional sequence of pixels at the beginning of the row, preceding the movable_block. Can be empty or contain white pixels. (e.g., `[]` in train_1/2, `[0]` in train_3)
  - name: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (excluding magenta in these examples, but generally non-white seems key). (e.g., `[1]*17`, `[3]*16`, `[8]*12`)
    properties:
      - color: Varies (blue, green, azure)
      - location: Immediately follows initial_segment.
  - name: white_gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: Immediately follows movable_block.
  - name: final_segment
    description: Sequence of pixels following the white_gap, typically containing at least one magenta (6) pixel. (e.g., `[6, 0]`, `[6, 0, 0]`)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: movable_block is immediately followed by white_gap.
  - type: ordering
    description: The input order is initial_segment -> movable_block -> white_gap -> final_segment.

transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: movable_block, white_gap, initial_segment, final_segment
    description: Find these four segments based on their color and adjacency properties.
  - action: reorder
    description: Change the order of the identified segments.
    input_order: [initial_segment, movable_block, white_gap, final_segment]
    output_order: [initial_segment, white_gap, movable_block, final_segment]

output_structure:
  - description: Concatenation of the segments in the new order.
