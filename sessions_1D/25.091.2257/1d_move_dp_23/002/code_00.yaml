task_description: Within the first row of a 2D grid, shift a colored block rightwards to become adjacent to a fixed red anchor pixel, moving the intermediate white space to the left of the block.
grid_dimensionality: 2D (but transformation logic applies only to the first row)
relevant_colors:
  - background: white (0)
  - anchor: red (2)
  - movable: green (3), yellow (4) # Any color other than white or red seems possible
objects:
  - id: target_row
    description: The first row (index 0) of the input grid.
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels within the target_row, where the color is not white (0) or red (2).
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the block (e.g., green, yellow).
      - pixels: The list of pixel values in the block.
      - start_index: The starting column index of the block in the target_row.
      - end_index: The ending column index of the block in the target_row.
  - id: red_anchor
    description: A single pixel with the color red (2) within the target_row.
    properties:
      - index: The column index of the red pixel in the target_row.
  - id: separating_pixels
    description: White (0) pixels located between the colored_block and the red_anchor in the target_row.
    properties:
      - count: The number of these white pixels.
  - id: leading_background
    description: White (0) pixels located before the colored_block in the target_row.
  - id: trailing_background
    description: White (0) pixels located after the red_anchor in the target_row.
  - id: other_rows
    description: Any rows in the input grid below the first row (index > 0).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: In the target_row of the input, the colored_block is to the left of the red_anchor, potentially separated by separating_pixels.
  - type: transformation
    description: In the target_row of the output, the colored_block is immediately adjacent to the left of the red_anchor. The separating_pixels are moved to be immediately adjacent to the left of the colored_block. Leading and trailing background pixels maintain their relative positions at the start and end of the row. Other_rows remain unchanged.
actions:
  - action: extract
    target: target_row
    input: input_grid
    output: first row as a 1D list or array.
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block, red_anchor (within target_row)
    description: Locate the start/end indices of the colored_block and the index of the red_anchor within the extracted row.
  - action: count
    target: separating_pixels (within target_row)
    input: indices of colored_block end and red_anchor
    output: number of white pixels between them (shift_amount).
  - action: extract
    target: leading_background, trailing_background (within target_row)
  - action: construct_transformed_row
    description: Assemble the transformed target_row by concatenating elements in the new order.
    order:
      1. leading_background
      2. shift_amount number of white (0) pixels
      3. colored_block pixels
      4. red_anchor (pixel value 2)
      5. trailing_background
  - action: construct_output_grid
    description: Create the final output grid.
    steps:
      1. Place the construct_transformed_row as the first row.
      2. Append all other_rows from the original input grid unchanged.
