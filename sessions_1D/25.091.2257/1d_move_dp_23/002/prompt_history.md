Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (arrays) of pixels represented by numbers 0-9 (colors).
2.  **Key Colors:** The relevant colors observed are white (0), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). White appears to function as a background or empty space.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is consistently a contiguous block of a single color (green or yellow in the examples) that is not white or red. Let's call this the "colored block".
    *   There is consistently a single red pixel (2). Let's call this the "red anchor".
    *   There are white pixels (0) acting as separators or background.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The core transformation involves shifting the position of the "colored block".
    *   The "colored block" moves to the right.
    *   The "red anchor" pixel seems to stay in its position relative to the end of the grid, or more accurately, the colored block moves *towards* it.
    *   The number of white pixels between the "colored block" and the "red anchor" in the input determines the magnitude of the shift.
    *   In the output, the "colored block" becomes immediately adjacent (to the left) of the "red anchor".
    *   The white pixels that were originally between the block and the anchor seem to relocate to the position immediately preceding the shifted block.
    *   Any white pixels originally before the colored block, or after the red anchor, remain in their relative start/end positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shifting a colored block rightwards to become adjacent to a fixed red anchor pixel.
grid_dimensionality: 1D
relevant_colors:
  - background: white (0)
  - anchor: red (2)
  - movable: green (3), yellow (4) # Any color other than white or red seems possible
objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels, where the color is not white (0) or red (2).
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the block (e.g., green, yellow).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel of the block in the input.
      - end_index: The index of the last pixel of the block in the input.
  - id: red_anchor
    description: A single pixel with the color red (2).
    properties:
      - index: The index of the red pixel in the input.
  - id: separating_pixels
    description: White (0) pixels located between the colored_block and the red_anchor in the input.
    properties:
      - count: The number of these white pixels. This determines the shift amount.
  - id: leading_background
    description: White (0) pixels located before the colored_block in the input.
  - id: trailing_background
    description: White (0) pixels located after the red_anchor in the input.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: In the input, the colored_block is to the left of the red_anchor, potentially separated by separating_pixels.
  - type: transformation
    description: In the output, the colored_block is immediately adjacent to the left of the red_anchor. The separating_pixels are moved to be immediately adjacent to the left of the colored_block. Leading and trailing background pixels maintain their relative positions at the start and end.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block, red_anchor
    description: Locate the start and end indices of the colored_block and the index of the red_anchor.
  - action: count
    target: separating_pixels
    input: indices of colored_block end and red_anchor
    output: number of white pixels between them (shift_amount).
  - action: construct_output
    description: Assemble the output array by concatenating elements in the new order.
    order:
      1. leading_background (from input)
      2. shift_amount number of white (0) pixels
      3. colored_block (from input)
      4. red_anchor (pixel value 2)
      5. trailing_background (from input)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the main contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor red (2). Record its color and sequence of pixels.
2.  Identify the single red pixel (2). Record its index.
3.  Count the number of white pixels (0) that appear strictly between the end of the identified colored block and the red pixel in the input grid. Let this count be `shift_amount`.
4.  Extract any white pixels (0) that appear before the start of the colored block in the input grid (leading background).
5.  Extract any white pixels (0) that appear after the red pixel (2) in the input grid (trailing background).
6.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the following elements in order:
    *   The leading background pixels.
    *   `shift_amount` number of white pixels (0).
    *   The sequence of pixels forming the colored block identified in step 1.
    *   The red pixel (2).
    *   The trailing background pixels.
```python

"""
Identifies a contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or red 2) and a single red pixel (2) in a 1D input grid.
Calculates the number of white pixels (0) between the block and the red pixel.
Constructs the output grid by:
1. Placing any white pixels that were originally before the block.
2. Placing the calculated number of white pixels.
3. Placing the colored block.
4. Placing the red pixel (2).
5. Placing any white pixels that were originally after the red pixel.
Effectively, the colored block moves rightward to be adjacent to the red pixel, and the white space previously between them moves to the left of the block.
