"""
Transforms the input grid by processing only the first row. 
Within the first row, it identifies a contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or red 2) 
and a single red pixel (2). It calculates the number of white pixels (0) located strictly between 
the end of the block and the red pixel. 
It then constructs a new first row by:
1. Placing any white pixels that were originally before the block.
2. Placing the calculated number of white pixels (that were between the block and anchor).
3. Placing the colored block itself.
4. Placing the red pixel (2).
5. Placing any white pixels (or other pixels) that were originally after the red pixel.
All other rows (if any) below the first row remain unchanged.
Effectively, in the first row, the colored block moves rightward to become adjacent to the 
red pixel, and the white space previously between them moves to the left of the block.
