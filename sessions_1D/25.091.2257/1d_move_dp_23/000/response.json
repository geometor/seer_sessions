White appears to function as a background or empty space.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   There is consistently a contiguous block of a single color (green or yellow in the examples) that is not white or red. Let's call this the \"colored block\".\n    *   There is consistently a single red pixel (2). Let's call this the \"red anchor\".\n    *   There are white pixels (0) acting as separators or background.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The core transformation involves shifting the position of the \"colored block\".\n    *   The \"colored block\" moves to the right.\n    *   The \"red anchor\" pixel seems to stay in its position relative to the end of the grid, or more accurately, the colored block moves *towards* it.\n    *   The number of white pixels between the \"colored block\" and the \"red anchor\" in the input determines the magnitude of the shift.\n    *   In the output, the \"colored block\" becomes immediately adjacent (to the left) of the \"red anchor\".\n    *   The white pixels that were originally between the block and the anchor seem to relocate to the position immediately preceding the shifted block.\n    *   Any white pixels originally before the colored block, or after the red anchor, remain in their relative start/end positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
