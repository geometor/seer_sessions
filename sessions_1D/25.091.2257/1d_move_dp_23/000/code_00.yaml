task_description: Shifting a colored block rightwards to become adjacent to a fixed red anchor pixel.
grid_dimensionality: 1D
relevant_colors:
  - background: white (0)
  - anchor: red (2)
  - movable: green (3), yellow (4) # Any color other than white or red seems possible
objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels, where the color is not white (0) or red (2).
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the block (e.g., green, yellow).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel of the block in the input.
      - end_index: The index of the last pixel of the block in the input.
  - id: red_anchor
    description: A single pixel with the color red (2).
    properties:
      - index: The index of the red pixel in the input.
  - id: separating_pixels
    description: White (0) pixels located between the colored_block and the red_anchor in the input.
    properties:
      - count: The number of these white pixels. This determines the shift amount.
  - id: leading_background
    description: White (0) pixels located before the colored_block in the input.
  - id: trailing_background
    description: White (0) pixels located after the red_anchor in the input.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: In the input, the colored_block is to the left of the red_anchor, potentially separated by separating_pixels.
  - type: transformation
    description: In the output, the colored_block is immediately adjacent to the left of the red_anchor. The separating_pixels are moved to be immediately adjacent to the left of the colored_block. Leading and trailing background pixels maintain their relative positions at the start and end.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block, red_anchor
    description: Locate the start and end indices of the colored_block and the index of the red_anchor.
  - action: count
    target: separating_pixels
    input: indices of colored_block end and red_anchor
    output: number of white pixels between them (shift_amount).
  - action: construct_output
    description: Assemble the output array by concatenating elements in the new order.
    order:
      1. leading_background (from input)
      2. shift_amount number of white (0) pixels
      3. colored_block (from input)
      4. red_anchor (pixel value 2)
      5. trailing_background (from input)
