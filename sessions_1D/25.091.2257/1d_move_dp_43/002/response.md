*   **General Assessment:** The provided code attempts to implement the logic described in the initial analysis (identify block, find marker, count intermediate whitespace, shift block by that count). However, the execution results show that for all training examples, the transformed output was identical to the input, indicating the shift operation failed or was calculated as zero incorrectly. The goal is to re-examine the examples, confirm the transformation rule, identify why the shift might have failed in the code execution, and refine the natural language program. The core logic seems to be about shifting a colored block based on the number of white pixels between it and a green marker.

*   **Metrics:**

    Let's re-analyze the parameters for each example:

    **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]`
    *   Block: Azure (8), Start=1, End=8, Length=8
    *   Marker (3): Index=12
    *   Whitespace (0) between End=8 and Index=12: Indices 9, 10, 11. Count = 3.
    *   Expected Shift: 3
    *   Expected New Block Start: 1 + 3 = 4
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0]` (Matches target)

    **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0]`
    *   Block: Yellow (4), Start=1, End=10, Length=10
    *   Marker (3): Index=13
    *   Whitespace (0) between End=10 and Index=13: Indices 11, 12. Count = 2.
    *   Expected Shift: 2
    *   Expected New Block Start: 1 + 2 = 3
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0]` (Matches target)

    **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]`
    *   Block: Magenta (6), Start=0, End=10, Length=11
    *   Marker (3): Index=13
    *   Whitespace (0) between End=10 and Index=13: Indices 11, 12. Count = 2.
    *   Expected Shift: 2
    *   Expected New Block Start: 0 + 2 = 2
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]` (Matches target)

    The analysis confirms the initial hypothesis about the transformation logic is consistent across all examples. The failure reported in the code execution seems inconsistent with this analysis and the apparent logic of the provided Python code. The code *should* have produced the correct outputs based on its structure. There might have been an issue in the execution environment or a very subtle bug missed in the trace.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: 1D array rearrangement
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row grid)
    input_elements:
      - object_type: contiguous_block
        description: A single sequence of adjacent, identical pixels.
        properties:
          - color: A single color, excluding white (0) and green (3). Varies per example (azure, yellow, magenta).
          - length: Variable.
          - start_index: Variable.
          - end_index: Variable.
      - object_type: marker
        description: A single pixel acting as a reference point.
        properties:
          - color: green (3)
          - index: Variable. Always appears after the contiguous_block.
      - object_type: separator
        description: Pixels located between the contiguous_block and the marker.
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - count: The number of these pixels dictates the transformation. Can be zero or more.
      - object_type: background
        description: Other white (0) pixels.
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - location: Can be before the block or after the marker.
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The elements appear in the order (optional preceding background), contiguous_block, separator (whitespace), marker, (optional trailing background).
      - type: functional
        description: The count of white pixels in the 'separator' group determines the amount the 'contiguous_block' is shifted rightwards.
    transformation:
      - action: identify_block
        target: contiguous_block
        details: Find its color, start_index, end_index, and length.
      - action: identify_marker
        target: marker
        details: Find its index.
      - action: count_separators
        target: separator
        details: Count the number of white (0) pixels strictly between the block's end_index and the marker's index. Call this 'shift_distance'.
      - action: create_output
        details: Initialize a new 1D grid of the same size as the input, filled with white (0).
      - action: place_block
        target: contiguous_block
        destination: output grid
        details: Copy the block's pixels into the output grid, starting at index `block_start_index + shift_distance`.
      - action: place_marker
        target: marker
        destination: output grid
        details: Copy the green (3) pixel into the output grid at its original index.
      - action: preserve_trailing_background
        target: background pixels after the marker
        destination: output grid
        details: Ensure white (0) pixels originally after the marker remain white (0) at their original indices in the output (this is typically handled by the initial white fill).
    output_elements:
      - object_type: grid
        description: A 1D grid of the same size as the input.
        properties:
          - Contains the shifted contiguous_block.
          - Contains the marker at its original position.
          - Contains white (0) pixels filling the space before the shifted block and potentially after the marker.
    invariants:
        - Grid size remains the same.
        - The color and length of the contiguous block remain the same.
        - The color and position of the green marker remain the same.
        - The relative order of the block and marker is preserved (block shifted right, marker stays put).
        - Only white pixels appear between the original block end and the marker.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white (0), non-green (3) pixels in the input grid. Record its color, start index, and end index.
    2.  Identify the index of the single green (3) marker pixel.
    3.  Count the number of white (0) pixels located strictly between the end index of the colored block and the index of the green marker. This count is the `shift_distance`.
    4.  Create a new grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
    5.  Copy the identified colored block (using its recorded color and length) into the new grid, starting at the position calculated as `original_start_index + shift_distance`.
    6.  Place the green (3) marker pixel into the new grid at its original index.
    7.  The resulting new grid is the output. (Note: White pixels before the original block position and after the marker position are implicitly handled by the initial white fill and the placement of the block and marker).
