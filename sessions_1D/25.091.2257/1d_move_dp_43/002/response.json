However, the execution results show that for all training examples, the transformed output was identical to the input, indicating the shift operation failed or was calculated as zero incorrectly. The goal is to re-examine the examples, confirm the transformation rule, identify why the shift might have failed in the code execution, and refine the natural language program. The core logic seems to be about shifting a colored block based on the number of white pixels between it and a green marker.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n\n    Let's re-analyze the parameters for each example:\n\n    **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]`\n    *   Block: Azure (8), Start=1, End=8, Length=8\n    *   Marker (3): Index=12\n    *   Whitespace (0) between End=8 and Index=12: Indices 9, 10, 11. Count = 3.\n    *   Expected Shift: 3\n    *   Expected New Block Start: 1 + 3 = 4\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0]` (Matches target)\n\n    **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0]`\n    *   Block: Yellow (4), Start=1, End=10, Length=10\n    *   Marker (3): Index=13\n    *   Whitespace (0) between End=10 and Index=13: Indices 11, 12. Count = 2.\n    *   Expected Shift: 2\n    *   Expected New Block Start: 1 + 2 = 3\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0]` (Matches target)\n\n    **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]`\n    *   Block: Magenta (6), Start=0, End=10, Length=11\n    *   Marker (3): Index=13\n    *   Whitespace (0) between End=10 and Index=13: Indices 11, 12. Count = 2.\n    *   Expected Shift: 2\n    *   Expected New Block Start: 0 + 2 = 2\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]` (Matches target)\n\n    The analysis confirms the initial hypothesis about the transformation logic is consistent across all examples. The failure reported in the code execution seems inconsistent with this analysis and the apparent logic of the provided Python code. The code *should* have produced the correct outputs based on its structure. There might have been an issue in the execution environment or a very subtle bug missed in the trace.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
