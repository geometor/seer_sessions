Each example contains a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-green color, a single green pixel (3), and several white pixels (0). The output is a rearrangement of the input pixels. The main colored block appears shifted to the right. The green pixel and any trailing white pixels seem to maintain their positions relative to the end of the grid or the shifted block. The amount of shift seems related to the number of white pixels between the main block and the green pixel.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
