"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies a single contiguous block of pixels with a color other than white (0) or green (3).
2. Identifies a single green (3) marker pixel.
3. Counts the number of white (0) pixels located strictly between the end of the colored block and the green marker.
4. Creates a new grid of the same size, initialized with white (0).
5. Places the identified colored block into the new grid, shifted to the right from its original starting position by the count of intermediate white pixels.
6. Places the green (3) marker into the new grid at its original index.
7. The remaining pixels in the new grid stay white (0).
