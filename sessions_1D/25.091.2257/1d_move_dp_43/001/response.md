"""
Identifies a contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or green 3) and a single green (3) marker pixel in a 1D input grid.
Calculates the number of white (0) pixels located strictly between the end of the block and the green marker.
Creates an output grid of the same size, initially filled with white (0).
Shifts the identified block to the right by the calculated number of white pixels.
Places the green marker at its original index in the output grid.
Copies any white pixels that were originally after the green marker into the output grid at their original indices.
