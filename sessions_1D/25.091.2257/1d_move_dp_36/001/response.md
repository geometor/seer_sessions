Transformation rule:
1. Locate the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel in the input 1D array. This pixel and all subsequent pixels form the "suffix" and remain unchanged.
2. Consider the portion of the array *before* the maroon pixel as the "transform region".
3. Within the transform region, identify the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (the "colored block"). Note its color, start index, and end index.
4. Identify the contiguous block of white (0) pixels that immediately follows the colored block (the "white block"). Note its length and content. If no white block follows, its length is 0.
5. Identify any pixels (which will be white based on examples) that occur *before* the start index of the colored block (the "prefix").
6. Construct the new arrangement for the transform region in the output:
   a. Start with the "prefix".
   b. Append the "white block".
   c. Append the "colored block".
7. Combine the newly constructed transform region with the unchanged "suffix" to form the final output array.
