The length seems consistent within the examples (length 15).\n2.  **Color Palette:** Colors observed are white (0), red (2), blue (1), gray (5), and maroon (9).\n3.  **Key Features:**\n    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white color exists in each input (red, blue, gray).\n    *   A contiguous block of white (0) pixels immediately follows this colored block in the input.\n    *   A maroon (9) pixel appears near the end of the array, seemingly acting as a delimiter or boundary marker.\n    *   The transformation primarily involves rearranging the elements *before* the maroon pixel.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The colored block shifts to the right.\n    *   The white block that followed the colored block in the input moves to the position immediately preceding the colored block's new location in the output.\n    *   The amount of rightward shift for the colored block appears equal to the number of pixels in the white block that followed it.\n    *   Elements before the original colored block (if any) seem to remain at the beginning.\n    *   The maroon pixel and any element(s) after it remain fixed in their positions relative to the end of the array.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
