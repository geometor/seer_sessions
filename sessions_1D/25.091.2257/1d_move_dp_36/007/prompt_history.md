Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be 1-dimensional arrays or grids with a height of 1. The length seems consistent within the examples (length 15).
2.  **Color Palette:** Colors observed are white (0), red (2), blue (1), gray (5), and maroon (9).
3.  **Key Features:**
    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white color exists in each input (red, blue, gray).
    *   A contiguous block of white (0) pixels immediately follows this colored block in the input.
    *   A maroon (9) pixel appears near the end of the array, seemingly acting as a delimiter or boundary marker.
    *   The transformation primarily involves rearranging the elements *before* the maroon pixel.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:**
    *   The colored block shifts to the right.
    *   The white block that followed the colored block in the input moves to the position immediately preceding the colored block's new location in the output.
    *   The amount of rightward shift for the colored block appears equal to the number of pixels in the white block that followed it.
    *   Elements before the original colored block (if any) seem to remain at the beginning.
    *   The maroon pixel and any element(s) after it remain fixed in their positions relative to the end of the array.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array based on the properties of adjacent blocks before a specific marker.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D grid)
objects:
  - type: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels. Only one such block appears before the marker in the examples.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., red, blue, gray).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The index where the block begins.
  - type: white_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels immediately following the 'colored_block'.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the block. Crucial for determining the shift amount.
      - start_index: The index where the block begins (immediately after colored_block ends).
  - type: marker
    description: A single maroon (9) pixel acting as a boundary.
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - location: Defines the end of the region to be transformed.
  - type: prefix_whites
    description: Optional contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels at the beginning of the array, before the 'colored_block'.
    properties:
      - length: Number of pixels.
  - type: suffix
    description: Any pixels including and after the 'marker'.
    properties:
      - content: Sequence of pixels including the marker.
      - location: End of the array.
actions:
  - identify_marker: Find the index of the first maroon (9) pixel.
  - partition_input: Divide the input array into three parts based on the marker: the part before the marker (transform_region), the marker itself, and the part after the marker.
  - identify_blocks: Within the 'transform_region':
      - Find the start and end of the 'colored_block'.
      - Find the start and end of the 'white_block' immediately following it.
      - Identify any 'prefix_whites'.
  - calculate_shift: Determine the shift distance, which equals the length of the 'white_block'.
  - rearrange: Construct the output's 'transform_region':
      - Place the 'prefix_whites' (if any) first.
      - Place the 'white_block' next.
      - Place the 'colored_block' last within this region.
  - reconstruct_output: Combine the rearranged 'transform_region', the 'marker', and the 'suffix' to form the final output array.
relationships:
  - adjacency: The 'white_block' must be immediately adjacent to (following) the 'colored_block'.
  - dependency: The amount of shift applied to the 'colored_block' depends directly on the length of the 'white_block'.
  - boundary: The 'marker' defines the right boundary for the rearrangement operation. Pixels at or after the marker are unchanged.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Locate the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel in the input array. This pixel and all subsequent pixels form the "suffix" and remain unchanged in their positions relative to the end of the array.
2.  Consider the portion of the array *before* the maroon pixel as the "transform region".
3.  Within the transform region, identify the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (the "colored block"). Note its color, start index, and length.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of white (0) pixels that immediately follows the colored block (the "white block"). Note its length. This length determines the "shift amount".
5.  Identify any white (0) pixels that occur *before* the start index of the colored block (the "prefix whites").
6.  Construct the new arrangement for the transform region in the output:
    a.  Start with the "prefix whites" (if any).
    b.  Append the "white block".
    c.  Append the "colored block".
7.  Combine the newly constructed transform region with the unchanged "suffix" (the maroon pixel and everything after it) to form the final output array.

1.  Take the input, which is a grid with a single row (1xN). Extract this row for processing.
2.  Locate the index of the first maroon (9) pixel within the row. This marks the boundary.
3.  Separate the row into two parts: the "transform region" (all pixels *before* the maroon pixel) and the "suffix" (the maroon pixel and all pixels after it). The "suffix" will remain unchanged.
4.  Analyze the "transform region":
    a.  Identify the "prefix": the sequence of pixels from the start of the transform region up to, but not including, the first non-white pixel. (Based on examples, the prefix consists only of white pixels).
    b.  Identify the "colored block": the first contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels. Note its color and length.
    c.  Identify the "white block": the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels that *immediately* follows the "colored block". Note its length. If no white pixels immediately follow, this block has length 0.
5.  Construct the new "transform region" for the output row by concatenating the identified parts in this specific order: first the "prefix", then the "white block", then the "colored block".
6.  Create the final output row by concatenating the newly constructed "transform region" with the original unchanged "suffix".
7.  Format the final output row back into a 1xN grid (a list containing one list).

**Assessment:**

The previous code failed because it attempted to use NumPy arrays directly in boolean `if` conditions (`if prefix:`, `if white_block:`, `if colored_block:`). NumPy requires explicit methods like `.any()` or `.all()` for truth-value testing, or checking the `.size` attribute to see if the array is empty. The error occurred consistently across all examples, indicating a fundamental flaw in how array existence was checked, rather than a specific edge case. The core logic for identifying the blocks (prefix, colored, white, suffix) and the rearrangement order (prefix, white block, colored block, suffix) appears correct based on the examples. The strategy is to correct the boolean checks using `.size > 0`.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

No computational tool use is needed here, as the error is a standard Python/NumPy type error, and the logic can be verified by inspection against the examples.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0]`
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0]`
    *   Analysis: Prefix is empty. Colored block (red, 2) is followed by a white block `[0, 0]`. White block moves before the colored block. Suffix `[9, 0]` remains. Error was due to checking `if prefix:` (empty array) and `if white_block:` / `if colored_block:` (non-empty arrays).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0]`
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0]`
    *   Analysis: Prefix `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` exists. Colored block (blue, 1) is followed by a white block `[0, 0]`. The order becomes prefix -> white block -> colored block. Suffix `[9, 0]` remains. Error was due to checking non-empty arrays `prefix`, `white_block`, `colored_block`.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]`
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9]`
    *   Analysis: Prefix `[0]` exists. Colored block (gray, 5) is followed by a white block `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. The order becomes prefix -> white block -> colored block. Suffix `[9]` remains. Error was due to checking non-empty arrays `prefix`, `white_block`, `colored_block`.

The fix involves changing `if array:` to `if array.size > 0:` for all identified blocks (prefix, white_block, colored_block) before appending them to the `parts_to_join` list.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid, which consists of a single row. Extract this row as a 1D sequence of pixels.
2.  Find the index of the first maroon (9) pixel in the sequence. If no maroon pixel is found, return the original input grid.
3.  Divide the sequence into two parts: the "transform region" (pixels before the maroon pixel) and the "suffix" (the maroon pixel and all subsequent pixels). The suffix remains unchanged.
4.  Analyze the "transform region":
    a.  Find the start index of the first non-white pixel. All pixels before this index form the "prefix". If the region starts with a non-white pixel or is empty, the prefix is empty.
    b.  Starting from that first non-white pixel, identify the "colored block", which is the contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels. Note its content. If no non-white pixel is found in the transform region, skip the rearrangement and proceed to step 6.
    c.  Identify the "white block", which is the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels that starts *immediately* after the "colored block" ends. If no white pixel immediately follows, or if the colored block extends to the end of the transform region, the white block is empty. Note its content.
5.  Construct the new "transform region" by concatenating the identified parts in the following order: first the "prefix" (if any), then the "white block" (if any), then the "colored block".
6.  Create the final output sequence by concatenating the newly constructed "transform region" with the unchanged "suffix".
7.  Format the final sequence back into a single-row grid (a list containing one list) and return it.
