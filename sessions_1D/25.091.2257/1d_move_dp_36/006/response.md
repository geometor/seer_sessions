**Assessment:**

The previous code failed because it attempted to use NumPy arrays directly in boolean `if` conditions (`if prefix:`, `if white_block:`, `if colored_block:`). NumPy requires explicit methods like `.any()` or `.all()` for truth-value testing, or checking the `.size` attribute to see if the array is empty. The error occurred consistently across all examples, indicating a fundamental flaw in how array existence was checked, rather than a specific edge case. The core logic for identifying the blocks (prefix, colored, white, suffix) and the rearrangement order (prefix, white block, colored block, suffix) appears correct based on the examples. The strategy is to correct the boolean checks using `.size > 0`.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

No computational tool use is needed here, as the error is a standard Python/NumPy type error, and the logic can be verified by inspection against the examples.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0]`
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0]`
    *   Analysis: Prefix is empty. Colored block (red, 2) is followed by a white block `[0, 0]`. White block moves before the colored block. Suffix `[9, 0]` remains. Error was due to checking `if prefix:` (empty array) and `if white_block:` / `if colored_block:` (non-empty arrays).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0]`
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0]`
    *   Analysis: Prefix `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` exists. Colored block (blue, 1) is followed by a white block `[0, 0]`. The order becomes prefix -> white block -> colored block. Suffix `[9, 0]` remains. Error was due to checking non-empty arrays `prefix`, `white_block`, `colored_block`.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]`
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9]`
    *   Analysis: Prefix `[0]` exists. Colored block (gray, 5) is followed by a white block `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. The order becomes prefix -> white block -> colored block. Suffix `[9]` remains. Error was due to checking non-empty arrays `prefix`, `white_block`, `colored_block`.

The fix involves changing `if array:` to `if array.size > 0:` for all identified blocks (prefix, white_block, colored_block) before appending them to the `parts_to_join` list.

      - end_index: Index within transform_region where it ends (exclusive).
  - type: white_block
    description: The contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels within the transform_region that *immediately* follows the colored_block. Can be empty.
    properties:
      - content: sequence of pixels (all 0s)

      - start_index: Index within transform_region where it begins (must equal colored_block.end_index).
actions:
  - extract_row: Get the 1D array from the 1xN input grid.
  - find_marker: Locate the index of the first maroon (9) pixel.
  - partition: Split the row into transform_region and suffix based on the marker index.
  - identify_blocks: Within the transform_region:
      - find_colored_block: Locate the first non-white contiguous block.
      - find_prefix: Identify the leading white pixels before the colored_block.
      - find_white_block: Identify the contiguous white pixels immediately after the colored_block.
  - rearrange: Construct the new transform_region by concatenating prefix, white_block, and colored_block in that order. Handle cases where blocks might be empty.
  - reconstruct_output: Combine the rearranged transform_region and the original suffix into a new 1D array.
  - format_output: Wrap the resulting 1D array into a list to match the 1xN grid format.
relationships:
  - boundary: The marker separates the transform_region from the fixed suffix.
  - adjacency: The white_block must start exactly where the colored_block ends.
  - ordering: The output arrangement within the transformed region is strictly prefix, then white_block, then colored_block.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid, which consists of a single row. Extract this row as a 1D sequence of pixels.
2.  Find the index of the first maroon (9) pixel in the sequence. If no maroon pixel is found, return the original input grid.
3.  Divide the sequence into two parts: the "transform region" (pixels before the maroon pixel) and the "suffix" (the maroon pixel and all subsequent pixels). The suffix remains unchanged.
4.  Analyze the "transform region":
    a.  Find the start index of the first non-white pixel. All pixels before this index form the "prefix". If the region starts with a non-white pixel or is empty, the prefix is empty.
    b.  Starting from that first non-white pixel, identify the "colored block", which is the contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels. Note its content. If no non-white pixel is found in the transform region, skip the rearrangement and proceed to step 6.
    c.  Identify the "white block", which is the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels that starts *immediately* after the "colored block" ends. If no white pixel immediately follows, or if the colored block extends to the end of the transform region, the white block is empty. Note its content.
5.  Construct the new "transform region" by concatenating the identified parts in the following order: first the "prefix" (if any), then the "white block" (if any), then the "colored block".
6.  Create the final output sequence by concatenating the newly constructed "transform region" with the unchanged "suffix".
7.  Format the final sequence back into a single-row grid (a list containing one list) and return it.
