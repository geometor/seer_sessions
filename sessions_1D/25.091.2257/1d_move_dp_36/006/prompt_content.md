Transformation Rule:
1.  Take the input, which is a grid with a single row (1xN). Extract this row for processing.
2.  Locate the index of the first maroon (9) pixel within the row. This marks the boundary.
3.  Separate the row into two parts: the "transform region" (all pixels *before* the maroon pixel) and the "suffix" (the maroon pixel and all pixels after it). The "suffix" will remain unchanged.
4.  Analyze the "transform region":
    a.  Identify the "prefix": the sequence of pixels from the start of the transform region up to, but not including, the first non-white pixel. (Based on examples, the prefix consists only of white pixels).
    b.  Identify the "colored block": the first contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels. Note its color and length.
    c.  Identify the "white block": the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels that *immediately* follows the "colored block". Note its length. If no white pixels immediately follow, this block has length 0.
5.  Construct the new "transform region" for the output row by concatenating the identified parts in this specific order: first the "prefix", then the "white block", then the "colored block".
6.  Create the final output row by concatenating the newly constructed "transform region" with the original unchanged "suffix".
7.  Format the final output row back into a 1xN grid (a list containing one list).
