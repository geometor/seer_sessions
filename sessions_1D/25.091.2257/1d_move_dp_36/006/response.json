            "text": "**Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it attempted to use NumPy arrays directly in boolean `if` conditions (`if prefix:`, `if white_block:`, `if colored_block:`). NumPy requires explicit methods like `.any()` or `.all()` for truth-value testing, or checking the `.size` attribute to see if the array is empty. The error occurred consistently across all examples, indicating a fundamental flaw in how array existence was checked, rather than a specific edge case. The core logic for identifying the blocks (prefix, colored, white, suffix) and the rearrangement order (prefix, white block, colored block, suffix) appears correct based on the examples. The strategy is to correct the boolean checks using `.size > 0`.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nNo computational tool use is needed here, as the error is a standard Python/NumPy type error, and the logic can be verified by inspection against the examples.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0]`\n    *   Analysis: Prefix is empty. Colored block (red, 2) is followed by a white block `[0, 0]`. White block moves before the colored block. Suffix `[9, 0]` remains. Error was due to checking `if prefix:` (empty array) and `if white_block:` / `if colored_block:` (non-empty arrays).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0]`\n    *   Analysis: Prefix `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` exists. Colored block (blue, 1) is followed by a white block `[0, 0]`. The order becomes prefix -> white block -> colored block. Suffix `[9, 0]` remains. Error was due to checking non-empty arrays `prefix`, `white_block`, `colored_block`.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9]`\n    *   Analysis: Prefix `[0]` exists. Colored block (gray, 5) is followed by a white block `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. The order becomes prefix -> white block -> colored block. Suffix `[9]` remains. Error was due to checking non-empty arrays `prefix`, `white_block`, `colored_block`.\n\nThe fix involves changing `if array:` to `if array.size > 0:` for all identified blocks (prefix, white_block, colored_block) before appending them to the `parts_to_join` list.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
