Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be 1-dimensional arrays or grids with a height of 1. The length seems consistent within the examples (length 15).
2.  **Color Palette:** Colors observed are white (0), red (2), blue (1), gray (5), and maroon (9).
3.  **Key Features:**
    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white color exists in each input (red, blue, gray).
    *   A contiguous block of white (0) pixels immediately follows this colored block in the input.
    *   A maroon (9) pixel appears near the end of the array, seemingly acting as a delimiter or boundary marker.
    *   The transformation primarily involves rearranging the elements *before* the maroon pixel.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:**
    *   The colored block shifts to the right.
    *   The white block that followed the colored block in the input moves to the position immediately preceding the colored block's new location in the output.
    *   The amount of rightward shift for the colored block appears equal to the number of pixels in the white block that followed it.
    *   Elements before the original colored block (if any) seem to remain at the beginning.
    *   The maroon pixel and any element(s) after it remain fixed in their positions relative to the end of the array.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array based on the properties of adjacent blocks before a specific marker.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D grid)
objects:
  - type: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels. Only one such block appears before the marker in the examples.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., red, blue, gray).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The index where the block begins.
  - type: white_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels immediately following the 'colored_block'.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the block. Crucial for determining the shift amount.
      - start_index: The index where the block begins (immediately after colored_block ends).
  - type: marker
    description: A single maroon (9) pixel acting as a boundary.
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - location: Defines the end of the region to be transformed.
  - type: prefix_whites
    description: Optional contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels at the beginning of the array, before the 'colored_block'.
    properties:
      - length: Number of pixels.
  - type: suffix
    description: Any pixels including and after the 'marker'.
    properties:
      - content: Sequence of pixels including the marker.
      - location: End of the array.
actions:
  - identify_marker: Find the index of the first maroon (9) pixel.
  - partition_input: Divide the input array into three parts based on the marker: the part before the marker (transform_region), the marker itself, and the part after the marker.
  - identify_blocks: Within the 'transform_region':
      - Find the start and end of the 'colored_block'.
      - Find the start and end of the 'white_block' immediately following it.
      - Identify any 'prefix_whites'.
  - calculate_shift: Determine the shift distance, which equals the length of the 'white_block'.
  - rearrange: Construct the output's 'transform_region':
      - Place the 'prefix_whites' (if any) first.
      - Place the 'white_block' next.
      - Place the 'colored_block' last within this region.
  - reconstruct_output: Combine the rearranged 'transform_region', the 'marker', and the 'suffix' to form the final output array.
relationships:
  - adjacency: The 'white_block' must be immediately adjacent to (following) the 'colored_block'.
  - dependency: The amount of shift applied to the 'colored_block' depends directly on the length of the 'white_block'.
  - boundary: The 'marker' defines the right boundary for the rearrangement operation. Pixels at or after the marker are unchanged.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Locate the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel in the input array. This pixel and all subsequent pixels form the "suffix" and remain unchanged in their positions relative to the end of the array.
2.  Consider the portion of the array *before* the maroon pixel as the "transform region".
3.  Within the transform region, identify the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (the "colored block"). Note its color, start index, and length.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of white (0) pixels that immediately follows the colored block (the "white block"). Note its length. This length determines the "shift amount".
5.  Identify any white (0) pixels that occur *before* the start index of the colored block (the "prefix whites").
6.  Construct the new arrangement for the transform region in the output:
    a.  Start with the "prefix whites" (if any).
    b.  Append the "white block".
    c.  Append the "colored block".
7.  Combine the newly constructed transform region with the unchanged "suffix" (the maroon pixel and everything after it) to form the final output array.
