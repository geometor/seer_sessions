task_description: Rearrange blocks of pixels in a 1D array preceding a marker pixel.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN 2D grid)
pixel_colors_used: white(0), blue(1), red(2), gray(5), maroon(9)
objects:
  - type: marker
    description: The first occurrence of a maroon (9) pixel. It defines the boundary for the transformation.
    properties:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
      - index: Location in the array.
  - type: transform_region
    description: The sequence of pixels in the input array *before* the marker pixel.
  - type: suffix
    description: The sequence of pixels in the input array starting from the marker pixel to the end. This part remains unchanged in the output.
  - type: prefix
    description: The contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels at the beginning of the 'transform_region'. Can be empty.
    location: Starts at index 0 of the 'transform_region'.
  - type: colored_block
    description: The first contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels found within the 'transform_region'.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., red, blue, gray).
      - content: The sequence of pixels forming the block.
    location: Immediately follows the 'prefix'.
  - type: white_block
    description: The contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels within the 'transform_region' that immediately follows the 'colored_block'. Can be empty.
    properties:
      - content: The sequence of white pixels.
    location: Immediately follows the 'colored_block'.
actions:
  - find_marker: Locate the index of the first maroon (9) pixel.
  - partition_input: Separate the input array into 'transform_region' (before marker) and 'suffix' (marker and after).
  - identify_blocks (within transform_region):
      - Find the 'prefix' (leading white pixels).
      - Find the 'colored_block' (first non-white sequence after prefix).
      - Find the 'white_block' (white sequence immediately after colored_block).
  - reconstruct_transform_region: Create the new 'transform_region' for the output by concatenating: 'prefix' + 'white_block' + 'colored_block'.
  - form_output: Concatenate the reconstructed 'transform_region' and the original 'suffix'.
relationships:
  - spatial: 'prefix', 'colored_block', 'white_block' appear contiguously in that order in the input 'transform_region'.
  - spatial_output: 'prefix', 'white_block', 'colored_block' appear contiguously in that order in the output 'transform_region'.
  - boundary: The 'marker' separates the part of the array that is rearranged from the part that is preserved ('suffix').
invariants:
  - The 'suffix' part of the array remains unchanged.
  - The total count of each color within the 'transform_region' remains the same, although their order changes.
  - The length of the array remains unchanged.
