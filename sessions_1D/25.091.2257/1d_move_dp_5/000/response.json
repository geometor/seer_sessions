White seems to be the background color.\n3.  **Key Elements:** Each input contains:\n    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-azure color (red, green, or yellow in the examples).\n    *   A single azure (8) pixel.\n    *   White (0) pixels filling the remaining space.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a positional shift of the colored block. The block moves horizontally to the right.\n5.  **Movement Constraint:** The colored block stops moving when its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the azure pixel. The length and color of the block remain unchanged.\n6.  **Static Elements:** The position of the azure pixel and the white background pixels remain unchanged relative to the overall grid dimensions. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
