Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data appear to be represented as 1-dimensional arrays or single-row grids.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and azure (8). White seems to be the background color.
3.  **Key Elements:** Each input contains:
    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-azure color (red, green, or yellow in the examples).
    *   A single azure (8) pixel.
    *   White (0) pixels filling the remaining space.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a positional shift of the colored block. The block moves horizontally to the right.
5.  **Movement Constraint:** The colored block stops moving when its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the azure pixel. The length and color of the block remain unchanged.
6.  **Static Elements:** The position of the azure pixel and the white background pixels remain unchanged relative to the overall grid dimensions. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored block horizontally rightward until it is adjacent to the left of a stationary azure pixel.
elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills empty space. Remains static except where overwritten by the moved block.
  - object: colored_block
    attributes:
      - color: Variable (non-white, non-azure; e.g., red(2), green(3), yellow(4))
      - shape: Contiguous horizontal line (1D block)
      - length: Variable
    role: The primary object being manipulated.
    action: Moves horizontally to the right.
  - object: target_pixel
    attributes:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: Single pixel
    role: Acts as a stopping point or anchor for the colored_block's final position. Remains static.
relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    description: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the 'colored_block' is immediately to the left of the 'target_pixel'.
grid_properties:
  - dimension: 1D or single-row grid
  - size: Constant between input and output.
transformation_summary:
  - action: Identify the 'colored_block' (color, length, initial position).
  - action: Identify the 'target_pixel' (position).
  - action: Create a new grid filled with 'background' color.
  - action: Place the 'target_pixel' at its original position in the new grid.
  - action: Calculate the new starting position for the 'colored_block' such that its rightmost pixel is at `target_pixel_position - 1`. The starting position is `target_pixel_position - length_of_colored_block`.
  - action: Place the 'colored_block' at its new calculated position in the new grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid and record its index (position). Place this azure pixel at the same index in the output grid.
3.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white (0), non-azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Record its color, its length, and the index of its leftmost pixel.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the colored block in the output grid. This index is `(index_of_azure_pixel) - (length_of_colored_block)`.
5.  Fill the segment in the output grid starting from the calculated target starting index for the recorded length with the recorded color of the block.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
