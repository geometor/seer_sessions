task_description: Move a colored block horizontally rightward until it is adjacent to the left of a stationary azure pixel.
elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills empty space. Remains static except where overwritten by the moved block.
  - object: colored_block
    attributes:
      - color: Variable (non-white, non-azure; e.g., red(2), green(3), yellow(4))
      - shape: Contiguous horizontal line (1D block)
      - length: Variable
    role: The primary object being manipulated.
    action: Moves horizontally to the right.
  - object: target_pixel
    attributes:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: Single pixel
    role: Acts as a stopping point or anchor for the colored_block's final position. Remains static.
relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    description: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the 'colored_block' is immediately to the left of the 'target_pixel'.
grid_properties:
  - dimension: 1D or single-row grid
  - size: Constant between input and output.
transformation_summary:
  - action: Identify the 'colored_block' (color, length, initial position).
  - action: Identify the 'target_pixel' (position).
  - action: Create a new grid filled with 'background' color.
  - action: Place the 'target_pixel' at its original position in the new grid.
  - action: Calculate the new starting position for the 'colored_block' such that its rightmost pixel is at `target_pixel_position - 1`. The starting position is `target_pixel_position - length_of_colored_block`.
  - action: Place the 'colored_block' at its new calculated position in the new grid.
