task_description: Shift a colored block rightwards based on the position of a marker pixel.
grid_dimensions:
  - input: 1x17
  - output: 1x17
objects:
  - object_type: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color (not white or azure).
    properties:
      - color: Variable (orange, magenta, gray in examples)
      - size: Variable length, preserved during transformation.
      - position: Changes during transformation.
  - object_type: marker
    description: A single pixel with the color azure (8).
    properties:
      - color: Azure (8)
      - size: 1x1
      - position: Fixed during transformation. Acts as a reference point.
  - object_type: background
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - role: Fills the grid space not occupied by the block or marker; replaces the original position of the block after shifting.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: In the input, the azure marker pixel is located at index `j`. The rightmost pixel of the colored block is located at index `j-2`.
actions:
  - action_type: shift
    object: block
    direction: right
    target_condition: The rightmost pixel of the block is moved to the position immediately to the left of the azure marker pixel (index `j-1`).
    details:
      - The block maintains its original color and size.
      - The space previously occupied by the block is filled with white (0).
      - The azure marker pixel remains unchanged in position and color.
