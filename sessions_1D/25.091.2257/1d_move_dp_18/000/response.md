Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 1xN grids (effectively 1D arrays). The width varies slightly across examples but seems consistent within each input/output pair (e.g., 1x17 in train_1).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and one other dominant color per example (orange (7) in train_1, magenta (6) in train_2, gray (5) in train_3).
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is always a contiguous horizontal block of a single color (orange, magenta, or gray).
    *   There is always a single azure (8) pixel.
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  **Relationships & Transformation:**
    *   In the input, the azure pixel is always located two positions to the right of the rightmost pixel of the colored block.
    *   In the output, the colored block has shifted to the right.
    *   The key change is the position of the colored block. Its rightmost pixel in the output is now immediately to the left of the original position of the azure pixel.
    *   The size of the colored block remains unchanged.
    *   The azure pixel remains in its original position.
    *   The area previously occupied by the colored block is filled with white pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored block rightwards based on the position of a marker pixel.
grid_dimensions:
  - input: 1x17
  - output: 1x17
objects:
  - object_type: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color (not white or azure).
    properties:
      - color: Variable (orange, magenta, gray in examples)
      - size: Variable length, preserved during transformation.
      - position: Changes during transformation.
  - object_type: marker
    description: A single pixel with the color azure (8).
    properties:
      - color: Azure (8)
      - size: 1x1
      - position: Fixed during transformation. Acts as a reference point.
  - object_type: background
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - role: Fills the grid space not occupied by the block or marker; replaces the original position of the block after shifting.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: In the input, the azure marker pixel is located at index `j`. The rightmost pixel of the colored block is located at index `j-2`.
actions:
  - action_type: shift
    object: block
    direction: right
    target_condition: The rightmost pixel of the block is moved to the position immediately to the left of the azure marker pixel (index `j-1`).
    details:
      - The block maintains its original color and size.
      - The space previously occupied by the block is filled with white (0).
      - The azure marker pixel remains unchanged in position and color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single azure (8) pixel and note its column index (`marker_col`).
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of a single color that is not white (0) or azure (8). Note its color, its starting column index (`block_start_col`), and its ending column index (`block_end_col`). Calculate its length (`block_length = block_end_col - block_start_col + 1`).
3.  Determine the target end column index for the block in the output grid: `target_end_col = marker_col - 1`.
4.  Determine the target start column index for the block in the output grid: `target_start_col = target_end_col - block_length + 1`.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
6.  Place the identified block (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at `target_start_col` and ending at `target_end_col`.
7.  Place the azure (8) pixel into the output grid at its original `marker_col`.
