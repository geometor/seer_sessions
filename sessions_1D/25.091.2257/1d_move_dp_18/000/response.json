The width varies slightly across examples but seems consistent within each input/output pair (e.g., 1x17 in train_1).\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and one other dominant color per example (orange (7) in train_1, magenta (6) in train_2, gray (5) in train_3).\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   There is always a contiguous horizontal block of a single color (orange, magenta, or gray).\n    *   There is always a single azure (8) pixel.\n    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Relationships & Transformation:**\n    *   In the input, the azure pixel is always located two positions to the right of the rightmost pixel of the colored block.\n    *   In the output, the colored block has shifted to the right.\n    *   The key change is the position of the colored block. Its rightmost pixel in the output is now immediately to the left of the original position of the azure pixel.\n    *   The size of the colored block remains unchanged.\n    *   The azure pixel remains in its original position.\n    *   The area previously occupied by the colored block is filled with white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
