*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are 1D arrays (or single-row grids) of colored pixels.
    *   Each input array contains exactly one magenta pixel (6).
    *   Each input array contains one contiguous block of a single non-white, non-magenta color (e.g., green, gray, blue).
    *   The remaining pixels are white (0).
    *   In the input, there may be white pixels located between the end of the colored block and the magenta pixel.
    *   The transformation involves moving the colored block so that it is immediately adjacent to (just before) the magenta pixel.
    *   The white pixels originally positioned between the colored block and the magenta pixel are relocated to the position immediately preceding the start of the colored block.
    *   The relative order of pixels within the colored block remains unchanged.
    *   The relative order of the white pixels that are moved remains unchanged.
    *   The positions of the magenta pixel and any white pixels *not* originally between the colored block and the magenta pixel remain unchanged relative to the overall structure shift.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - id: color_block
        description: A contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not magenta (6). There is exactly one such block per input.
        properties:
          - color: A single color from 1-5, 7-9.
          - length: The number of pixels in the block.
          - start_index: The starting position of the block in the input array.
          - end_index: The ending position of the block in the input array.
      - id: magenta_pixel
        description: A single pixel with the color magenta (6). There is exactly one such pixel per input.
        properties:
          - color: 6 (magenta)
          - index: The position of the magenta pixel in the input array.
      - id: gap_pixels
        description: A sequence of zero or more white pixels (0) located directly between the `color_block` and the `magenta_pixel` in the input array.
        properties:
          - color: 0 (white)
          - count: The number of white pixels in the gap.
          - start_index: The position immediately after `color_block.end_index`.
          - end_index: The position immediately before `magenta_pixel.index`.
      - id: other_pixels
        description: All other pixels in the input array not part of `color_block`, `magenta_pixel`, or `gap_pixels`.
        properties:
          - color: Primarily white (0), but could include pixels to the right of `magenta_pixel`.
          - relative_positions: Maintained with respect to the start/end of the array and the `magenta_pixel`.

    actions:
      - id: identify_elements
        description: Locate the `color_block`, `magenta_pixel`, and `gap_pixels` within the input array.
      - id: relocate_gap
        description: Remove the `gap_pixels` from their original position between the `color_block` and `magenta_pixel`.
      - id: insert_gap
        description: Insert the removed `gap_pixels` immediately before the original `start_index` of the `color_block`.

    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: In the output, the `color_block`'s end index is immediately followed by the `magenta_pixel`'s index.
      - type: ordering
        description: The relative order of pixels within the `color_block` is preserved. The relative order of pixels within the `gap_pixels` is preserved. The relative order of `other_pixels` (not involved in the swap) is preserved relative to the array boundaries and the `magenta_pixel`.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single magenta pixel (color 6) and its index (`magenta_index`).
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor magenta (6). Determine its start index (`block_start`), end index (`block_end`), and the block itself (`color_block`).
    3.  Identify the sequence of white pixels (color 0) located between the end of the `color_block` and the `magenta_pixel`. These are the `gap_pixels`, ranging from index `block_end + 1` to `magenta_index - 1`.
    4.  Create the output array by rearranging the elements of the input array:
        a.  Take all pixels from the start of the input array up to (but not including) `block_start`.
        b.  Append the `gap_pixels`.
        c.  Append the `color_block`.
        d.  Append the magenta pixel.
        e.  Append all remaining pixels from the input array (those originally after the magenta pixel).
