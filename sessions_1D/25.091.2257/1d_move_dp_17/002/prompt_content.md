"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by moving a contiguous block of non-background, 
non-anchor color pixels so that its right end is adjacent to the left of a fixed 
anchor pixel (azure/8).

1. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, 
   filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2. Find the index of the single azure (8) pixel (anchor) in the input grid. 
   Place an azure (8) pixel at the same index in the output grid.
3. Find the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is 
   not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color and its length.
4. Calculate the target position for this block in the output grid such that 
   its rightmost pixel is at the index immediately preceding the anchor pixel's index.
5. Fill the calculated target indices in the output grid with the recorded color 
   of the block.
