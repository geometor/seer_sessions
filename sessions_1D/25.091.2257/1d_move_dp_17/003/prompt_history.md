*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of the same size (1x16).
    *   Each input grid contains three types of elements:
        1.  Background pixels (white/0).
        2.  A single, fixed anchor pixel (azure/8).
        3.  A contiguous block of a single color (blue/1 or red/2), which changes position.
    *   The output grid retains the background pixels and the anchor pixel in their original positions.
    *   The colored block (blue or red) is shifted horizontally to the right.
    *   The final position of the colored block in the output grid is always immediately to the left of the anchor (azure/8) pixel. The rightmost pixel of the block becomes adjacent to the anchor pixel.
    *   The color and length of the block remain unchanged during the transformation.

*   **Facts:**

    actions:
      - identify: locate the anchor pixel (azure/8).
      - identify: locate the contiguous movable_block (non-white/0, non-azure/8).
      - determine: record the color and length of the movable_block.
      - calculate: determine the target position for the movable_block. The target end index is the index immediately preceding the anchor pixel's index.
      - transform: place the movable_block at its calculated target position in the output grid, preserving its color and length.
      - transform: place the anchor pixel at its original position in the output grid.
      - transform: fill all other positions with the background color (white/0).
    relationships:
      - adjacency: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the movable_block is adjacent (left side) to the anchor pixel.
      - reference_point: The anchor pixel's position determines the final position of the movable_block.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
    2.  Find the index of the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid. Let this be `anchor_index`. Place an azure (8) pixel at `anchor_index` in the output grid.
    3.  Find the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color and its length (`block_length`).
    4.  Calculate the target ending index for this block in the output grid as `target_end_index = anchor_index - 1`.
    5.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output grid as `target_start_index = target_end_index - block_length + 1`.
    6.  Fill the cells in the output grid from `target_start_index` to `target_end_index` (inclusive) with the recorded color of the block.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The error `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` strongly indicates that a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values was used in a context expecting a single boolean (e.g., `if array:` or `bool(array)` or logical operators `and`/`or`).

Based on the code structure and the error message, the most likely cause is that the input grid, although conceptually 1D for this task, might be represented as a 2D array with one row (e.g., shape `(1, 16)`) instead of a 1D array (shape `(16,)`).

If `input_array` has shape `(1, 16)`:
1.  `np.where(input_array == 8)` returns `(array([0]), array([10]))`, representing (row_indices, col_indices). The original code `np.where(input_array == 8)[0]` incorrectly extracts `array([0])` (the row indices) instead of the column index.
2.  The loop in `find_movable_block` (`for i, pixel in enumerate(input_array)`) iterates once, with `pixel` being the entire row `array([0, 1, ..., 8, ..., 0])`.
3.  The comparison `pixel != 0` then becomes `array([...]) != 0`, resulting in a boolean array like `array([False, True, ..., False, ..., False])`.
4.  The expression `(pixel != 0 and pixel != 8)` attempts to perform a logical `and` between two such boolean arrays, triggering the ambiguity error.

**Strategy:** The core logic of identifying the anchor, identifying the movable block, and repositioning it seems correct based on the examples. The fix involves ensuring the input grid is consistently treated as a 1D array within the `transform` function, regardless of whether it's passed as a flat list, a list containing one list, or a 1xN NumPy array. We will flatten the input if it's 1xN and adjust the extraction of the anchor index accordingly.

**Metrics Analysis:**

*   **Input Shape:** The inputs are conceptually 1D, but can be represented as 1D (`(16,)`) or 2D (`(1, 16)`) arrays.
*   **Anchor Finding:**
    *   For 1D input `arr_1d`, `np.where(arr_1d == 8)` returns `(array([index]),)`. The correct index is obtained via `[0][0]`.
    *   For 2D input `arr_2d`, `np.where(arr_2d == 8)` returns `(array([row]), array([col]))`. The correct index requires `[1][0]`.
*   **Movable Block:** The logic correctly identifies the block color, length, and start index when operating on the 1D array representation.
*   **Error Trigger:** The analysis confirms (`"error_trigger_2d_input": true`) that passing a 2D (1xN) array directly into the `find_movable_block` function (as implemented previously) would indeed cause the "ambiguous truth value" error due to element-wise comparison results being used with `and`.

This confirms the assessment: the code needs to handle potential 1xN input formats by flattening them to 1D before proceeding with anchor/block finding and placement.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: Primarily 1D (single row), potentially represented as 1xN 2D grid.
input_format_handling: Input grid must be treated as a 1D sequence, flattening necessary if provided as 1xN.
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    count: variable
    behavior: static (fills empty space)
  - type: anchor
    color: azure (8)
    count: 1
    shape: single_pixel
    behavior: static (position fixed)
  - type: movable_block
    color: non_white_non_azure (e.g., blue/1, red/2)
    count: 1
    shape: contiguous_horizontal_block
    properties:
      - length: variable
      - color: variable (consistent within block)
    behavior: shifts_horizontally
actions:
  - preprocess: Ensure the input grid is treated as a 1D array (flatten if necessary).
  - identify: locate the index of the single anchor pixel (azure/8) in the 1D input array.
  - identify: locate the contiguous movable_block (non-white/0, non-azure/8) in the 1D input array.
  - determine: record the color and length of the movable_block.
  - calculate: determine the target end index for the movable_block. Target end index = (anchor index) - 1.
  - calculate: determine the target start index for the movable_block. Target start index = (target end index) - (block length) + 1.
  - transform: create an output 1D array of the same size, filled with the background color (white/0).
  - transform: place the anchor pixel at its original index in the output array.
  - transform: place the movable_block (using its recorded color) into the output array spanning from the calculated target start index to the target end index (inclusive).
relationships:
  - adjacency: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the movable_block must be adjacent (to the left) of the anchor pixel.
  - reference_point: The anchor pixel's position dictates the final position of the movable_block.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid. Ensure it is treated as a single, 1-dimensional sequence of pixels (if input is 2D like `[[...]]`, flatten it to `[...]`). Let the length be `N`.
2.  Create a new 1D output sequence of length `N`, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Find the index (position) of the single azure (8) pixel in the input sequence. Let this be `anchor_index`. Place an azure (8) pixel at `anchor_index` in the output sequence.
4.  Find the first contiguous block of pixels in the input sequence whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8). Record this block's color (`block_color`) and its length (`block_length`).
5.  Calculate the target ending index for this block in the output sequence: `target_end_index = anchor_index - 1`.
6.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output sequence: `target_start_index = target_end_index - block_length + 1`.
7.  Fill the positions in the output sequence from `target_start_index` up to and including `target_end_index` with the recorded `block_color`.
8.  Return the completed output sequence.
