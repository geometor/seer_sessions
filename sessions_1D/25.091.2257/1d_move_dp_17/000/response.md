*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of the same size (1x16).
    *   Each input grid contains three types of elements:
        1.  Background pixels (white/0).
        2.  A single, fixed anchor pixel (azure/8).
        3.  A contiguous block of a single color (blue/1 or red/2), which changes position.
    *   The output grid retains the background pixels and the anchor pixel in their original positions.
    *   The colored block (blue or red) is shifted horizontally to the right.
    *   The final position of the colored block in the output grid is always immediately to the left of the anchor (azure/8) pixel. The rightmost pixel of the block becomes adjacent to the anchor pixel.
    *   The color and length of the block remain unchanged during the transformation.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_manipulation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    objects:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        count: variable
        behavior: static (fills empty space)
      - type: anchor
        color: azure (8)
        count: 1
        shape: single_pixel
        behavior: static (position fixed)
      - type: movable_block
        color: non_white_non_azure (e.g., blue/1, red/2)
        count: 1
        shape: contiguous_horizontal_block
        properties:
          - length: variable
          - color: variable (consistent within block)
        behavior: shifts_right
    actions:
      - identify: locate the anchor pixel (azure/8).
      - identify: locate the contiguous movable_block (non-white/0, non-azure/8).
      - determine: record the color and length of the movable_block.
      - calculate: determine the target position for the movable_block. The target end index is the index immediately preceding the anchor pixel's index.
      - transform: place the movable_block at its calculated target position in the output grid, preserving its color and length.
      - transform: place the anchor pixel at its original position in the output grid.
      - transform: fill all other positions with the background color (white/0).
    relationships:
      - adjacency: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the movable_block is adjacent (left side) to the anchor pixel.
      - reference_point: The anchor pixel's position determines the final position of the movable_block.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
    2.  Find the index of the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid. Let this be `anchor_index`. Place an azure (8) pixel at `anchor_index` in the output grid.
    3.  Find the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color and its length (`block_length`).
    4.  Calculate the target ending index for this block in the output grid as `target_end_index = anchor_index - 1`.
    5.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output grid as `target_start_index = target_end_index - block_length + 1`.
    6.  Fill the cells in the output grid from `target_start_index` to `target_end_index` (inclusive) with the recorded color of the block.
