Background pixels (white/0).\n        2.  A single, fixed anchor pixel (azure/8).\n        3.  A contiguous block of a single color (blue/1 or red/2), which changes position.\n    *   The output grid retains the background pixels and the anchor pixel in their original positions.\n    *   The colored block (blue or red) is shifted horizontally to the right.\n    *   The final position of the colored block in the output grid is always immediately to the left of the anchor (azure/8) pixel. The rightmost pixel of the block becomes adjacent to the anchor pixel.\n    *   The color and length of the block remain unchanged during the transformation.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
