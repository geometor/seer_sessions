task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
grid_size: 10 # All examples are 1x10
element_types:
  - background:
      color: white (0)
      quantity: variable
      role: filler/space
  - colored_block:
      color: variable (non-white, non-gray)
      shape: contiguous horizontal segment
      quantity: 1 per grid
      role: primary object being moved
  - stopper:
      color: gray (5)
      shape: single pixel
      quantity: 1 per grid
      role: boundary/destination marker
transformations:
  - type: translation
    target: colored_block
    direction: right
    termination_condition: adjacency (left side) to the stopper pixel
  - type: collection_and_placement
    target: background pixels (white)
    destination: leftmost available positions before the translated colored_block
preserved_properties:
  - grid_dimensions
  - pixel values within the colored_block (relative order)
  - absolute position of the stopper pixel (gray)
