Let's call this the \"colored block\". Its length varies between examples.\n    *   A single gray pixel (5). Its position is near or at the right end of the grid.\n    *   Multiple white pixels (0) filling the remaining space.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a spatial rearrangement of the pixels within the row.\n    *   The colored block shifts its position to the right.\n    *   The gray pixel appears to remain fixed relative to the grid's right boundary *or* acts as a stopping point for the colored block.\n    *   The white pixels also change position, filling the space vacated by the colored block and the space to its left in the output.\n5.  **Inferred Rule:** The colored block moves rightwards until it is immediately adjacent to the left side of the gray pixel. The white pixels are then placed contiguously in the positions to the left of the moved colored block. The gray pixel retains its original position relative to the end of the grid (which also seems to be its absolute position in these examples). The relative order of pixels *within* the colored block is preserved.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the single gray pixel (5) and note its index (`stopper_index`).\n3.  Determine the length of the `colored_block` (`block_length`).\n4.  Calculate the target starting index for the `colored_block` in the output grid: `target_start_index = stopper_index - block_length`.\n5.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with white (0).\n6.  Place the `colored_block` into the new grid starting at `target_start_index`.\n7.  Place the gray pixel (5) into the new grid at `stopper_index`.\n8.  The remaining positions in the new grid (from index 0 up to `target_start_index - 1`, and any positions after `stopper_index` if the gray pixel wasn't originally at the end) should already be filled with the initial white (0) pixels. Ensure the final grid length matches the input grid length."
