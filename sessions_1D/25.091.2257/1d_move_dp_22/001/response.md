Transformation rule:
1. Identify the magenta pixel (6) and its position.
2. Identify the contiguous horizontal block of a color other than white (0) or magenta (6). Note its color and length.
3. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
4. Place the magenta pixel in the output grid at its original position.
5. Calculate the target start position for the block: (magenta position - block length).
6. Place the identified block into the output grid starting at the calculated target position, ensuring it ends immediately to the left of the magenta pixel.
