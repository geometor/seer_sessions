task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1xN (Observed: 1x14)
  output: 1xN (Same as input)
objects:
  - id: main_block
    description: A single contiguous horizontal sequence of identical pixels with color C, where C is not white (0) and not magenta (6).
    properties:
      color: Varies (green '3' or orange '7' in examples). Excludes white '0' and magenta '6'.
      shape: Horizontal line segment.
      length: Varies.
      position: Varies in the input.
  - id: marker
    description: A single magenta pixel (color 6).
    properties:
      color: magenta '6'
      shape: Single pixel.
      position: Varies in the input grid row, but its index remains constant between input and output.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels filling the rest of the grid.
    properties:
      color: white '0'
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: marker
    output_property: marker_index (column index)
  - action: identify
    target: main_block
    output_properties: [block_color, block_length]
  - action: calculate_position
    input_properties: [marker_index, block_length]
    output_property: target_start_index
    formula: target_start_index = marker_index - block_length
  - action: construct_output
    details: Create a new 1xN grid filled with the background color.
  - action: place
    target: marker
    grid: output
    position: marker_index
  - action: place
    target: main_block (using identified block_color and block_length)
    grid: output
    position: Starting at target_start_index, extending for block_length pixels.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency (in output)
    object1: main_block (rightmost pixel)
    object2: marker
    details: The rightmost pixel of the main_block is at index `marker_index - 1`.
  - type: position_invariance
    object: marker
    details: The column index of the marker pixel is the same in the input and output grids.
