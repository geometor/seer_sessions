            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly indicates that the `transform` function, or the code calling it, encountered a situation where a NumPy array was used in a boolean context (e.g., `if my_array:`). This is disallowed because it's unclear whether the condition should be true if *any* element is true or if *all* elements are true.\n\nBased on the previous code, the most likely culprit is the initial check `if not input_grid or len(input_grid) != 1:`. If `input_grid` is passed as a NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[...]])`), the `not input_grid` part triggers this error.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the initial input validation within the `transform` function to correctly handle both standard Python lists (`List[List[int]]`) and NumPy arrays (`np.ndarray`) as potential input formats, ensuring the function extracts the single row of data correctly regardless of the input type before proceeding with the core transformation logic. The core logic itself (finding the marker, finding the block, calculating the new position, and rebuilding the output) appears sound based on the examples.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nWe will re-examine the examples to confirm the pattern and ensure the logic holds. We assume the input is a single row (1xN grid).\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (1x14)\n    *   Marker (color 6) Position: Index 8\n    *   Main Block: Color 3 (green), Length 4\n    *   Calculation: Target start index = 8 - 4 = 4. Block occupies indices 4, 5, 6, 7.\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]` (1x14)\n    *   Marker (color 6) Position: Index 12\n    *   Main Block: Color 7 (orange), Length 8\n    *   Calculation: Target start index = 12 - 8 = 4. Block occupies indices 4 through 11.\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]` (Matches)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]` (1x14)\n    *   Marker (color 6) Position: Index 12\n    *   Main Block: Color 3 (green), Length 5\n    *   Calculation: Target start index = 12 - 5 = 7. Block occupies indices 7 through 11.\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0]` (Matches)\n\nThe transformation logic consistently involves finding the magenta marker, finding the contiguous colored block, and shifting the block so its right edge is immediately to the left of the marker. The input validation needs correction, but the core algorithm appears correct.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
