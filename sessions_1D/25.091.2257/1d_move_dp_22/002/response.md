**General Assessment:**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that the `transform` function, or the code calling it, encountered a situation where a NumPy array was used in a boolean context (e.g., `if my_array:`). This is disallowed because it's unclear whether the condition should be true if *any* element is true or if *all* elements are true.

Based on the previous code, the most likely culprit is the initial check `if not input_grid or len(input_grid) != 1:`. If `input_grid` is passed as a NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[...]])`), the `not input_grid` part triggers this error.

The strategy is to modify the initial input validation within the `transform` function to correctly handle both standard Python lists (`List[List[int]]`) and NumPy arrays (`np.ndarray`) as potential input formats, ensuring the function extracts the single row of data correctly regardless of the input type before proceeding with the core transformation logic. The core logic itself (finding the marker, finding the block, calculating the new position, and rebuilding the output) appears sound based on the examples.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

We will re-examine the examples to confirm the pattern and ensure the logic holds. We assume the input is a single row (1xN grid).

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (1x14)
    *   Marker (color 6) Position: Index 8
    *   Main Block: Color 3 (green), Length 4
    *   Calculation: Target start index = 8 - 4 = 4. Block occupies indices 4, 5, 6, 7.
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]` (1x14)
    *   Marker (color 6) Position: Index 12
    *   Main Block: Color 7 (orange), Length 8
    *   Calculation: Target start index = 12 - 8 = 4. Block occupies indices 4 through 11.
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]` (Matches)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]` (1x14)
    *   Marker (color 6) Position: Index 12
    *   Main Block: Color 3 (green), Length 5
    *   Calculation: Target start index = 12 - 5 = 7. Block occupies indices 7 through 11.
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0]` (Matches)

The transformation logic consistently involves finding the magenta marker, finding the contiguous colored block, and shifting the block so its right edge is immediately to the left of the marker. The input validation needs correction, but the core algorithm appears correct.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Verify the input grid is a single row (1xN, where N > 0). Handle potential list or NumPy array input formats. Extract the single row of pixel data and determine its width (N).
2.  Create a new output row of the same width (N), initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
3.  Iterate through the input row to find the magenta pixel (color 6). Record its column index (`marker_index`). Place the magenta pixel at `marker_index` in the output row.
4.  Iterate through the input row again to find the contiguous horizontal block of pixels whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* magenta (6). Record the color (`block_color`) and length (`block_length`) of this block. Assume there is exactly one such block per input row.
5.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the output row using the formula: `target_start_index = marker_index - block_length`.
6.  Place the identified block into the output row: Starting at `target_start_index`, fill the next `block_length` pixels with `block_color`.
7.  Return the completed output row, formatted as a grid (e.g., a list containing the single output row).
