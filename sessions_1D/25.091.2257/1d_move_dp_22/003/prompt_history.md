**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** All input examples are 1x14 grids (single rows).
2.  **Key Objects:**
    *   A contiguous horizontal block of a single color (green or orange). Let's call this the "main block".
    *   A single magenta pixel (color 6), acting as a marker or boundary.
    *   White pixels (color 0) filling the remaining space.
3.  **Relationships:** The main block and the magenta pixel are separated by zero or more white pixels in the input.
4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are also 1x14, containing the same colors and objects as the input.
5.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation is the horizontal shift (translation) of the "main block". Its final position appears to be determined by the position of the magenta pixel. Specifically, the main block moves rightwards until its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the magenta pixel. The magenta pixel itself does not move. The relative order of pixels within the main block remains unchanged. White pixels fill the space not occupied by the shifted main block or the magenta pixel.

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
2.  Identify the single magenta pixel (color 6) in the input grid and record its column index. Place this magenta pixel at the same column index in the output grid.
3.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white (color > 0), non-magenta (color != 6) pixels in the input grid. Record its color and its length (number of pixels).
4.  Determine the target starting column index for this block in the output grid. This index is calculated as: `(magenta_pixel_column_index - block_length)`.
5.  Place the identified block (using its recorded color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated target starting column index and extending to the right until the column index `(magenta_pixel_column_index - 1)`.

## Example 1:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that the `transform` function, or the code calling it, encountered a situation where a NumPy array was used in a boolean context (e.g., `if my_array:`). This is disallowed because it's unclear whether the condition should be true if *any* element is true or if *all* elements are true.

Based on the previous code, the most likely culprit is the initial check `if not input_grid or len(input_grid) != 1:`. If `input_grid` is passed as a NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[...]])`), the `not input_grid` part triggers this error.

The strategy is to modify the initial input validation within the `transform` function to correctly handle both standard Python lists (`List[List[int]]`) and NumPy arrays (`np.ndarray`) as potential input formats, ensuring the function extracts the single row of data correctly regardless of the input type before proceeding with the core transformation logic. The core logic itself (finding the marker, finding the block, calculating the new position, and rebuilding the output) appears sound based on the examples.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

We will re-examine the examples to confirm the pattern and ensure the logic holds. We assume the input is a single row (1xN grid).

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (1x14)
    *   Marker (color 6) Position: Index 8
    *   Main Block: Color 3 (green), Length 4
    *   Calculation: Target start index = 8 - 4 = 4. Block occupies indices 4, 5, 6, 7.
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]` (1x14)
    *   Marker (color 6) Position: Index 12
    *   Main Block: Color 7 (orange), Length 8
    *   Calculation: Target start index = 12 - 8 = 4. Block occupies indices 4 through 11.
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]` (Matches)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]` (1x14)
    *   Marker (color 6) Position: Index 12
    *   Main Block: Color 3 (green), Length 5
    *   Calculation: Target start index = 12 - 5 = 7. Block occupies indices 7 through 11.
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0]` (Matches)

The transformation logic consistently involves finding the magenta marker, finding the contiguous colored block, and shifting the block so its right edge is immediately to the left of the marker. The input validation needs correction, but the core algorithm appears correct.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Verify the input grid is a single row (1xN, where N > 0). Handle potential list or NumPy array input formats. Extract the single row of pixel data and determine its width (N).
2.  Create a new output row of the same width (N), initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
3.  Iterate through the input row to find the magenta pixel (color 6). Record its column index (`marker_index`). Place the magenta pixel at `marker_index` in the output row.
4.  Iterate through the input row again to find the contiguous horizontal block of pixels whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* magenta (6). Record the color (`block_color`) and length (`block_length`) of this block. Assume there is exactly one such block per input row.
5.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the output row using the formula: `target_start_index = marker_index - block_length`.
6.  Place the identified block into the output row: Starting at `target_start_index`, fill the next `block_length` pixels with `block_color`.
7.  Return the completed output row, formatted as a grid (e.g., a list containing the single output row).
