Let's call this the \"main block\".\n    *   A single magenta pixel (color 6), acting as a marker or boundary.\n    *   White pixels (color 0) filling the remaining space.\n3.  **Relationships:** The main block and the magenta pixel are separated by zero or more white pixels in the input.\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are also 1x14, containing the same colors and objects as the input.\n5.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation is the horizontal shift (translation) of the \"main block\". Its final position appears to be determined by the position of the magenta pixel. Specifically, the main block moves rightwards until its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the magenta pixel. The magenta pixel itself does not move. The relative order of pixels within the main block remains unchanged. White pixels fill the space not occupied by the shifted main block or the magenta pixel.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
