task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1x14
  output: 1x14
objects:
  - id: main_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of identical non-white, non-magenta pixels.
    properties:
      color: Varies (green '3' or orange '7' in examples).
      shape: Horizontal line segment.
      length: Varies.
      position: Varies in the input.
  - id: marker
    description: A single magenta pixel.
    properties:
      color: magenta '6'
      shape: Single pixel.
      position: Varies in the input, but remains fixed relative to the grid boundaries during transformation.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels filling the rest of the grid.
    properties:
      color: white '0'
actions:
  - action: shift
    target: main_block
    constraints:
      - type: relative_positioning
        reference_object: marker
        details: The main_block is moved horizontally such that its rightmost pixel becomes adjacent to the left side of the marker pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency

    object2: marker (left side)
    state: established in output
  - type: immutability
    object: marker
    property: position
    state: maintained between input and output
