Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN 2D grids).
Each input grid contains three main components:
1.  A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (blue, orange, or red in the examples). This color is never white (0) or maroon (9). This block always starts at or near the left edge.
2.  A single maroon (9) pixel located somewhere to the right of the colored block.
3.  White (0) pixels acting as background or spacing, primarily located between the colored block and the maroon pixel, and potentially at the beginning or end of the grid.

The transformation involves moving the colored block horizontally to the right.
The maroon pixel acts as a fixed anchor point.
The colored block moves until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the maroon pixel.
The space originally occupied by the colored block becomes white (0).
The maroon pixel and any pixels to its right remain unchanged in their positions and colors.
The relative order and color of pixels within the moving block are preserved.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Move a colored block next to a fixed anchor pixel.

Input_Features:
  - Grid_Type: 1-dimensional array (or 1xN grid).
  - Objects:
      - Moving_Block:
          - Type: Contiguous sequence of pixels.
          - Color: Single color, not white (0) or maroon (9).
          - Position: Initially located towards the left side.
          - Properties: Has a specific length and color.
      - Anchor_Pixel:
          - Type: Single pixel.
          - Color: Maroon (9).
          - Position: Fixed, located to the right of the Moving_Block.
          - Properties: Stationary marker.
      - Background_Pixels:
          - Type: Pixels.
          - Color: White (0).
          - Position: Fill remaining spaces, notably between Moving_Block and Anchor_Pixel.

Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal shift (rightward translation) of the Moving_Block.
  - Target_Position: The Moving_Block is repositioned so its rightmost pixel is at the index immediately preceding the Anchor_Pixel's index.
  - Side_Effects:
      - The original location of the Moving_Block is filled with Background_Pixels (white).
      - The Anchor_Pixel remains in its original position.
      - All pixels to the right of the Anchor_Pixel remain in their original positions and colors.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: The final state has the Moving_Block immediately adjacent to the left of the Anchor_Pixel.
  - Preservation: The color, length, and internal order of the Moving_Block are preserved. The position and color of the Anchor_Pixel and pixels to its right are preserved.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the "Moving Block": Find the first contiguous sequence of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its color, starting index (`block_start`), and ending index (`block_end`). Calculate its length (`block_length = block_end - block_start + 1`).
3.  Identify the "Anchor Pixel": Find the index of the maroon (9) pixel (`anchor_index`).
4.  Clear the original position of the Moving Block: Set the pixels in the output grid from `block_start` to `block_end` to white (0).
5.  Calculate the new position for the Moving Block: The new ending index will be `anchor_index - 1`. The new starting index will be `anchor_index - block_length`.
6.  Place the Moving Block in its new position: Set the pixels in the output grid from the new starting index to the new ending index using the recorded color of the Moving Block.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
