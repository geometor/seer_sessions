A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (blue, orange, or red in the examples). This color is never white (0) or maroon (9). This block always starts at or near the left edge.\n2.  A single maroon (9) pixel located somewhere to the right of the colored block.\n3.  White (0) pixels acting as background or spacing, primarily located between the colored block and the maroon pixel, and potentially at the beginning or end of the grid.\n\nThe transformation involves moving the colored block horizontally to the right.\nThe maroon pixel acts as a fixed anchor point.\nThe colored block moves until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the maroon pixel.\nThe space originally occupied by the colored block becomes white (0).\nThe maroon pixel and any pixels to its right remain unchanged in their positions and colors.\nThe relative order and color of pixels within the moving block are preserved.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the \"Moving Block\": Find the first contiguous sequence of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its color, starting index (`block_start`), and ending index (`block_end`). Calculate its length (`block_length = block_end - block_start + 1`).\n3.  Identify the \"Anchor Pixel\": Find the index of the maroon (9) pixel (`anchor_index`).\n4.  Clear the original position of the Moving Block: Set the pixels in the output grid from `block_start` to `block_end` to white (0).\n5.  Calculate the new position for the Moving Block: The new ending index will be `anchor_index - 1`. The new starting index will be `anchor_index - block_length`.\n6.  Place the Moving Block in its new position: Set the pixels in the output grid from the new starting index to the new ending index using the recorded color of the Moving Block.\n7.
