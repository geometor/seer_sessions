Task: Move a colored block next to a fixed anchor pixel.

Input_Features:
  - Grid_Type: 1-dimensional array (or 1xN grid).
  - Objects:
      - Moving_Block:
          - Type: Contiguous sequence of pixels.
          - Color: Single color, not white (0) or maroon (9).
          - Position: Initially located towards the left side.
          - Properties: Has a specific length and color.
      - Anchor_Pixel:
          - Type: Single pixel.
          - Color: Maroon (9).
          - Position: Fixed, located to the right of the Moving_Block.
          - Properties: Stationary marker.
      - Background_Pixels:
          - Type: Pixels.
          - Color: White (0).
          - Position: Fill remaining spaces, notably between Moving_Block and Anchor_Pixel.

Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal shift (rightward translation) of the Moving_Block.
  - Target_Position: The Moving_Block is repositioned so its rightmost pixel is at the index immediately preceding the Anchor_Pixel's index.
  - Side_Effects:
      - The original location of the Moving_Block is filled with Background_Pixels (white).
      - The Anchor_Pixel remains in its original position.
      - All pixels to the right of the Anchor_Pixel remain in their original positions and colors.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: The final state has the Moving_Block immediately adjacent to the left of the Anchor_Pixel.
  - Preservation: The color, length, and internal order of the Moving_Block are preserved. The position and color of the Anchor_Pixel and pixels to its right are preserved.
