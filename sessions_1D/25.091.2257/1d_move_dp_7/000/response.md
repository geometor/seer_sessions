Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

### Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve input and output grids that are 1 row high and 7 columns wide (1x7).
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), green (3), red (2), and azure (8).
3.  **Input Pattern:**
    *   The last pixel (column index 6) in the input is always azure (8).
    *   The first 6 pixels (indices 0-5) contain a mix of white (0) pixels and a single contiguous block of another color (green or red).
    *   In examples 2 and 3, this non-white block is adjacent to a block of white pixels of the same size (3 pixels).
    *   In example 1, the non-white block `[3, 3, 3]` is surrounded by white pixels `[0]` and `[0, 0]`.
    *   The total number of white pixels among the first 6 positions is always 3.
    *   The single contiguous block of non-white color among the first 6 positions always has a length of 3.
4.  **Output Pattern:**
    *   The last pixel (column index 6) in the output is always azure (8), same as the input.
    *   The first 6 pixels of the output consist of a block of 3 white (0) pixels followed by a block of 3 non-white pixels (matching the non-white color from the input). `[0, 0, 0, C, C, C]` where C is the non-white color from the input prefix.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation rearranges the first 6 pixels. It identifies the contiguous block of non-white color (excluding the final azure pixel) and all the white pixels within the first 6 positions. It then reconstructs the first 6 positions by placing all the white pixels first, followed by the non-white block. The final azure pixel remains unchanged in its position.

### Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: array
      - dimensions: [1, 7] # height, width
      - cells: pixels with color values 0-9

constant_features:
  - feature: final_pixel
    description: The pixel at the last position (index 6) is always azure (8).
    location: grid[0, 6]
    input_value: 8
    output_value: 8

variable_features:
  - feature: prefix_sequence
    description: The sequence of the first 6 pixels (indices 0-5).
    location: grid[0, 0:6]
    contains:
      - white_pixels:
          color: 0
          count: 3 (in all examples)
          arrangement: variable (can be one or more contiguous blocks)
      - non_white_block:
          color: varies (e.g., green=3, red=2)
          count: 1 contiguous block
          length: 3 (in all examples)
          arrangement: variable position within the prefix

transformation:
  - type: rearrangement
    scope: prefix_sequence (first 6 pixels)
    input_objects:
      - white_pixels (color 0) from prefix
      - non_white_block (color != 0 and != 8) from prefix
    output_structure:
      - description: Concatenation of grouped pixels followed by the constant final pixel.
      - step_1: Group all white pixels from the input prefix together.
      - step_2: Identify the contiguous non-white block from the input prefix.
      - step_3: Place the grouped white pixels first.
      - step_4: Place the non-white block immediately after the white pixels.
      - step_5: Append the original final azure pixel.
    result: Output grid always has the structure [0, 0, 0, C, C, C, 8], where C is the color of the non_white_block from the input prefix.

```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the input grid (always 1x7).
2.  Isolate the sequence of the first 6 pixels (the "prefix") and the final pixel (always azure 8).
3.  Within the prefix, identify the single contiguous block of pixels whose color is not white (0). Store the color and length of this block.
4.  Count the total number of white (0) pixels within the prefix.
5.  Construct the output grid:
    a.  Create a sequence of white (0) pixels with a length equal to the count found in step 4.
    b.  Append the non-white block identified in step 3 to this sequence of white pixels.
    c.  Append the final azure (8) pixel (isolated in step 2) to the end of the combined sequence.
6.  The resulting sequence is the output grid.
