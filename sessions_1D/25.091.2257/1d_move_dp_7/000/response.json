            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve input and output grids that are 1 row high and 7 columns wide (1x7).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), green (3), red (2), and azure (8).\n3.  **Input Pattern:**\n    *   The last pixel (column index 6) in the input is always azure (8).\n    *   The first 6 pixels (indices 0-5) contain a mix of white (0) pixels and a single contiguous block of another color (green or red).\n    *   In examples 2 and 3, this non-white block is adjacent to a block of white pixels of the same size (3 pixels).\n    *   In example 1, the non-white block `[3, 3, 3]` is surrounded by white pixels `[0]` and `[0, 0]`.\n    *   The total number of white pixels among the first 6 positions is always 3.\n    *   The single contiguous block of non-white color among the first 6 positions always has a length of 3.\n4.  **Output Pattern:**\n    *   The last pixel (column index 6) in the output is always azure (8), same as the input.\n    *   The first 6 pixels of the output consist of a block of 3 white (0) pixels followed by a block of 3 non-white pixels (matching the non-white color from the input). `[0, 0, 0, C, C, C]` where C is the non-white color from the input prefix.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation rearranges the first 6 pixels. It identifies the contiguous block of non-white color (excluding the final azure pixel) and all the white pixels within the first 6 positions. It then reconstructs the first 6 positions by placing all the white pixels first, followed by the non-white block. The final azure pixel remains unchanged in its position.\n\n### Facts\n\n"
