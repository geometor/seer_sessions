task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: array
      - dimensions: [1, 7] # height, width
      - cells: pixels with color values 0-9

constant_features:
  - feature: final_pixel
    description: The pixel at the last position (index 6) is always azure (8).
    location: grid[0, 6]
    input_value: 8
    output_value: 8

variable_features:
  - feature: prefix_sequence
    description: The sequence of the first 6 pixels (indices 0-5).
    location: grid[0, 0:6]
    contains:
      - white_pixels:
          color: 0
          count: 3 (in all examples)
          arrangement: variable (can be one or more contiguous blocks)
      - non_white_block:
          color: varies (e.g., green=3, red=2)
          count: 1 contiguous block
          length: 3 (in all examples)
          arrangement: variable position within the prefix

transformation:
  - type: rearrangement
    scope: prefix_sequence (first 6 pixels)
    input_objects:
      - white_pixels (color 0) from prefix
      - non_white_block (color != 0 and != 8) from prefix
    output_structure:
      - description: Concatenation of grouped pixels followed by the constant final pixel.
      - step_1: Group all white pixels from the input prefix together.
      - step_2: Identify the contiguous non-white block from the input prefix.
      - step_3: Place the grouped white pixels first.
      - step_4: Place the non-white block immediately after the white pixels.
      - step_5: Append the original final azure pixel.
    result: Output grid always has the structure [0, 0, 0, C, C, C, 8], where C is the color of the non_white_block from the input prefix.
