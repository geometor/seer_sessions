"""
Transforms a 1x7 input grid by rearranging the first 6 pixels. 
It identifies a contiguous block of 3 non-white pixels (excluding the final azure pixel) 
and all the white pixels within the first 6 positions. 
It then reconstructs the first 6 positions by placing all the white pixels first, 
followed by the non-white block. The final azure pixel (index 6) remains unchanged.
The output grid structure is [0, 0, 0, C, C, C, 8], where C is the color of the 
non-white block from the input prefix.
