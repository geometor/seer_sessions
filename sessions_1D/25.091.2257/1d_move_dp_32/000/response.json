The length of the row is consistent within each example pair (input and output have the same dimensions).\n2.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** The dominant color is white (0).\n    *   **Colored Block:** There is a single, contiguous horizontal block of a color other than white or yellow (magenta, azure, red in the examples).\n    *   **Marker:** There is a single yellow pixel (4).\n3.  **Relationships:** The primary relationship is spatial positioning within the row. The colored block and the yellow marker have distinct positions.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a horizontal shift (translation) of the colored block. The yellow marker's position remains unchanged and acts as a target or anchor point for the shift. The background (white pixels) adjusts to accommodate the shifted block.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to locate the contiguous block of color that is *not* white (0) or yellow (4). Record its color, starting column index, and ending column index. Calculate its length.\n3.  Scan the input grid to locate the single yellow marker pixel (4). Record its column index.\n4.  Determine the target starting column index for the colored block in the output grid. This is calculated as: `yellow_marker_index - block_length`.\n5.  Determine the target ending column index for the colored block in the output grid. This is calculated as: `yellow_marker_index - 1`.\n6.  Place the colored block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated target starting index and ending at the calculated target ending index.\n7.  Place the yellow marker pixel (4) into the output grid at its original column index (as found in step 3).\n8.  The output grid is now complete."
