task_description: Shift a colored block horizontally to be adjacent to a marker pixel.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  variable_size: false (input and output dimensions are identical per example)
objects:
  - object_type: block
    count: 1
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, not white (0) or yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: variable (magenta, azure, red in examples)
      - shape: horizontal segment (1 x Length)
      - length: variable
  - object_type: marker
    count: 1
    description: A single pixel used as a reference point.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: single pixel (1 x 1)
  - object_type: background
    description: Fills the rest of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: colored block
    details: Find its color, starting index, ending index, and length.
  - action: identify
    target: yellow marker
    details: Find its index.
  - action: shift
    target: colored block
    direction: horizontal
    reference_point: yellow marker's index
    condition: Position the rightmost pixel of the block immediately to the left of the yellow marker's index.
  - action: maintain
    target: yellow marker
    details: Keep the yellow marker in its original position in the output grid.
  - action: fill
    target: background
    details: Fill all other positions in the output grid with white pixels.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [colored block (right end), yellow marker]
    state: target state in output (block's right end at marker_index - 1)
  - type: position
    object: yellow marker
    state: constant (position remains unchanged between input and output)
