Okay, let's break down the perception, facts, and the transformation rule for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples operate on a single row (1xN grid). The length of the row is consistent within each example pair (input and output have the same dimensions).
2.  **Key Objects:**
    *   **Background:** The dominant color is white (0).
    *   **Colored Block:** There is a single, contiguous horizontal block of a color other than white or yellow (magenta, azure, red in the examples).
    *   **Marker:** There is a single yellow pixel (4).
3.  **Relationships:** The primary relationship is spatial positioning within the row. The colored block and the yellow marker have distinct positions.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a horizontal shift (translation) of the colored block. The yellow marker's position remains unchanged and acts as a target or anchor point for the shift. The background (white pixels) adjusts to accommodate the shifted block.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored block horizontally to be adjacent to a marker pixel.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  variable_size: false (input and output dimensions are identical per example)
objects:
  - object_type: block
    count: 1
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, not white (0) or yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: variable (magenta, azure, red in examples)
      - shape: horizontal segment (1 x Length)
      - length: variable
  - object_type: marker
    count: 1
    description: A single pixel used as a reference point.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: single pixel (1 x 1)
  - object_type: background
    description: Fills the rest of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: colored block
    details: Find its color, starting index, ending index, and length.
  - action: identify
    target: yellow marker
    details: Find its index.
  - action: shift
    target: colored block
    direction: horizontal
    reference_point: yellow marker's index
    condition: Position the rightmost pixel of the block immediately to the left of the yellow marker's index.
  - action: maintain
    target: yellow marker
    details: Keep the yellow marker in its original position in the output grid.
  - action: fill
    target: background
    details: Fill all other positions in the output grid with white pixels.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [colored block (right end), yellow marker]
    state: target state in output (block's right end at marker_index - 1)
  - type: position
    object: yellow marker
    state: constant (position remains unchanged between input and output)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to locate the contiguous block of color that is *not* white (0) or yellow (4). Record its color, starting column index, and ending column index. Calculate its length.
3.  Scan the input grid to locate the single yellow marker pixel (4). Record its column index.
4.  Determine the target starting column index for the colored block in the output grid. This is calculated as: `yellow_marker_index - block_length`.
5.  Determine the target ending column index for the colored block in the output grid. This is calculated as: `yellow_marker_index - 1`.
6.  Place the colored block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated target starting index and ending at the calculated target ending index.
7.  Place the yellow marker pixel (4) into the output grid at its original column index (as found in step 3).
8.  The output grid is now complete.
