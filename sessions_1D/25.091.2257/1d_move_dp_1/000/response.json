The length of the array remains constant between input and output (30 elements in these examples).\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), blue (1), orange (7), and azure (8).\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white color (gray, blue, or orange in the examples). Let's call this the \"movable block\".\n    *   There is always a single azure (8) pixel. Let's call this the \"target pixel\".\n    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the \"movable block\".\n5.  **Relationship:** In the input, the \"movable block\" is located somewhere to the left of the \"target pixel\". There might be white pixels between them.\n6.  **Action:** The \"movable block\" is shifted horizontally to the right.\n7.  **Goal/Constraint:** The shift continues until the rightmost pixel of the \"movable block\" is immediately adjacent to (just left of) the \"target pixel\".\n8.  **Side Effects:** The space originally occupied by the \"movable block\" is filled with white (0) pixels. The positions of the \"target pixel\" and any white pixels *after* the \"target pixel\" remain unchanged. White pixels originally *before* the \"movable block\" also remain white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new output grid of the same length as the input, initially filled with white (0).\n6.  Place the identified block (using its original color) into the new grid at the calculated starting and ending indices.\n7.  Place the azure (8) pixel into the new grid at its original index.\n8.
