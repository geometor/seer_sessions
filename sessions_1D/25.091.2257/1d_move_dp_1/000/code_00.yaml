task_description: Shift a colored block rightward until it touches the azure pixel.

grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array (row)
  - size_constraint: Length remains constant between input and output.

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-azure color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and azure (8).
      - shape: Horizontal line segment (contiguous).
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
  - id: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color azure.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels filling the rest of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: movable_block
    to: target_pixel
    details: In the input, the movable_block is located entirely to the left of the target_pixel's index.

actions:
  - id: shift_block
    object: movable_block
    direction: right
    termination_condition: The rightmost pixel of the movable_block is at index `target_pixel.index - 1`.
  - id: fill_background
    object: background
    details: Positions originally occupied by the movable_block before the shift are filled with the background color (white).

invariants:
  - The position of the target_pixel remains unchanged.
  - The relative positions of pixels within the movable_block remain unchanged.
  - The length of the grid remains unchanged.
  - Pixels to the right of the target_pixel remain unchanged.
