task_description: Shift a colored block within a 1D list rightward until it touches the azure pixel.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D list (row)
  - size_constraint: Length remains constant between input and output.

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels within the list, representing a block.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and azure (8).
      - shape: Contiguous sequence.
      - count: Exactly one per input list.
  - id: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color azure.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one per input list.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels filling the rest of the list.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial (index-based)
    from: movable_block
    to: target_pixel
    details: In the input list, the movable_block sequence is located entirely at indices less than the target_pixel's index.

actions:
  - id: shift_block
    object: movable_block
    direction: right (increasing index)
    termination_condition: The index of the rightmost pixel of the movable_block sequence becomes `target_pixel.index - 1`.
  - id: fill_background
    object: background
    details: Indices originally occupied by the movable_block sequence before the shift are filled with the background color (white) in the output list.

invariants:
  - The index of the target_pixel remains unchanged.
  - The relative order and color of pixels within the movable_block remain unchanged.
  - The length of the list remains unchanged.
  - Pixels at indices greater than the target_pixel's index remain unchanged.
