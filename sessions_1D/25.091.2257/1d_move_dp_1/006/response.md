## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed due to a misunderstanding of the input data format. The examples provided initially were presented as flat lists (e.g., `0 5 5 5 ...`), which I interpreted as potentially representing a 1xN grid format (`List[List[int]]`). However, the execution error "Input grid must be a non-empty list of lists" indicates the testing framework likely passed the flat list directly (`List[int]`).

The core transformation logic identified (shifting a colored block rightwards until it's adjacent to an azure marker pixel) appears consistent across all examples. The strategy is to correct the input/output handling in the natural language program and subsequent code to operate directly on a 1D list (`List[int]`) instead of a nested list (`List[List[int]]`).

## Metrics

Let's analyze the structure of the provided examples:


``` python
import numpy as np

train_examples = [
    {"input": [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], "output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0]},
    {"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8], "output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8]},
    {"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], "output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0]},
]

for i, ex in enumerate(train_examples):
    input_list = ex["input"]
    output_list = ex["output"]
    input_len = len(input_list)
    output_len = len(output_list)
    
    # Find movable block
    start_idx = -1
    block_color = -1
    block_len = 0
    for j, p in enumerate(input_list):
        if p != 0 and p != 8:
            if start_idx == -1:
                start_idx = j
                block_color = p
            block_len += 1
        elif start_idx != -1:
            break # Block ended
    if start_idx != -1 and block_len == 0: # Handle block at very end
        block_len = input_len - start_idx
        
    # Find target
    target_idx = -1
    try:
        target_idx = input_list.index(8)
    except ValueError:
        target_idx = -1 # Not found

    # Find block in output
    output_start_idx = -1
    if block_color != -1:
        try:
            output_start_idx = output_list.index(block_color)
        except ValueError:
             output_start_idx = -1 # Not found in output


    print(f"\n--- Example {i+1} ---")
    print(f"Input Type: {type(input_list)}, Length: {input_len}")
    print(f"Output Type: {type(output_list)}, Length: {output_len}")
    print(f"Movable Block: Color={block_color}, Start={start_idx}, Length={block_len}")
    print(f"Target Pixel (8): Index={target_idx}")
    print(f"Expected Output Block Start: {output_start_idx}")
    if target_idx != -1 and block_len > 0:
        expected_output_end_idx = target_idx - 1
        expected_output_start_idx_calc = expected_output_end_idx - block_len + 1
        print(f"Calculated Output Start Index: {expected_output_start_idx_calc}")
        print(f"Match: {output_start_idx == expected_output_start_idx_calc}")


```
```

--- Example 1 ---
Input Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Output Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Movable Block: Color=5, Start=1, Length=21
Target Pixel (8): Index=28
Expected Output Block Start: 7
Calculated Output Start Index: 7
Match: True

--- Example 2 ---
Input Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Output Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Movable Block: Color=1, Start=22, Length=4
Target Pixel (8): Index=29
Expected Output Block Start: 25
Calculated Output Start Index: 25
Match: True

--- Example 3 ---
Input Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Output Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Movable Block: Color=7, Start=16, Length=6
Target Pixel (8): Index=27
Expected Output Block Start: 21
Calculated Output Start Index: 21
Match: True

```
The metrics confirm:
*   Inputs and outputs are indeed flat lists (`List[int]`).
*   Lengths are consistent within each example (30) and between input/output.
*   The calculated target start index for the block (based on target index and block length) matches the observed start index in the output for all examples.

## YAML Facts

task_description: Shift a colored block within a 1D list rightward until it touches the azure pixel.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D list (row)
  - size_constraint: Length remains constant between input and output.

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels within the list, representing a block.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and azure (8).
      - shape: Contiguous sequence.
      - count: Exactly one per input list.
  - id: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color azure.
    properties:

      - count: Exactly one per input list.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels filling the rest of the list.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial (index-based)
    from: movable_block
    to: target_pixel
    details: In the input list, the movable_block sequence is located entirely at indices less than the target_pixel's index.

actions:
  - id: shift_block
    object: movable_block
    direction: right (increasing index)
    termination_condition: The index of the rightmost pixel of the movable_block sequence becomes `target_pixel.index - 1`.
  - id: fill_background
    object: background
    details: Indices originally occupied by the movable_block sequence before the shift are filled with the background color (white) in the output list.

invariants:
  - The index of the target_pixel remains unchanged.
  - The relative order and color of pixels within the movable_block remain unchanged.
  - The length of the list remains unchanged.
  - Pixels at indices greater than the target_pixel's index remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept a 1D list of integers as input.
2.  Identify the contiguous sequence (block) of identical pixels where the pixel value is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record the color, the starting index, and the ending index of this block. Calculate its length.
3.  Identify the index of the single azure (8) pixel (the target pixel).
4.  Create a new output list of the same length as the input list, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
5.  Calculate the target ending index for the block in the output list: `target_pixel_index - 1`.
6.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output list: `target_ending_index - block_length + 1`.
7.  Fill the segment of the output list from the calculated `target_starting_index` to the `target_ending_index` (inclusive) with the color recorded in step 2.
8.  Place the azure (8) pixel into the output list at the `target_pixel_index` identified in step 3.
9.  Copy any pixels from the input list located at indices *greater* than the `target_pixel_index` to the corresponding indices in the output list.
10. Return the completed output list.
