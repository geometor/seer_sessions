Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or can be viewed as 1xN grids). The length of the array remains constant between input and output (30 elements in these examples).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), blue (1), orange (7), and azure (8).
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white color (gray, blue, or orange in the examples). Let's call this the "movable block".
    *   There is always a single azure (8) pixel. Let's call this the "target pixel".
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the "movable block".
5.  **Relationship:** In the input, the "movable block" is located somewhere to the left of the "target pixel". There might be white pixels between them.
6.  **Action:** The "movable block" is shifted horizontally to the right.
7.  **Goal/Constraint:** The shift continues until the rightmost pixel of the "movable block" is immediately adjacent to (just left of) the "target pixel".
8.  **Side Effects:** The space originally occupied by the "movable block" is filled with white (0) pixels. The positions of the "target pixel" and any white pixels *after* the "target pixel" remain unchanged. White pixels originally *before* the "movable block" also remain white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored block rightward until it touches the azure pixel.

grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array (row)
  - size_constraint: Length remains constant between input and output.

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-azure color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and azure (8).
      - shape: Horizontal line segment (contiguous).
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
  - id: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color azure.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels filling the rest of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: movable_block
    to: target_pixel
    details: In the input, the movable_block is located entirely to the left of the target_pixel's index.

actions:
  - id: shift_block
    object: movable_block
    direction: right
    termination_condition: The rightmost pixel of the movable_block is at index `target_pixel.index - 1`.
  - id: fill_background
    object: background
    details: Positions originally occupied by the movable_block before the shift are filled with the background color (white).

invariants:
  - The position of the target_pixel remains unchanged.
  - The relative positions of pixels within the movable_block remain unchanged.
  - The length of the grid remains unchanged.
  - Pixels to the right of the target_pixel remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Identify the index of the single azure (8) pixel.
3.  Calculate the target ending index for the block, which is `index_of_azure_pixel - 1`.
4.  Calculate the required starting index for the block by subtracting its length (original `end_index - start_index`) from the target ending index.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same length as the input, initially filled with white (0).
6.  Place the identified block (using its original color) into the new grid at the calculated starting and ending indices.
7.  Place the azure (8) pixel into the new grid at its original index.
8.  Copy any pixels from the input grid that were located *after* the azure (8) pixel to the corresponding positions in the output grid.

## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed due to a misunderstanding of the input data format. The examples provided initially were presented as flat lists (e.g., `0 5 5 5 ...`), which I interpreted as potentially representing a 1xN grid format (`List[List[int]]`). However, the execution error "Input grid must be a non-empty list of lists" indicates the testing framework likely passed the flat list directly (`List[int]`).

The core transformation logic identified (shifting a colored block rightwards until it's adjacent to an azure marker pixel) appears consistent across all examples. The strategy is to correct the input/output handling in the natural language program and subsequent code to operate directly on a 1D list (`List[int]`) instead of a nested list (`List[List[int]]`).

## Metrics

Let's analyze the structure of the provided examples:

outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```

--- Example 1 ---
Input Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Output Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Movable Block: Color=5, Start=1, Length=21
Target Pixel (8): Index=28
Expected Output Block Start: 7
Calculated Output Start Index: 7
Match: True

--- Example 2 ---
Input Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Output Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Movable Block: Color=1, Start=22, Length=4
Target Pixel (8): Index=29
Expected Output Block Start: 25
Calculated Output Start Index: 25
Match: True

--- Example 3 ---
Input Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Output Type: <class 'list'>, Length: 30
Movable Block: Color=7, Start=16, Length=6
Target Pixel (8): Index=27
Expected Output Block Start: 21
Calculated Output Start Index: 21
Match: True

```
The metrics confirm:
*   Inputs and outputs are indeed flat lists (`List[int]`).
*   Lengths are consistent within each example (30) and between input/output.
*   The calculated target start index for the block (based on target index and block length) matches the observed start index in the output for all examples.

## YAML Facts

task_description: Shift a colored block within a 1D list rightward until it touches the azure pixel.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D list (row)
  - size_constraint: Length remains constant between input and output.

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels within the list, representing a block.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and azure (8).
      - shape: Contiguous sequence.
      - count: Exactly one per input list.
  - id: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color azure.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one per input list.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels filling the rest of the list.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial (index-based)
    from: movable_block
    to: target_pixel
    details: In the input list, the movable_block sequence is located entirely at indices less than the target_pixel's index.

actions:
  - id: shift_block
    object: movable_block
    direction: right (increasing index)
    termination_condition: The index of the rightmost pixel of the movable_block sequence becomes `target_pixel.index - 1`.
  - id: fill_background
    object: background
    details: Indices originally occupied by the movable_block sequence before the shift are filled with the background color (white) in the output list.

invariants:
  - The index of the target_pixel remains unchanged.
  - The relative order and color of pixels within the movable_block remain unchanged.
  - The length of the list remains unchanged.
  - Pixels at indices greater than the target_pixel's index remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept a 1D list of integers as input.
2.  Identify the contiguous sequence (block) of identical pixels where the pixel value is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record the color, the starting index, and the ending index of this block. Calculate its length.
3.  Identify the index of the single azure (8) pixel (the target pixel).
4.  Create a new output list of the same length as the input list, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
5.  Calculate the target ending index for the block in the output list: `target_pixel_index - 1`.
6.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output list: `target_ending_index - block_length + 1`.
7.  Fill the segment of the output list from the calculated `target_starting_index` to the `target_ending_index` (inclusive) with the color recorded in step 2.
8.  Place the azure (8) pixel into the output list at the `target_pixel_index` identified in step 3.
9.  Copy any pixels from the input list located at indices *greater* than the `target_pixel_index` to the corresponding indices in the output list.
10. Return the completed output list.
