**Assessment and Strategy:**

The execution results indicate a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format of the `transform` function (`List[List[int]]` representing a 1xN grid) and the actual format being passed during testing. The error "Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN format)" was raised because the function's initial check `if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or len(input_grid) != 1 or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):` failed. This suggests the test harness might be passing the input data in a different structure than initially assumed (e.g., perhaps a flat list `List[int]` or even a numpy array directly, although the function signature specifies `List[List[int]]`).

However, looking back at the problem description and typical ARC task formats, the input *should* be a 2D grid (list of lists). The examples provided only show single rows, making them 1xN grids. The previous code *did* anticipate this 1xN `List[List[int]]` format. The error implies the data being passed during the test *doesn't* match this structure.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Format:** Use code execution to inspect the `type` and `shape` (if applicable) of the input data *as received by the test harness*. Since I cannot directly see the test harness, I will assume the standard ARC format of `List[List[int]]` and that the error message from the previous code was accurate about *its* expectation failing, implying the input was *not* `List[List[int]]` as passed. The most likely scenario is that the initial prompt presentation (single string of numbers) led to confusion, and the actual data structure might be different, or the test harness pre-processes it. Let's *assume* for now the standard is `List[List[int]]` and the previous code's check was appropriate, but the *data representation* in the prompt was misleading.
2.  **Verify Logic:** The core logic (find block, find target, shift block) appears sound based on the visual examples.
3.  **Refine Implementation:** Ensure the code correctly handles the `List[List[int]]` format, extracting the single row, processing it, and returning the result in the same `List[List[int]]` format. The previous code attempted this, but perhaps there's a subtle issue or the initial format assumption was wrong.

**Metrics:**

Let's re-examine the data structure assumption using the provided examples.
