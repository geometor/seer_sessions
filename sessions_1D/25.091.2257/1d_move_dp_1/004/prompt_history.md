Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or can be viewed as 1xN grids). The length of the array remains constant between input and output (30 elements in these examples).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), blue (1), orange (7), and azure (8).
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white color (gray, blue, or orange in the examples). Let's call this the "movable block".
    *   There is always a single azure (8) pixel. Let's call this the "target pixel".
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the "movable block".
5.  **Relationship:** In the input, the "movable block" is located somewhere to the left of the "target pixel". There might be white pixels between them.
6.  **Action:** The "movable block" is shifted horizontally to the right.
7.  **Goal/Constraint:** The shift continues until the rightmost pixel of the "movable block" is immediately adjacent to (just left of) the "target pixel".
8.  **Side Effects:** The space originally occupied by the "movable block" is filled with white (0) pixels. The positions of the "target pixel" and any white pixels *after* the "target pixel" remain unchanged. White pixels originally *before* the "movable block" also remain white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored block rightward until it touches the azure pixel.

grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array (row)
  - size_constraint: Length remains constant between input and output.

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-azure color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and azure (8).
      - shape: Horizontal line segment (contiguous).
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
  - id: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color azure.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels filling the rest of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: movable_block
    to: target_pixel
    details: In the input, the movable_block is located entirely to the left of the target_pixel's index.

actions:
  - id: shift_block
    object: movable_block
    direction: right
    termination_condition: The rightmost pixel of the movable_block is at index `target_pixel.index - 1`.
  - id: fill_background
    object: background
    details: Positions originally occupied by the movable_block before the shift are filled with the background color (white).

invariants:
  - The position of the target_pixel remains unchanged.
  - The relative positions of pixels within the movable_block remain unchanged.
  - The length of the grid remains unchanged.
  - Pixels to the right of the target_pixel remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Identify the index of the single azure (8) pixel.
3.  Calculate the target ending index for the block, which is `index_of_azure_pixel - 1`.
4.  Calculate the required starting index for the block by subtracting its length (original `end_index - start_index`) from the target ending index.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same length as the input, initially filled with white (0).
6.  Place the identified block (using its original color) into the new grid at the calculated starting and ending indices.
7.  Place the azure (8) pixel into the new grid at its original index.
8.  Copy any pixels from the input grid that were located *after* the azure (8) pixel to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
