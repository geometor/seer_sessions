"""
Shift a colored block within a single row rightward until its right edge touches the left side of the azure pixel in that row.

The input is expected to be a 1xN grid (list containing one list).
1. Identify the single row.
2. Find the contiguous block of a single color (not white 0, not azure 8). Record its color, start index, end index.
3. Find the index of the azure (8) pixel.
4. Calculate the block's target end index: `azure_index - 1`.
5. Calculate the block's target start index based on its length and target end index.
6. Create a new row initialized with white (0).
7. Place the block with its original color at the target start/end indices in the new row.
8. Place the azure pixel at its original index in the new row.
9. Copy pixels from the input row that were to the right of the azure pixel's index into the new row.
10. Return the new row wrapped in a list to match the 1xN grid format.
