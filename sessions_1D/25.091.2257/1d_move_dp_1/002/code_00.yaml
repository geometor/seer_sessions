task_description: Shift a colored block within a single row rightward until its right edge touches the left side of the azure pixel in that row.

grid_properties:
  - type: 2D array (grid)
  - shape: Always 1 row, variable number of columns (1xN).
  - size_constraint: Dimensions (1xN) remain constant between input and output.

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of pixels within the single row, having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not azure (8).
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and azure (8). Observed: gray (5), blue (1), orange (7).
      - shape: Horizontal line segment (contiguous).
      - count: Exactly one per input grid row.
      - location: Resides entirely within the single row.
  - id: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color azure within the single row.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one per input grid row.
      - location: Resides within the single row, always to the right of the movable_block in the input.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels filling the rest of the single row.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: movable_block
    to: target_pixel
    details: In the input row, the movable_block is located entirely to the left of the target_pixel's column index.

actions:
  - id: shift_block
    object: movable_block
    direction: right (increasing column index)
    termination_condition: The rightmost pixel (highest column index) of the movable_block is at column index `target_pixel.column_index - 1`.
  - id: fill_background
    object: background
    details: Column indices originally occupied by the movable_block before the shift are filled with the background color (white) in the output row.

invariants:
  - The grid dimensions (1xN) remain unchanged.
  - The row index (always 0) remains unchanged.
  - The column index of the target_pixel remains unchanged.
  - The relative positions of pixels within the movable_block remain unchanged (its length and color are preserved).
  - Pixels in the row located at column indices *greater than* the target_pixel's column index remain unchanged.
