**Assessment and Strategy:**

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" strongly suggests that the code is attempting boolean logic on a NumPy array where a single boolean value is expected. Given the iteration `for i, pixel in enumerate(grid_np)`, this likely occurs because `grid_np` is being treated as a 2D array (e.g., shape `(1, N)`) instead of a 1D array. When iterating over a 2D array with `enumerate`, `pixel` becomes an entire row (a 1D array), and comparisons like `pixel != 0` result in boolean arrays, triggering the error in the `if` condition.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge that the input, while presented linearly, represents a 1xN grid (a 2D structure).
2.  Modify the code to explicitly access the single row of this 2D grid for processing.
3.  Use `tool_code` to verify the data structure and the indices/properties identified by the helper functions on the corrected row data.
4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 1xN grid structure accurately.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's confirm the structure and find the relevant indices for each training example, assuming the input is a list containing one list (representing the 1xN grid).


``` python
import numpy as np

def find_movable_block_1d(row: np.ndarray):
    start_index = -1
    block_color = -1
    for i, pixel in enumerate(row):
        if pixel != 0 and pixel != 8:
            if start_index == -1:
                start_index = i
                block_color = pixel
            elif pixel != block_color: # End of block if color changes
                 return block_color, start_index, i - 1
        elif start_index != -1: # End of block if white or azure is encountered
            return block_color, start_index, i - 1
    if start_index != -1:
        return block_color, start_index, len(row) - 1
    return None

def find_target_pixel_1d(row: np.ndarray):
    for i, pixel in enumerate(row):
        if pixel == 8:
            return i
    return None

# Re-represent inputs as list of lists
train_inputs = [
    [[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]],
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8]],
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]],
]

results = []
for i, input_list in enumerate(train_inputs):
    input_grid = np.array(input_list)
    shape = input_grid.shape
    if shape[0] != 1:
        results.append(f"Example {i+1}: Unexpected shape {shape}. Skipping analysis.")
        continue

    row_data = input_grid[0] # Select the first (only) row

    block_info = find_movable_block_1d(row_data)
    target_idx = find_target_pixel_1d(row_data)

    results.append({
        "example": i + 1,
        "input_shape": shape,
        "row_length": len(row_data),
        "block_info": block_info,
        "target_index": target_idx,
    })

print(results)
```
```
[{'example': 1, 'input_shape': (1, 30), 'row_length': 30, 'block_info': (np.int64(5), 1, 21), 'target_index': 28}, {'example': 2, 'input_shape': (1, 30), 'row_length': 30, 'block_info': (np.int64(1), 22, 25), 'target_index': 29}, {'example': 3, 'input_shape': (1, 30), 'row_length': 30, 'block_info': (np.int64(7), 16, 21), 'target_index': 27}]

```
**Findings from Metrics:**

*   **Input Structure:** The inputs are indeed best interpreted as 1xN grids (shape `(1, 30)`).
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Grid shape: (1, 30)
    *   Movable block: Color gray (5), indices 1 to 21 (length 21).
    *   Target pixel (azure 8): Index 28.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Grid shape: (1, 30)
    *   Movable block: Color blue (1), indices 22 to 25 (length 4).
    *   Target pixel (azure 8): Index 29.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Grid shape: (1, 30)
    *   Movable block: Color orange (7), indices 16 to 21 (length 6).
    *   Target pixel (azure 8): Index 27.

The core logic remains the same, but needs to operate explicitly on the single row of the input grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored block within a single row rightward until its right edge touches the left side of the azure pixel in that row.

grid_properties:
  - type: 2D array (grid)
  - shape: Always 1 row, variable number of columns (1xN).
  - size_constraint: Dimensions (1xN) remain constant between input and output.

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of pixels within the single row, having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not azure (8).
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and azure (8). Observed: gray (5), blue (1), orange (7).
      - shape: Horizontal line segment (contiguous).
      - count: Exactly one per input grid row.
      - location: Resides entirely within the single row.
  - id: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color azure within the single row.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one per input grid row.
      - location: Resides within the single row, always to the right of the movable_block in the input.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels filling the rest of the single row.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: movable_block
    to: target_pixel
    details: In the input row, the movable_block is located entirely to the left of the target_pixel's column index.

actions:
  - id: shift_block
    object: movable_block
    direction: right (increasing column index)
    termination_condition: The rightmost pixel (highest column index) of the movable_block is at column index `target_pixel.column_index - 1`.
  - id: fill_background
    object: background
    details: Column indices originally occupied by the movable_block before the shift are filled with the background color (white) in the output row.

invariants:
  - The grid dimensions (1xN) remain unchanged.
  - The row index (always 0) remains unchanged.
  - The column index of the target_pixel remains unchanged.
  - The relative positions of pixels within the movable_block remain unchanged (its length and color are preserved).
  - Pixels in the row located at column indices *greater than* the target_pixel's column index remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 1xN grid (a list containing one list of integers).
2.  Extract the single row from the input grid.
3.  Within this row, identify the contiguous block of pixels having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color, starting column index, and ending column index.
4.  Within the same row, identify the column index of the single azure (8) pixel.
5.  Calculate the target ending column index for the block, which is `column_index_of_azure_pixel - 1`.
6.  Calculate the length of the identified block (`original_end_index - original_start_index + 1`).
7.  Calculate the required starting column index for the block in the output row: `target_ending_column_index - block_length + 1`.
8.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white (0).
9.  Place the identified block (using its original color) into the new output row, spanning from the calculated starting column index to the target ending column index.
10. Place the azure (8) pixel into the new output row at its original column index.
11. Copy any pixels from the input row that were located at column indices *greater than* the azure pixel's column index to the corresponding positions in the output row.
12. Construct the final output grid as a 1xN grid (a list containing the single modified output row).
