            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" strongly suggests that the code is attempting boolean logic on a NumPy array where a single boolean value is expected. Given the iteration `for i, pixel in enumerate(grid_np)`, this likely occurs because `grid_np` is being treated as a 2D array (e.g., shape `(1, N)`) instead of a 1D array. When iterating over a 2D array with `enumerate`, `pixel` becomes an entire row (a 1D array), and comparisons like `pixel != 0` result in boolean arrays, triggering the error in the `if` condition.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge that the input, while presented linearly, represents a 1xN grid (a 2D structure).\n2.  Modify the code to explicitly access the single row of this 2D grid for processing.\n3.  Use `tool_code` to verify the data structure and the indices/properties identified by the helper functions on the corrected row data.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 1xN grid structure accurately.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's confirm the structure and find the relevant indices for each training example, assuming the input is a list containing one list (representing the 1xN grid).\n\n"
