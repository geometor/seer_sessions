Identifies a contiguous block of a non-white, non-azure color and a single azure pixel in a 1D input grid.
Shifts the identified block rightward so that its rightmost edge is immediately adjacent to the left of the azure pixel.
The space previously occupied by the block is filled with white. Pixels to the right of the azure pixel remain unchanged.
