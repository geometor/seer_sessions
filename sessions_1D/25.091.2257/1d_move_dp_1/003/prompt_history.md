Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or can be viewed as 1xN grids). The length of the array remains constant between input and output (30 elements in these examples).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), blue (1), orange (7), and azure (8).
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white color (gray, blue, or orange in the examples). Let's call this the "movable block".
    *   There is always a single azure (8) pixel. Let's call this the "target pixel".
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the "movable block".
5.  **Relationship:** In the input, the "movable block" is located somewhere to the left of the "target pixel". There might be white pixels between them.
6.  **Action:** The "movable block" is shifted horizontally to the right.
7.  **Goal/Constraint:** The shift continues until the rightmost pixel of the "movable block" is immediately adjacent to (just left of) the "target pixel".
8.  **Side Effects:** The space originally occupied by the "movable block" is filled with white (0) pixels. The positions of the "target pixel" and any white pixels *after* the "target pixel" remain unchanged. White pixels originally *before* the "movable block" also remain white.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Identify the index of the single azure (8) pixel.
3.  Calculate the target ending index for the block, which is `index_of_azure_pixel - 1`.
4.  Calculate the required starting index for the block by subtracting its length (original `end_index - start_index`) from the target ending index.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same length as the input, initially filled with white (0).
6.  Place the identified block (using its original color) into the new grid at the calculated starting and ending indices.
7.  Place the azure (8) pixel into the new grid at its original index.
8.  Copy any pixels from the input grid that were located *after* the azure (8) pixel to the corresponding positions in the output grid.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" strongly suggests that the code is attempting boolean logic on a NumPy array where a single boolean value is expected. Given the iteration `for i, pixel in enumerate(grid_np)`, this likely occurs because `grid_np` is being treated as a 2D array (e.g., shape `(1, N)`) instead of a 1D array. When iterating over a 2D array with `enumerate`, `pixel` becomes an entire row (a 1D array), and comparisons like `pixel != 0` result in boolean arrays, triggering the error in the `if` condition.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge that the input, while presented linearly, represents a 1xN grid (a 2D structure).
2.  Modify the code to explicitly access the single row of this 2D grid for processing.
3.  Use `tool_code` to verify the data structure and the indices/properties identified by the helper functions on the corrected row data.
4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 1xN grid structure accurately.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's confirm the structure and find the relevant indices for each training example, assuming the input is a list containing one list (representing the 1xN grid).

**Findings from Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Grid shape: (1, 30)
    *   Movable block: Color gray (5), indices 1 to 21 (length 21).
    *   Target pixel (azure 8): Index 28.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Grid shape: (1, 30)
    *   Movable block: Color blue (1), indices 22 to 25 (length 4).
    *   Target pixel (azure 8): Index 29.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Grid shape: (1, 30)
    *   Movable block: Color orange (7), indices 16 to 21 (length 6).
    *   Target pixel (azure 8): Index 27.

The core logic remains the same, but needs to operate explicitly on the single row of the input grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 1xN grid (a list containing one list of integers).
2.  Extract the single row from the input grid.
3.  Within this row, identify the contiguous block of pixels having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color, starting column index, and ending column index.
4.  Within the same row, identify the column index of the single azure (8) pixel.
5.  Calculate the target ending column index for the block, which is `column_index_of_azure_pixel - 1`.
6.  Calculate the length of the identified block (`original_end_index - original_start_index + 1`).
7.  Calculate the required starting column index for the block in the output row: `target_ending_column_index - block_length + 1`.
8.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white (0).
9.  Place the identified block (using its original color) into the new output row, spanning from the calculated starting column index to the target ending column index.
10. Place the azure (8) pixel into the new output row at its original column index.
11. Copy any pixels from the input row that were located at column indices *greater than* the azure pixel's column index to the corresponding positions in the output row.
12. Construct the final output grid as a 1xN grid (a list containing the single modified output row).
