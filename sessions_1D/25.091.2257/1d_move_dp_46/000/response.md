**Perception of Elements:**

The task operates on what appears to be a 1-dimensional grid (or a flattened 2D grid, treated as 1D) of fixed length (20 cells in the examples). Each grid contains pixels of different colors. Key elements observed are:

1.  **Anchor Pixel:** A single pixel of color red ('2') is present in every input grid. Its position seems important.
2.  **Payload Object:** A contiguous block (object) of a single color, which is *neither* white ('0') *nor* red ('2'), is present in each input. In cases where multiple such blocks might exist, the examples suggest the *largest* such block is the relevant one.
3.  **Background Color:** The white color ('0') acts as a background or filler color in the output.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating the identified "payload object" so that it ends immediately before the "anchor pixel" (red '2'). The rest of the grid cells in the output are filled with the background color (white '0'). The original position of the anchor pixel is preserved in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 1-dimensional array (or treated as such)
  - Size: Constant length (e.g., 20 cells in examples)
  - Cells: Contain integer color codes (0-9)

Identified_Objects:
  - Anchor:
      - Type: Pixel
      - Color: Red (2)
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
      - Role: Acts as a positional reference point for the output. Its absolute position is maintained.
  - Payload:
      - Type: Contiguous block of pixels (Object)
      - Color: Any single color EXCEPT White (0) and Red (2)
      - Selection: The largest such block in the input grid.
      - Role: This object is moved in the transformation.
  - Background:
      - Type: Pixel Color
      - Color: White (0)
      - Role: Fills the grid cells in the output that are not occupied by the Anchor or the Payload.

Transformation_Actions:
  - Locate: Find the index of the Anchor pixel (Red '2').
  - Identify: Find the largest contiguous block of a single color that is not White ('0') or Red ('2'). This is the Payload block. Note its color and length.
  - Construct_Output:
      - Create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled entirely with the Background color (White '0').
      - Place the Anchor pixel (Red '2') at its original index in the new grid.
      - Place the identified Payload block immediately before the Anchor pixel in the new grid.

Relationships:
  - Payload_Positioning: The Payload block is positioned relative to the Anchor pixel in the output grid (specifically, it ends at the index immediately preceding the Anchor pixel's index).
  - Output_Composition: The output grid is composed solely of the relocated Payload block, the Anchor pixel in its original position, and Background pixels (White '0') everywhere else.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color white ('0').
2.  Locate the single red ('2') pixel in the input grid and record its index.
3.  Identify all contiguous blocks of pixels where each block consists of a single color that is *not* white ('0') and *not* red ('2').
4.  Select the largest block among those identified in step 3 (if there's a tie in size, the examples don't specify, but let's assume any one of the largest suffices or perhaps the first encountered). This is the "payload block". Record its color and length.
5.  Place the payload block into the output grid such that it ends at the index immediately preceding the index of the red ('2') pixel recorded in step 2.
6.  Place the red ('2') pixel into the output grid at its original index (recorded in step 2), overwriting the background color if necessary.
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
