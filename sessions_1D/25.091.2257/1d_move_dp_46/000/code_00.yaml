Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 1-dimensional array (or treated as such)
  - Size: Constant length (e.g., 20 cells in examples)
  - Cells: Contain integer color codes (0-9)

Identified_Objects:
  - Anchor:
      - Type: Pixel
      - Color: Red (2)
      - Count: Exactly one per grid
      - Role: Acts as a positional reference point for the output. Its absolute position is maintained.
  - Payload:
      - Type: Contiguous block of pixels (Object)
      - Color: Any single color EXCEPT White (0) and Red (2)
      - Selection: The largest such block in the input grid.
      - Role: This object is moved in the transformation.
  - Background:
      - Type: Pixel Color
      - Color: White (0)
      - Role: Fills the grid cells in the output that are not occupied by the Anchor or the Payload.

Transformation_Actions:
  - Locate: Find the index of the Anchor pixel (Red '2').
  - Identify: Find the largest contiguous block of a single color that is not White ('0') or Red ('2'). This is the Payload block. Note its color and length.
  - Construct_Output:
      - Create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled entirely with the Background color (White '0').
      - Place the Anchor pixel (Red '2') at its original index in the new grid.
      - Place the identified Payload block immediately before the Anchor pixel in the new grid.

Relationships:
  - Payload_Positioning: The Payload block is positioned relative to the Anchor pixel in the output grid (specifically, it ends at the index immediately preceding the Anchor pixel's index).
  - Output_Composition: The output grid is composed solely of the relocated Payload block, the Anchor pixel in its original position, and Background pixels (White '0') everywhere else.
