Each grid contains pixels of different colors. Key elements observed are:\n\n1.  **Anchor Pixel:** A single pixel of color red ('2') is present in every input grid. Its position seems important.\n2.  **Payload Object:** A contiguous block (object) of a single color, which is *neither* white ('0') *nor* red ('2'), is present in each input. In cases where multiple such blocks might exist, the examples suggest the *largest* such block is the relevant one.\n3.  **Background Color:** The white color ('0') acts as a background or filler color in the output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating the identified \"payload object\" so that it ends immediately before the \"anchor pixel\" (red '2'). The rest of the grid cells in the output are filled with the background color (white '0'). The original position of the anchor pixel is preserved in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all contiguous blocks of pixels where each block consists of a single color that is *not* white ('0') and *not* red ('2').\n4.  Select the largest block among those identified in step 3 (if there's a tie in size, the examples don't specify, but let's assume any one of the largest suffices or perhaps the first encountered). This is the \"payload block\". Record its color and length.\n5.  Place the payload block into the output grid such that it ends at the index immediately preceding the index of the red ('2') pixel recorded in step 2.\n6.  Place the red ('2') pixel into the output grid at its original index (recorded in step 2), overwriting the background color if necessary.\n7.  The resulting grid is the final output."
