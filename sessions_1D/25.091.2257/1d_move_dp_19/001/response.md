"""
The transformation rule operates on a 1D grid (a single row). It identifies a single green pixel (color 3) which acts as a right boundary. To the left of this boundary, it identifies a contiguous block of a single color (other than white 0 or green 3) - this is the 'object'. It also identifies all white pixels (color 0) in this same region (left of the green boundary). The transformation rearranges this region: all the identified white pixels are placed first, followed immediately by the object block. The green boundary pixel and everything to its right remain unchanged.

1. Locate the index of the green pixel (color 3).
2. Define the 'active segment' as the part of the grid to the left of the green pixel.
3. Within the active segment, collect all white pixels (0) into one list.
4. Within the active segment, collect all non-white, non-green pixels (the object) into another list.
5. Construct the new active segment by concatenating the list of white pixels and the list of object pixels.
6. The final output grid is formed by concatenating the new active segment with the original green pixel and everything that followed it.
