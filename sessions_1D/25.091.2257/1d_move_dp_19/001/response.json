It identifies a single green pixel (color 3) which acts as a right boundary. To the left of this boundary, it identifies a contiguous block of a single color (other than white 0 or green 3) - this is the 'object'. It also identifies all white pixels (color 0) in this same region (left of the green boundary). The transformation rearranges this region: all the identified white pixels are placed first, followed immediately by the object block. The green boundary pixel and everything to its right remain unchanged.\n\n1. Locate the index of the green pixel (color 3).\n2. Define the 'active segment' as the part of the grid to the left of the green pixel.\n3. Within the active segment, collect all white pixels (0) into one list.\n4. Within the active segment, collect all non-white, non-green pixels (the object) into another list.\n5. Construct the new active segment by concatenating the list of white pixels and the list of object pixels.\n6. The final output grid is formed by concatenating the new active segment with the original green pixel and everything that followed it.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_boundary_index(grid_1d: np.ndarray, boundary_color: int = 3) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the first occurrence of the boundary color.\"\"\"\n    indices = np.where(grid_1d == boundary_color)[0]\n    if len(indices) == 0:\n        # Handle cases where the boundary marker might be missing, though not seen in examples\n        # For now, assume it's always present based on examples.\n        # Could return -1 or len(grid_1d) or raise error depending on desired behavior.\n        raise ValueError(f\"Boundary color {boundary_color} not found in input.\")\n    return indices[0]\n\ndef separate_pixels(segment: np.ndarray, background_color: int = 0, boundary_color: int = 3) -> (List[int], List[int]):\n    \"\"\"Separates pixels in a segment into background and object pixels.\"\"\"\n    background_pixels = [p for p in segment if p == background_color]\n    object_pixels = [p for p in segment if p != background_color and p != boundary_color]\n    return background_pixels, object_pixels\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving a colored object block rightwards\n    within the segment left of a green boundary, placing it adjacent to the boundary\n    and shifting all white space in that segment to the left.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list containing a single list of integers representing the 1D grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing a single list of integers representing the transformed 1D grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Ensure input is treated as 1D\n    if len(input_grid) != 1:\n        # This function expects a 1xN grid based on examples\n        # If other dimensionalities are possible, logic would need adjustment\n         raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be 1-dimensional (1xN).\")\n    \n    input_array = np.array(input_grid[0], dtype=int)\n    \n    # Define colors\n    background_color = 0\n    boundary_color = 3\n\n    # 1.
