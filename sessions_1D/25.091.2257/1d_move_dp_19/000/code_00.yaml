task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are 1xN grids

elements:
  - element: boundary_marker
    description: A single green (3) pixel.
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True
      - role: Defines the right boundary for the transformation area.
  - element: movable_object
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and green (3).
    properties:
      - color: Varies (blue, gray, yellow in examples)
      - location: Always located to the left of the boundary_marker.
      - action: Moves rightward.
  - element: space
    description: Contiguous blocks of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - role: Acts as empty space through which the movable_object can move, or potentially gets displaced by the object's movement.
      - location: Can be anywhere, but the relevant space is between the movable_object and the boundary_marker.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The movable_object is always initially separated from the boundary_marker by one or more space (white) pixels.
  - type: transformation
    description: The movable_object shifts right until it is immediately adjacent to the left of the boundary_marker. The space pixels originally between them are shifted to the left, filling the original position of the movable_object.

constraints:
  - The transformation only affects the segment of the grid to the left of the boundary_marker.
  - The boundary_marker (green pixel) and any pixels to its right remain unchanged.
  - The pixels to the left of the initial position of the movable_object remain unchanged.
  - There is only one boundary_marker (green pixel) in the observed examples.
  - There is only one movable_object block to the left of the boundary_marker.
