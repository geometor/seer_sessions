Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are all 1-dimensional grids (or single rows).
2.  **Key Colors**: The colors involved are white (0), blue (1), red (not present), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5). White seems to represent background or empty space. Green (3) appears to act as a fixed point or boundary. The other non-white colors (blue, gray, yellow) form contiguous blocks which are the primary objects being manipulated.
3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves shifting a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-green color to the right. This shift happens within the portion of the grid to the left of the green pixel.
4.  **Movement Logic**: The non-white block moves rightwards, swapping places with the white pixels immediately to its right, until it becomes adjacent to the green pixel. The green pixel itself and any pixels to its right remain unchanged. Pixels to the left of the non-white block also remain unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are 1xN grids

elements:
  - element: boundary_marker
    description: A single green (3) pixel.
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True
      - role: Defines the right boundary for the transformation area.
  - element: movable_object
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and green (3).
    properties:
      - color: Varies (blue, gray, yellow in examples)
      - location: Always located to the left of the boundary_marker.
      - action: Moves rightward.
  - element: space
    description: Contiguous blocks of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - role: Acts as empty space through which the movable_object can move, or potentially gets displaced by the object's movement.
      - location: Can be anywhere, but the relevant space is between the movable_object and the boundary_marker.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The movable_object is always initially separated from the boundary_marker by one or more space (white) pixels.
  - type: transformation
    description: The movable_object shifts right until it is immediately adjacent to the left of the boundary_marker. The space pixels originally between them are shifted to the left, filling the original position of the movable_object.

constraints:
  - The transformation only affects the segment of the grid to the left of the boundary_marker.
  - The boundary_marker (green pixel) and any pixels to its right remain unchanged.
  - The pixels to the left of the initial position of the movable_object remain unchanged.
  - There is only one boundary_marker (green pixel) in the observed examples.
  - There is only one movable_object block to the left of the boundary_marker.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Locate the index of the green pixel (color 3) in the input grid. Let this be `boundary_index`.
3.  Identify the segment of the input grid from the beginning (index 0) up to, but not including, `boundary_index`. Let this be the `active_segment`.
4.  Within the `active_segment`, find the contiguous block of non-white (not 0), non-green (not 3) pixels. Note its starting index (`object_start`), ending index (`object_end`), and the color of the block (`object_color`).
5.  Determine the length of this object block: `object_length = object_end - object_start + 1`.
6.  Count the number of white (0) pixels within the `active_segment` that are located *after* the object block (i.e., between `object_end + 1` and `boundary_index - 1`). Let this count be `space_count`.
7.  Modify the output grid in the range corresponding to the `active_segment`:
    *   Fill the indices from `boundary_index - object_length` up to `boundary_index - 1` with the `object_color`.
    *   Fill the remaining indices within the `active_segment` (from its start up to `boundary_index - object_length - 1`) with white (0), preserving any initial white pixels that were before the object's original start index. *Correction*: A simpler way is to identify all white pixels within the active segment and place them at the beginning of the active segment in the output, followed by the object block.
8.  Let's refine step 7: Modify the output grid in the range from index 0 to `boundary_index - 1`:
    *   Identify all white pixels (0) in the input grid within this range. Count them. Let the count be `total_white_count`.
    *   Identify the non-white, non-green object block (color and length) as determined in steps 4 & 5.
    *   In the output grid, fill the indices from 0 to `total_white_count - 1` with white (0).
    *   In the output grid, fill the indices from `total_white_count` to `total_white_count + object_length - 1` with the `object_color`.
9.  Ensure that the portion of the output grid from `boundary_index` onwards is identical to the input grid from `boundary_index` onwards.
10. Return the modified output grid.
