            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are all 1-dimensional grids (or single rows).\n2.  **Key Colors**: The colors involved are white (0), blue (1), red (not present), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5). White seems to represent background or empty space. Green (3) appears to act as a fixed point or boundary. The other non-white colors (blue, gray, yellow) form contiguous blocks which are the primary objects being manipulated.\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves shifting a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-green color to the right. This shift happens within the portion of the grid to the left of the green pixel.\n4.  **Movement Logic**: The non-white block moves rightwards, swapping places with the white pixels immediately to its right, until it becomes adjacent to the green pixel. The green pixel itself and any pixels to its right remain unchanged. Pixels to the left of the non-white block also remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Let this be `boundary_index`.\n3.  Identify the segment of the input grid from the beginning (index 0) up to, but not including, `boundary_index`. Let this be the `active_segment`.\n4.  Within the `active_segment`, find the contiguous block of non-white (not 0), non-green (not 3) pixels. Note its starting index (`object_start`), ending index (`object_end`), and the color of the block (`object_color`).\n5.  Determine the length of this object block: `object_length = object_end - object_start + 1`.\n6.  Count the number of white (0) pixels within the `active_segment` that are located *after* the object block (i.e., between `object_end + 1` and `boundary_index - 1`). Let this count be `space_count`.\n7.  Modify the output grid in the range corresponding to the `active_segment`:\n    *   Fill the indices from `boundary_index - object_length` up to `boundary_index - 1` with the `object_color`.\n    *   Fill the remaining indices within the `active_segment` (from its start up to `boundary_index - object_length - 1`) with white (0), preserving any initial white pixels that were before the object's original start index. *Correction*: A simpler way is to identify all white pixels within the active segment and place them at the beginning of the active segment in the output, followed by the object block.\n8.  Let's refine step 7: Modify the output grid in the range from index 0 to `boundary_index - 1`:\n    *   Identify all white pixels (0) in the input grid within this range. Count them. Let the count be `total_white_count`.\n    *   Identify the non-white, non-green object block (color and length) as determined in steps 4 & 5.\n    *   In the output grid, fill the indices from 0 to `total_white_count - 1` with white (0).\n    *   In the output grid, fill the indices from `total_white_count` to `total_white_count + object_length - 1` with the `object_color`.\n9.  Ensure that the portion of the output grid from `boundary_index` onwards is identical to the input grid from `boundary_index` onwards.\n10. Return the modified output grid."
