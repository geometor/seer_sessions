Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Data Format:** The input and output data are presented as single rows (or 1D arrays) of colored pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors observed are white (0) acting as a background, orange (7) acting as a fixed point or target, and either red (2) or magenta (6) forming a contiguous block.
3.  **Structure:** Each input row contains a single contiguous block of a non-white, non-orange color (red or magenta) and a single orange pixel. The rest of the pixels are white background.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal shift of the contiguous colored block (red or magenta).
5.  **Movement:** The colored block moves to the right.
6.  **Target:** The movement stops when the rightmost pixel of the colored block is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the orange pixel.
7.  **Invariance:** The orange pixel's position remains unchanged. The pixels to the right of the orange pixel (if any) also remain unchanged. The color and length of the moved block remain unchanged. The overall length of the row remains unchanged.

    steps:

      - Fill with background color up to the calculated destination start position.
      - Place the Movable Block (original color, original length) starting at the destination start position.
      - Place the Target Pixel at its original position (target_index).
      - Copy pixels from the input array located after the Target Pixel (from target_index + 1 onwards) to the output array.

assumptions:
  - Input is a single row (1D array).
  - Exactly one Target Pixel (7) exists.
  - Exactly one Movable Block (contiguous non-0, non-7 color) exists.
  - Background is white (0).
  - The Movable Block can always fit to the left of the Target Pixel in the output.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input row to find the single orange pixel (the "Target Pixel") and note its index. Identify the single contiguous block of pixels that are neither white nor orange (the "Movable Block"), noting its color, start index, and length. Assume white is the background color.
2.  **Calculate Destination:** Determine the target start index for the Movable Block by subtracting its length from the index of the Target Pixel.
3.  **Construct Output:**
    a.  Create a new row of the same length as the input row.
    b.  Fill the new row with the background color (white) from the beginning up to the calculated target start index (exclusive).
    c.  Place the Movable Block (using its original color and length) into the new row, starting at the target start index.
    d.  Place the Target Pixel (orange) into the new row at its original index.
    e.  Copy any pixels that were originally located to the right of the Target Pixel in the input row into the corresponding positions in the new row.
4.  **Return:** The constructed new row is the output.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" indicates that the code attempted to evaluate a NumPy array (likely the `input_grid`) in a boolean context, which is invalid for arrays with more than one element. This strongly suggests the input `input_grid` is being passed as a 2D NumPy array (a grid, even if it's just 1xN), while the code was written assuming a 1D list or array.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input data structure is indeed a 2D NumPy array.
2.  Adjust the code to explicitly operate on the first (and presumably only) row of the input grid.
3.  Ensure the output is returned in the correct format (a 2D NumPy array or list of lists).

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the structure of the input examples.


*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1
input_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7]])
output_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7]])

# Example 2
input_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]])
output_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]])

# Example 3
input_3 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]])
output_3 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0]])

print(f"Input 1 shape: {input_1.shape}, Output 1 shape: {output_1.shape}")
print(f"Input 2 shape: {input_2.shape}, Output 2 shape: {output_2.shape}")
print(f"Input 3 shape: {input_3.shape}, Output 3 shape: {output_3.shape}")

# Check if inputs are treated as boolean (causes error)
try:
    if input_1: print("Input 1 evaluated as True")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Input 1 boolean check error: {e}")

try:
    if input_2: print("Input 2 evaluated as True")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Input 2 boolean check error: {e}")

try:
    if input_3: print("Input 3 evaluated as True")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Input 3 boolean check error: {e}")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Input 1 shape: (1, 18), Output 1 shape: (1, 18)
Input 2 shape: (1, 18), Output 2 shape: (1, 18)
Input 3 shape: (1, 18), Output 3 shape: (1, 18)
Input 1 boolean check error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
Input 2 boolean check error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
Input 3 boolean check error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

```
The metrics confirm that the inputs and outputs are 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, N), meaning they are grids containing a single row. The boolean check confirms this structure causes the observed error.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  **Access Row:** Take the input, which is a 2D grid containing a single row. Extract this single row for processing.
2.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the extracted row to find the single orange pixel (the "Target Pixel") and note its column index. Identify the single contiguous block of pixels that are neither white nor orange (the "Movable Block"), noting its color, starting column index, and length. Assume white is the background color.
3.  **Calculate Destination:** Determine the target starting column index for the Movable Block by subtracting its length from the column index of the Target Pixel.
4.  **Construct Output Row:**
    a.  Create a new row (as a list or 1D array) of the same length as the input row.
    b.  Fill the new row with the background color (white) from the beginning up to the calculated target starting column index (exclusive).
    c.  Place the Movable Block (using its original color and length) into the new row, starting at the target starting column index.
    d.  Place the Target Pixel (orange) into the new row at its original column index.
    e.  Copy any pixels that were originally located to the right of the Target Pixel in the input row into the corresponding positions in the new row.
5.  **Format Output:** Package the newly constructed row into a 2D structure (e.g., a list containing the row, or a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N)) to match the expected output format.
6.  **Return:** The final 2D grid containing the transformed row is the output.
