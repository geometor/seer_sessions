Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Data Format:** The input and output data are presented as single rows (or 1D arrays) of colored pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors observed are white (0) acting as a background, orange (7) acting as a fixed point or target, and either red (2) or magenta (6) forming a contiguous block.
3.  **Structure:** Each input row contains a single contiguous block of a non-white, non-orange color (red or magenta) and a single orange pixel. The rest of the pixels are white background.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal shift of the contiguous colored block (red or magenta).
5.  **Movement:** The colored block moves to the right.
6.  **Target:** The movement stops when the rightmost pixel of the colored block is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the orange pixel.
7.  **Invariance:** The orange pixel's position remains unchanged. The pixels to the right of the orange pixel (if any) also remain unchanged. The color and length of the moved block remain unchanged. The overall length of the row remains unchanged.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored block rightwards until it touches a target pixel.

elements:
  - object: Background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills empty space.
  - object: Movable Block
    attributes:
      - color: Varies (red(2) or magenta(6) in examples)
      - shape: Contiguous horizontal line segment.
      - count: Exactly one per input row.
      - definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels that are not background (0) and not target (7).
  - object: Target Pixel
    attributes:
      - color: orange (7)
      - count: Exactly one per input row.
      - role: Acts as a fixed endpoint for the movement.

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the Movable Block is immediately to the left of the Target Pixel.
  - type: Spatial Constraint
    description: The Target Pixel's position is fixed from input to output. Pixels to the right of the Target Pixel are also fixed.

actions:
  - action: Identify
    target: Background color (0), Target Pixel (7), Movable Block (non-0, non-7 contiguous sequence).
  - action: Calculate
    target: Position of Target Pixel (target_index).
    target: Length of Movable Block (block_length).
    result: Destination start position for Movable Block (target_index - block_length).
  - action: Move
    object: Movable Block
    direction: Right
    termination_condition: Right edge of Movable Block is adjacent to the left edge of Target Pixel.
  - action: Reconstruct
    steps:
      - Create an output array of the same size as the input.
      - Fill with background color up to the calculated destination start position.
      - Place the Movable Block (original color, original length) starting at the destination start position.
      - Place the Target Pixel at its original position (target_index).
      - Copy pixels from the input array located after the Target Pixel (from target_index + 1 onwards) to the output array.

assumptions:
  - Input is a single row (1D array).
  - Exactly one Target Pixel (7) exists.
  - Exactly one Movable Block (contiguous non-0, non-7 color) exists.
  - Background is white (0).
  - The Movable Block can always fit to the left of the Target Pixel in the output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input row to find the single orange pixel (the "Target Pixel") and note its index. Identify the single contiguous block of pixels that are neither white nor orange (the "Movable Block"), noting its color, start index, and length. Assume white is the background color.
2.  **Calculate Destination:** Determine the target start index for the Movable Block by subtracting its length from the index of the Target Pixel.
3.  **Construct Output:**
    a.  Create a new row of the same length as the input row.
    b.  Fill the new row with the background color (white) from the beginning up to the calculated target start index (exclusive).
    c.  Place the Movable Block (using its original color and length) into the new row, starting at the target start index.
    d.  Place the Target Pixel (orange) into the new row at its original index.
    e.  Copy any pixels that were originally located to the right of the Target Pixel in the input row into the corresponding positions in the new row.
4.  **Return:** The constructed new row is the output.
