The rest of the pixels are white background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal shift of the contiguous colored block (red or magenta).\n5.  **Movement:** The colored block moves to the right.\n6.  **Target:** The movement stops when the rightmost pixel of the colored block is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the orange pixel.\n7.  **Invariance:** The orange pixel's position remains unchanged. The pixels to the right of the orange pixel (if any) also remain unchanged. The color and length of the moved block remain unchanged. The overall length of the row remains unchanged.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Assume white is the background color.\n2.  **Calculate Destination:** Determine the target start index for the Movable Block by subtracting its length from the index of the Target Pixel.\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    a.  Create a new row of the same length as the input row.\n    b.  Fill the new row with the background color (white) from the beginning up to the calculated target start index (exclusive).\n    c.
