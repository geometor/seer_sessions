task_description: Move a colored block rightwards until it touches a target pixel.

elements:
  - object: Background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills empty space.
  - object: Movable Block
    attributes:
      - color: Varies (red(2) or magenta(6) in examples)
      - shape: Contiguous horizontal line segment.
      - count: Exactly one per input row.
      - definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels that are not background (0) and not target (7).
  - object: Target Pixel
    attributes:
      - color: orange (7)
      - count: Exactly one per input row.
      - role: Acts as a fixed endpoint for the movement.

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the Movable Block is immediately to the left of the Target Pixel.
  - type: Spatial Constraint
    description: The Target Pixel's position is fixed from input to output. Pixels to the right of the Target Pixel are also fixed.

actions:
  - action: Identify
    target: Background color (0), Target Pixel (7), Movable Block (non-0, non-7 contiguous sequence).
  - action: Calculate
    target: Position of Target Pixel (target_index).
    target: Length of Movable Block (block_length).
    result: Destination start position for Movable Block (target_index - block_length).
  - action: Move
    object: Movable Block
    direction: Right
    termination_condition: Right edge of Movable Block is adjacent to the left edge of Target Pixel.
  - action: Reconstruct
    steps:
      - Create an output array of the same size as the input.
      - Fill with background color up to the calculated destination start position.
      - Place the Movable Block (original color, original length) starting at the destination start position.
      - Place the Target Pixel at its original position (target_index).
      - Copy pixels from the input array located after the Target Pixel (from target_index + 1 onwards) to the output array.

assumptions:
  - Input is a single row (1D array).
  - Exactly one Target Pixel (7) exists.
  - Exactly one Movable Block (contiguous non-0, non-7 color) exists.
  - Background is white (0).
  - The Movable Block can always fit to the left of the Target Pixel in the output.
