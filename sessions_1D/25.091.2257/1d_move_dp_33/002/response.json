This strongly suggests the input `input_grid` is being passed as a 2D NumPy array (a grid, even if it's just 1xN), while the code was written assuming a 1D list or array.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input data structure is indeed a 2D NumPy array.\n2.  Adjust the code to explicitly operate on the first (and presumably only) row of the input grid.\n3.  Ensure the output is returned in the correct format (a 2D NumPy array or list of lists).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the structure of the input examples.\n"

Identify the single contiguous block of pixels that are neither white nor orange (the \"Movable Block\"), noting its color, starting column index, and length. Assume white is the background color.\n3.  **Calculate Destination:** Determine the target starting column index for the Movable Block by subtracting its length from the column index of the Target Pixel.\n4.  **Construct Output Row:**\n    a.  Create a new row (as a list or 1D array) of the same length as the input row.\n    b.  Fill the new row with the background color (white) from the beginning up to the calculated target starting column index (exclusive).\n    c.
