"""
Move a contiguous colored block rightwards until its right edge is immediately 
adjacent to the left edge of a fixed orange target pixel.

1. Identify the background color (0), the fixed target pixel (7), and the 
   movable colored block (contiguous sequence of non-0, non-7 pixels).
2. Determine the index of the target pixel and the color, start index, and 
   length of the movable block.
3. Calculate the destination start index for the movable block, which is the 
   target pixel's index minus the block's length.
4. Construct the output row:
   a. Initialize with the background color.
   b. Place the movable block at the calculated destination start index.
   c. Place the target pixel at its original index.
   d. Copy any pixels from the input that were originally to the right of 
      the target pixel.
