task_description: Move a colored block within a single-row grid rightwards until it touches a target pixel in the same row.

elements:
  - object: Grid
    attributes:
      - type: 2D NumPy array
      - shape: (1, N) - Always a single row.
  - object: Background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills empty space within the row.
  - object: Movable Block
    attributes:
      - location: Within the single row of the grid.
      - color: Varies (red(2) or magenta(6) in examples)
      - shape: Contiguous horizontal line segment within the row.
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
      - definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels within the row that are not background (0) and not target (7).
  - object: Target Pixel
    attributes:
      - location: Within the single row of the grid.
      - color: orange (7)
      - count: Exactly one per input grid.
      - role: Acts as a fixed endpoint for the movement within the row.

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: In the output grid's row, the rightmost pixel of the Movable Block is immediately to the left of the Target Pixel.
  - type: Spatial Constraint
    description: The Target Pixel's column position within the row is fixed from input to output. Pixels to the right of the Target Pixel within the row are also fixed.

actions:
  - action: Access Row
    target: The first (and only) row of the input grid.
  - action: Identify
    context: Within the accessed row.
    target: Background color (0), Target Pixel (7), Movable Block (non-0, non-7 contiguous sequence).
  - action: Calculate
    context: Within the accessed row.
    target: Column index of Target Pixel (target_index).
    target: Length of Movable Block (block_length).
    result: Destination start column index for Movable Block (target_index - block_length).
  - action: Move
    context: Within the accessed row.
    object: Movable Block
    direction: Right
    termination_condition: Right edge of Movable Block is adjacent to the left edge of Target Pixel.
  - action: Reconstruct
    steps:
      - Create an output row of the same length as the input row.
      - Fill with background color up to the calculated destination start column index.
      - Place the Movable Block (original color, original length) starting at the destination start column index.
      - Place the Target Pixel at its original column index.
      - Copy pixels from the input row located after the Target Pixel (from target_index + 1 onwards) to the output row.
      - Format the final output as a 2D grid (list containing the single output row or a 2D NumPy array).

assumptions:
  - Input is a 2D grid with exactly one row.
  - Exactly one Target Pixel (7) exists in the row.
  - Exactly one Movable Block (contiguous non-0, non-7 color) exists in the row.
  - Background is white (0).
  - The Movable Block can always fit to the left of the Target Pixel in the output row.
