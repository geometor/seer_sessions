Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** All examples consist of a single row (1D grid).
*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and one other non-white color per example (magenta (6), blue (1), gray (5)).
*   **Objects:**
    *   A background of white pixels (0).
    *   A single, contiguous block (segment) of a specific color (magenta, blue, or gray).
    *   A single azure pixel (8) acting as a marker or anchor point.
*   **Relationships:**
    *   In the input, the colored block appears somewhere to the left of the azure pixel, separated by zero or more white pixels.
    *   In the output, the colored block is positioned immediately to the left of the azure pixel.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation is a positional shift of the colored block. The block moves horizontally so that its rightmost pixel becomes adjacent to the left side of the azure pixel. The length and color of the block, as well as the position of the azure pixel, are preserved. The rest of the grid remains white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
grid_dimensions:
  - input: [1, 30]
  - output: [1, 30]
pixels_used:
  - white (0)
  - azure (8)
  - magenta (6) or blue (1) or gray (5) # Varies per example
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: non-white, non-azure (magenta, blue, or gray)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - variable length
      - variable color (one specific color per input grid)
  - type: marker
    color: azure (8)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - single pixel
      - fixed position within the transformation
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - fills remaining space
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: color_segment
    object2: azure_marker
    state:
      - input: separated by zero or more white pixels
      - output: color_segment's right end is immediately left-adjacent to azure_marker
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: color_segment (non-white, non-azure contiguous block)
    properties:
      - color
      - length
      - position
  - action: identify
    target: azure_marker (pixel with value 8)
    properties:
      - position
  - action: construct_output
    elements:
      - create a grid of the same dimensions filled with white (0)
      - place the identified azure_marker at its original position
      - place the identified color_segment such that its rightmost pixel is at the position immediately to the left of the azure_marker's position
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Scan the input grid to locate the contiguous segment of non-white, non-azure pixels (the "colored block"). Record its color and length.
3.  Scan the input grid to locate the single azure pixel (8). Record its position (column index).
4.  In the output grid, place the azure pixel (8) at the same position it occupied in the input grid.
5.  Calculate the starting position for the colored block in the output grid: `azure_pixel_position - block_length`.
6.  Place the identified colored block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated position.
