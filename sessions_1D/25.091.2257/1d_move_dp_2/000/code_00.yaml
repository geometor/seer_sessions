    state:
      - input: separated by zero or more white pixels
      - output: color_segment's right end is immediately left-adjacent to azure_marker
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: color_segment (non-white, non-azure contiguous block)
    properties:
      - color
      - length

    elements:
      - create a grid of the same dimensions filled with white (0)
      - place the identified azure_marker at its original position
      - place the identified color_segment such that its rightmost pixel is at the position immediately to the left of the azure_marker's position
