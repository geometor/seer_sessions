**General Assessment**

The previous code correctly identified the pattern `[0, 0, 1, 0]` and the sequence `[1, 0]` as the suffix. It also correctly identified the two white pixels `[0, 0]` immediately preceding the `1` as the pixels to be moved. However, the construction of the output was flawed. The code mistakenly removed the last element of the sequence preceding the `[0, 0, 1, 0]` pattern (`prefix[:-1]`). This resulted in an output grid that was one element shorter than the input and expected output grids, causing the mismatches in size and color counts.

The strategy is to correct the output construction logic. Instead of removing an element from the prefix, the code should concatenate the moved `[0, 0]`, the entire prefix, and the suffix `[1, 0]` to maintain the original grid length and preserve all original elements other than the moved zeros in their relative order.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D grid by moving specific white pixels based on a trailing marker pattern.
elements:
  - object: grid
    property: single row (1D array)
    constraints: grid length remains constant throughout the transformation.
  - object: marker_pattern
    property: sequence of [white, white, blue, white] pixels (values [0, 0, 1, 0])
    location: always present near the end of the input grid.
  - object: moved_whites
    property: sequence of two white pixels [white, white] (values [0, 0])
    location: immediately preceding the blue pixel of the marker_pattern in the input.
  - object: main_sequence
    property: all pixels in the input grid excluding the moved_whites.
    location: consists of pixels before the moved_whites and the [blue, white] (values [1, 0]) part of the marker_pattern.
transformation:
  action: move
  source_object: moved_whites
  destination: prepend to the main_sequence.
constraints:
  - The relative order of pixels within the main_sequence is preserved.
  - The overall length of the grid remains constant.
  - The marker_pattern [0, 0, 1, 0] is always present in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the fixed sequence `[0, 0, 1, 0]` (two whites, one blue, one white) within the input grid row. Let the index of the blue pixel (`1`) be `M`.
2.  Identify the two white pixels (`[0, 0]`) immediately preceding the blue pixel. These are located at indices `M-2` and `M-1`. These are the `moved_whites`.
3.  Construct the output row by:
    a.  Starting with the `moved_whites` (`[0, 0]`).
    b.  Appending all pixels from the beginning of the input row up to (but not including) the `moved_whites` (i.e., indices `0` to `M-3`).
    c.  Appending the final part of the marker pattern, which is the blue pixel and the last white pixel (`[1, 0]`), located at indices `M` and `M+1` in the input.
4.  The resulting sequence forms the output grid row, which will have the same length as the input row.
