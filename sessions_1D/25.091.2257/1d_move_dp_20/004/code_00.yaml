task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D grid by moving specific white pixels based on a trailing marker pattern.
elements:
  - object: grid
    property: single row (1D array)
    constraints: grid length remains constant throughout the transformation.
  - object: marker_pattern
    property: sequence of [white, white, blue, white] pixels (values [0, 0, 1, 0])
    location: always present near the end of the input grid.
  - object: moved_whites
    property: sequence of two white pixels [white, white] (values [0, 0])
    location: immediately preceding the blue pixel of the marker_pattern in the input.
  - object: main_sequence
    property: all pixels in the input grid excluding the moved_whites.
    location: consists of pixels before the moved_whites and the [blue, white] (values [1, 0]) part of the marker_pattern.
transformation:
  action: move
  source_object: moved_whites
  destination: prepend to the main_sequence.
constraints:
  - The relative order of pixels within the main_sequence is preserved.
  - The overall length of the grid remains constant.
  - The marker_pattern [0, 0, 1, 0] is always present in the input.
