            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the pattern `[0, 0, 1, 0]` and the sequence `[1, 0]` as the suffix. It also correctly identified the two white pixels `[0, 0]` immediately preceding the `1` as the pixels to be moved. However, the construction of the output was flawed. The code mistakenly removed the last element of the sequence preceding the `[0, 0, 1, 0]` pattern (`prefix[:-1]`). This resulted in an output grid that was one element shorter than the input and expected output grids, causing the mismatches in size and color counts.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the output construction logic. Instead of removing an element from the prefix, the code should concatenate the moved `[0, 0]`, the entire prefix, and the suffix `[1, 0]` to maintain the original grid length and preserve all original elements other than the moved zeros in their relative order.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
