*   **Perception of the elements**:
    *   The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays).
    *   The grids contain pixels of white (0), blue (1), and one other color (magenta (6) or yellow (4)).
    *   Each input grid features a structure: some initial white pixels, a contiguous block of a single non-white/non-blue color (the "main block"), followed by exactly two white pixels, a single blue pixel, and a final white pixel.
    *   The transformation involves rearranging the pixels within the row.
    *   The main block of color appears shifted to the right in the output compared to the input.
    *   The number of leading white pixels increases by two in the output.
    *   The two white pixels that were immediately before the blue pixel in the input are no longer there in the output; instead, two white pixels appear at the beginning.
    *   The blue pixel and the final white pixel remain fixed at the end of the grid.
    *   The color and length of the main block remain unchanged.
    *   The overall length of the grid remains unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts**:

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the sequence `[0, 0, 1, 0]` (two whites, one blue, one white) near the end of the input grid row.
    2.  Remove the two white pixels (`[0, 0]`) that immediately precede the blue pixel (`1`).
    3.  Insert these two removed white pixels (`[0, 0]`) at the very beginning of the grid row.
    4.  The resulting arrangement of pixels forms the output grid row.

*   **General Assessment**:
    *   The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: locating the `[0, 0, 1, 0]` sequence and moving the first two `0`s to the beginning of the row.
    *   The error reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") strongly indicates an issue with how the input data type (likely a NumPy array provided by the testing environment) is being handled within the Python function, specifically in conditional checks (`if not input_grid`). The function expects standard Python lists based on its type hints.
    *   The strategy is to adjust the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, likely by explicitly converting the relevant parts to Python lists or using NumPy-compatible checks, while keeping the core transformation logic intact.

```
    ***Correction during Metrics Analysis:*** The code output reveals a discrepancy. The expected output length is 18, while the input length is 19. My initial perception and NLP assumed the length remained constant. Let's re-examine the examples.

    *   Example 1 Input: `[0, 6, 6, ..., 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]` (Length 19)
    *   Example 1 Output: `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, ..., 6, 6, 1, 0]` (Length 18)

    It seems one `0` from the original input is *not* carried over to the output. Revisiting the transformation:
    1.  Input starts with some elements.
    2.  Then `[0, 0, 1, 0]` occurs.
    3.  The two `0`s before the `1` are moved to the front.
    4.  The `1` and the final `0` remain at the end.
    5.  The elements *before* the `[0, 0, 1, 0]` sequence are placed *after* the moved `0`s and *before* the final `[1, 0]`.

    Let's trace Example 1:
    Input: `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, | 0, 0, 1, 0]`
    Indices: `0, 1, ..., 14` | `15, 16, 17, 18`
    Identify `[0, 0, 1, 0]` at indices `[15, 16, 17, 18]`.
    Move `0` at index `15` and `0` at index `16` to the front.
    Keep `1` at index `17` and `0` at index `18` at the end.
    Take elements from index `0` to `14`: `[0, 6, ..., 6]`
    Construct output: `[0, 0]` (moved) + `[0, 6, ..., 6]` (original start) + `[1, 0]` (original end)
    Output: `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]` (Length 18)

    This matches the expected output. The length *does* change from 19 to 18. The final `0` of the input pattern `[0, 0, 1, 0]` seems to be the *only* `0` at the very end of the output, along with the `1`. The two `0`s identified before the `1` are moved. It implies the input structure is `<prefix> <zero> <zero> <one> <zero>`, and the output is `<moved_zero> <moved_zero> <prefix> <one> <zero>`. The length decreases by one because the original `<prefix>` already contained some leading zeros that are combined with the moved zeros. *No, wait.* The length decrease is simpler: the input has `prefix` + `[0, 0, 1, 0]`. The output has `[0, 0]` + `prefix` + `[1, 0]`. The number of elements in `prefix` is `len(input) - 4`. The number of elements in output is `2 + (len(input) - 4) + 2 = len(input)`. The metrics code output showing length 18 for output is incorrect based on my re-analysis and the provided example outputs. Let me re-run the length check.

    Example 1 Output: `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]` - Length is 18.
    Example 1 Input: `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]` - Length is 19.

    Okay, the length *does* decrease. Why?
    Input: `prefix` (len=15) + `[0, 0, 1, 0]` (len=4). Total=19.
    Output: `[0, 0]` (len=2) + `prefix` (len=15) + `[1, 0]` (len=2). Total=19.

    Let's re-examine the provided output for train_1:
    Input: `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]`
    Output: `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]`

    Prefix is `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` (Length 15)
    Pattern is `[0, 0, 1, 0]` at indices 15, 16, 17, 18.
    Moved Zeros are `[0, 0]` from indices 15, 16.
    Final sequence is `[1, 0]` from indices 17, 18.
    Result = `[0, 0]` + `prefix` + `[1, 0]`
    Result = `[0, 0]` + `[0, 6, 6, ..., 6]` + `[1, 0]`
    Result = `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]` - This indeed has length 18 (2 + 15 + 1 = 18). Hmm, my formula `2 + prefix_len + 2` was wrong. It should be `2 + prefix_len + 1` if the final 0 is shared? No, that doesn't make sense.

    Let's look at the elements:
    Input: `e_0, e_1, ..., e_{p-1}, | 0, 0, 1, 0` where p is the index of the first 0 in the pattern (p=15 in ex1). Length = p + 4.
    Output: `0, 0, | e_0, e_1, ..., e_{p-1}, | 1, 0`. Length = 2 + p + 2 = p + 4.

    Why are the provided outputs length 18?
    Train 1 Output: `0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 0` (len 18)
    Train 2 Output: `0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 0` (len 18)
    Train 3 Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 0` (len 18)

    There must be an error in the provided output examples if my derivation is correct. Let me trust the examples provided. How can we get length 18 from 19? We must lose one element.
    Which element is lost?
    Comparing input[0] `[0, 6, ..., 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]` and output[0] `[0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]`.
    Prefix: `[0, 6, 6, ..., 6]` (len 15). Contains one '0' at the start.
    Moved: `[0, 0]`
    End marker: `[1, 0]`
    Output constructed: `[0, 0]` + Prefix + `[1, 0]` = `[0, 0] + [0, 6, ..., 6] + [1, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]`
    This result matches the provided output and has length 18.
    So the length calculation is `2 + prefix_len + 2` = `2 + 15 + 2 = 19`. Where does the 18 come from?

    Let's re-evaluate the `prefix`.
    Input: `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, | 0, 0, 1, 0]`
    Pattern starts at index 15. `prefix` = `input[0:15]` = `[0, 6, 6, ..., 6]`
    Moved elements are `input[15:17]` = `[0, 0]`
    End elements are `input[17:19]` = `[1, 0]`
    Output = `list(input[15:17]) + list(input[0:15]) + list(input[17:19])`
    Output = `[0, 0] + [0, 6, ..., 6] + [1, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]`
    Length = `2 + 15 + 2 = 19`.

    I am consistently getting length 19 based on the logic, but the provided outputs have length 18. Is it possible the input string representation in the prompt omitted a space or element?
    Input 1: `0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0` (Count = 19)
    Output 1: `0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 0` (Count = 18)

    This confirms the length difference. The only way `[0, 0] + prefix + [1, 0]` results in length 18 when `prefix` has length 15 is if one element is removed. Which one?
    Comparing `prefix = [0, 6, 6, ..., 6]` with the middle part of the output `[0, 6, 6, ..., 6]`. They appear identical.
    Comparing `moved = [0, 0]` with start of output `[0, 0]`. Matches.
    Comparing `end = [1, 0]` with end of output `[1, 0]`. Matches.

    Let's try Example 3:
    Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, | 0, 0, 1, 0]` (len 19)
    Prefix: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` (len 15)
    Moved: `[0, 0]`
    End: `[1, 0]`
    Output Expected: `[0, 0] + prefix + [1, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]` (len 19)
    Output Given: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]` (len 18)

    There is definitely a length discrepancy. The provided outputs are shorter by 1 element.
    Where could the element be lost? It must be from the `prefix`.
    Output 1 middle: `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` (len 15)
    Output 3 middle: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` (len 16)

    Wait, the prefix length is NOT constant!
    Example 1 Prefix: `input[0:15]` = `[0, 6, ..., 6]`. Length 15.
    Example 3 Prefix: `input[0:15]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6]`. Length 15.

    Output 1 middle section: `output[2:-2]` = `[0, 6, 6, ..., 6]` (Indices 2 to 15 inclusive -> 14 elements!)
    Output 3 middle section: `output[2:-2]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6]` (Indices 2 to 15 inclusive -> 14 elements!)

    So, the rule is: `Output = [0, 0] + Prefix[1:] + [1, 0]` ? Let's test this.
    Ex 1: Prefix = `[0, 6, ..., 6]`. Prefix[1:] = `[6, ..., 6]` (len 14). Output = `[0, 0] + [6, ..., 6] + [1, 0]` = `[0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]`. Length 18. This DOES NOT match the output `[0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]`.

    Let's rethink: Maybe the definition of the pattern or what gets moved is slightly off.
    Pattern: `[0, 0, 1, 0]`
    Input: `A B C ... X Y Z | 0 0 1 0`
    Output: `0 0 | A B C ... X Y Z | 1 0`  -- This gives length 19 for Ex 1. Fails.

    Consider the structure `Leading_Zeros | Main_Block | 0 0 1 0`
    Ex 1: `[0]` | `[6...6]` | `[0, 0, 1, 0]`
    Ex 3: `[0,0,0,0]` | `[6...6]` | `[0, 0, 1, 0]`

    Transformation: Move the `[0, 0]` before the `[1, 0]` to the *very beginning*.
    Ex 1 Input: `[0, 6, ..., 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]`
    Move `[0, 0]` -> Output starts `[0, 0, ...]`
    Remaining input: `[0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]`
    Append remaining -> Output: `[0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]`
    This matches Output 1 and has length 18. This logic works!

    Let's test on Example 3:
    Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]`
    Identify `[0, 0, 1, 0]`. The two `0`s before `1` are at index 15, 16.
    Move `[0, 0]` to front.
    Remaining input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]` (Indices 0-14, 17, 18)
    Append remaining -> Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]`
    This matches Output 3 and has length 18.

    Okay, this revised logic holds for all examples and explains the length change. The original NLP was almost correct, but the construction method was slightly flawed. It's not about concatenating prefix; it's about removing the two zeros and inserting them at the beginning.

    Recalculate metrics based on the confirmed understanding. The `find_pattern_index` function correctly finds the index of '1'. The indices to remove are `marker_index - 2` and `marker_index - 1`.

```
    ***Further Correction:*** The metrics simulation confirms my *second* attempt at the logic was also wrong. Moving the elements `[0, 0]` to the front and appending the rest results in the wrong output. The length difference *is* real.

    Let's trace Example 1 *very carefully* again.
    Input:  `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]` (len 19)
    Output: `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]` (len 18)

    Pattern `[0, 0, 1, 0]` starts at index 15. The relevant indices are 15, 16, 17, 18.
    The elements to move seem to be the two zeros at indices 15 and 16.
    Let's denote the input as `I`.
    Let `prefix = I[0:15]` = `[0, 6, ..., 6]`
    Let `moved_zeros = I[15:17]` = `[0, 0]`
    Let `suffix = I[17:19]` = `[1, 0]`

    Output is `[0, 0, | 0, 6, ..., 6, | 1, 0]` (len 18)
    It seems the output is constructed as: `moved_zeros` + `prefix` + `suffix`.
    `[0, 0] + [0, 6, ..., 6] + [1, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]`
    This matches the output and has length 2 + 15 + 2 = 19.

    I am completely stuck on why the output length is 18. There must be something fundamentally different.

    Could the pattern be different? What if the pattern is just `[0, 1, 0]`?
    Ex 1: `... 6, 0, | 0, 1, 0]` -> `0` is at index 16. Pattern `[0, 1, 0]` starts index 16.
    Ex 3: `... 6, 0, | 0, 1, 0]` -> `0` is at index 16. Pattern `[0, 1, 0]` starts index 16.

    What if the rule is: Find the *last* sequence `[C, 0, 1, 0]` where C is any color. Move the `0` *before* the `1` to the start of the grid.
    Ex 1: `... 6, 0, | 0, 1, 0]`. Last `[C, 0, 1, 0]` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]` starting at index 15. The `0` before `1` is at index 16.
    Move `I[16]` (value 0) to the front.
    Input: `[0, 6, ..., 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]`
    Remove `I[16]`: `[0, 6, ..., 6, 0, 1, 0]` (len 18)
    Insert `0` at front: `[0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 0, 1, 0]` (len 19) - Doesn't match.

    What if we move *two* elements?
    Maybe the "pattern" includes the block before it?
    Find `[X, 0, 0, 1, 0]` where X is non-zero?
    Ex 1: `[6, 0, 0, 1, 0]` starts at index 14.
    Ex 3: `[6, 0, 0, 1, 0]` starts at index 14.

    Let's reconsider the "move two white pixels" idea.
    Input: `prefix + [0, 0, 1, 0]`
    Output: `[0, 0] + prefix + [1, 0]`
    Why does this result in length 18 in the examples?
    `len(output) = 2 + len(prefix) + 2`.
    If `len(output) == 18`, then `len(prefix)` must be 14.
    But `len(prefix) = len(input) - 4 = 19 - 4 = 15`.
    This is a contradiction based on the provided examples.

    Possibility 1: The prompt's output examples are wrong (length should be 19).
    Possibility 2: My understanding of `prefix`, `moved`, `suffix` is wrong.
    Possibility 3: The operation is not simple rearrangement.

    Let's assume the outputs ARE correct (length 18).
    Input (19): `P1 P2 ... P15 | 0 0 1 0`
    Output (18): `O1 O2 ... O18`
    We know `O1=0, O2=0`.
    We know `O17=1, O18=0`.
    So `Output = [0, 0] + Middle + [1, 0]`.
    `len(Middle) = 18 - 2 - 2 = 14`.
    The middle part must come from the `prefix = P1..P15` (len 15).
    How to get 14 elements from 15? Remove one. Which one?
    Ex 1 Prefix: `[0, 6, 6, ..., 6]`
    Ex 1 Middle: `[0, 6, 6, ..., 6]`
    Wait, I counted the middle section length wrong earlier.
    Output 1: `[0, 0, | 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, | 1, 0]`
    Middle section: indices 2 to 15. That's `15 - 2 + 1 = 14` elements.
    Prefix: indices 0 to 14. That's `14 - 0 + 1 = 15` elements.
    Prefix = `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]`
    Middle = `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]`
    It looks like the *last* element of the prefix (`P15`, which is 6 in Ex1) is dropped.

    Let's test this hypothesis:
    Hypothesis: Output = `[0, 0] + Prefix[:-1] + [1, 0]`
    Ex 1:
    Prefix = `I[0:15]` = `[0, 6, ..., 6, 6]`
    Prefix[:-1] = `I[0:14]` = `[0, 6, ..., 6]` (len 14)
    Moved = `[0, 0]`
    End = `[1, 0]`
    Output = `[0, 0] + [0, 6, ..., 6] + [1, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]` (len 18). Matches Output 1.

    Ex 3:
    Input = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, | 0, 0, 1, 0]`
    Prefix = `I[0:15]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 6]`
    Prefix[:-1] = `I[0:14]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6]` (len 14)
    Moved = `[0, 0]`
    End = `[1, 0]`
    Output = `[0, 0] + [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6] + [1, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, ..., 6, 1, 0]` (len 18). Matches Output 3.

    This hypothesis works for all examples and explains the length change.

The simulation now confirms the hypothesis.

*   **General Assessment**:
    *   The initial error was due to NumPy array handling in Python conditions.
    *   Further analysis revealed the initial understanding of the transformation was slightly incorrect regarding the output length and composition.
    *   The core pattern `[0, 0, 1, 0]` near the end is correctly identified.
    *   The transformation involves taking the two `0`s immediately preceding the `1`, placing them at the start of the output. The elements preceding these two `0`s in the input form a `prefix`. The `[1, 0]` sequence forms the `suffix`. The final output is constructed by concatenating the moved `[0, 0]`, then the `prefix` *excluding its last element*, and finally the `[1, 0]` suffix. This explains the decrease in length by one element.

*   **Metrics**:
    
```text
    Example 1: Input (1, 19), Output (1, 18). Pattern [0,0,1,0] found, '1' at index 17. Prefix length 15. Transformation successful.
    Example 2: Input (1, 19), Output (1, 18). Pattern [0,0,1,0] found, '1' at index 17. Prefix length 15. Transformation successful.
    Example 3: Input (1, 19), Output (1, 18). Pattern [0,0,1,0] found, '1' at index 17. Prefix length 15. Transformation successful.

      - Input grid is always 1 row.
      - Input grid always contains the pattern [0, 0, 1, 0] near the end.
      - Prefix segment always has at least one element (based on examples).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the sequence `[0, 0, 1, 0]` (two whites, one blue, one white) located near the end of the input grid row. Let the index of the blue pixel (`1`) be `M`.
    2.  Identify the two white pixels (`[0, 0]`) immediately preceding the blue pixel. These are at indices `M-2` and `M-1`. Call this sequence `moved_zeros`.
    3.  Identify the sequence of pixels from the beginning of the row up to index `M-3`. Call this the `prefix`.
    4.  Identify the final sequence consisting of the blue pixel and the last white pixel (`[1, 0]`) at indices `M` and `M+1`. Call this the `suffix`.
    5.  Construct the output row by concatenating:
        *   The `moved_zeros` sequence (`[0, 0]`).
        *   The `prefix` sequence, *excluding its last element*.
        *   The `suffix` sequence (`[1, 0]`).
    6.  The resulting row is the output grid. The length of the output row will be one less than the input row.
