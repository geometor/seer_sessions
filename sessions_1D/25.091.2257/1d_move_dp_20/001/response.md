"""
Identifies the sequence [0, 0, 1, 0] (two white, one blue, one white) near the end of the input grid row.
Removes the two white pixels ([0, 0]) that immediately precede the blue pixel (1).
Inserts these two removed white pixels ([0, 0]) at the very beginning of the grid row.
The resulting arrangement of pixels forms the output grid row.
