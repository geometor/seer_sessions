*   **Perception of the elements**:
    *   The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays).
    *   The grids contain pixels of white (0), blue (1), and one other color (magenta (6) or yellow (4)).
    *   Each input grid features a structure: some initial white pixels, a contiguous block of a single non-white/non-blue color (the "main block"), followed by exactly two white pixels, a single blue pixel, and a final white pixel.
    *   The transformation involves rearranging the pixels within the row.
    *   The main block of color appears shifted to the right in the output compared to the input.
    *   The number of leading white pixels increases by two in the output.
    *   The two white pixels that were immediately before the blue pixel in the input are no longer there in the output; instead, two white pixels appear at the beginning.
    *   The blue pixel and the final white pixel remain fixed at the end of the grid.
    *   The color and length of the main block remain unchanged.
    *   The overall length of the grid remains unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D grid based on specific markers.
    elements:
      - object: grid
        property: single row (1D array)
      - object: main_block
        property: contiguous sequence of a single color (not white or blue)
        location: variable start index in input
      - object: marker_sequence
        property: sequence of [blue, white] pixels (values [1, 0])
        location: fixed at the end of the grid
      - object: preceding_whites
        property: sequence of two white pixels (values [0, 0])
        location: immediately before the marker_sequence in the input
    transformation:
      action: move
      source_object: preceding_whites
      destination: beginning of the grid
    constraints:
      - grid size remains constant
      - main_block color and length remain constant
      - marker_sequence position remains constant relative to the end
      - input always contains the [0, 0, 1, 0] sequence towards the end
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the sequence `[0, 0, 1, 0]` (two whites, one blue, one white) near the end of the input grid row.
    2.  Remove the two white pixels (`[0, 0]`) that immediately precede the blue pixel (`1`).
    3.  Insert these two removed white pixels (`[0, 0]`) at the very beginning of the grid row.
    4.  The resulting arrangement of pixels forms the output grid row.
