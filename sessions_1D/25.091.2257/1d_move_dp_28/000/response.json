            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of colored pixels. The length of the array remains the same from input to output.\n2.  **Pixel Colors:** The examples use white (0), maroon (9), and one other primary color per example (magenta 6, azure 8, orange 7).\n3.  **Key Pixels/Objects:**\n    *   There is always exactly one maroon (9) pixel in the input. This seems to act as a crucial marker or anchor point.\n    *   There is always exactly one contiguous block of a single color that is *not* white (0) and *not* maroon (9). Let's call this the \"colored block\".\n    *   The rest of the pixels are white (0), acting as background or filler.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the position of the \"colored block\" relative to the maroon (9) pixel.\n5.  **Observation:** In the input, the colored block can appear anywhere relative to the maroon pixel (before it in all examples shown). In the output, the colored block is always positioned *immediately before* the maroon (9) pixel.\n6.  **Invariance:** The specific color of the \"colored block\" (magenta, azure, orange) is preserved. The single maroon (9) pixel is preserved. The number and relative order of the white (0) pixels amongst themselves are preserved, although their absolute positions shift due to the movement of the colored block. The total length of the array is preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
