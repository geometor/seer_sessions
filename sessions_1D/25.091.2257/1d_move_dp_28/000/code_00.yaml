task_context:
  grid_representation: 1D array or 1xN grid
  dimensionality: 1
  colors_present:
    - white (0): Background/filler pixel. Variable count.
    - maroon (9): Marker pixel. Always count 1.
    - variable_color (C): A single color C where C is not 0 and not 9. Forms the moving block. Always count >= 1.
objects:
  - id: marker
    description: The single maroon (9) pixel.
    properties:
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
  - id: moving_block
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the variable_color (C).
    properties:
      color: variable_color (C)
      contiguity: yes
      count: 1 instance per grid
  - id: background
    description: All white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      contiguity: Can be multiple separate blocks or single pixels.
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: moving_block
    object2: marker
    input_state: variable (moving_block can be anywhere relative to marker, but seems to be before it in examples)
    output_state: moving_block immediately precedes marker
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: marker (maroon 9 pixel)
  - action: identify
    target: moving_block (contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon color)
  - action: remove
    target: moving_block
    effect: Creates an intermediate array containing only background (white 0) pixels and the marker (maroon 9) pixel, preserving their relative order.
  - action: insert
    target: moving_block
    location: Immediately before the marker (maroon 9) pixel in the intermediate array.
invariants:
  - Total number of pixels (array length).
  - The color and pixels comprising the moving_block.
  - The single marker pixel.
  - The total number of background (white 0) pixels.
  - The relative order of all background pixels amongst themselves.
