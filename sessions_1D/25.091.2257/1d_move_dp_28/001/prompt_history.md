Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of colored pixels. The length of the array remains the same from input to output.
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The examples use white (0), maroon (9), and one other primary color per example (magenta 6, azure 8, orange 7).
3.  **Key Pixels/Objects:**
    *   There is always exactly one maroon (9) pixel in the input. This seems to act as a crucial marker or anchor point.
    *   There is always exactly one contiguous block of a single color that is *not* white (0) and *not* maroon (9). Let's call this the "colored block".
    *   The rest of the pixels are white (0), acting as background or filler.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the position of the "colored block" relative to the maroon (9) pixel.
5.  **Observation:** In the input, the colored block can appear anywhere relative to the maroon pixel (before it in all examples shown). In the output, the colored block is always positioned *immediately before* the maroon (9) pixel.
6.  **Invariance:** The specific color of the "colored block" (magenta, azure, orange) is preserved. The single maroon (9) pixel is preserved. The number and relative order of the white (0) pixels amongst themselves are preserved, although their absolute positions shift due to the movement of the colored block. The total length of the array is preserved.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: 1D array or 1xN grid
  dimensionality: 1
  colors_present:
    - white (0): Background/filler pixel. Variable count.
    - maroon (9): Marker pixel. Always count 1.
    - variable_color (C): A single color C where C is not 0 and not 9. Forms the moving block. Always count >= 1.
objects:
  - id: marker
    description: The single maroon (9) pixel.
    properties:
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
  - id: moving_block
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the variable_color (C).
    properties:
      color: variable_color (C)
      contiguity: yes
      count: 1 instance per grid
  - id: background
    description: All white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      contiguity: Can be multiple separate blocks or single pixels.
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: moving_block
    object2: marker
    input_state: variable (moving_block can be anywhere relative to marker, but seems to be before it in examples)
    output_state: moving_block immediately precedes marker
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: marker (maroon 9 pixel)
  - action: identify
    target: moving_block (contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon color)
  - action: remove
    target: moving_block
    effect: Creates an intermediate array containing only background (white 0) pixels and the marker (maroon 9) pixel, preserving their relative order.
  - action: insert
    target: moving_block
    location: Immediately before the marker (maroon 9) pixel in the intermediate array.
invariants:
  - Total number of pixels (array length).
  - The color and pixels comprising the moving_block.
  - The single marker pixel.
  - The total number of background (white 0) pixels.
  - The relative order of all background pixels amongst themselves.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input array to find the unique maroon (9) pixel and note its value and original index.
2.  Scan the input array to find the unique contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Identify the color and the sequence of pixels that make up this block.
3.  Create a new list containing all pixels from the input array *except* for those belonging to the identified colored block. Ensure the relative order of the remaining pixels (all the whites and the single maroon pixel) is maintained.
4.  Find the index of the maroon (9) pixel within this new list.
5.  Insert the sequence of pixels identified in step 2 (the colored block) into the new list at the index immediately before the maroon (9) pixel found in step 4.
6.  The resulting list is the final output array.
