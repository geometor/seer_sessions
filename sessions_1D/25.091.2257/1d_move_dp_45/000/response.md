Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

The input and output are both single rows (1D grids) of pixels. Each row contains white pixels (0) and some non-white pixels (e.g., blue=1, azure=8, magenta=6). The core transformation seems to involve rearranging the positions of the pixels based on their color. Specifically, the white pixels (0) that are located *between* blocks of non-white pixels are moved. These intervening white pixels are relocated to the position immediately before the first block of non-white pixels. The non-white pixels themselves, as well as any white pixels preceding the first non-white block or succeeding the last non-white block, maintain their relative order. The overall length of the row remains unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
Grid_Dimensions:
  - Input: 1xN (where N varies, e.g., 1x16)
  - Output: 1xN (same dimensions as input)

Pixel_Types:
  - White: Value 0
  - Non-White: Values 1-9

Objects:
  - White_Pixels: Individual pixels with value 0.
  - Non_White_Blocks: Contiguous sequences of one or more non-white pixels.

Relationships:
  - Order: Pixels are arranged sequentially in a row.
  - Adjacency: Pixels are next to each other.
  - Betweenness: Some White_Pixels may be located spatially between two distinct Non_White_Blocks.
  - Grouping: Non-white pixels of the same color adjacent to each other form blocks.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all Non_White_Blocks within the input row.
  - Identify: Locate all White_Pixels situated between the first and last Non_White_Blocks.
  - Partition: Conceptually divide the input row into segments:
      1. White_Pixels before the first Non_White_Block (Prefix_White).
      2. The sequence of Non_White_Blocks and the White_Pixels between them (Core_Segment).
      3. White_Pixels after the last Non_White_Block (Suffix_White).
  - Extract: Collect the White_Pixels that were between Non_White_Blocks within the Core_Segment (Middle_White).
  - Extract: Collect the Non_White_Blocks from the Core_Segment in their original relative order (Ordered_Blocks).
  - Reconstruct: Assemble the output row by concatenating:
      1. Prefix_White
      2. Middle_White
      3. Ordered_Blocks
      4. Suffix_White

Invariants:
  - The total number of pixels remains the same.
  - The count of each color pixel remains the same.
  - The relative order of Non_White_Blocks is preserved.
  - White pixels originally before the first Non_White_Block remain at the beginning.
  - White pixels originally after the last Non_White_Block remain at the end.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input row to identify all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels and their start/end positions.
2.  Identify any white pixels (value 0) that appear *before* the first non-white block begins. Store these as the "Prefix White Pixels".
3.  Identify any white pixels (value 0) that appear *after* the last non-white block ends. Store these as the "Suffix White Pixels".
4.  Identify any white pixels (value 0) that are located *between* the identified non-white blocks. Store these as the "Middle White Pixels".
5.  Collect all the non-white blocks in the order they appear in the input. Store this sequence as "Ordered Non-White Blocks".
6.  Construct the output row by concatenating the following components in order:
    *   The "Prefix White Pixels".
    *   The "Middle White Pixels".
    *   The "Ordered Non-White Blocks".
    *   The "Suffix White Pixels".
