Each row contains white pixels (0) and some non-white pixels (e.g., blue=1, azure=8, magenta=6). The core transformation seems to involve rearranging the positions of the pixels based on their color. Specifically, the white pixels (0) that are located *between* blocks of non-white pixels are moved. These intervening white pixels are relocated to the position immediately before the first block of non-white pixels. The non-white pixels themselves, as well as any white pixels preceding the first non-white block or succeeding the last non-white block, maintain their relative order. The overall length of the row remains unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

White_Pixels before the first Non_White_Block (Prefix_White).\n      2. The sequence of Non_White_Blocks and the White_Pixels between them (Core_Segment).\n      3.
