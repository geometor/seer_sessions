"""
Identifies a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-green color and a single green pixel (3) in a 1D input grid.
Moves the colored block horizontally so its rightmost edge is immediately adjacent to the left of the green pixel.
The green pixel's position remains fixed. The background is white (0). The grid is represented as a list containing a single list.
