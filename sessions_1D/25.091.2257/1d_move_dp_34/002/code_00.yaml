task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row in a 2D list structure [[...]]
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    identifier: First contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color, excluding background (0) and marker (3).
    properties:
      color: Any color except 0 and 3 (e.g., 6, 2, 8 in examples). Color is preserved.
      size: Variable length (e.g., 4, 3, 5 pixels). Length is preserved.
      role: mobile_object
  - type: single_pixel
    identifier: The pixel with color 3 (green). Assumed to be unique.
    properties:
      color: 3 # green
      role: stationary_boundary_marker
relationship:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the mobile_object is located at the index immediately preceding the index of the stationary_boundary_marker.
transformation:
  - type: relocation # Combination of erasing and redrawing
    target: mobile_object
    destination_rule: Position the block such that its last pixel is at `marker_index - 1`.
    properties:
      preserves_shape: True # (Length in 1D)
      preserves_color: True
      overwrites_original_position: True (with background color)
invariants:
  - element: stationary_boundary_marker
    property: position
  - element: grid
    property: size
