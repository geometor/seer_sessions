The length of this block varies across examples.\n    *   A single green pixel (3).\n4.  **Transformation**: The primary transformation is the horizontal movement (translation) of the colored block.\n5.  **Movement Rule**: The colored block moves to the right.\n6.  **Stopping Condition**: The movement stops when the rightmost pixel of the colored block is positioned immediately to the left of the single green pixel.\n7.  **Invariance**: The green pixel's position remains unchanged. The size and color of the moving block remain unchanged. The overall size of the grid remains unchanged. The pixels previously occupied by the block become white (0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Place the green pixel (3) in the output grid at the `marker_index`.\n6.  Calculate the target ending index for the block in the output grid: `target_end_index = marker_index - 1`.\n7.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output grid: `target_start_index = target_end_index - length + 1`.\n8.  Copy the identified block (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at `target_start_index` and ending at `target_end_index`."
