    role: boundary_marker
relationship:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: In the output grid, the 'moving_block' (specifically its rightmost pixel) is positioned immediately to the left of the 'stationary_marker'. (block_end_index = marker_index - 1)
transformation:
  - type: translation
    target: moving_block
    direction: horizontal (implicitly rightward based on examples)
    termination_condition: adjacency to boundary_marker (left side)
    properties:
      preserves_shape: True # Length remains constant
      preserves_color: True # Color remains constant
      overwrites_original_position: True # Original position becomes background color (0)
