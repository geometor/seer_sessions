            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation: moving a colored block rightward until it is adjacent to a stationary green marker pixel in a 1D grid. The reported error, \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous,\" likely originated from comparing NumPy array elements directly within conditional logic without extracting scalar values (e.g., using `.item()`), a common issue when mixing NumPy arrays with standard Python control flow expecting single booleans. The *final* version of the code provided in the previous step appears to have addressed this with `.item()`. Assuming this fix resolves the execution error, the fundamental logic of finding the marker, finding the block, calculating the new position, and constructing the output grid seems sound and consistent across all training examples. The strategy is to confirm the pattern holds across all examples by extracting specific metrics and then refine the documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) for maximum clarity and accuracy.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nI will extract the grid size, block details (color, start/end index, length), and marker index for each input and output pair."
