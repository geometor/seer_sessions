**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
2.  **Background**: The predominant color is white (0), acting as the background.
3.  **Objects**: Each input grid contains two distinct non-white elements:
    *   A contiguous block (or "object") of a single color (magenta 6, red 2, or azure 8). The length of this block varies across examples.
    *   A single green pixel (3).
4.  **Transformation**: The primary transformation is the horizontal movement (translation) of the colored block.
5.  **Movement Rule**: The colored block moves to the right.
6.  **Stopping Condition**: The movement stops when the rightmost pixel of the colored block is positioned immediately to the left of the single green pixel.
7.  **Invariance**: The green pixel's position remains unchanged. The size and color of the moving block remain unchanged. The overall size of the grid remains unchanged. The pixels previously occupied by the block become white (0).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the single green pixel (3) and note its index; this is the `marker_index`.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-green pixels. Note its color, its starting index (`start_index`), and its ending index (`end_index`). Calculate its length (`length = end_index - start_index + 1`).
4.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Place the green pixel (3) in the output grid at the `marker_index`.
6.  Calculate the target ending index for the block in the output grid: `target_end_index = marker_index - 1`.
7.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output grid: `target_start_index = target_end_index - length + 1`.
8.  Copy the identified block (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at `target_start_index` and ending at `target_end_index`.

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment**

The previous code execution failed on all training examples with the error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This typically indicates a NumPy array is being used in a boolean context expecting a single True/False value (e.g., `if array:`). However, a step-by-step simulation of the provided logic using the training examples suggests the core transformation rule (identify marker, identify block, move block adjacent to marker) is correct and the calculations seem sound.

The error might stem from:
1.  **Subtle NumPy Interaction:** An unexpected behavior in how NumPy arrays or types are handled, possibly in edge cases not explicitly covered by the examples, or in the interaction between Python logic (like `in`) and NumPy elements/arrays.
2.  **Input Handling:** While the second version of the code presented includes stricter input validation (`raise ValueError`), if the first version with more complex input handling was used, it might have failed depending on how the test harness passes the grid data.
3.  **Testing Environment:** An issue within the execution or testing framework itself.

**Strategy:**
1.  Re-confirm the understanding of the task based on all examples.
2.  Refine the description (YAML facts) and the natural language program to be precise.
3.  Assume the core logic derived previously is correct for the transformation.
4.  For the next phase (coder), use the cleaner, more robust version of the Python code provided, paying close attention to data types and potential NumPy ambiguities, perhaps adding assertions or debug prints if the error persists.

**Metrics Analysis**

The following metrics were extracted from the training examples:



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid_list):
    if not grid_list or not isinstance(grid_list, list) or not isinstance(grid_list[0], list):
         return {"error": "Invalid input format"}
    grid = np.array(grid_list[0])
    n = len(grid)
    marker_color = 3
    background_color = 0
    exclude_colors = {background_color, marker_color}

    # Find marker
    marker_indices = np.where(grid == marker_color)[0]
    marker_index = marker_indices[0].item() if len(marker_indices) > 0 else None # Use .item() for clean int

    # Find block
    start_index = -1
    block_color = -1
    block_info = None
    for i in range(n):
        pixel = grid[i].item() # Use .item() for clean int comparison
        if start_index != -1:
            if pixel == block_color:
                continue
            else:
                block_info = (start_index, i - 1, block_color)
                break
        elif pixel not in exclude_colors:
            start_index = i
            block_color = pixel
    if block_info is None and start_index != -1: # Check block reaching end
        block_info = (start_index, n - 1, block_color)

    analysis_result = {
        "grid_width": n,
        "marker_index": marker_index,
    }

    if block_info:
        block_start, block_end, color = block_info
        block_len = block_end - block_start + 1
        analysis_result.update({
            "block_start": block_start,
            "block_end": block_end,
            "block_color": color,
            "block_length": block_len
        })
    else:
         analysis_result["block_info"] = "Not found"

    return analysis_result


train_1_in = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]]
train_2_in = [[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
train_3_in = [[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]]

analysis = {
    "train_1": analyze_grid(train_1_in),
    "train_2": analyze_grid(train_2_in),
    "train_3": analyze_grid(train_3_in),
}

print(analysis)
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
{'train_1': {'grid_width': 15, 'marker_index': 13, 'block_start': 6, 'block_end': 9, 'block_color': 6, 'block_length': 4}, 'train_2': {'grid_width': 15, 'marker_index': 10, 'block_start': 1, 'block_end': 3, 'block_color': 2, 'block_length': 3}, 'train_3': {'grid_width': 15, 'marker_index': 14, 'block_start': 1, 'block_end': 5, 'block_color': 8, 'block_length': 5}}

```
**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Grid Size:** All examples use a 1x15 grid.
*   **Marker:** A single green (3) pixel exists in each input. Its position varies (index 13, 10, 14).
*   **Block:** A single contiguous block of a non-white (0), non-green (3) color exists in each input. The color varies (magenta 6, red 2, azure 8), the start/end positions vary, and the length varies (4, 3, 5).
*   **Consistency:** The structure (1D grid, single marker, single block, white background) is consistent across all training examples.

  - element: grid
    property: size (width remains the same)

  - Exactly one boundary_marker pixel (color 3) exists.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of a single color (not 0 or 3) exists.
  - The grid is 1-dimensional (represented as a list containing one list).
  - There is always enough space to place the block to the left of the marker.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (a list containing a single list of integers).
2.  Identify the background color (white, 0) and the marker color (green, 3).
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (0).
4.  Scan the input grid to find the index of the first occurrence of the marker pixel (3). Let this be `marker_index`.
5.  Place the marker pixel (3) into the output grid at `marker_index`.
6.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither the background color (0) nor the marker color (3).
7.  Record the starting index (`block_start`), ending index (`block_end`), color (`block_color`), and calculate the length (`block_length = block_end - block_start + 1`) of this block.
8.  Calculate the target ending index for the block in the output grid: `target_end_index = marker_index - 1`.
9.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output grid: `target_start_index = target_end_index - block_length + 1`.
10. Fill the portion of the output grid from `target_start_index` to `target_end_index` (inclusive) with the identified `block_color`.
11. Return the completed output grid (as a list containing a single list).
