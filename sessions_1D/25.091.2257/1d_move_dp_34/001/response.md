Identifies a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-green color and a single green pixel (3) in a 1D input grid.
Moves the colored block to the right until its rightmost edge is immediately adjacent to the left of the green pixel.
The green pixel's position remains fixed. The background is white (0).
