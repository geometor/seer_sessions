```python
"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (represented as a list containing a single list) by identifying a contiguous block of a single color (not background white 0 or marker green 3) and a single marker pixel (green 3).
The transformation moves the identified block horizontally so its rightmost edge is immediately adjacent to the left of the marker pixel's original position. The marker pixel remains in its original position. The area previously occupied by the block becomes background color (0).
