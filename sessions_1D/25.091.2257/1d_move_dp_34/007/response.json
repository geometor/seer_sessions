The marker pixel remains in its original position. The area previously occupied by the block becomes background color (0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional, Set\n\n# --- Helper Functions ---\n\ndef find_first_pixel_index(grid_1d: np.ndarray, color: int) -> Optional[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the first occurrence of a specific color in a 1D numpy array.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_1d: 1D numpy array representing the grid row.\n        color: The color to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        The index of the color if found, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n    indices = np.where(grid_1d == color)[0]\n    if len(indices) > 0:\n        return indices[0].item() # Use .item() to get a standard Python int\n    return None\n\ndef find_first_contiguous_block(grid_1d: np.ndarray, exclude_colors: Set[int]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of a single color, excluding specified colors.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_1d: 1D numpy array representing the grid row.\n        exclude_colors: A set of colors to ignore when searching for the block.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (start_index, end_index, color, length) if a block is found, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_index = -1\n    block_color = -1\n    n = len(grid_1d)\n    for i in range(n):\n        pixel = grid_1d[i].item() # Use .item() for robust comparison\n\n        # If we are currently tracking a block\n        if start_index != -1:\n            if pixel == block_color:\n                # Continue the block\n                continue\n            else:\n                # Block ended at the previous pixel\n                end_index = i -
