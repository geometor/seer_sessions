task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as [[...]] list of lists
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block # The first contiguous block found scanning left-to-right
    properties:
      color: any color except background (0) or marker (3) # e.g., 6, 2, 8
      size: variable length (e.g., 4, 3, 5 pixels)
      role: mobile_object
  - type: single_pixel
    properties:
      color: 3 # green
      role: fixed_boundary_marker # The first instance found scanning left-to-right
relationship_initial:
  - type: spatial
    description: The mobile_object and boundary_marker are separated by zero or more background pixels in the input.
relationship_final:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: In the output, the rightmost pixel of the mobile_object is immediately to the left (at index marker_index - 1) of the boundary_marker.
transformation:
  - type: horizontal_translation
    target: mobile_object
    properties:
      preserves_shape: True # Length remains the same
      preserves_color: True # Color remains the same
      destination: Positioned such that its rightmost pixel is at index `marker_index - 1`.
      overwrites_original_position: True (replaced with background color)
invariants:
  - element: boundary_marker
    property: position (index remains the same)
  - element: grid
    property: size (width remains the same)
  - element: background_color
    property: value (remains 0)
assumptions:
  - Exactly one boundary_marker pixel (color 3) exists.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of a single color (not 0 or 3) exists.
  - The grid is 1-dimensional (represented as a list containing one list).
  - There is always enough space to place the block to the left of the marker.
