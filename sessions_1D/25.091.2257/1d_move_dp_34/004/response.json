            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code execution failed on all training examples with the error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This typically indicates a NumPy array is being used in a boolean context expecting a single True/False value (e.g., `if array:`). However, a step-by-step simulation of the provided logic using the training examples suggests the core transformation rule (identify marker, identify block, move block adjacent to marker) is correct and the calculations seem sound.\n\nThe error might stem from:\n1.  **Subtle NumPy Interaction:** An unexpected behavior in how NumPy arrays or types are handled, possibly in edge cases not explicitly covered by the examples, or in the interaction between Python logic (like `in`) and NumPy elements/arrays.\n2.  **Input Handling:** While the second version of the code presented includes stricter input validation (`raise ValueError`), if the first version with more complex input handling was used, it might have failed depending on how the test harness passes the grid data.\n3.  **Testing Environment:** An issue within the execution or testing framework itself.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-confirm the understanding of the task based on all examples.\n2.  Refine the description (YAML facts) and the natural language program to be precise.\n3.  Assume the core logic derived previously is correct for the transformation.\n4.  For the next phase (coder), use the cleaner, more robust version of the Python code provided, paying close attention to data types and potential NumPy ambiguities, perhaps adding assertions or debug prints if the error persists.\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\nThe following metrics were extracted from the training examples:\n\n"
