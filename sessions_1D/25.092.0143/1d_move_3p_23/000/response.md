Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of the same length (11 pixels).
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use white (0) as the background color. There is one other color present in each example: green (3) or yellow (4).
3.  **Object Identification:** In each input grid, there is a single contiguous horizontal segment (an "object") composed of a non-white color (green or yellow). This segment is surrounded by white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the non-white segment.
5.  **Shift Details:** Comparing input and output:
    *   In `train_1`, the green segment `3 3 3 3 3` moves from starting index 1 to starting index 4.
    *   In `train_2`, the green segment `3 3 3 3 3` moves from starting index 0 to starting index 3.
    *   In `train_3`, the yellow segment `4 4 4 4 4` moves from starting index 1 to starting index 4.
6.  **Consistency:** In all examples, the non-white segment shifts exactly 3 positions to the right. The segment's color and length remain unchanged. The pixels outside the shifted segment in the output are all white. The overall grid dimensions remain constant.

**Facts:**


```yaml

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1  # Effectively 1D rows
  size_input: [1, 11] # rows, columns
  size_output: [1, 11]

  - type: segment
    attributes:
      color: non-white (3 or 4 in examples)
      contiguity: horizontal
      count_per_grid: 1
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: segment_object (properties: color, start_index, length)
  - name: shift_segment
    inputs: segment_object
    parameters:
      direction: right
      distance: 3
    outputs: new_start_index
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    inputs: original_grid_size, background_color, segment_object, new_start_index
    outputs: output_grid
relationships:
  - The output grid contains the same segment (color, length) as the input grid.
  - The segment's starting position in the output grid is 3 positions to the right of its starting position in the input grid.
  - All other positions in the output grid are filled with the background color (white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, starting index, and length.
2.  Determine the dimensions of the input row.
3.  Create a new output row of the same dimensions, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the segment in the output row by adding 3 to the segment's starting index from the input row.
5.  Place the identified segment (using its original color and length) into the output row, starting at the calculated target starting index.
