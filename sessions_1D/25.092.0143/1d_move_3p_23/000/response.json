            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of the same length (11 pixels).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use white (0) as the background color. There is one other color present in each example: green (3) or yellow (4).\n3.  **Object Identification:** In each input grid, there is a single contiguous horizontal segment (an \"object\") composed of a non-white color (green or yellow). This segment is surrounded by white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the non-white segment.\n5.  **Shift Details:** Comparing input and output:\n    *   In `train_1`, the green segment `3 3 3 3 3` moves from starting index 1 to starting index 4.\n    *   In `train_2`, the green segment `3 3 3 3 3` moves from starting index 0 to starting index 3.\n    *   In `train_3`, the yellow segment `4 4 4 4 4` moves from starting index 1 to starting index 4.\n6.  **Consistency:** In all examples, the non-white segment shifts exactly 3 positions to the right. The segment's color and length remain unchanged. The pixels outside the shifted segment in the output are all white. The overall grid dimensions remain constant.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
