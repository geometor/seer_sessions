task_type: object_manipulation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1  # Effectively 1D rows
  size_input: [1, 11] # rows, columns
  size_output: [1, 11]
  constant_size: true
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: segment
    attributes:
      color: non-white (3 or 4 in examples)
      contiguity: horizontal
      count_per_grid: 1
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: segment_object (properties: color, start_index, length)
  - name: shift_segment
    inputs: segment_object
    parameters:
      direction: right
      distance: 3
    outputs: new_start_index
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    inputs: original_grid_size, background_color, segment_object, new_start_index
    outputs: output_grid
relationships:
  - The output grid contains the same segment (color, length) as the input grid.
  - The segment's starting position in the output grid is 3 positions to the right of its starting position in the input grid.
  - All other positions in the output grid are filled with the background color (white).
