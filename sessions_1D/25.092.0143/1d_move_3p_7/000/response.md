*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a 1-dimensional grid (a single row). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels. The output grid shows this same colored block shifted to the right. The amount of the shift appears to be equal to the length of the colored block itself. The rest of the grid remains white.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D
    input_grid:
      description: A single row grid.
      elements:
        - type: background
          color: white (0)
        - type: object
          description: A single contiguous block of a non-white color.
          properties:
            - color: variable (e.g., green(3), red(2))
            - shape: horizontal line segment
            - length: variable (e.g., 3)
            - start_index: variable
    output_grid:
      description: A single row grid of the same dimensions as the input.
      elements:
        - type: background
          color: white (0)
        - type: object
          description: The same object from the input grid.
          properties:
            - color: same as input object
            - shape: horizontal line segment
            - length: same as input object
            - start_index: shifted from input start_index
    transformation:
      action: shift_object
      direction: right
      amount:
        relationship: equal to the length of the non-white object
      result: The non-white object is moved right by its own length, replacing white pixels. Original positions become white.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Determine its color, its length (L), and its starting column index (S_in).
    2.  Calculate the starting column index for the block in the output row (S_out) by adding the length (L) to the input starting index (S_in): S_out = S_in + L.
    3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
    4.  Place the identified block (using its original color and length L) into the output row starting at the calculated index S_out.
