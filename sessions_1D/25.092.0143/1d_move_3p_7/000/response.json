Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels. The output grid shows this same colored block shifted to the right. The amount of the shift appears to be equal to the length of the colored block itself. The rest of the grid remains white.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
