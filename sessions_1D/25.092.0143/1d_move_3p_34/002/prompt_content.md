"""
Identifies a contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color in a 1x15 input row.
Shifts this block 3 positions to the right.
Creates a new 1x15 output row, initially filled with white (0).
Places the shifted block into the output row, preserving its color and length.
The original position of the block in the output row remains white.
