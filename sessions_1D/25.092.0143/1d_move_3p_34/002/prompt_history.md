Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1x15 grid (a single row of 15 pixels).
2.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) as the background color. Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color: magenta (6), red (2), or azure (8).
3.  **Objects:** The main object in each input grid is the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation consistently involves moving the non-white block horizontally. By comparing the input and output grids, the block shifts exactly 3 positions to the right. The pixels that were occupied by the block in the input are replaced with the white background color in the output. The shape and color of the block itself remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensions: [1, 15] # All examples are 1 row, 15 columns
  background_color: 0 # White
  num_objects_per_input: 1
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    properties:
      color: non-zero (changes per example: 6, 2, 8)
      shape: horizontal line segment (variable length: 4, 3, 5)
      location: variable starting position in the row
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  properties:
    direction: right
    distance: 3 pixels
  effects:
    - The non-white block moves 3 columns to the right.
    - The original position of the block is filled with the background color (0).
    - The shape and color of the block are preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Determine the starting column index of this block.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length (15 pixels), initially filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  Copy the identified non-white block into the output row, starting at the column index equal to its original starting index plus 3.
