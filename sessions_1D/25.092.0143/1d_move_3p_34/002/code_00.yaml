task_context:
  input_format: List[List[int]] # 2D array representation
  output_format: List[List[int]] # 2D array representation
  grid_dimensions: [1, 15] # Height=1, Width=15 for all examples
  background_color: 0 # White
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    location: Located within the single row of the grid.
    properties:
      color: Single non-zero color (6, 2, 8 in examples)
      shape: Horizontal line segment
      length: Variable (4, 3, 5 pixels in examples)
      start_column: Variable (6, 1, 1 in examples)
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  target: The single non-white horizontal block.
  properties:
    direction: right
    distance: 3 columns
  effects:
    - The block's starting column index increases by 3.
    - The block retains its original color and length.
    - The output grid is initialized with the background color (0).
    - The shifted block is placed onto the output grid.
    - Pixels outside the shifted block remain the background color.
