Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color: magenta (6), red (2), or azure (8).\n3.  **Objects:** The main object in each input grid is the contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation consistently involves moving the non-white block horizontally. By comparing the input and output grids, the block shifts exactly 3 positions to the right. The pixels that were occupied by the block in the input are replaced with the white background color in the output. The shape and color of the block itself remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
