task_context:
  grid_dimensions: [1, 15] # All examples are 1 row, 15 columns
  background_color: 0 # White
  num_objects_per_input: 1
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    properties:
      color: non-zero (changes per example: 6, 2, 8)
      shape: horizontal line segment (variable length: 4, 3, 5)
      location: variable starting position in the row
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  properties:
    direction: right
    distance: 3 pixels
  effects:
    - The non-white block moves 3 columns to the right.
    - The original position of the block is filled with the background color (0).
    - The shape and color of the block are preserved.
