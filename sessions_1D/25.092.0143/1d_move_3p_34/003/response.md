"""
Identifies a contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color in a 1x15 input grid.
Shifts this block 3 positions to the right.
The output grid is 1x15, initialized with white (0).
The shifted block is placed into the output grid, preserving its color and length.
The pixels outside the shifted block remain white.
