Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1x15 grid (a single row of 15 pixels).
2.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) as the background color. Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color: magenta (6), red (2), or azure (8).
3.  **Objects:** The main object in each input grid is the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation consistently involves moving the non-white block horizontally. By comparing the input and output grids, the block shifts exactly 3 positions to the right. The pixels that were occupied by the block in the input are replaced with the white background color in the output. The shape and color of the block itself remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensions: [1, 15] # All examples are 1 row, 15 columns
  background_color: 0 # White
  num_objects_per_input: 1
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    properties:
      color: non-zero (changes per example: 6, 2, 8)
      shape: horizontal line segment (variable length: 4, 3, 5)
      location: variable starting position in the row
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  properties:
    direction: right
    distance: 3 pixels
  effects:
    - The non-white block moves 3 columns to the right.
    - The original position of the block is filled with the background color (0).
    - The shape and color of the block are preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Determine the starting column index of this block.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length (15 pixels), initially filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  Copy the identified non-white block into the output row, starting at the column index equal to its original starting index plus 3.

Train Set Results:

## Example 3:

**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a horizontal block of non-white pixels 3 positions to the right within a 1x15 grid. However, the python code failed during execution with a `ValueError`. This error, "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous," typically occurs in NumPy when a boolean operation is attempted on an array that should resolve to a single True/False value, but instead contains multiple boolean values (e.g., comparing an array element-wise results in an array of True/False). This strongly suggests an issue with how the input grid data (likely passed as a 2D list-of-lists, e.g., `[[...]]`) was converted to or handled by NumPy, particularly when passed between functions expecting different array dimensions (1D vs 2D).

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input format passed to the `transform` function is indeed a list of lists (e.g., `[[...]]`).
2.  Adjust the `transform` function to correctly handle this 2D input, extracting the single row for processing.
3.  Ensure the `find_horizontal_block` function receives a 1D array as intended.
4.  Ensure the final output matches the required format (list of lists).

**Metrics:**

Let's verify the structure and find the block details for each example.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid (a 1x15 2D list/array).
2.  Identify the single row within the input grid.
3.  Scan the row to find the contiguous horizontal block of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Determine its color, starting column index, and length.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length (15 pixels), initialized entirely with the white background color (0).
5.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
6.  Copy the identified block (using its original color and length) into the new output row at the calculated new starting position. Ensure the block placement does not exceed the row bounds (though not observed in examples, it's good practice).
7.  Format the output row as a 1x15 2D list/array (i.e., a list containing the single output row list) and return it.
