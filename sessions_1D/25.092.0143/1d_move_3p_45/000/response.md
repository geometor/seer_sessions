Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be 1-dimensional arrays (or single rows) of length 16.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and magenta (6). White seems to function as a background color.
3.  **Objects:** In each input, there's a single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    *   Example 1: A block of three blue pixels (`1 1 1`).
    *   Example 2: A block of three blue pixels (`1 1 1`).
    *   Example 3: A block of ten magenta pixels (`6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6`).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a spatial shift of the non-white block.
    *   Example 1: The blue block moves from indices 7-9 to 10-12 (a shift of +3 positions).
    *   Example 2: The blue block moves from indices 9-11 to 12-14 (a shift of +3 positions).
    *   Example 3: The magenta block moves from indices 1-10 to 4-13 (a shift of +3 positions).
5.  **Consistency:** The shift amount (+3 positions to the right) is consistent across all examples, regardless of the object's color, length, or initial position. The background remains white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a contiguous block of non-background pixels 3 positions to the right within a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  size: 16
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: The main object of interest, composed of non-background pixels.
    properties:
      color: Any non-zero color (variable, e.g., 1-blue, 6-magenta)
      length: Variable (e.g., 3, 10)
      start_index: Variable
      end_index: Variable
    relationship_to_background: Embedded within a background of color 0.
actions:
  - name: find_object
    description: Locate the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-background pixels.
  - name: shift_object
    description: Move the identified block horizontally.
    parameters:
      direction: right
      distance: 3 positions
constraints:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
  - There is only one contiguous block of non-background pixels in the input.
  - The object is moved entirely; its shape and color remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input 1D grid to find the start and end indices of the single contiguous block of non-background colored pixels.
3.  Create a new 1D grid of the same size as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the new start index for the block by adding 3 to its original start index.
5.  Calculate the new end index for the block by adding 3 to its original end index.
6.  Copy the sequence of pixels corresponding to the original block (from the input grid) into the new grid, starting at the calculated new start index and ending at the calculated new end index.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.
