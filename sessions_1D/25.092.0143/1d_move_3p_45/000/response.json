White seems to function as a background color.\n3.  **Objects:** In each input, there's a single contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n    *   Example 1: A block of three blue pixels (`1 1 1`).\n    *   Example 2: A block of three blue pixels (`1 1 1`).\n    *   Example 3: A block of ten magenta pixels (`6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6`).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a spatial shift of the non-white block.\n    *   Example 1: The blue block moves from indices 7-9 to 10-12 (a shift of +3 positions).\n    *   Example 2: The blue block moves from indices 9-11 to 12-14 (a shift of +3 positions).\n    *   Example 3: The magenta block moves from indices 1-10 to 4-13 (a shift of +3 positions).\n5.  **Consistency:** The shift amount (+3 positions to the right) is consistent across all examples, regardless of the object's color, length, or initial position. The background remains white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
