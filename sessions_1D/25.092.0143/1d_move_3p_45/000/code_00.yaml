task_description: Move a contiguous block of non-background pixels 3 positions to the right within a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  size: 16
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: The main object of interest, composed of non-background pixels.
    properties:
      color: Any non-zero color (variable, e.g., 1-blue, 6-magenta)
      length: Variable (e.g., 3, 10)
      start_index: Variable
      end_index: Variable
    relationship_to_background: Embedded within a background of color 0.
actions:
  - name: find_object
    description: Locate the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-background pixels.
  - name: shift_object
    description: Move the identified block horizontally.
    parameters:
      direction: right
      distance: 3 positions
constraints:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
  - There is only one contiguous block of non-background pixels in the input.
  - The object is moved entirely; its shape and color remain unchanged.
