White serves as the background color.\n3.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains exactly one \"object,\" defined as a contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the position of the non-white object within the row. The object's color and length remain unchanged. The background (white pixels) fills the remaining space.\n5.  **Movement Pattern:** In all provided examples, the non-white object is shifted exactly 3 positions to the right. The pixels where the object was originally located become white in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
