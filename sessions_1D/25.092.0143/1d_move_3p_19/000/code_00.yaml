task_description: Shift a horizontal block of color three steps to the right within a single row.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      count: 1 per grid
      color: variable (blue, gray, yellow in examples)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      size: variable length
      consistency: color and size remain unchanged between input and output
actions:
  - name: shift_right
    target: colored_block
    parameters:
      distance: 3 positions
    effect: Changes the starting column index of the colored_block.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_relation
    description: The colored_block is embedded within a background of white pixels.
transformation_rule:
  - step: Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels (the object) in the input row. Note its color, length, and starting position.
  - step: Calculate the new starting position by adding 3 to the original starting position.
  - step: Create an output row of the same length as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white).
  - step: Place the identified object (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new position.
