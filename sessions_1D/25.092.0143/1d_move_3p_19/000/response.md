**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays).
2.  **Colors:** The grids contain white (0) pixels and a single block of non-white pixels (blue, gray, or yellow in the examples). White serves as the background color.
3.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains exactly one "object," defined as a contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the position of the non-white object within the row. The object's color and length remain unchanged. The background (white pixels) fills the remaining space.
5.  **Movement Pattern:** In all provided examples, the non-white object is shifted exactly 3 positions to the right. The pixels where the object was originally located become white in the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a horizontal block of color three steps to the right within a single row.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      count: 1 per grid
      color: variable (blue, gray, yellow in examples)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      size: variable length
      consistency: color and size remain unchanged between input and output
actions:
  - name: shift_right
    target: colored_block
    parameters:
      distance: 3 positions
    effect: Changes the starting column index of the colored_block.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_relation
    description: The colored_block is embedded within a background of white pixels.
transformation_rule:
  - step: Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels (the object) in the input row. Note its color, length, and starting position.
  - step: Calculate the new starting position by adding 3 to the original starting position.
  - step: Create an output row of the same length as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white).
  - step: Place the identified object (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new position.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the input row.
2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels. Record its color, length, and starting column index.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).
4.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the output row by adding 3 to its starting column index in the input row.
5.  Copy the block of non-white pixels (with its recorded color and length) into the output row, starting at the calculated target column index.
6.  The resulting row is the final output.
