Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

The input grids are all single rows (1x21). Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and a single horizontal contiguous segment (object) of a non-white color. The color and length of this segment vary across examples (yellow, azure, blue; lengths 3, 5, 6). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The transformation involves moving the colored segment exactly three positions to the right within the row. The background pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_size:
    static: true
    rows: 1
    columns: 21
  colors_present:
    - white (0) # Background
    - yellow (4) # Object color in example 1
    - azure (8) # Object color in example 2
    - blue (1) # Object color in example 3
  object_count: 1 per grid

object_description:
  - id: main_object
    shape: horizontal line segment
    color: varies (non-white)
    size: varies (number of pixels in the segment)
    position: varies (starting column index)
    relationship_to_background: surrounded by white pixels

transformation:
  action: horizontal translation (shift)
  target: main_object
  direction: right
  magnitude: 3 pixels
  background_pixels: remain unchanged

inferred_rules:
  - The transformation applies uniformly to the single non-white object found in the input.
  - The amount of shift (3 pixels to the right) is constant across all examples.
  - The dimensions of the grid remain constant.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, length, and starting column index.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length (21 pixels), initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Determine the new starting column index for the segment by adding 3 to its original starting column index.
4.  Place the identified segment (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new column index.
