task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_size:
    static: true
    rows: 1
    columns: 21
  colors_present:
    - white (0) # Background
    - yellow (4) # Object color in example 1
    - azure (8) # Object color in example 2
    - blue (1) # Object color in example 3
  object_count: 1 per grid

object_description:
  - id: main_object
    shape: horizontal line segment
    color: varies (non-white)
    size: varies (number of pixels in the segment)
    position: varies (starting column index)
    relationship_to_background: surrounded by white pixels

transformation:
  action: horizontal translation (shift)
  target: main_object
  direction: right
  magnitude: 3 pixels
  background_pixels: remain unchanged

inferred_rules:
  - The transformation applies uniformly to the single non-white object found in the input.
  - The amount of shift (3 pixels to the right) is constant across all examples.
  - The dimensions of the grid remain constant.
