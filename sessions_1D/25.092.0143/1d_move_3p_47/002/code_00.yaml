task_type: grid_transformation
input_format: 2D array (list of lists) of integers (colors)
output_format: 2D array (list of lists) of integers (colors)
input_shape: 1xN (specifically 1x21 in examples)
output_shape: Same as input shape (1xN)
element_colors:
  - white (0) - background/padding
  - one non-white color per example (orange (7), green (3), yellow (4)) - forms a contiguous block in input (sometimes with surrounding white)
structure:
  - Input is a single-row grid.
  - The sequence of elements within the row is the primary focus.
transformation:
  - Positional rearrangement of elements within the grid's sequence.
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
action:
  type: circular_shift_1d
  direction: right
  amount: 3 positions
  target: The sequence of all elements in the grid, treated as a 1D array.
process:
  - Flatten the 2D input grid into a 1D sequence.
  - Perform a circular right shift of 3 positions on the 1D sequence.
  - Reshape the shifted 1D sequence back to the original 2D grid dimensions.
relationships:
  - The output grid contains the same elements as the input grid, but their positions are shifted cyclically.
