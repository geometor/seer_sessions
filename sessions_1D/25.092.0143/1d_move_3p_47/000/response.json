Each sequence contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color (orange, green, or yellow in the examples) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output. The transformation involves rearranging the positions of the pixels within the sequence. Specifically, the entire sequence appears to be shifted cyclically to the right by a fixed amount. Comparing input and output sequences reveals that the last three elements of the input sequence move to the beginning of the output sequence, and the rest of the elements shift three positions to the right. This consistent shift amount (3 positions) across all examples suggests a circular right rotation.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
