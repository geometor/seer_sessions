Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples consist of a single row (1D grid). The length of the row is consistent within each example pair (input and output have the same dimensions) and across the examples shown (1x19).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain white pixels (0) and one other color per example (magenta (6) or yellow (4)).
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form a single, contiguous horizontal block in the input grids.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output, the entire sequence of pixels appears to be shifted horizontally.
5.  **Shift Direction and Amount:** In all examples, the pattern shifts to the right. By comparing the starting position of the colored block or the position of specific white pixels, the shift amount is consistently 3 positions.
6.  **Boundary Handling:** Pixels shifted off the right edge seem to reappear on the left edge, indicating a circular or wrap-around shift.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Circularly shift the entire input row 3 positions to the right."

  dimensionality: 1 # All examples are 1-row grids
  size_conservation: True # Input and output grids have the same dimensions

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Perform a circular shift of all pixels in the row 3 positions to the right.
3.  The resulting shifted row is the output grid.
