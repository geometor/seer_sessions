task_description: "Circularly shift the entire input row 3 positions to the right."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # All examples are 1-row grids
  size_conservation: True # Input and output grids have the same dimensions
objects:
  - type: pixel_sequence
    description: "The entire row of pixels."
transformation:
  type: shift
  direction: right
  amount: 3
  boundary_condition: circular # Pixels wrap around from right to left

    input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
    notes: "The sequence shifted right by 3; the last three elements [0, 0, 0] moved to the beginning."
