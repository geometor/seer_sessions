The length of the row is consistent within each example pair (input and output have the same dimensions) and across the examples shown (1x19).\n2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain white pixels (0) and one other color per example (magenta (6) or yellow (4)).\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form a single, contiguous horizontal block in the input grids.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output, the entire sequence of pixels appears to be shifted horizontally.\n5.  **Shift Direction and Amount:** In all examples, the pattern shifts to the right. By comparing the starting position of the colored block or the position of specific white pixels, the shift amount is consistently 3 positions.\n6.  **Boundary Handling:** Pixels shifted off the right edge seem to reappear on the left edge, indicating a circular or wrap-around shift.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
