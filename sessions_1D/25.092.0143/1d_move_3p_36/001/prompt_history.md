Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are single rows (1D grids) of pixels. The length of the row remains constant between input and output (15 pixels in all examples).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other color per example (red (2), blue (1), or gray (5)). White appears to function as a background color.
3.  **Objects:** Each input row contains exactly one contiguous block (an object) of a non-white color. This block is surrounded by white pixels on either side, or just on one side if the block touches an edge.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a positional shift of the non-white block.
    *   In example 1, the red block moves from the left edge to start at index 3.
    *   In example 2, the blue block moves from starting index 6 to starting index 9.
    *   In example 3, the gray block moves from starting index 1 to starting index 4.
5.  **Shift Amount:** In all three examples, the starting position of the non-white block increases by 3. This suggests a consistent shift of 3 positions to the right.
6.  **Background Handling:** The white pixels are redistributed to accommodate the shifted block, filling the space before and after it to maintain the total row length. The number of white pixels remains constant overall, but their positions change.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
input_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: background
      color: white
      count: variable
    - type: object
      count: 1
      shape: contiguous_block (horizontal line segment)
      color: non-white (variable, consistent within an example)
      properties:
        - length: variable
        - position: variable
output_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: background
      color: white
      count: same total as input, but redistributed
    - type: object
      count: 1
      shape: same as input object
      color: same as input object
      properties:
        - length: same as input object
        - position: shifted relative to input
relationships:
  - input_object and output_object are identical in color and length.
actions:
  - identify: locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row.
  - translate: shift the identified block 3 positions to the right.
  - reconstruct: build the output row by placing the shifted block at its new position and filling the remaining positions (before and after the block) with white pixels to match the original input row length.
constants:
  - shift_amount: 3 positions
  - shift_direction: right
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, length, and starting position.
2.  Calculate the new starting position of the block by adding 3 to its original starting position.
3.  Construct the output row, which has the same total length as the input row:
    a.  Fill the positions from the beginning of the row up to (but not including) the new starting position with white pixels (color 0).
    b.  Place the identified non-white block (with its original color and length) starting at the new calculated position.
    c.  Fill any remaining positions from the end of the block to the end of the row with white pixels (color 0).
