task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
input_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: background
      color: white
      count: variable
    - type: object
      count: 1
      shape: contiguous_block (horizontal line segment)
      color: non-white (variable, consistent within an example)
      properties:
        - length: variable
        - position: variable
output_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: background
      color: white
      count: same total as input, but redistributed
    - type: object
      count: 1
      shape: same as input object
      color: same as input object
      properties:
        - length: same as input object
        - position: shifted relative to input
relationships:
  - input_object and output_object are identical in color and length.
actions:
  - identify: locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row.
  - translate: shift the identified block 3 positions to the right.
  - reconstruct: build the output row by placing the shifted block at its new position and filling the remaining positions (before and after the block) with white pixels to match the original input row length.
constants:
  - shift_amount: 3 positions
  - shift_direction: right
