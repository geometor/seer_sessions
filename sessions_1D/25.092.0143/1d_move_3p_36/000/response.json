            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are single rows (1D grids) of pixels. The length of the row remains constant between input and output (15 pixels in all examples).\n2.  **Pixel Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other color per example (red (2), blue (1), or gray (5)). White appears to function as a background color.\n3.  **Objects:** Each input row contains exactly one contiguous block (an object) of a non-white color. This block is surrounded by white pixels on either side, or just on one side if the block touches an edge.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a positional shift of the non-white block.\n    *   In example 1, the red block moves from the left edge to start at index 3.\n    *   In example 2, the blue block moves from starting index 6 to starting index 9.\n    *   In example 3, the gray block moves from starting index 1 to starting index 4.\n5.  **Shift Amount:** In all three examples, the starting position of the non-white block increases by 3. This suggests a consistent shift of 3 positions to the right.\n6.  **Background Handling:** The white pixels are redistributed to accommodate the shifted block, filling the space before and after it to maintain the total row length. The number of white pixels remains constant overall, but their positions change.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
