Each input grid contains a contiguous horizontal segment of a single non-white color, flanked by white pixels on both sides or extending to one edge. The output grid shows the same colored segment, but shifted horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. The background color is consistently white (0). The size and color of the segment remain unchanged. The overall dimensions of the grid also remain unchanged. The shift appears consistent across all examples.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
