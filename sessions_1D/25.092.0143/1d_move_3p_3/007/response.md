"""
Identifies the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid's single row.
Shifts this block 3 positions to the right, preserving its color and length. 
Pixels shifted beyond the right boundary are clipped. The rest of the row remains white (0).
The output grid has the same dimensions (1xN) as the input grid.
