*   **Perception**: The input and output are both single rows of pixels. Each input contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color surrounded by white pixels. The output shows the same colored block shifted three positions to the right, with the rest of the row remaining white. The color and length of the block are preserved.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively a 1D array or list
    components:
      - object: colored_block
        count: 1
        properties:
          - color: non-white (red, orange, magenta in examples)
          - shape: contiguous horizontal segment
          - size: variable length (11, 10, 6 in examples)
          - location: variable start index within the row
      - object: background
        count: 1
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - location: fills the rest of the row
    actions:
      - name: shift_right
        target: colored_block
        parameters:
          - distance: 3 positions
    relationships:
      - type: embedding
        object1: colored_block
        object2: background
        details: The colored block is located within the background.
    constraints:
      - The color of the block remains unchanged.
      - The length of the block remains unchanged.
      - The length of the row remains unchanged.
      - There is only one colored block per input.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, its starting index, and its length.
    2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
    3.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
    4.  Place the identified colored block (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new index.

## General Assessment

The core transformation logic identified previously—finding a single contiguous block of non-white color and shifting it 3 positions to the right—appears correct based on the visual examples. The Python code implementing this logic failed with a NumPy-related error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") or due to incorrect assumptions about the input structure (`list[int]` instead of `list[list[int]]`).

The error indicates that the code attempted a boolean evaluation on a NumPy array that contained multiple elements (e.g., `if my_array:` or `if my_array == value:`), which is ambiguous. This likely occurred either due to incorrect handling of the input grid format (treating a 1xN list-of-lists as a flat list, or vice-versa, especially when interacting with NumPy functions) or an unexpected comparison within the `find_colored_block` logic when processing the input row data.

The strategy for resolution is to:
1.  Ensure the code correctly handles the standard ARC input format, which is a list of lists (e.g., `[[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]` for a single row).
2.  Extract the single row (the inner list) from the input grid.
3.  Implement the block-finding and shifting logic robustly, preferably using standard list operations to avoid potential NumPy ambiguities unless necessary. Ensure comparisons are made element-wise (pixel vs. value) rather than on arrays/lists directly in boolean contexts.
4.  Re-verify the `find_colored_block` logic to ensure it correctly identifies the start index, end index (exclusive), and color of the block within the extracted row.
5.  Construct the output row by placing the identified block at the shifted position, handling boundary conditions (clipping the block if it shifts partially off the right edge).
6.  Return the result in the standard ARC format (a list containing the single output row).

## Metrics

Based on the provided examples:

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Block Color | Block Length | Block Start Index (Input) | Block Start Index (Output) | Shift |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :---------- | :----------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------- | :---- |
| Train 1 | 1x30        | 1x30         | 2 (red)     | 11           | 1                         | 4                          | +3    |
| Train 2 | 1x30        | 1x30         | 7 (orange)  | 10           | 14                        | 17                         | +3    |
| Train 3 | 1x30        | 1x30         | 6 (magenta) | 6            | 19                        | 22                         | +3    |

**Observations:**
*   All inputs and outputs are 1x30 grids (single row).
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color.
*   The background color is white (0).
*   The transformation consistently shifts the colored block 3 positions to the right.
*   The color and length of the block are preserved in the output.
*   Pixels shifted off the right edge are lost (clipping).
*   The grid dimensions remain constant.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a list containing a single list representing one row of pixels (`[[p1, p2, ..., pN]]`).
2.  Extract the row of pixels (the inner list) from the input grid. Let its length be `N`.
3.  Create a new list, `output_row`, of length `N`, initialized entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  Iterate through the extracted input row to find the contiguous block of non-white pixels. Identify its color (`C`), its starting index (`start_idx`), and its ending index (`end_idx`, exclusive). If no non-white block is found, proceed to step 7.
5.  Calculate the length of the block: `length = end_idx - start_idx`.
6.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the `output_row`: `new_start_idx = start_idx + 3`.
7.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `length - 1`:
    a.  Calculate the target index in the `output_row`: `target_idx = new_start_idx + i`.
    b.  If `target_idx` is within the valid range of indices for `output_row` (i.e., `0 <= target_idx < N`), set the pixel at `output_row[target_idx]` to the block's color `C`.
8.  Wrap the `output_row` list within another list to create the final output grid format: `[[output_row]]`.
9.  Return the final output grid.
