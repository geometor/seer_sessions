            "text": "**Assessment:**\n\nThe code failed on all training examples with the error `Input grid must be a non-empty list of lists.` This indicates a discrepancy between the input format expected by the `transform` function (a list containing at least one list, e.g., `[[0, 2, 2, ...]]`) and the format likely provided during the test execution. The task examples present the data as single rows, which might be interpreted or passed as a flat list (`[0, 2, 2, ...]`) rather than a list containing one row (`[[0, 2, 2, ...]]`).\n\nThe core logic identified previously\u2014finding a contiguous block of non-white color and shifting it 3 positions to the right\u2014appears consistent across all examples. The failure is likely due to input validation or handling, not the transformation logic itself.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Acknowledge the input format issue. The natural language program should describe the transformation on the conceptual single row of data.\n2.  The coder phase will need to adjust the `transform` function to correctly handle the input format provided by the ARC testing environment for this specific task, which seems to represent 1D data. It might need to accept `list[int]` or adapt the validation check.\n3.  Verify the core transformation logic (find block, shift right by 3) remains consistent.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on manual analysis of the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 30)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 30)\n    *   Block: Color=Red(2), Length=11, Start Index=1\n    *   Shift: 1 -> 4 (Right by 3)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 30)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 30)\n    *   Block: Color=Orange(7), Length=10, Start Index=14\n    *   Shift: 14 -> 17 (Right by 3)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 30)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]` (Length 30)\n    *   Block: Color=Magenta(6), Length=6, Start Index=19\n    *   Shift: 19 -> 22 (Right by 3)\n\n**Consistency Check:**\n*   All examples use a 1x30 grid (represented as a single list/row).\n*   Each input has exactly one contiguous block of a non-white color.\n*   The background is always white (0).\n*   The transformation consistently shifts the colored block exactly 3 positions to the right.\n*   The color and length of the block are preserved.\n*   Pixels shifted off the right edge are lost, and the vacated positions on the left become white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
