task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row or list
input_format_note: Examples presented as single space-separated lines, likely corresponding to a single list of integers. Code needs to handle this format.
components:
  - object: colored_block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white (variable, e.g., red, orange, magenta)
      - shape: contiguous horizontal segment (1D block)
      - size: variable length (e.g., 11, 10, 6)
      - location: variable start index within the row
  - object: background
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: fills the rest of the row
actions:
  - name: shift_right
    target: colored_block
    parameters:
      - distance: 3 positions
constraints:
  - The color of the block remains unchanged.
  - The length of the block remains unchanged (unless truncated by the right boundary).
  - The length of the row remains unchanged (30 in examples).
  - There is only one colored block per input row.
  - Input is always a single row.
