**Assessment:**

The code failed on all training examples with the error `Input grid must be a non-empty list of lists.` This indicates a discrepancy between the input format expected by the `transform` function (a list containing at least one list, e.g., `[[0, 2, 2, ...]]`) and the format likely provided during the test execution. The task examples present the data as single rows, which might be interpreted or passed as a flat list (`[0, 2, 2, ...]`) rather than a list containing one row (`[[0, 2, 2, ...]]`).

The core logic identified previously—finding a contiguous block of non-white color and shifting it 3 positions to the right—appears consistent across all examples. The failure is likely due to input validation or handling, not the transformation logic itself.

**Strategy:**

1.  Acknowledge the input format issue. The natural language program should describe the transformation on the conceptual single row of data.
2.  The coder phase will need to adjust the `transform` function to correctly handle the input format provided by the ARC testing environment for this specific task, which seems to represent 1D data. It might need to accept `list[int]` or adapt the validation check.
3.  Verify the core transformation logic (find block, shift right by 3) remains consistent.

**Metrics:**

Based on manual analysis of the examples:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 30)
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 30)
    *   Block: Color=Red(2), Length=11, Start Index=1
    *   Shift: 1 -> 4 (Right by 3)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 30)
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 30)
    *   Block: Color=Orange(7), Length=10, Start Index=14
    *   Shift: 14 -> 17 (Right by 3)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 30)
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]` (Length 30)
    *   Block: Color=Magenta(6), Length=6, Start Index=19
    *   Shift: 19 -> 22 (Right by 3)

**Consistency Check:**
*   All examples use a 1x30 grid (represented as a single list/row).
*   Each input has exactly one contiguous block of a non-white color.
*   The background is always white (0).
*   The transformation consistently shifts the colored block exactly 3 positions to the right.
*   The color and length of the block are preserved.
*   Pixels shifted off the right edge are lost, and the vacated positions on the left become white.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a single row (list) of pixels.
2.  Identify the contiguous segment (block) of non-white pixels. Determine its color, starting index, and length.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
5.  Copy the identified colored block (with its original color and length) into the output row, starting at the calculated new index. Ensure the block does not extend beyond the bounds of the output row; truncate if necessary.
