task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are 1xN grids
input_features:
  - object: colored_block
    count: 1
    attributes:
      - color: non-white (any color other than 0)
      - shape: contiguous horizontal segment (1D line)
      - location: defined by start_index and end_index
      - size: defined by length (end_index - start_index)
  - object: background
    count: 1
    attributes:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: fills the grid cells not occupied by the colored_block
output_features:
  - object: colored_block
    count: 1
    attributes:
      - color: same as input colored_block
      - shape: same as input colored_block
      - location: start_index is input start_index + 3
      - size: same as input colored_block
  - object: background
    count: 1
    attributes:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: fills the grid cells not occupied by the shifted colored_block
transformation:
  - action: identify_object
    source: input_grid
    target_description: the single contiguous block of non-white pixels
    attributes_to_extract: [color, start_index, length]
  - action: create_grid
    target: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - initialization_color: white (0)
  - action: calculate_new_position
    input_attribute: start_index (from identified object)
    operation: add
    value: 3
    output_attribute: new_start_index
  - action: place_object
    source_object: identified colored_block (using original color and length)
    target_grid: output_grid
    target_location: starting at new_start_index
constraints:
  - The input grid will always be 1 row high.
  - There will always be exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color.
  - The shift amount is constant (3).
