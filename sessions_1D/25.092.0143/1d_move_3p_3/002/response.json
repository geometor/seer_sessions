            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code failed due to a `NameError: name '__file__' is not defined`. This error originates from the attempt to dynamically modify the Python path using `sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent))`. This approach is problematic when the code is executed in an environment where `__file__` is not defined (e.g., directly executing a string or within certain interactive environments). This part of the code was intended to import a utility function (`find_objects_by_color` from `grid_utils.py`), but a fallback function was defined locally anyway, and the core logic uses a different helper function (`find_colored_block`) which is also defined locally. Therefore, the path manipulation and import attempt are unnecessary and can be removed.\n\nThe core transformation logic described in the initial analysis and implemented in the `transform` and `find_colored_block` functions appears sound based on the examples. The error prevented execution but doesn't indicate a flaw in the understanding of the transformation rule itself, which consistently involves shifting a single colored block three positions to the right.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Remove the unnecessary path manipulation code (`sys.path.append...`) and the associated `try...except ImportError` block.\n2.  Ensure the locally defined `find_colored_block` function correctly identifies the block's properties (start, end, color).\n3.  Verify that the `transform` function correctly calculates the new position and constructs the output grid based on these properties.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Input Block Color | Input Block Start | Input Block Length | Output Block Start | Output Block Length | Shift Amount |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :------------------ | :----------- |\n| Train 1 | (1, 30)     | (1, 30)      | 2 (Red)           | 1                 | 12                 | 4                  | 12                  | 3            |\n| Train 2 | (1, 30)     | (1, 30)      | 7 (Orange)        | 14                | 10                 | 17                 | 10                  | 3            |\n| Train 3 | (1, 30)     | (1, 30)      | 6 (Magenta)       | 19                | 6                  | 22                 | 6                   | 3            |\n\n*Observations*:\n*   All inputs and outputs are 1x30 grids.\n*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a non-white color.\n*   The color and length of the block are preserved in the output.\n*   The block is consistently shifted 3 positions to the right.\n*   The background remains white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through the single row of the input grid to find the first non-white pixel. This marks the `start_index` of the colored block. Record its `color`.\n3.  Continue iterating from the `start_index` until either a white pixel (0) or the end of the row is encountered. This determines the `end_index` (exclusive) of the block.\n4.  Calculate the `length` of the block (`end_index - start_index`).\n5.  Calculate the `new_start_index` for the block in the output grid by adding 3 to the original `start_index`.\n6.  Calculate the `new_end_index` for the block in the output grid (`new_start_index + length`).\n7.  Copy the block (using the identified `color` and `length`) into the output grid, starting at the `new_start_index` and ending just before the `new_end_index`, ensuring not to write past the grid boundaries. If the `new_end_index` exceeds the grid width, only copy the portion of the block that fits within the grid."
