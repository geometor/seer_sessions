The output shows the same colored block shifted three positions to the right, with the rest of the row remaining white. The color and length of the block are preserved.

    1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, its starting index, and its length.
    2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
    3.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
    4.  Place the identified colored block (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new index.

Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: error:
name '__file__' is not defined
**General Assessment**

The provided code failed due to a `NameError: name '__file__' is not defined`. This error originates from the attempt to dynamically modify the Python path using `sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent))`. This approach is problematic when the code is executed in an environment where `__file__` is not defined (e.g., directly executing a string or within certain interactive environments). This part of the code was intended to import a utility function (`find_objects_by_color` from `grid_utils.py`), but a fallback function was defined locally anyway, and the core logic uses a different helper function (`find_colored_block`) which is also defined locally. Therefore, the path manipulation and import attempt are unnecessary and can be removed.

The core transformation logic described in the initial analysis and implemented in the `transform` and `find_colored_block` functions appears sound based on the examples. The error prevented execution but doesn't indicate a flaw in the understanding of the transformation rule itself, which consistently involves shifting a single colored block three positions to the right.

**Strategy:**

1.  Remove the unnecessary path manipulation code (`sys.path.append...`) and the associated `try...except ImportError` block.
2.  Ensure the locally defined `find_colored_block` function correctly identifies the block's properties (start, end, color).
3.  Verify that the `transform` function correctly calculates the new position and constructs the output grid based on these properties.

*Observations*:
*   All inputs and outputs are 1x30 grids.
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a non-white color.
*   The color and length of the block are preserved in the output.
*   The block is consistently shifted 3 positions to the right.
*   The background remains white.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Iterate through the single row of the input grid to find the first non-white pixel. This marks the `start_index` of the colored block. Record its `color`.
3.  Continue iterating from the `start_index` until either a white pixel (0) or the end of the row is encountered. This determines the `end_index` (exclusive) of the block.
4.  Calculate the `length` of the block (`end_index - start_index`).
5.  Calculate the `new_start_index` for the block in the output grid by adding 3 to the original `start_index`.
6.  Calculate the `new_end_index` for the block in the output grid (`new_start_index + length`).
7.  Copy the block (using the identified `color` and `length`) into the output grid, starting at the `new_start_index` and ending just before the `new_end_index`, ensuring not to write past the grid boundaries. If the `new_end_index` exceeds the grid width, only copy the portion of the block that fits within the grid.
