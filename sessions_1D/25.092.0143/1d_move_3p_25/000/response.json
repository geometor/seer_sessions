            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of the Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output grids are consistently 1-dimensional arrays (rows) of pixels. The length of the row is the same for the input and output in each example (23 pixels long).\n2.  **Colors**: The primary colors observed are white (0), which acts as a background, and one other non-white color per example: red (2), azure (8), or magenta (6).\n3.  **Objects**: Each input row contains exactly one contiguous block (an object) of a non-white color. The rest of the row is filled with the white background color.\n4.  **Transformation**: The transformation appears to be a spatial shift. The non-white block from the input row is moved horizontally to the right within the row.\n5.  **Shift Amount**: Comparing the start position of the non-white block in the input and output:\n    *   Example 1 (Red): Starts at index 0 in input, index 3 in output. Shift = +3.\n    *   Example 2 (Azure): Starts at index 2 in input, index 5 in output. Shift = +3.\n    *   Example 3 (Magenta): Starts at index 1 in input, index 4 in output. Shift = +3.\n    The shift amount is consistently 3 positions to the right.\n6.  **Preservation**: The color of the non-white block and its length are preserved during the transformation. The overall length of the row also remains unchanged. The pixels vacated by the shift become white (background).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
