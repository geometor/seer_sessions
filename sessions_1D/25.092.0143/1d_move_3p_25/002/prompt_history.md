Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

## Perception of the Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output grids are consistently 1-dimensional arrays (rows) of pixels. The length of the row is the same for the input and output in each example (23 pixels long).
2.  **Colors**: The primary colors observed are white (0), which acts as a background, and one other non-white color per example: red (2), azure (8), or magenta (6).
3.  **Objects**: Each input row contains exactly one contiguous block (an object) of a non-white color. The rest of the row is filled with the white background color.
4.  **Transformation**: The transformation appears to be a spatial shift. The non-white block from the input row is moved horizontally to the right within the row.
5.  **Shift Amount**: Comparing the start position of the non-white block in the input and output:
    *   Example 1 (Red): Starts at index 0 in input, index 3 in output. Shift = +3.
    *   Example 2 (Azure): Starts at index 2 in input, index 5 in output. Shift = +3.
    *   Example 3 (Magenta): Starts at index 1 in input, index 4 in output. Shift = +3.
    The shift amount is consistently 3 positions to the right.
6.  **Preservation**: The color of the non-white block and its length are preserved during the transformation. The overall length of the row also remains unchanged. The pixels vacated by the shift become white (background).

      - direction: right
      - distance: 3 pixels
      - preservation: The color and length of the block remain unchanged.
      - background_fill: Positions previously occupied by the block (before the shift) are filled with the background color (white).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, starting position (index), and length.
2.  Determine the background color (which is white, color 0).
3.  Calculate the new starting position for the block by adding 3 to its original starting position.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with the background color (white).
5.  Place the identified non-white block (with its original color and length) into the output row, starting at the calculated new position.

This module transforms an input grid (represented as a 1D numpy array) by
