## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input grid was a 1-dimensional array based on the visual representation of the examples. The error messages (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`) strongly suggest that the code was attempting operations designed for single values (scalars) on array-like structures. This typically happens when indexing a 2D numpy array returns a row (which is itself an array) where a single pixel value was expected, or when a numpy array is used directly in a boolean context (like `if some_array:`).

The simulation performed using `tool_code` confirmed that the ARC framework likely provides inputs as 2D structures (e.g., list of lists or 2D numpy arrays), even for tasks involving only a single row. The core logic of identifying the colored block and shifting it right by 3 positions appears sound, but it needs to be applied correctly to the *data within the row* of the 2D input grid.

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to:
1.  Accept a 2D grid as input.
2.  Explicitly select the first (and only) row.
3.  Perform the block identification and shifting logic on this 1D row data.
4.  Create the output row.
5.  Return the result formatted as a 2D grid (containing the single modified row).

## Metrics

Based on the examples and the simulation:

*   **Input/Output Grid Dimensions:** All training examples use input grids of shape `(1, 23)` and produce output grids of shape `(1, 23)`. The transformation preserves dimensions.
*   **Grid Structure:** Inputs are 2D grids (list of lists or numpy arrays) with `height=1`.
*   **Background Color:** White (0) is consistently used as the background.
*   **Object:** A single, contiguous, horizontal block (line segment) of non-white color exists in the input row.
*   **Object Properties & Transformation:**
    *   **Example 1:**
        *   Input: Red (2) block, start=0, length=19.
        *   Output: Red (2) block, start=3, length=19. (Shift +3)
    *   **Example 2:**
        *   Input: Azure (8) block, start=2, length=9.
        *   Output: Azure (8) block, start=5, length=9. (Shift +3)
    *   **Example 3:**
        *   Input: Magenta (6) block, start=1, length=10.
        *   Output: Magenta (6) block, start=4, length=10. (Shift +3)
*   **Action:** The colored block is consistently shifted 3 columns to the right within the row.
*   **Error Pattern:** The `ValueError` occurred uniformly across all examples, indicating a systematic issue with handling the input data structure, not a conditional logic failure specific to certain inputs.

```yaml
task_description: Move a colored block horizontally by 3 positions within a single-row grid.
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2-dimensional grid containing exactly one row.
    properties:
      - width: variable (consistent between input/output, e.g., 23)
      - height: 1
      - structure: 2D list of lists or 2D numpy array
  - element: background
    description: The default color filling most of the grid row.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
  - element: colored_block
    description: A single contiguous segment of non-background color located within the grid's single row.
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (e.g., red, azure, magenta)
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - length: variable (preserved during transformation)
      - count: exactly one per grid row
      - position: defined by start and end column indices within the row
relationship:
  - type: containment
    description: The colored_block exists within the single row of the grid.
  - type: spatial
    description: The colored_block is surrounded by the background color within the row.
action:
  - name: shift_horizontal
    target: colored_block
    context: Applied to the single row data extracted from the 2D input grid.
    details:
      - The entire colored_block is moved horizontally within its row.
      - direction: right
      - distance: 3 pixels (columns)
      - preservation: The color and length of the block remain unchanged.
      - background_fill: Column positions within the row previously occupied by the block are filled with the background color (white) in the output row.
      - output_structure: The modified row is placed back into a 2D grid structure for the final output.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Extract this row of pixel data.
3.  Identify the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels within the row. Record its color, starting column index, and length.
4.  Note the background color (white, 0).
5.  Create a new, empty row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with the background color.
6.  Calculate the new starting column index for the non-white block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
7.  Copy the original non-white block (same color, same length) into the new row, starting at the calculated new position. Ensure the placement respects the row boundaries.
8.  Format the new row as the single row within a 2D grid structure to produce the final output grid.
