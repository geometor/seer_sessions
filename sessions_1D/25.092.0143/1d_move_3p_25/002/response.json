            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input grid was a 1-dimensional array based on the visual representation of the examples. The error messages (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`) strongly suggest that the code was attempting operations designed for single values (scalars) on array-like structures. This typically happens when indexing a 2D numpy array returns a row (which is itself an array) where a single pixel value was expected, or when a numpy array is used directly in a boolean context (like `if some_array:`).\n\nThe simulation performed using `tool_code` confirmed that the ARC framework likely provides inputs as 2D structures (e.g., list of lists or 2D numpy arrays), even for tasks involving only a single row. The core logic of identifying the colored block and shifting it right by 3 positions appears sound, but it needs to be applied correctly to the *data within the row* of the 2D input grid.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `transform` function to:\n1.  Accept a 2D grid as input.\n2.  Explicitly select the first (and only) row.\n3.  Perform the block identification and shifting logic on this 1D row data.\n4.  Create the output row.\n5.  Return the result formatted as a 2D grid (containing the single modified row).\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the examples and the simulation:\n\n*   **Input/Output Grid Dimensions:** All training examples use input grids of shape `(1, 23)` and produce output grids of shape `(1, 23)`. The transformation preserves dimensions.\n*   **Grid Structure:** Inputs are 2D grids (list of lists or numpy arrays) with `height=1`.\n*   **Background Color:** White (0) is consistently used as the background.\n*   **Object:** A single, contiguous, horizontal block (line segment) of non-white color exists in the input row.\n*   **Object Properties & Transformation:**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Input: Red (2) block, start=0, length=19.\n        *   Output: Red (2) block, start=3, length=19. (Shift +3)\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Input: Azure (8) block, start=2, length=9.\n        *   Output: Azure (8) block, start=5, length=9. (Shift +3)\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Input: Magenta (6) block, start=1, length=10.\n        *   Output: Magenta (6) block, start=4, length=10. (Shift +3)\n*   **Action:** The colored block is consistently shifted 3 columns to the right within the row.\n*   **Error Pattern:** The `ValueError` occurred uniformly across all examples, indicating a systematic issue with handling the input data structure, not a conditional logic failure specific to certain inputs.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
