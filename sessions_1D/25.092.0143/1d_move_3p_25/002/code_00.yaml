task_description: Move a colored block horizontally by 3 positions within a single-row grid.
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2-dimensional grid containing exactly one row.
    properties:
      - width: variable (consistent between input/output, e.g., 23)
      - height: 1
      - structure: 2D list of lists or 2D numpy array
  - element: background
    description: The default color filling most of the grid row.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
  - element: colored_block
    description: A single contiguous segment of non-background color located within the grid's single row.
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (e.g., red, azure, magenta)
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - length: variable (preserved during transformation)
      - count: exactly one per grid row
      - position: defined by start and end column indices within the row
relationship:
  - type: containment
    description: The colored_block exists within the single row of the grid.
  - type: spatial
    description: The colored_block is surrounded by the background color within the row.
action:
  - name: shift_horizontal
    target: colored_block
    context: Applied to the single row data extracted from the 2D input grid.
    details:
      - The entire colored_block is moved horizontally within its row.
      - direction: right
      - distance: 3 pixels (columns)
      - preservation: The color and length of the block remain unchanged.
      - background_fill: Column positions within the row previously occupied by the block are filled with the background color (white) in the output row.
      - output_structure: The modified row is placed back into a 2D grid structure for the final output.
