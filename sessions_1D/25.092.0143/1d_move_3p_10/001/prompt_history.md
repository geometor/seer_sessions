Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

*   The inputs and outputs are single rows (1-dimensional grids).
*   Each row contains a background of white pixels (0).
*   Embedded within the white background is a single contiguous block (object) of a non-white color (magenta (6), yellow (4), or red (2) in the examples).
*   The length of the non-white block varies between examples.
*   The starting position of the non-white block varies between examples.
*   In the output, the non-white block retains its original color and length.
*   The non-white block's position changes from the input to the output. Specifically, it shifts to the right.
*   The amount of shift appears constant across all examples: 3 positions to the right.
*   The overall length of the row remains unchanged. Pixels previously occupied by the start of the block become white, and the block occupies pixels that were previously white.

**Facts:**

task_type: object_manipulation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (row)

    properties:
      - length: variable (15, 3, 9 in examples)
      - start_index: variable (2, 12, 6 in examples)

    properties:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 3 positions

  - type: spatial
    description: The colored_block is embedded within the background.
  - type: transformation
    input_object: colored_block (at start_index)
    output_object: colored_block (at start_index + 3)
    preserves:
      - color
      - length
    changes:
      - position (start_index)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Record the color, length, and starting index of this block.
3.  Determine the new starting index by adding 3 to the original starting index.
4.  Create a new row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
5.  Copy the identified colored block (using its original color and length) into the new row, starting at the calculated new starting index.
6.  The resulting row is the output.
