Specifically, it shifts to the right.\n*   The amount of shift appears constant across all examples: 3 positions to the right.\n*   The overall length of the row remains unchanged. Pixels previously occupied by the start of the block become white, and the block occupies pixels that were previously white.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
