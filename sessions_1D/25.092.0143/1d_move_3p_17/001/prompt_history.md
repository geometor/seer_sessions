## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a 1x16 grid (a single row).
Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal line of a non-white color (blue or red) surrounded by white pixels.
The line always starts at the second position (index 1) in the input grid.
The length and color of the line vary between examples.
The output grid is the same size (1x16).
The transformation involves shifting the colored line horizontally to the right.
By observing the examples:
- In `train_1`, the blue line (1) of length 7 starts at index 1 and moves to start at index 4.
- In `train_2`, the red line (2) of length 8 starts at index 1 and moves to start at index 4.
- In `train_3`, the blue line (1) of length 4 starts at index 1 and moves to start at index 4.
The shift distance is consistently 3 positions to the right (from index 1 to index 4).
The background remains white (0).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1x16
  output: 1x16
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: non-white (blue=1, red=2)
      length: variable (4, 7, 8 in examples)
      position:
        input: starts at column index 1
        output: starts at column index 4
      contiguity: contiguous block of pixels
relationships:
  - The line object is surrounded by the background color.
actions:
  - Identify the non-white horizontal line object in the input grid.
  - Determine the line's color and length.
  - Shift the entire line object horizontally 3 positions to the right.
  - Maintain the background color in the remaining positions.
constants:
  - shift_distance: 3 columns
  - shift_direction: right
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a 1x16 grid filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right (column index 0 to 15) to find the start of the non-white horizontal line.
3.  Identify the color and length of the non-white line.
4.  Determine the starting column index of the line in the input (this will always be 1 based on the examples).
5.  Calculate the new starting column index for the line in the output grid by adding 3 to the input starting index (1 + 3 = 4).
6.  Place the identified line (with its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated new starting column index (index 4).
