"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by identifying a single contiguous horizontal line 
of a non-white color. This line is then shifted 3 positions to the right in the 
output grid, while maintaining its original color and length. The rest of the 
output grid is filled with the background color (white, 0). The input line is 
assumed to start at index 1 based on observations from the training examples.
Handles potential NumPy array inputs by converting them to lists.
