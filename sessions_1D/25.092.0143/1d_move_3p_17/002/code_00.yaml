task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1x16
  output: 1x16
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_line
    count: 1 per grid
    properties:
      color: non-white (blue=1 or red=2)
      length: variable (4, 7, 8 in examples)
      position:
        input: contiguous segment starting at column index 1
        output: contiguous segment starting at column index 4
      contiguity: confirmed contiguous
relationships:
  - The line object is the only non-background object in the grid.
  - The line object is surrounded by the background color.
actions:
  - Identify the single contiguous non-white horizontal line object in the input grid.
  - Determine the line's color, length, and starting position (which is always index 1).
  - Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color.
  - Draw the identified line into the new grid, preserving its color and length, but starting at a new column index calculated by adding a fixed offset to the original starting index.
constants:
  - shift_distance: 3 columns
  - shift_direction: right
  - input_line_start_index: 1
  - output_line_start_index: 4
