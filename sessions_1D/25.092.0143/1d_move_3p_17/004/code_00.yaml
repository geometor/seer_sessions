task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1x16 (consistent across examples)
  output: 1x16 (consistent across examples)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: non-white (blue=1, red=2 observed)
      length: variable (4, 7, 8 observed)
      contiguity: single contiguous block
      position:
        input: starts at column index 1 (consistent observation)
        output: starts at column index 4
relationships:
  - The line object is the only non-background object in the grid.
  - The line object is surrounded by the background color.
actions:
  - Detect the single contiguous horizontal line of non-white color in the input grid's single row.
  - Determine the line's starting index (always 1 in examples), color, and length.
  - Create an output grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color.
  - Calculate the output starting index by adding a fixed offset of 3 to the input starting index.
  - Draw the identified line (same color, same length) into the output grid at the calculated output starting index.
constants:
  - shift_distance: 3 columns
  - shift_direction: right
  - input_line_start_index: 1 (based on observed examples)
assumptions:
  - Input grid is always 1xN.
  - There is exactly one contiguous horizontal line of non-white color.
  - This line always starts at index 1 in the input.
  - The background is always white (0).
potential_issues:
  - Input data type mismatch (NumPy array vs. list of lists) causing execution errors. Resolved by ensuring input is converted to list of lists.
