            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided Python code implements the logic described in the initial analysis: identify a single horizontal line of non-white pixels starting at index 1 and shift it 3 positions to the right. The core transformation logic appears correct based on the examples.\n\nThe error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` occurring consistently across all examples strongly suggests a data type mismatch between the function's expectation (list of lists of integers) and the data passed by the testing environment (likely a NumPy array). The comparison operations or boolean checks within the code might be failing when applied directly to NumPy array elements or slices in a way that expects a single boolean outcome.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Input Type Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle potential NumPy array inputs by converting them to Python lists of lists at the beginning. This ensures the rest of the function operates on the expected data type.\n2.  **Code Robustness:** Ensure the code correctly handles edge cases, such as empty grids or grids without the expected line pattern (though the examples suggest the pattern is consistent). The current `find_line_properties` function returns `None` if no line is found, which is handled correctly in `transform`.\n3.  **Verification:** Re-verify the core logic (line identification, shift calculation, output generation) against the examples after implementing the type handling fix.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nBased on the initial analysis and the provided examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Identified Line: Start=1, Color=Blue(1), Length=7\n    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Shifted Start=1+3=4)\n    *   Result: Error (Likely due to input type)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Identified Line: Start=1, Color=Red(2), Length=8\n    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Shifted Start=1+3=4)\n    *   Result: Error (Likely due to input type)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Identified Line: Start=1, Color=Blue(1), Length=4\n    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Shifted Start=1+3=4)\n    *   Result: Error (Likely due to input type)\n\nThe transformation logic (shift right by 3) seems consistent and correctly derived from the examples. The primary issue appears to be technical (input data type) rather than logical.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Assume the input grid has exactly one row.\n2.  **Initialization:** Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n3.  **Object Identification:** Scan the single row of the input grid to find the first non-white pixel. This marks the start of the horizontal line object. Record its starting column index, color, and determine its length by counting consecutive pixels of the same color.\n4.  **Transformation Calculation:** Calculate the starting column index for the line in the output grid by adding 3 to the starting column index found in the input grid.\n5.  **Output Generation:** Iterate from the calculated output starting index for the determined length of the line. In the output grid's row, set the pixels at these column indices to the color identified from the input line. Ensure writing stays within the grid boundaries.\n6.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid."
