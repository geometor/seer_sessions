Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the perception, facts, and natural language program.

**Perception:**

The input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (green, gray, or blue) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output grid contains the same colored block, but its position within the row has shifted. In all examples, the shift is consistently 3 positions to the right. The length of the colored block and the color itself remain unchanged. The overall length of the row also remains unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Structure:
  - Input: Single row (1D array)
  - Output: Single row (1D array)
  - Dimensions: Input and output rows have the same length.
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous block of a single non-white color.
  - Quantity: Exactly one per input grid.
  - Properties:
    - Color: Varies (green, gray, blue in examples).
    - Length: Varies.
    - Integrity: The block remains intact (same color, same length) from input to output.
Background:
  - Color: White (0)
  - Role: Fills the space not occupied by the colored block.
Transformation:
  - Action: Translation (Shift)
  - Target: The single non-white colored block.
  - Direction: Rightward along the row.
  - Magnitude: Exactly 3 positions.
Relationships:
  - The colored block is embedded within a background of white pixels.
  - The position of the block in the output is determined by its position in the input plus the fixed shift amount.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, length, and starting position.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels.
3.  Calculate the new starting position for the block by adding 3 to its original starting position in the input row.
4.  Place the identified colored block (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new position.
5.  Return the modified output row.
