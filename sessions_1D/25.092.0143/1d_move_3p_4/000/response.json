Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (green, gray, or blue) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output grid contains the same colored block, but its position within the row has shifted. In all examples, the shift is consistently 3 positions to the right. The length of the colored block and the color itself remain unchanged. The overall length of the row also remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
