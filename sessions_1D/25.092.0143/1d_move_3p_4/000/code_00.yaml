Grid_Structure:
  - Input: Single row (1D array)
  - Output: Single row (1D array)
  - Dimensions: Input and output rows have the same length.
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous block of a single non-white color.
  - Quantity: Exactly one per input grid.
  - Properties:
    - Color: Varies (green, gray, blue in examples).
    - Length: Varies.

Transformation:
  - Action: Translation (Shift)
  - Target: The single non-white colored block.
  - Direction: Rightward along the row.
  - Magnitude: Exactly 3 positions.
Relationships:
  - The colored block is embedded within a background of white pixels.
