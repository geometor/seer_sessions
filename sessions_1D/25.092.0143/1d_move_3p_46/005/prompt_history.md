Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as 1D arrays (single rows) of pixels. Based on the examples, the length seems consistent (20 pixels).
2.  **Colors:** Each example uses white (0) as a background color and one other distinct color (yellow=4, azure=8, magenta=6) to form a specific shape or object.
3.  **Objects:** In each input, there is a single, contiguous block of a non-white color. This block appears to be the primary object of interest. The white pixels seem to act as empty space or background.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output, the block of non-white color consistently shifts its position to the right. The amount of shift appears to be constant across examples.
5.  **Shift Amount:**
    *   Example 1: Yellow block starts at index 0, ends at 15. In output, starts at index 3, ends at 18. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 2: Azure block starts at index 0, ends at 14. In output, starts at index 3, ends at 17. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 3: Magenta block starts at index 4, ends at 8. In output, starts at index 7, ends at 11. Shift = 3.
6.  **Background Handling:** The white pixels (0) fill the space vacated by the shifted object and the remaining space in the grid. The total number of non-white pixels and white pixels remains the same between input and output. The grid size also remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 1D Array (Row)
  - Size: Constant (e.g., 20 elements in examples)
  - Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous block of non-white pixels
  - Quantity: Exactly one per input grid
  - Properties:
      - Color: Varies (yellow, azure, magenta in examples)
      - Length: Varies (16, 15, 5 in examples)
      - Position: Defined by start and end index

Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal Shift
  - Target: The single non-white block object
  - Direction: Right
  - Magnitude: 3 positions
  - Effect: Object's start and end indices increase by 3.
  - Background_Behavior: White pixels fill all grid positions not occupied by the shifted object.

Conservation:
  - Grid size remains constant.
  - The count of each color pixel remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, its starting index, and its ending index.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
4.  Calculate the new ending index for the block by adding 3 to its original ending index.
5.  Place the identified block of non-white pixels (using its original color and length) into the new output row, starting at the calculated new starting index and ending at the calculated new ending index.
6.  The resulting output row is the final result.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**Assessment and Strategy**

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that a comparison intended for a single value (scalar) was performed on a NumPy array containing multiple elements. Based on the code structure and the error message, this likely occurred because the input grid was treated as a 1D list/array when it was actually provided as a 2D NumPy array (even if it only had one row).

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge that the input is likely a 2D NumPy array.
2.  Modify the logic to specifically operate on the single row within the 2D input array.
3.  Adjust the `find_object_block` and `transform` functions accordingly. The core logic of finding the block and shifting it remains the same, but it needs to be applied to the row data extracted from the 2D input.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's re-examine the examples assuming a 2D input structure (1 row, N columns).

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Input/Output Shape:** All inputs are confirmed as (1, 20). Outputs are also (1, 20). *Correction*: The code output shows output_1 shape as (1, 19). This is likely a typo in my manual `output_1` definition within the `tool_code`. The actual task output for example 1 is indeed (1, 20). I will proceed assuming all grids are (1, 20).
*   **Block Identification:** The code correctly identifies the single non-white block, its color, start/end indices, and length in both input and output for all examples.
*   **Shift Calculation:** The calculated shift is consistently +3 for all examples.
*   **Conservation:** The block color and length are preserved during the shift (ignoring the length discrepancy in example 1 caused by the typo in the test code).

The core logic remains consistent: find the block, shift it right by 3. The implementation needs to handle the 2D input format.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 2D Array (Grid)
  - Shape: Constant (1 row, 20 columns in examples)
  - Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels
  - Location: Within the single row of the grid
  - Quantity: Exactly one per input grid
  - Properties:
      - Color: Varies (yellow, azure, magenta in examples)
      - Length: Varies (16, 15, 5 pixels in examples)
      - Position: Defined by start and end column index within the row

Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal Shift
  - Target: The single non-white block object in the grid's row
  - Direction: Right
  - Magnitude: 3 columns
  - Effect: The block's start and end column indices increase by 3.
  - Background_Behavior: White pixels fill all grid positions not occupied by the shifted object. The grid shape remains unchanged.

Conservation:
  - Grid shape (rows, columns) remains constant.
  - The block's color remains constant.
  - The block's length remains constant.
  - The total count of each color pixel remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is a 2D array with one row.
2.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within that row. Determine its color, its starting column index, and its ending column index.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting column index.
5.  Calculate the new ending column index for the block by adding 3 to its original ending column index.
6.  Copy the original block (preserving its color and length) into the single row of the output grid, starting at the calculated new starting column index and ending at the calculated new ending column index. Ensure the placement stays within the grid boundaries.
7.  The resulting output grid is the final result.
