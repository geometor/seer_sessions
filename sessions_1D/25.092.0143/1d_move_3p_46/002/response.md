**General Assessment:**

The error message (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`) indicates a problem within the NumPy operations, specifically where a boolean condition is expected, but an array of booleans was provided. Reviewing the provided Python code, the comparisons and conditional logic within both `find_object_block` and `transform` appear designed to work with single integer values extracted from the 1D input array, which should yield single boolean results. Therefore, the error is surprising given the assumed 1D integer list input format and the logic implemented.

Possible reasons for the error include:
1.  An unexpected input data structure being passed to the `transform` function by the test harness (e.g., a nested list or multi-dimensional array).
2.  An unforeseen interaction or edge case within the NumPy functions used, although the operations (`!=`, `<`, `==`, slicing, assignment) are standard for 1D arrays.
3.  An issue in the test environment itself.

The core transformation logic identified previously (find the single contiguous non-white block and shift it right by 3 positions) seems consistent across all three examples. The strategy is to re-verify this logic using precise metrics from the examples, refine the documentation (YAML and natural language program), and assume the underlying transformation rule is correctly understood. The implementation error needs debugging, potentially by examining the exact state of variables just before the error occurs or simplifying the code further, but the high-level plan remains the same.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input_Output_Structure:
  - Type: Paired 1D grids (rows)
  - Grid_Size: Consistent across all examples (20 pixels)
  - Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Name: Color Block
  - Identification: A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
  - Quantity: Exactly one per grid.
  - Properties:
    - Color: Varies per example pair (yellow=4, azure=8, magenta=6), but consistent between input and output for a given pair.
    - Length: Varies per example pair (16, 15, 5 pixels), but consistent between input and output for a given pair.
    - Position: Defined by start and end indices. Changes between input and output.

Transformation:
  - Type: Spatial Translation (Shift)
  - Target: The Color Block object.
  - Direction: Horizontal (along the row).
  - Vector: +3 positions (shift right).
  - Application: The start index of the Color Block in the output is the start index in the input plus 3.
  - Background_Handling: The output grid is initialized with the background color (white=0), and the shifted Color Block overwrites the corresponding positions.

Conservation_Rules:
  - Grid size remains constant (20).
  - The Color Block's color remains constant.
  - The Color Block's length remains constant.
  - The number of pixels of each color remains constant between input and output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive a 1D input grid (row) of pixels.
2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels (the "Color Block"). Determine its color, length, and starting index.
3.  Create a new 1D output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the Color Block by adding 3 to its original starting index in the input grid.
5.  Copy the identified Color Block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new starting index.
6.  Return the generated output grid.
