            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`) indicates a problem within the NumPy operations, specifically where a boolean condition is expected, but an array of booleans was provided. Reviewing the provided Python code, the comparisons and conditional logic within both `find_object_block` and `transform` appear designed to work with single integer values extracted from the 1D input array, which should yield single boolean results. Therefore, the error is surprising given the assumed 1D integer list input format and the logic implemented.\n\nPossible reasons for the error include:\n1.  An unexpected input data structure being passed to the `transform` function by the test harness (e.g., a nested list or multi-dimensional array).\n2.  An unforeseen interaction or edge case within the NumPy functions used, although the operations (`!=`, `<`, `==`, slicing, assignment) are standard for 1D arrays.\n3.  An issue in the test environment itself.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (find the single contiguous non-white block and shift it right by 3 positions) seems consistent across all three examples. The strategy is to re-verify this logic using precise metrics from the examples, refine the documentation (YAML and natural language program), and assume the underlying transformation rule is correctly understood. The implementation error needs debugging, potentially by examining the exact state of variables just before the error occurs or simplifying the code further, but the high-level plan remains the same.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n"
