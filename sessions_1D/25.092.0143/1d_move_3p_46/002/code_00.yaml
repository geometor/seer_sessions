Input_Output_Structure:
  - Type: Paired 1D grids (rows)
  - Grid_Size: Consistent across all examples (20 pixels)
  - Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Name: Color Block
  - Identification: A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
  - Quantity: Exactly one per grid.
  - Properties:
    - Color: Varies per example pair (yellow=4, azure=8, magenta=6), but consistent between input and output for a given pair.
    - Length: Varies per example pair (16, 15, 5 pixels), but consistent between input and output for a given pair.
    - Position: Defined by start and end indices. Changes between input and output.

Transformation:
  - Type: Spatial Translation (Shift)
  - Target: The Color Block object.
  - Direction: Horizontal (along the row).
  - Vector: +3 positions (shift right).
  - Application: The start index of the Color Block in the output is the start index in the input plus 3.
  - Background_Handling: The output grid is initialized with the background color (white=0), and the shifted Color Block overwrites the corresponding positions.

Conservation_Rules:
  - Grid size remains constant (20).
  - The Color Block's color remains constant.
  - The Color Block's length remains constant.
  - The number of pixels of each color remains constant between input and output.
