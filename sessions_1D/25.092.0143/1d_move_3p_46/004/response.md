**Assessment and Strategy**

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that a comparison intended for a single value (scalar) was performed on a NumPy array containing multiple elements. Based on the code structure and the error message, this likely occurred because the input grid was treated as a 1D list/array when it was actually provided as a 2D NumPy array (even if it only had one row).

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge that the input is likely a 2D NumPy array.
2.  Modify the logic to specifically operate on the single row within the 2D input array.
3.  Adjust the `find_object_block` and `transform` functions accordingly. The core logic of finding the block and shifting it remains the same, but it needs to be applied to the row data extracted from the 2D input.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's re-examine the examples assuming a 2D input structure (1 row, N columns).


``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 1
input_1 = np.array([[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
output_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]]) # Corrected expected output shape

# Example 2
input_2 = np.array([[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
output_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

# Example 3
input_3 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
output_3 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])


def analyze_example(input_arr, output_arr):
    input_shape = input_arr.shape
    output_shape = output_arr.shape
    # Find block in input row
    row = input_arr[0]
    start_index = -1
    end_index = -1
    color = 0
    for i, pixel in enumerate(row):
        if pixel != 0:

                start_index = i
                color = pixel
            end_index = i
        elif start_index != -1:
            break # block ended
    if start_index != -1 and end_index == -1: # block goes to end
        end_index = len(row) - 1

    # Find block in output row
    row_out = output_arr[0]
    start_index_out = -1
    end_index_out = -1
    color_out = 0
    for i, pixel in enumerate(row_out):
        if pixel != 0:
            if start_index_out == -1:
                start_index_out = i
                color_out = pixel
            end_index_out = i
        elif start_index_out != -1:
            break
    if start_index_out != -1 and end_index_out == -1:
        end_index_out = len(row_out) -1

    shift = start_index_out - start_index if start_index != -1 and start_index_out != -1 else None
    length = end_index - start_index + 1 if start_index != -1 else 0
    length_out = end_index_out - start_index_out + 1 if start_index_out != -1 else 0


    return {
        "input_shape": input_shape,
        "output_shape": output_shape,

analysis = [
    analyze_example(input_1, output_1),

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Input/Output Shape:** All inputs are confirmed as (1, 20). Outputs are also (1, 20). *Correction*: The code output shows output_1 shape as (1, 19). This is likely a typo in my manual `output_1` definition within the `tool_code`. The actual task output for example 1 is indeed (1, 20). I will proceed assuming all grids are (1, 20).
*   **Block Identification:** The code correctly identifies the single non-white block, its color, start/end indices, and length in both input and output for all examples.
*   **Shift Calculation:** The calculated shift is consistently +3 for all examples.
*   **Conservation:** The block color and length are preserved during the shift (ignoring the length discrepancy in example 1 caused by the typo in the test code).

The core logic remains consistent: find the block, shift it right by 3. The implementation needs to handle the 2D input format.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 2D Array (Grid)
  - Shape: Constant (1 row, 20 columns in examples)
  - Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels
  - Location: Within the single row of the grid
  - Quantity: Exactly one per input grid
  - Properties:
      - Color: Varies (yellow, azure, magenta in examples)
      - Length: Varies (16, 15, 5 pixels in examples)
      - Position: Defined by start and end column index within the row

Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal Shift
  - Target: The single non-white block object in the grid's row
  - Direction: Right
  - Magnitude: 3 columns
  - Effect: The block's start and end column indices increase by 3.
  - Background_Behavior: White pixels fill all grid positions not occupied by the shifted object. The grid shape remains unchanged.

Conservation:
  - Grid shape (rows, columns) remains constant.
  - The block's color remains constant.
  - The block's length remains constant.
  - The total count of each color pixel remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is a 2D array with one row.
2.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within that row. Determine its color, its starting column index, and its ending column index.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting column index.
5.  Calculate the new ending column index for the block by adding 3 to its original ending column index.
6.  Copy the original block (preserving its color and length) into the single row of the output grid, starting at the calculated new starting column index and ending at the calculated new ending column index. Ensure the placement stays within the grid boundaries.
7.  The resulting output grid is the final result.
