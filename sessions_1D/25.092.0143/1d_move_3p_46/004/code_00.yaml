Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 2D Array (Grid)
  - Shape: Constant (1 row, 20 columns in examples)
  - Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels
  - Location: Within the single row of the grid
  - Quantity: Exactly one per input grid
  - Properties:
      - Color: Varies (yellow, azure, magenta in examples)
      - Length: Varies (16, 15, 5 pixels in examples)
      - Position: Defined by start and end column index within the row

Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal Shift
  - Target: The single non-white block object in the grid's row
  - Direction: Right
  - Magnitude: 3 columns
  - Effect: The block's start and end column indices increase by 3.
  - Background_Behavior: White pixels fill all grid positions not occupied by the shifted object. The grid shape remains unchanged.

Conservation:
  - Grid shape (rows, columns) remains constant.
  - The block's color remains constant.
  - The block's length remains constant.
  - The total count of each color pixel remains constant.
