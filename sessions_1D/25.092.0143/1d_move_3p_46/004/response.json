Based on the code structure and the error message, this likely occurred because the input grid was treated as a 1D list/array when it was actually provided as a 2D NumPy array (even if it only had one row).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge that the input is likely a 2D NumPy array.\n2.  Modify the logic to specifically operate on the single row within the 2D input array.\n3.  Adjust the `find_object_block` and `transform` functions accordingly. The core logic of finding the block and shifting it remains the same, but it needs to be applied to the row data extracted from the 2D input.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples assuming a 2D input structure (1 row, N columns).\n\n"

The actual task output for example 1 is indeed (1, 20). I will proceed assuming all grids are (1, 20).\n*   **Block Identification:** The code correctly identifies the single non-white block, its color, start/end indices, and length in both input and output for all examples.\n*   **Shift Calculation:** The calculated shift is consistently +3 for all examples.\n*   **Conservation:** The block color and length are preserved during the shift (ignoring the length discrepancy in example 1 caused by the typo in the test code).\n\nThe core logic remains consistent: find the block, shift it right by 3.
