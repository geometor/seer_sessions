Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 1D Array (Row)
  - Size: Constant (e.g., 20 elements in examples)
  - Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous block of non-white pixels
  - Quantity: Exactly one per input grid
  - Properties:
      - Color: Varies (yellow, azure, magenta in examples)
      - Length: Varies (16, 15, 5 in examples)
      - Position: Defined by start and end index

Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal Shift
  - Target: The single non-white block object
  - Direction: Right
  - Magnitude: 3 positions
  - Effect: Object's start and end indices increase by 3.
  - Background_Behavior: White pixels fill all grid positions not occupied by the shifted object.

Conservation:
  - Grid size remains constant.
  - The count of each color pixel remains constant.
