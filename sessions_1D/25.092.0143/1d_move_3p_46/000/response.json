            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as 1D arrays (single rows) of pixels. Based on the examples, the length seems consistent (20 pixels).\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses white (0) as a background color and one other distinct color (yellow=4, azure=8, magenta=6) to form a specific shape or object.\n3.  **Objects:** In each input, there is a single, contiguous block of a non-white color. This block appears to be the primary object of interest. The white pixels seem to act as empty space or background.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output, the block of non-white color consistently shifts its position to the right. The amount of shift appears to be constant across examples.\n5.  **Shift Amount:**\n    *   Example 1: Yellow block starts at index 0, ends at 15. In output, starts at index 3, ends at 18. Shift = 3.\n    *   Example 2: Azure block starts at index 0, ends at 14. In output, starts at index 3, ends at 17. Shift = 3.\n    *   Example 3: Magenta block starts at index 4, ends at 8. In output, starts at index 7, ends at 11. Shift = 3.\n6.  **Background Handling:** The white pixels (0) fill the space vacated by the shifted object and the remaining space in the grid. The total number of non-white pixels and white pixels remains the same between input and output. The grid size also remains constant.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white pixels (0).\n3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index.\n4.  Calculate the new ending index for the block by adding 3 to its original ending index.\n5.  Place the identified block of non-white pixels (using its original color and length) into the new output row, starting at the calculated new starting index and ending at the calculated new ending index.\n6.  The resulting output row is the final result."
