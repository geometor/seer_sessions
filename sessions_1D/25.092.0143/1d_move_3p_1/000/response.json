The transformation shifts this non-white block horizontally to the right by a fixed amount, leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged. The color and length of the block are preserved. By observing the examples, the shift amount is consistently 3 positions to the right.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
