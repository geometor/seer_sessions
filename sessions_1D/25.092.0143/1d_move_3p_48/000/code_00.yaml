Data:
  - type: 1D grid (row)
    structure: Input and Output are single rows of the same length.
Objects:
  - type: contiguous block
    properties:
      - color: non-white (variable, e.g., yellow, gray, orange)
      - length: variable (e.g., 3, 6, 9)
      - count: exactly one per input row
    location: surrounded by white pixels
Background:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
Transformation:
  - action: shift
  - target: the contiguous block of non-white pixels
  - direction: right
  - amount: 3 positions
  - mechanism: The block moves 3 steps to the right. The original positions occupied by the block become white. The pixels to the right of the block are displaced by the shift.
Relationship:
  - The shift amount (3) is constant and independent of the block's color or length.
