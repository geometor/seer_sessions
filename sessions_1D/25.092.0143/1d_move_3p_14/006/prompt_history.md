*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (vectors).
    *   Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (magenta, green, or gray) surrounded by white pixels (0).
    *   The non-white block's color and length remain the same in the output.
    *   The position of the non-white block changes between the input and output.
    *   The block shifts horizontally to the right.
    *   The amount of shift appears related to the number of white pixels initially to the right of the block.
    *   In all output examples, there is exactly one white pixel to the right of the non-white block.

*   **Facts:**

      - input_block_color == output_block_color
      - input_block_length == output_block_length
    calculations:
      - find the start and end index of the non-white block
      - count the number of white pixels after the block's end index (trailing_whites)
      - calculate the required shift: shift_amount = trailing_whites - 1
      - determine the new start index: new_start_index = old_start_index + shift_amount
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, starting position, and length.
    2.  Count the number of white pixels that appear consecutively to the *right* of this non-white block (trailing white pixels). Let this count be `N`.
    3.  Calculate the required rightward shift amount for the block: `Shift = N - 1`.
    4.  Construct the output row:
        *   Start with white pixels. The number of leading white pixels in the output will be the number of leading white pixels in the input plus the `Shift` amount.
        *   Append the original non-white block (same color, same length).
        *   Append exactly one white pixel.
        *   Ensure the total length of the output row matches the input row length (this should happen automatically if the steps above are followed correctly, given the observation that the shift results in exactly one trailing white pixel).

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels 
to the right such that exactly one white pixel remains to its right.

The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the single contiguous block of a non-white color in the input row.
2. Counting the number of white pixels immediately following this block (trailing whites).
3. Calculating the shift distance needed to leave exactly one trailing white pixel (shift = trailing_whites - 1).
4. Constructing the output row by placing the non-white block at its new shifted position, ensuring it's preceded by the appropriate number of leading white pixels and followed by exactly one white pixel. The overall grid size remains the same.
