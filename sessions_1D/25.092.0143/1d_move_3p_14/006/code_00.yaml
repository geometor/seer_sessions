task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white # Examples use magenta (6), green (3), gray (5)
    count: 1 per grid
    properties:
      - location (start_index, end_index)
      - color
      - length
background:
  color: white (0)
transformation:
  type: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  target: non-white_block
  shift_amount: constant(3) # The block always shifts 3 positions to the right
  properties_preserved:
    - color
    - length
relationship:
  - input_grid_size == output_grid_size
  - input_block_color == output_block_color
  - input_block_length == output_block_length
  - output_block_start_index == input_block_start_index + 3
calculations:
  - Find the start index, end index, color, and length of the non-white block in the input.
  - Calculate the new start index: new_start_index = old_start_index + 3.
  - Calculate the new end index: new_end_index = new_start_index + block_length - 1.
  - Construct the output grid: Initialize an all-white grid of the same size, then place the original block (same color, same length) at the calculated new start and end indices.
