Identifying the single contiguous block of a non-white color in the input row.\n2. Counting the number of white pixels immediately following this block (trailing whites).\n3. Calculating the shift distance needed to leave exactly one trailing white pixel (shift = trailing_whites - 1).\n4. Constructing the output row by placing the non-white block at its new shifted position, ensuring it's preceded by the appropriate number of leading white pixels and followed by exactly one white pixel.
