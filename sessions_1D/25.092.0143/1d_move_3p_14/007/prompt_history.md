*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (vectors).
    *   Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (magenta, green, or gray) surrounded by white pixels (0).
    *   The non-white block's color and length remain the same in the output.
    *   The position of the non-white block changes between the input and output.
    *   The block shifts horizontally to the right.
    *   The amount of shift appears related to the number of white pixels initially to the right of the block.
    *   In all output examples, there is exactly one white pixel to the right of the non-white block.

*   **Facts:**

      - input_block_color == output_block_color
      - input_block_length == output_block_length
    calculations:
      - find the start and end index of the non-white block
      - count the number of white pixels after the block's end index (trailing_whites)
      - calculate the required shift: shift_amount = trailing_whites - 1
      - determine the new start index: new_start_index = old_start_index + shift_amount
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, starting position, and length.
    2.  Count the number of white pixels that appear consecutively to the *right* of this non-white block (trailing white pixels). Let this count be `N`.
    3.  Calculate the required rightward shift amount for the block: `Shift = N - 1`.
    4.  Construct the output row:
        *   Start with white pixels. The number of leading white pixels in the output will be the number of leading white pixels in the input plus the `Shift` amount.
        *   Append the original non-white block (same color, same length).
        *   Append exactly one white pixel.
        *   Ensure the total length of the output row matches the input row length (this should happen automatically if the steps above are followed correctly, given the observation that the shift results in exactly one trailing white pixel).
```python
"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels 
to the right such that exactly one white pixel remains to its right.

The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the single contiguous block of a non-white color in the input row.
2. Counting the number of white pixels immediately following this block (trailing whites).
3. Calculating the shift distance needed to leave exactly one trailing white pixel (shift = trailing_whites - 1).
4. Constructing the output row by placing the non-white block at its new shifted position, ensuring it's preceded by the appropriate number of leading white pixels and followed by exactly one white pixel. The overall grid size remains the same.

**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt correctly identified the core elements: a single non-white block in a 1D grid being shifted horizontally. However, the execution failed because the Python code implementation contained a bug, specifically in how the shifted block was placed into the new grid, resulting in an empty (all white) output. The analysis of the input/output pairs reveals a consistent pattern: the block is always shifted exactly 3 positions to the right. The initial natural language program was based on an incorrect interpretation (shifting based on trailing white pixels), and the subsequent code was based on the correct fixed-shift rule but implemented incorrectly.

**Strategy:**

1.  Verify the constant shift rule using metrics derived from the examples.
2.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the constant rightward shift of 3 positions.
3.  Correct the Python implementation bug, ensuring the block is correctly copied to the new position in the output grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white # Examples use magenta (6), green (3), gray (5)
    count: 1 per grid
    properties:
      - location (start_index, end_index)
      - color
      - length
background:
  color: white (0)
transformation:
  type: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  target: non-white_block
  shift_amount: constant(3) # The block always shifts 3 positions to the right
  properties_preserved:
    - color
    - length
relationship:
  - input_grid_size == output_grid_size
  - input_block_color == output_block_color
  - input_block_length == output_block_length
  - output_block_start_index == input_block_start_index + 3
calculations:
  - Find the start index, end index, color, and length of the non-white block in the input.
  - Calculate the new start index: new_start_index = old_start_index + 3.
  - Calculate the new end index: new_end_index = new_start_index + block_length - 1.
  - Construct the output grid: Initialize an all-white grid of the same size, then place the original block (same color, same length) at the calculated new start and end indices.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Determine its color, starting index, and length.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output row by adding exactly 3 to the block's starting index from the input row.
4.  Copy the identified non-white block (preserving its color and length) into the output row, starting at the calculated target starting index.
5.  The resulting output row is the final transformation.
