*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (vectors).
    *   Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (magenta, green, or gray) surrounded by white pixels (0).
    *   The non-white block's color and length remain the same in the output.
    *   The position of the non-white block changes between the input and output.
    *   The block shifts horizontally to the right.
    *   The amount of shift appears related to the number of white pixels initially to the right of the block.
    *   In all output examples, there is exactly one white pixel to the right of the non-white block.

*   **Facts:**

      - find the start and end index of the non-white block

      - calculate the required shift: shift_amount = trailing_whites - 1
      - determine the new start index: new_start_index = old_start_index + shift_amount
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, starting position, and length.
    2.  Count the number of white pixels that appear consecutively to the *right* of this non-white block (trailing white pixels). Let this count be `N`.
    3.  Calculate the required rightward shift amount for the block: `Shift = N - 1`.
    4.  Construct the output row:
        *   Start with white pixels. The number of leading white pixels in the output will be the number of leading white pixels in the input plus the `Shift` amount.
        *   Append the original non-white block (same color, same length).
        *   Append exactly one white pixel.
        *   Ensure the total length of the output row matches the input row length (this should happen automatically if the steps above are followed correctly, given the observation that the shift results in exactly one trailing white pixel).

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels 
to the right such that exactly one white pixel remains to its right.

The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the single contiguous block of a non-white color in the input row.
2. Counting the number of white pixels immediately following this block (trailing whites).
3. Calculating the shift distance needed to leave exactly one trailing white pixel (shift = trailing_whites - 1).
4. Constructing the output row by placing the non-white block at its new shifted position, ensuring it's preceded by the appropriate number of leading white pixels and followed by exactly one white pixel. The overall grid size remains the same.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core elements: a 1D grid, a single non-white block, and a rightward shift transformation. However, the specific rule determining the shift amount was incorrectly deduced from only the first example. The assumption that the output must have exactly one trailing white pixel is contradicted by the second example, which has two. The code implemented this incorrect rule, leading to incorrect shift calculations for examples 2 and 3. Observing that the code produced the *input* as output suggests the calculated `shift_amount` was 0 in those cases, which indicates a flaw in the initial shift calculation logic (`shift = trailing_whites - 1`) when applied across all examples, as the actual shifts required were 3, 4, and 3 respectively according to that incorrect logic, none of which are 0.

Re-evaluating all examples reveals a consistent pattern: the non-white block is always shifted exactly 3 positions to the right, regardless of the number of leading or trailing white pixels in the input or output. The previous code failed because it tried to dynamically calculate the shift based on trailing zeros instead of applying this constant shift.

The strategy is to correct the understanding of the transformation rule to a simple, constant rightward shift of 3 positions and update the documentation and natural language program accordingly.

Ah, the numpy integer types (`int64`) are not directly serializable by the standard `json` library. I need to convert them to standard Python integers before printing.

My apologies, the `convert_numpy_types` function also needs to handle `np.bool_` if the comparisons result in numpy booleans, or I need to ensure the comparisons yield standard Python booleans. Let's adjust the conversion function.
