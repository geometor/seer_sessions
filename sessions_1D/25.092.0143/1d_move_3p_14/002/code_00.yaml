task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows (vectors)
grid_properties:
  - size_preserved: true # Input and Output grids have the same length
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1 per grid
    properties:
      - color: non-white (magenta(6), green(3), gray(5) in examples)
      - length: variable, preserved during transformation
      - start_index: variable, changes during transformation
      - end_index: variable, changes during transformation
background:
  color: white (0)
transformation:
  type: horizontal_shift
  target: non-white_block
  direction: right
  properties_preserved:
    - color
    - length
  rule: Shift the block rightwards so that exactly one white pixel remains to its right.
  determinant: The number of white pixels initially to the right of the block determines the shift amount.
  calculation: shift_amount = (number_of_trailing_white_pixels) - 1
output_constraints:
  - block is followed by exactly one white pixel.
  - block does not wrap around.
  - grid size is maintained.
relationship:
  - input_block_color == output_block_color
  - input_block_length == output_block_length
  - output_block_start_index == input_block_start_index + shift_amount
  - output_block_end_index == input_block_end_index + shift_amount
  - output_grid[output_block_end_index + 1] == 0 # The single trailing white pixel
  - output_grid[output_block_end_index + 2:] must not exist or be empty (ensures only *one* trailing white)
