"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by identifying a single contiguous horizontal block 
of non-white pixels and shifting this block 3 positions to the right. 
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. Pixels outside the 
shifted block, including those vacated by the shift, are set to the background 
color, white (0). The block's color and length are preserved. If the shift 
causes the block to extend beyond the grid's right boundary, the block is 
truncated. Assumes the input contains exactly one such non-white block against 
a white background.
