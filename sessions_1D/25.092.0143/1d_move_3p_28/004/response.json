The errors reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") indicate an implementation issue within the Python code, likely related to how boolean conditions are checked on NumPy arrays or lists, rather than a misunderstanding of the transformation rule itself. The strategy is to maintain the core understanding of the transformation while ensuring the implementation handles array/list conditions correctly.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Input Grid: 1x29\n        *   Non-white Block: Magenta (6), Start Index: 7, Length: 9\n        *   Output Grid: 1x29\n        *   Shifted Block: Magenta (6), Start Index: 10 (7+3), Length: 9\n        *   Code Result: Error (Ambiguous truth value)\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Input Grid: 1x29\n        *   Non-white Block: Azure (8), Start Index: 0, Length: 25\n        *   Output Grid: 1x29\n        *   Shifted Block: Azure (8), Start Index: 3 (0+3), Length: 25\n        *   Code Result: Error (Ambiguous truth value)\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Input Grid: 1x29\n        *   Non-white Block: Orange (7), Start Index: 17, Length: 3\n        *   Output Grid: 1x29\n        *   Shifted Block: Orange (7), Start Index: 20 (17+3), Length: 3\n        *   Code Result: Error (Ambiguous truth value)\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "

Identify the single contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels within this row. Record its color, starting index, and length.\n    3.  Create a new row of the same length as the input row, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n    4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the new row by adding 3 to its original starting index.\n    5.  Determine the range of indices in the new row where the block should be placed, considering the row's boundaries. The placement starts at the target starting index (or index 0 if the target index is negative, though unlikely here) and ends after the block's length, but cannot exceed the row's right boundary (index `width - 1`).\n    6.  Copy the pixels of the identified non-white block (using its recorded color) into the calculated range within the new row.\n    7.  Package the new row into a grid structure (a list containing the single row list). This is the output grid."
