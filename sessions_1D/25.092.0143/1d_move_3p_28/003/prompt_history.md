*   **Perception of Task Elements**:
    *   The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or single-row grids).
    *   Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (magenta, azure, orange) surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
    *   The output grid contains the same block of non-white color, but its position is shifted horizontally.
    *   The size of the grid and the size of the non-white block remain unchanged between input and output.
    *   In all examples, the shift is consistently 3 positions to the right.
    *   The pixels vacated by the shift on the left become white (0).

**General Assessment**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a single, contiguous block of non-white pixels three positions to the right within a 1D array (represented as a 1xN grid), filling the background with white (0). The provided code implements this logic.

However, the code failed execution on all training examples, producing a `TypeError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in Python when a boolean check (like in an `if` statement) receives a NumPy array of booleans instead of a single boolean value. Despite manual tracing suggesting the code logic is sound for the provided examples, the error indicates a failure during execution.

This discrepancy could arise from:
1.  An unexpected interaction between the code and the execution environment (e.g., how data types are handled).
2.  An edge case or variation not present in the examples, for which the current logic is insufficient.
3.  A subtle flaw in the NumPy operations or conditional checks that wasn't apparent in manual tracing.

Given the error occurred consistently, the strategy is to:
1.  Verify the initial perceptions using code execution to gather precise metrics about the examples.
2.  Confirm the consistency of the "shift by 3" rule across all examples.
3.  Refine the Facts YAML and Natural Language Program based on these metrics.
4.  Acknowledge the execution error but maintain the core logic derived from the examples, as the error's specific cause within the code isn't immediately obvious from the trace. The next coding phase will need to address this specific NumPy error, possibly by ensuring all conditional checks operate on scalar booleans.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Assume the input is a 1xN grid containing exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color against a white (0) background.
2.  Identify the non-white block: determine its color, starting column index, and length.
3.  Create a new 1xN grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized entirely with the white (0) background color.
4.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the new grid by adding 3 to the original starting index.
5.  Copy the identified non-white block (with its original color and length) into the new grid, starting at the calculated target index. Ensure that the copying respects the grid boundaries (i.e., do not write past the last column).
6.  The resulting grid is the output.
