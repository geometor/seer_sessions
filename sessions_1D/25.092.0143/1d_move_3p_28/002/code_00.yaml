task_type: array_manipulation
dimensionality: 1D # Presented as 1xN grids
grid_properties:
  size_preserved: true # All examples show input/output grids of size (1, 29)
  background_color: white (0) # Assumed based on examples
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white (magenta: 6, azure: 8, orange: 7 in examples)
    count: 1 per grid # Consistently observed
    properties:
      - size_preserved: true # Length is preserved across transformation
      - color_preserved: true # Color is preserved across transformation
      - location: variable (starts at index 7, 0, 17 in examples)
      - length: variable (9, 25, 3 in examples)
actions:
  - action_type: horizontal_shift
    target_object: the single non-white contiguous_block
    direction: right
    magnitude: 3 positions # Consistently observed shift = output_start - input_start
    constraints:
      - Grid boundaries are respected; if the shifted block exceeds the right boundary, it is truncated.
    effects:
      - The block appears at the new shifted position.
      - Pixels to the left of the new block position, including those vacated by the shift, are set to the background color (white).
relationships:
  - The non-white block is the only non-background element.
  - The transformation depends solely on the identification and relocation of this block.
consistency_checks: # Based on metric analysis
  - Grid dimensions are preserved across all examples.
  - Block length is preserved across all examples.
  - Block color is preserved across all examples.
  - Shift magnitude is consistently +3 across all examples.
uncertainties:
  - Behavior with multiple non-white blocks is undefined by examples.
  - Behavior if background color is not white (0) is undefined by examples.
  - Behavior with 2D grids (more than one row) is undefined by examples.
  - Cause of the execution error ("ambiguous truth value") in the previous code attempt is not fully explained by the examples alone, but the logic appears sound according to metrics.
