task_type: array_manipulation
dimensionality: 1D # Confirmed single row
grid_properties:
  height: 1
  width: 29 # Consistent across examples
  size_preserved: true
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white (magenta, azure, orange in examples)
    count: 1 per grid
    properties:
      - length_preserved: true
      - color_preserved: true
      - location: defined by start_index
  - object_type: background
    color: white (0)
actions:
  - action_type: horizontal_shift
    target_object: non-white contiguous_block
    direction: right
    magnitude: 3 positions
    constraints:
      - Block is truncated if shifted beyond the right grid boundary.
    effect:
      - Original block location filled with background color (white).
      - New block location filled with block color.
relationships:
  - The non-white block exists within a white background.
  - The output block's start position is exactly 3 greater than the input block's start position.
