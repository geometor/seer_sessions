## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels three positions to the right within a 1D array (single row). However, it failed on all examples with a `list index out of range` error. This suggests the error might not be in the logical algorithm (shifting right by 3) but potentially in:

1.  **Input Handling:** How the `input_grid` (expected as `list[list[int]]`) is accessed or processed. The code assumes `input_grid[0]` exists and is the row.
2.  **Edge Cases:** An unexpected edge case in block detection or index calculation, although tracing Example 1 didn't reveal an obvious flaw.
3.  **Test Harness:** An issue in how the test environment passes the data to the `transform` function, possibly not conforming to the expected `list[list[int]]` format.

Given the consistency of the error across different inputs, we should first verify the assumed structure (1xN grid) and the parameters (block position, length, shift amount) for all examples.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the dimensions and block properties for each training example.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_data, output_data):
    input_grid = np.array(input_data)
    output_grid = np.array(output_data)

    h_in, w_in = input_grid.shape
    h_out, w_out = output_grid.shape

    input_row = input_grid[0]
    output_row = output_grid[0]

    # Find input block
    in_start, in_len, in_color = -1, 0, 0
    for i, pixel in enumerate(input_row):
        if pixel != 0:
            if in_start == -1:
                in_start = i
                in_color = pixel
            in_len += 1
        elif in_start != -1: # End of block
            break
            
    # Find output block
    out_start, out_len, out_color = -1, 0, 0
    for i, pixel in enumerate(output_row):
        if pixel != 0:
            if out_start == -1:
                out_start = i
                out_color = pixel
            out_len += 1
        elif out_start != -1: # End of block
            break

    shift = out_start - in_start if in_start != -1 and out_start != -1 else None

    return {
        "input_shape": (h_in, w_in),
        "output_shape": (h_out, w_out),
        "input_block": {"start": in_start, "length": in_len, "color": in_color},
        "output_block": {"start": out_start, "length": out_len, "color": out_color},
        "shift_amount": shift
    }

examples = [
    {
        "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    }
]

results = [analyze_example(ex["input"], ex["output"]) for ex in examples]
print(results)
```
```
[{'input_shape': (1, 29), 'output_shape': (1, 29), 'input_block': {'start': 7, 'length': 9, 'color': np.int64(6)}, 'output_block': {'start': 10, 'length': 9, 'color': np.int64(6)}, 'shift_amount': 3}, {'input_shape': (1, 29), 'output_shape': (1, 29), 'input_block': {'start': 0, 'length': 25, 'color': np.int64(8)}, 'output_block': {'start': 3, 'length': 25, 'color': np.int64(8)}, 'shift_amount': 3}, {'input_shape': (1, 29), 'output_shape': (1, 29), 'input_block': {'start': 17, 'length': 3, 'color': np.int64(7)}, 'output_block': {'start': 20, 'length': 3, 'color': np.int64(7)}, 'shift_amount': 3}]

```
The metrics confirm:

*   All examples use 1x29 grids for both input and output.
*   Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color.
*   The block's color and length are preserved in the output.
*   The block's starting position is consistently shifted exactly 3 positions to the right.

This confirms the core logic of the previous code was correct for the observed transformation. The `list index out of range` error likely stems from an unexpected interaction within the test environment or a subtle bug missed in the code analysis, possibly related to list slicing or indexing details, rather than a misunderstanding of the task itself. The code logic appears robust for the confirmed 1D shift operation.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Assume the input is a single-row grid (a list containing one list of integers).
2.  Identify the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels within the row. Record its color, starting index, and length. Handle the case where no non-white block exists (e.g., an all-white row).
3.  Determine the width of the row.
4.  Create a new row of the same width, initialized entirely with the background color, white (0).
5.  If a non-white block was found in the input:
    a.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the new row by adding 3 to the original starting index.
    b.  Determine the actual range of indices where the block will be placed in the new row. The placement starts at the target starting index (but not less than index 0) and extends for the block's original length, but stops at the row's width boundary.
    c.  Fill the pixels within this calculated range in the new row with the block's color.
6.  Package the new row into a list to match the required grid output format (list of lists). This is the final output grid.
