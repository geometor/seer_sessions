*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels.
    *   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels.
    *   The non-white blocks have different colors (red, gray) and lengths across the examples.
    *   In the output, the non-white block has been shifted horizontally to the right.
    *   The amount of shift appears consistent across all examples. In train\_1, the red block (2 2 2) starts at index 11 and moves to start at index 14 (shift of 3). In train\_2, the gray block starts at index 4 and moves to start at index 7 (shift of 3). In train\_3, the gray block starts at index 1 and moves to start at index 4 (shift of 3).
    *   The size of the grid remains the same.
    *   The color and length of the non-white block remain unchanged.
    *   The positions previously occupied by the block become white (0) in the output, and the block overwrites the white pixels at its new location.

Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: error:
name '__file__' is not defined
*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue was a runtime error (`name '__file__' is not defined`) caused by an unnecessary attempt to dynamically locate a utility module (`grid_utils`). This module and its import are not required because the necessary logic (`find_non_white_block`) was already implemented within the provided script. The core transformation logic (identifying a single non-white block and shifting it right by 3 positions) appears correct based on the initial analysis and holds true for all provided training examples. The strategy is to remove the problematic import and path manipulation, then re-verify the logic against the examples.

*   **Metrics:**
    I will verify the starting index, length, and calculated shift for the non-white block in each training example.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
    2.  Locate the unique contiguous block (sequence) of non-white pixels within the row. Determine its color, its starting index (position), and its length.
    3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (1 row, same width), initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index found in step 2.
    5.  Copy the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the newly calculated index from step 4. Ensure the block does not extend beyond the grid boundaries (though this case is not observed in the examples).
