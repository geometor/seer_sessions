In train\\_1, the red block (2 2 2) starts at index 11 and moves to start at index 14 (shift of 3). In train\\_2, the gray block starts at index 4 and moves to start at index 7 (shift of 3). In train\\_3, the gray block starts at index 1 and moves to start at index 4 (shift of 3).\n    *   The size of the grid remains the same.\n    *   The color and length of the non-white block remain unchanged.\n    *   The positions previously occupied by the block become white (0) in the output, and the block overwrites the white pixels at its new location.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
