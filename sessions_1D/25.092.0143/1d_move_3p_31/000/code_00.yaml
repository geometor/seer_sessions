task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 25]
  output: [1, 25]
objects:
  - type: segment
    properties:
      contiguity: horizontal
      color: non-white (variable: red, magenta, green)
      background_color: white (0)
  - type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
relationships:
  - The non-white segment is surrounded by the white background.
actions:
  - identify: Find the start index, end index, and color of the non-white segment in the input grid.
  - shift: Move the identified non-white segment 3 positions horizontally to the right.
  - reconstruct: Create the output grid by placing the shifted segment and filling the remaining positions with the white background color.
constraints:
  - Only one non-white segment exists per input grid.
  - The grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The color and length of the non-white segment remain constant.
  - The shift amount is always 3 positions to the right.
