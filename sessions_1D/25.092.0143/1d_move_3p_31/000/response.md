Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 1-dimensional grids (rows) of size 1x25.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) and one other color per example: red (2), magenta (6), or green (3).
3.  **Input Pattern:** Each input grid contains a single, contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color. The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.
4.  **Output Pattern:** Each output grid also contains a single, contiguous horizontal segment of the same non-white color and length as the input. The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels. The total number of white and non-white pixels remains the same between input and output.
5.  **Transformation:** The non-white segment in the output grid is shifted 3 positions to the right compared to its position in the input grid. The white pixels fill the remaining space.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 25]
  output: [1, 25]
objects:
  - type: segment
    properties:
      contiguity: horizontal
      color: non-white (variable: red, magenta, green)
      background_color: white (0)
  - type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
relationships:
  - The non-white segment is surrounded by the white background.
actions:
  - identify: Find the start index, end index, and color of the non-white segment in the input grid.
  - shift: Move the identified non-white segment 3 positions horizontally to the right.
  - reconstruct: Create the output grid by placing the shifted segment and filling the remaining positions with the white background color.
constraints:
  - Only one non-white segment exists per input grid.
  - The grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The color and length of the non-white segment remain constant.
  - The shift amount is always 3 positions to the right.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a 1x25 grid filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid (1x25 row) to find the first occurrence of a non-white pixel. Record its column index (start\_index) and its color (segment\_color).
3.  Continue iterating from the start\_index to find the end of the contiguous segment of segment\_color. Record the length of this segment (segment\_length).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the segment in the output grid by adding 3 to the original start\_index (new\_start\_index = start\_index + 3).
5.  Place the segment of segment\_color with segment\_length into the output grid, starting at the new\_start\_index.
