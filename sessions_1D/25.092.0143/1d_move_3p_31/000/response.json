The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** Each output grid also contains a single, contiguous horizontal segment of the same non-white color and length as the input. The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels. The total number of white and non-white pixels remains the same between input and output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The non-white segment in the output grid is shifted 3 positions to the right compared to its position in the input grid. The white pixels fill the remaining space.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the input grid (1x25 row) to find the first occurrence of a non-white pixel. Record its column index (start\\_index) and its color (segment\\_color).\n3.  Continue iterating from the start\\_index to find the end of the contiguous segment of segment\\_color. Record the length of this segment (segment\\_length).\n4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the segment in the output grid by adding 3 to the original start\\_index (new\\_start\\_index = start\\_index + 3).\n5.  Place the segment of segment\\_color with segment\\_length into the output grid, starting at the new\\_start\\_index."
