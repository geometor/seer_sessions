Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (yellow, orange, or gray in the examples) surrounded by white pixels. The output grid is the same size as the input grid. The transformation involves moving the colored block horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. In all three examples, the colored block is shifted exactly 3 positions to the right. The color and length of the block remain unchanged. The surrounding pixels remain white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n"
