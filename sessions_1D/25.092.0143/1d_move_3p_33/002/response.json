            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe core issue stems from an incorrect assumption about the input data structure. While the visual representation shows a single row, the ARC framework typically represents grids as 2D arrays (lists of lists), even if they only have one row. The error `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` occurs because the code attempts operations (like `np.zeros_like` or direct comparison) assuming a 1D array when it receives a 2D array (e.g., `[[0, 0, ...]]`).\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the logic to explicitly handle 2D input grids that contain a single row. This involves:\n1.  Accessing the first (and only) row of the input grid.\n2.  Applying the block identification and shifting logic to this row.\n3.  Constructing the output as a 2D grid containing the transformed row.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the structure of the input data using the first training example.\n"

Copy the identified non-white block (preserving its color and length) into the new row, starting at the calculated target column index. Handle potential boundary conditions where the shifted block might extend beyond the grid dimensions (though not observed in examples, it's good practice).\n7.
