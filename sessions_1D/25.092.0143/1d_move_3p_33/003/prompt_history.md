## Perception

The input and output are both single rows (1D grids) composed of pixels.
Each input row contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (e.g., red '2' or magenta '6') surrounded by white pixels ('0').
The output row contains the exact same block of non-white pixels (same color, same length) as the input, but its position is shifted horizontally to the right.
The surrounding pixels remain white.
By comparing the starting positions of the non-white block in the input and output across all examples, the shift amount is consistently 3 positions to the right.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, length, and starting position.
2.  Create an output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels (0).
3.  Place the identified block of non-white pixels into the output row, starting 3 positions to the right of its original starting position in the input row. Ensure the color and length of the block are preserved.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The core issue stems from an incorrect assumption about the input data structure. While the visual representation shows a single row, the ARC framework typically represents grids as 2D arrays (lists of lists), even if they only have one row. The error `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` occurs because the code attempts operations (like `np.zeros_like` or direct comparison) assuming a 1D array when it receives a 2D array (e.g., `[[0, 0, ...]]`).

The strategy is to adapt the logic to explicitly handle 2D input grids that contain a single row. This involves:
1.  Accessing the first (and only) row of the input grid.
2.  Applying the block identification and shifting logic to this row.
3.  Constructing the output as a 2D grid containing the transformed row.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the structure of the input data using the first training example.


*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Example train_1 input
input_1 = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

# Check type and shape
input_type = type(input_1)
input_np = np.array(input_1)
input_shape = input_np.shape
input_ndim = input_np.ndim

print(f"{input_type=}")
print(f"{input_shape=}")
print(f"{input_ndim=}")

# Check structure of other inputs
input_2 = [[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
input_3 = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

input_2_np = np.array(input_2)
input_3_np = np.array(input_3)

print(f"Input 2 shape: {input_2_np.shape}")
print(f"Input 3 shape: {input_3_np.shape}")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
input_type=<class 'list'>
input_shape=(1, 18)
input_ndim=2
Input 2 shape: (1, 18)
Input 3 shape: (1, 18)

```
The code execution confirms that the inputs are provided as 2D lists (lists containing one list), which become 2D NumPy arrays with a shape of (1, N) where N is the number of columns. This confirms the source of the error in the previous code, which assumed 1D input.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a 2D grid (list of lists) which is guaranteed to have exactly one row.
2.  Extract the single row from the input grid.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within this row. Determine its color, length, and starting column index.
4.  Create a new row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
5.  Calculate the target starting column index for the non-white block in the new row by adding 3 to its original starting column index.
6.  Copy the identified non-white block (preserving its color and length) into the new row, starting at the calculated target column index. Handle potential boundary conditions where the shifted block might extend beyond the grid dimensions (though not observed in examples, it's good practice).
7.  Construct the final output grid as a 2D grid (list of lists) containing only the newly created row.
