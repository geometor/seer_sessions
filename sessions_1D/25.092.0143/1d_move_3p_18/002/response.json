            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels three positions to the right within a single row. However, the Python code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D list, while ARC grids are represented as lists of lists (2D arrays), even if they only have one row (e.g., `[[0, 0, 7, 7, 0]]`). The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" confirms that NumPy operations were attempted on incompatible array dimensions, likely when processing the input grid as if it were 1D when it was actually 2D (1xN).\n\n    The strategy for resolving this is to modify the code to explicitly handle the 2D input format by extracting the single row before applying the transformation logic. The output should also be formatted as a 2D list (list containing the single transformed row).\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Let's examine the structure of the first training example's input and output.\n    "
