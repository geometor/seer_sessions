*   **Perception:** The input is always a single row (a 1D grid). Each row contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output is also a single row of the same length. The block of non-white pixels appears to be shifted horizontally to the right by a fixed amount in the output compared to the input. The surrounding white pixels are adjusted accordingly.

*   **Facts:**

    task_type: object_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D
    input_elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        quantity: variable
      - type: object
        description: A single contiguous block of identical non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - color: variable (non-white)
          - length: variable
          - position: variable (start_index)
    output_elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        quantity: variable
      - type: object
        description: The same object from the input.
        properties:
          - color: same as input object
          - length: same as input object
          - position: shifted horizontally from input position
    transformation:
      - action: identify_object
        target: the contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - action: calculate_shift
        details: The shift amount is constant across examples.
        value: 3 positions to the right
      - action: apply_shift
        target: the identified object
        direction: right
        amount: 3
      - action: reconstruct_grid
        details: Place the shifted object in a new grid of the same dimensions, filling remaining cells with the background color (white).
    relationships:
      - The non-white block in the output is identical in color and length to the block in the input.
      - The starting position of the block in the output is always 3 positions greater (to the right) than its starting position in the input.
      - The total length of the row remains unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within the input row.
    2.  Note the color, length, and starting column index of this block.
    3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels (0).
    4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
    5.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new index.
