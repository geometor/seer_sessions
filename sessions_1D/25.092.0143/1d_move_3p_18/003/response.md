```python
"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by identifying a single contiguous horizontal block 
of a non-white color within the row, shifting this block 3 positions to the 
right, and placing it into an output grid of the same dimensions. The rest of 
the output grid is filled with the background color (white, 0). If the shift 
causes the block to extend beyond the grid boundary, the block is truncated.
