Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The transformation involves shifting this colored block exactly 3 positions to the right within the grid, while maintaining the grid's dimensions and the surrounding white pixels. The specific color and length of the block can vary between examples.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
