**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output data are presented as one-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers representing colors. Each example features a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red, orange, or gray) surrounded by white pixels (0). The core transformation observed across all examples is a spatial shift of this colored block. The length of the array and the color/length of the block remain unchanged; only its position within the array is altered. Specifically, the colored block moves three positions to the right. The white pixels effectively flow around the shifted block, maintaining the overall array length.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: 1-dimensional array (or 1xN grid)
  Format: Integers representing colors (0-9)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous_Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (varies per example: red(2), orange(7), gray(5))
      - Shape: Linear segment
      - Count: 1 per grid
    Relationship_to_Background: Surrounded by white pixels

Transformation:
  Action: Spatial_Shift
  Target: Contiguous_Block (non-white)
  Direction: Right
  Magnitude: 3 positions
  Effect_on_Background: White pixels fill the vacated space on the left and are displaced on the right, maintaining array length.
  Invariants:

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input array.
2.  Determine the starting and ending indices of this block.
3.  Create a new array of the same length as the input, initialized with white pixels (0).
4.  Copy the identified non-white block into the new array, shifting its starting position 3 indices to the right compared to its position in the input array.
5.  The resulting array is the output.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: list index out of range

## Example 2:
Error: list index out of range

## Example 3:
Error: list index out of range
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying a single contiguous block of non-background color in a 1xN grid and shifting it 3 positions to the right. The code failed with a "list index out of range" error on all training examples.

The error indicates an attempt to access an invalid index in a list. Given the logic (identifying a block and shifting it), this most likely occurred either during the block identification phase (`find_non_white_block`) or, more probably, during the creation of the output array when placing the shifted block (`output_row[new_position_index] = ...`). Although the code includes a check (`if 0 <= new_position_index < grid_length`) to prevent writing out of bounds in the `output_row`, the error might have originated elsewhere, perhaps in accessing the `input_row` if the indices derived (`start_index`, `end_index`) were somehow incorrect, or if the input format was misinterpreted.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the input and output structures precisely using `tool_code`.
2.  Confirm the transformation rule (shift right by 3) holds for all examples.
3.  Pinpoint the exact cause of the "list index out of range" error by carefully re-evaluating the indexing logic in the context of the confirmed grid structures.
4.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts based on these verified details.

```
**Analysis of Metrics and Errors:**

The metrics confirm the initial observations:
*   All grids are 1x26.
*   Each input has a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red, orange, gray).
*   The block's color and length remain unchanged in the output.
*   The block's starting position consistently shifts exactly 3 indices to the right.

Given that the core logic (shift right by 3) is validated and the code includes bounds checking for the output write operation, the "list index out of range" error is puzzling if the code executed was exactly as shown previously. Potential causes for the error in the execution environment (which we cannot directly inspect) might include:
1.  **Input Misinterpretation:** Although the code explicitly handles `input_grid[0]`, perhaps the test harness passed the data in an unexpected format that caused an error *before* the main logic started or during the `find_non_white_block` helper function if it received malformed input.
2.  **Helper Function Bug:** An edge case in `find_non_white_block` might have returned incorrect start/end indices under certain conditions not present in a simple simulation (though unlikely given these examples).
3.  **Indexing Error Despite Check:** While the `if 0 <= new_position_index < grid_length:` check looks correct for the *write* operation `output_row[new_position_index] = ...`, perhaps the error occurred on the *read* operation `... = input_row[original_block_index]`? This seems unlikely as `original_block_index` iterates from `start_index` to `end_index`, which should be valid indices within `input_row` based on how they were found.

Without the exact traceback, we proceed assuming the core transformation logic is correct (shift right by 3) and focus on ensuring the implementation is robust, particularly around indexing. The previous code seems logically sound for the identified transformation. The error might stem from environmental factors or a subtle implementation detail missed in review.

**YAML Facts:**

Data:
  Type: Grid (2D array)
  Format: Integers representing colors (0-9)
  Dimensions: Always 1x26 in training examples
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:

    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (red(2), orange(7), gray(5) observed)
      - Shape: Horizontal linear segment
      - Count: 1 per grid
      - Length: Varies (12, 18, 16 observed)
      - Location: Contained within the single row
    Relationship_to_Background: Surrounded by white pixels horizontally

Transformation:
  Action: Horizontal_Shift
  Target: Contiguous_Block (non-white)
  Direction: Right
  Magnitude: 3 positions (pixels/indices)
  Effect_on_Background: White pixels fill the 3 vacated positions to the left of the block's original start, and the block overwrites the 3 white pixels to the right of its original end.
  Invariants:
    - Grid dimensions (1x26)
    - Block color
    - Block length
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row.
2.  Identify the contiguous segment (block) of non-white pixels within this row. Determine its starting index, ending index, and color.
3.  Record the length of the input row.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length, initialized entirely with white pixels (0).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
6.  Iterate from the original starting index to the original ending index of the block found in the input row. For each position `i` in this range:
    a.  Calculate the corresponding target position `j` in the output row by adding 3 to `i` (i.e., `j = i + 3`).
    b.  Copy the pixel value from the input row at index `i` to the output row at index `j`. (Ensure `j` remains within the bounds of the row length, though the examples suggest it always will).
7.  Package the completed output row into a grid format (a list containing the single output row).
8.  Return the output grid.
