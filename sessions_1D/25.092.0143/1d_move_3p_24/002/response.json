            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying a single contiguous block of non-background color in a 1xN grid and shifting it 3 positions to the right. The code failed with a \"list index out of range\" error on all training examples.\n\nThe error indicates an attempt to access an invalid index in a list. Given the logic (identifying a block and shifting it), this most likely occurred either during the block identification phase (`find_non_white_block`) or, more probably, during the creation of the output array when placing the shifted block (`output_row[new_position_index] = ...`). Although the code includes a check (`if 0 <= new_position_index < grid_length`) to prevent writing out of bounds in the `output_row`, the error might have originated elsewhere, perhaps in accessing the `input_row` if the indices derived (`start_index`, `end_index`) were somehow incorrect, or if the input format was misinterpreted.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the input and output structures precisely using `tool_code`.\n2.  Confirm the transformation rule (shift right by 3) holds for all examples.\n3.  Pinpoint the exact cause of the \"list index out of range\" error by carefully re-evaluating the indexing logic in the context of the confirmed grid structures.\n4.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts based on these verified details.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and content of each training example."

Potential causes for the error in the execution environment (which we cannot directly inspect) might include:\n1.  **Input Misinterpretation:** Although the code explicitly handles `input_grid[0]`, perhaps the test harness passed the data in an unexpected format that caused an error *before* the main logic started or during the `find_non_white_block` helper function if it received malformed input.\n2.  **Helper Function Bug:** An edge case in `find_non_white_block` might have returned incorrect start/end indices under certain conditions not present in a simple simulation (though unlikely given these examples).\n3.  **Indexing Error Despite Check:** While the `if 0 <= new_position_index < grid_length:` check looks correct for the *write* operation `output_row[new_position_index] = ...`, perhaps the error occurred on the *read* operation `... = input_row[original_block_index]`? This seems unlikely as `original_block_index` iterates from `start_index` to `end_index`, which should be valid indices within `input_row` based on how they were found.\n\nWithout the exact traceback, we proceed assuming the core transformation logic is correct (shift right by 3) and focus on ensuring the implementation is robust, particularly around indexing. The previous code seems logically sound for the identified transformation. The error might stem from environmental factors or a subtle implementation detail missed in review.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
