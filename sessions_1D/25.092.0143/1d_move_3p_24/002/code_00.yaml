Data:
  Type: Grid (2D array)
  Format: Integers representing colors (0-9)
  Dimensions: Always 1x26 in training examples
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous_Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (red(2), orange(7), gray(5) observed)
      - Shape: Horizontal linear segment
      - Count: 1 per grid
      - Length: Varies (12, 18, 16 observed)
      - Location: Contained within the single row
    Relationship_to_Background: Surrounded by white pixels horizontally

Transformation:
  Action: Horizontal_Shift
  Target: Contiguous_Block (non-white)
  Direction: Right
  Magnitude: 3 positions (pixels/indices)
  Effect_on_Background: White pixels fill the 3 vacated positions to the left of the block's original start, and the block overwrites the 3 white pixels to the right of its original end.
  Invariants:
    - Grid dimensions (1x26)
    - Block color
    - Block length
