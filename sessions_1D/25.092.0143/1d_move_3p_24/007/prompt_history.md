**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output data are presented as one-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers representing colors. Each example features a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red, orange, or gray) surrounded by white pixels (0). The core transformation observed across all examples is a spatial shift of this colored block. The length of the array and the color/length of the block remain unchanged; only its position within the array is altered. Specifically, the colored block moves three positions to the right. The white pixels effectively flow around the shifted block, maintaining the overall array length.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: 1-dimensional array (or 1xN grid)
  Format: Integers representing colors (0-9)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous_Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (varies per example: red(2), orange(7), gray(5))
      - Shape: Linear segment
      - Count: 1 per grid
    Relationship_to_Background: Surrounded by white pixels

Transformation:
  Action: Spatial_Shift
  Target: Contiguous_Block (non-white)
  Direction: Right
  Magnitude: 3 positions
  Effect_on_Background: White pixels fill the vacated space on the left and are displaced on the right, maintaining array length.
  Invariants:
    - Grid dimensions (length)
    - Color of the block
    - Length of the block
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input array.
2.  Determine the starting and ending indices of this block.
3.  Create a new array of the same length as the input, initialized with white pixels (0).
4.  Copy the identified non-white block into the new array, shifting its starting position 3 indices to the right compared to its position in the input array.
5.  The resulting array is the output.

**Assessment of Information and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation as a spatial shift of a contiguous block of non-white pixels within a background of white pixels. However, the provided code (`code_00.py`) incorrectly interpreted the 1xN input arrays as Nx1 column vectors and attempted a *vertical* shift downwards instead of the required *horizontal* shift to the right.

The execution results confirm this misinterpretation: the transformed output is identical to the input in all training examples. This indicates that the `find_vertical_block` function (designed for columns) failed to find the horizontal block, causing the `transform` function to return an unchanged copy of the input grid.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correctly treat the input as a 1xN grid (a single row).
2.  Implement logic to find the start and end indices of the *horizontal* non-white block within this row.
3.  Implement the horizontal shift of this block 3 positions to the right, ensuring pixels shifted off the right edge are discarded and vacated positions on the left are filled with the background color.
4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this corrected understanding.

**Metric Analysis Summary:**

The analysis confirms:
*   All grids are 1x26 (1 row, 26 columns).
*   Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red=2, orange=7, gray=5).
*   The block length varies between examples (12, 18, 16 pixels).
*   In every example, the block's starting position shifts exactly **3 positions to the right** in the output compared to the input.
*   The block color and length remain unchanged.
*   The overall grid dimensions remain unchanged.

**Updated YAML Facts**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Grid (List of Lists)
  Format: Integers representing colors (0-9)
  Dimensions: 1xN (Specifically 1x26 in training examples)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous_Horizontal_Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (varies: red(2), orange(7), gray(5))
      - Shape: Horizontal line segment
      - Location: Within the single row
      - Count: 1 per grid
    Relationship_to_Background: Surrounded by white pixels (0) horizontally within the row.

Transformation:
  Action: Horizontal_Shift
  Target: Contiguous_Horizontal_Block (non-white)
  Direction: Right
  Magnitude: 3 positions (indices)
  Effect_on_Background: White pixels (0) fill the 3 vacated positions on the left of the block's original start. Pixels maintain their relative order within the block.
  Invariants:
    - Grid dimensions (1xN)
    - Color of the block
    - Length of the block
```


**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept a 1xN input grid (a list containing a single list representing the row).
2.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within the row. Determine its color, starting index, and ending index.
3.  If no non-white block is found, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 3 to the original starting index.
6.  Iterate from the original start index to the original end index of the block in the input row. For each pixel within this range:
    a.  Calculate the corresponding target index in the output row by adding 3 to the current pixel's index.
    b.  If the target index is within the bounds of the output row's length, copy the pixel value from the input row (at the current index) to the output row (at the target index).
7.  Wrap the completed output row in a list to form the 1xN output grid.
8.  Return the output grid.
