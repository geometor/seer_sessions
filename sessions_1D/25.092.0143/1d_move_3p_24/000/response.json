Each example features a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red, orange, or gray) surrounded by white pixels (0). The core transformation observed across all examples is a spatial shift of this colored block. The length of the array and the color/length of the block remain unchanged; only its position within the array is altered. Specifically, the colored block moves three positions to the right. The white pixels effectively flow around the shifted block, maintaining the overall array length.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
