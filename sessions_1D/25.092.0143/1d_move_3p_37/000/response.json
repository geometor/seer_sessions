Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels embedded within a background of white (0) pixels. The color and length of the non-white block vary across examples (green, magenta, blue; length 4 or 5). The transformation involves shifting this entire non-white block horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. The area where the block was originally located becomes white, and the rest of the background remains white. By comparing the start index of the block in the input and output across all examples, the shift distance appears to be consistently 3 positions to the right.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
