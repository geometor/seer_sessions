task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-white pixels 3 positions to the right within a 1D grid."
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: "1x9" # Observed in all examples
  - background_color: "white (0)"
objects:
  - id: "block"
    definition: "A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels."
    properties:
      color: "Variable (non-white)"
      length: "Variable"
      position:
        start_index: "Index of the first non-white pixel."
        end_index: "Index of the last non-white pixel."
actions:
  - name: "Identify Block"
    inputs: "Input grid"
    outputs: "The block object (pixels and indices)"
    description: "Find the start and end indices of the contiguous non-white pixel block."
  - name: "Shift Right"
    target: "block"
    parameters:
      distance: 3
      direction: "right"
    outputs: "A new grid with the block shifted."
    description: "Create a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color. Copy the identified block's pixels into the new grid, starting at 'start_index + 3'."
relationships:
  - type: "Containment"
    entity1: "Background (white pixels)"
    entity2: "block"
    description: "The non-white block is surrounded by or adjacent to white pixels."
  - type: "Transformation"
    input: "Input grid"
    output: "Output grid"
    rule: "The output grid is generated by taking the input grid, identifying the non-white block, and shifting it 3 positions to the right, replacing its original position with the background color."
