**Perception:**

The input and output are both single-row grids (1x9). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels embedded within a background of white (0) pixels. The color and length of the non-white block vary across examples (green, magenta, blue; length 4 or 5). The transformation involves shifting this entire non-white block horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. The area where the block was originally located becomes white, and the rest of the background remains white. By comparing the start index of the block in the input and output across all examples, the shift distance appears to be consistently 3 positions to the right.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Identify the background color, which is white (0).
3.  Find the sequence of contiguous non-white pixels (the "block"). Determine the starting index and ending index of this block in the input grid.
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output grid by adding 3 to the original starting index found in step 3.
6.  Copy the pixels corresponding to the block (from the original starting index to the original ending index) from the input grid into the output grid, placing them starting at the calculated new starting index.
7.  Return the newly created output grid.
