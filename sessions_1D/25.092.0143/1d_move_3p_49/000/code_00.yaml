  - description: Input and Output Grids
    properties:
      format: 1-dimensional array of integers (colors)
      background_color: white (0)
      content: Contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color.
  - description: Non-white Color Block (Object)
    properties:
      identity: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
      color: Varies between examples (orange=7, yellow=4, red=2).
      size: Length of the contiguous sequence, remains constant between input and output.
    relationships:
      location_input: Defined by the start and end indices in the input grid.
      location_output: Defined by the start and end indices in the output grid.
  - description: Transformation Action
    properties:
      type: Horizontal Shift
      direction: Right
      magnitude: 3 positions
    operates_on: The Non-white Color Block
    result: The block's start index increases by 3. The grid positions previously occupied by the start of the block, and the positions between the old start and new start, become white. The overall grid size remains constant.
