**Perception:**
The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (represented as a sequence of numbers). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (orange, yellow, or red in the examples) surrounded by white pixels (value 0). The output grid shows that this colored block has been moved horizontally. Specifically, in all provided examples, the colored block is shifted exactly 3 positions to the right. The size, shape (length), and color of the block remain unchanged. The rest of the grid remains filled with white pixels.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**
1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Note its color, starting position, and length.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Calculate the new starting position for the non-white block by adding 3 to its original starting position.
4.  Place the identified non-white block (with its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated new position.
5.  Return the modified grid as the output.

**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: shifting a single contiguous block of non-white pixels three positions to the right within a 1D row. However, the implementation failed because it assumed the input was a Python list (1D array), whereas the ARC framework likely provides inputs as 2D NumPy arrays, even if they only have one row (shape 1xN). The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that comparisons were being made on array slices instead of individual elements due to incorrect indexing or iteration over a 2D structure.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Verify that the inputs are indeed 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, width). The metrics gathered support this.
2.  **Adapt Logic for 2D:** Modify the `find_colored_block` and `transform` logic to work with 2D NumPy arrays, specifically accessing the single row (row 0) for processing.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the Facts YAML and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the 1xN 2D grid structure.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` to confirm the structure and properties of the input examples:

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   All input grids are consistently 2D arrays with shape (1, 29).
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color within the first (and only) row.
*   The background color is consistently white (0).
*   The transformation consistently involves shifting the block 3 columns to the right. (Example 1: start 6 -> 9; Example 2: start 1 -> 4; Example 3: start 10 -> 13).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N).
2.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels located in the first (index 0) row. Note its color, starting column index, and length.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same shape (1, N) as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the non-white block by adding 3 to its original starting column index.
5.  Copy the identified non-white block (with its original color and length) into the first row (index 0) of the output grid, starting at the calculated new column index.
6.  Return the modified 2D grid as the output.
