**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: shifting a single contiguous block of non-white pixels three positions to the right within a 1D row. However, the implementation failed because it assumed the input was a Python list (1D array), whereas the ARC framework likely provides inputs as 2D NumPy arrays, even if they only have one row (shape 1xN). The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that comparisons were being made on array slices instead of individual elements due to incorrect indexing or iteration over a 2D structure.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Verify that the inputs are indeed 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, width). The metrics gathered support this.
2.  **Adapt Logic for 2D:** Modify the `find_colored_block` and `transform` logic to work with 2D NumPy arrays, specifically accessing the single row (row 0) for processing.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the Facts YAML and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the 1xN 2D grid structure.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` to confirm the structure and properties of the input examples:


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid_list, name):
    grid = np.array(grid_list, dtype=int)
    print(f"--- {name} ---")
    print(f"Shape: {grid.shape}")
    
    if grid.shape[0] != 1:
        print("Grid is not 1xN. Analysis stopped.")
        return

    row = grid[0]
    start_index = -1
    end_index = -1
    color = -1
    
    # Find block
    for i, pixel in enumerate(row):
        if pixel != 0:
            start_index = i
            color = pixel
            break
            
    if start_index != -1:
        for i in range(start_index, len(row)):
            if row[i] == color:
                end_index = i + 1 # exclusive
            else:
                break
        print(f"Non-white Color: {color}")
        print(f"Block Start Index (col): {start_index}")
        print(f"Block End Index (col, exclusive): {end_index}")
        print(f"Block Length: {end_index - start_index}")
    else:
        print("No non-white block found.")

# Example Inputs (as 2D lists)
input1 = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
input2 = [[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
input3 = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

analyze_grid(input1, "Example 1 Input")
analyze_grid(input2, "Example 2 Input")
analyze_grid(input3, "Example 3 Input")
```
```
--- Example 1 Input ---
Shape: (1, 29)
Non-white Color: 7
Block Start Index (col): 6
Block End Index (col, exclusive): 15
Block Length: 9
--- Example 2 Input ---
Shape: (1, 29)
Non-white Color: 4
Block Start Index (col): 1
Block End Index (col, exclusive): 12
Block Length: 11
--- Example 3 Input ---
Shape: (1, 29)
Non-white Color: 2
Block Start Index (col): 10
Block End Index (col, exclusive): 18
Block Length: 8

```
**Observations from Metrics:**

*   All input grids are consistently 2D arrays with shape (1, 29).
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color within the first (and only) row.
*   The background color is consistently white (0).
*   The transformation consistently involves shifting the block 3 columns to the right. (Example 1: start 6 -> 9; Example 2: start 1 -> 4; Example 3: start 10 -> 13).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - description: Input and Output Grids
    properties:
      format: 2-dimensional NumPy array of integers (colors)
      shape: Always 1 row, variable number of columns (1xN)
      background_color: white (0)
      content: Contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color in the first row.
  - description: Non-white Color Block (Object)
    properties:
      identity: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels within the single row.
      location: Always resides entirely within row 0.
      color: Varies between examples (orange=7, yellow=4, red=2).
      size: Length (number of columns) of the contiguous sequence, remains constant between input and output.
    relationships:
      location_input: Defined by the start and end column indices in the input grid's row 0.
      location_output: Defined by the start and end column indices in the output grid's row 0.
  - description: Transformation Action
    properties:
      type: Horizontal Shift (within the single row)
      direction: Right
      magnitude: 3 columns
    operates_on: The Non-white Color Block
    result: The block's start column index increases by 3. The grid positions previously occupied by the start of the block, and the positions between the old start and new start, become white. The overall grid shape (1xN) remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N).
2.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels located in the first (index 0) row. Note its color, starting column index, and length.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same shape (1, N) as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the non-white block by adding 3 to its original starting column index.
5.  Copy the identified non-white block (with its original color and length) into the first row (index 0) of the output grid, starting at the calculated new column index.
6.  Return the modified 2D grid as the output.
