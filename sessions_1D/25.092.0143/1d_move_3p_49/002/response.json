            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: shifting a single contiguous block of non-white pixels three positions to the right within a 1D row. However, the implementation failed because it assumed the input was a Python list (1D array), whereas the ARC framework likely provides inputs as 2D NumPy arrays, even if they only have one row (shape 1xN). The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly indicates that comparisons were being made on array slices instead of individual elements due to incorrect indexing or iteration over a 2D structure.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Verify that the inputs are indeed 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, width). The metrics gathered support this.\n2.  **Adapt Logic for 2D:** Modify the `find_colored_block` and `transform` logic to work with 2D NumPy arrays, specifically accessing the single row (row 0) for processing.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the Facts YAML and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the 1xN 2D grid structure.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` to confirm the structure and properties of the input examples:\n\n"
