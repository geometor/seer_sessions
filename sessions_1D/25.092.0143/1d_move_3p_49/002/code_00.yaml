  - description: Input and Output Grids
    properties:
      format: 2-dimensional NumPy array of integers (colors)
      shape: Always 1 row, variable number of columns (1xN)
      background_color: white (0)
      content: Contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color in the first row.
  - description: Non-white Color Block (Object)
    properties:
      identity: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels within the single row.
      location: Always resides entirely within row 0.
      color: Varies between examples (orange=7, yellow=4, red=2).
      size: Length (number of columns) of the contiguous sequence, remains constant between input and output.
    relationships:
      location_input: Defined by the start and end column indices in the input grid's row 0.
      location_output: Defined by the start and end column indices in the output grid's row 0.
  - description: Transformation Action
    properties:
      type: Horizontal Shift (within the single row)
      direction: Right
      magnitude: 3 columns
    operates_on: The Non-white Color Block
    result: The block's start column index increases by 3. The grid positions previously occupied by the start of the block, and the positions between the old start and new start, become white. The overall grid shape (1xN) remains constant.
