Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional grid (a row vector) into another grid of the same dimensions.

*   **Input Grids:** Each input grid is a 1x13 array. It consists primarily of white pixels (0), with a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (green, red, or blue in the examples). The length and starting position of this colored block vary between examples.
*   **Output Grids:** Each output grid mirrors the dimensions (1x13) and the background color (white) of its corresponding input. The non-white colored block from the input is present in the output, preserving its color and length.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is a spatial shift of the non-white colored block. In all three examples, the block is moved exactly 3 positions to the right relative to its starting position in the input grid. The rest of the grid remains white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored block horizontally within a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Fixed at 1x13 for all examples.
  - background_color: White (0).
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: Non-white (varies: green(3), red(2), blue(1))
      - shape: Horizontal line segment (1D block)
      - length: Variable (3, 3, 6 pixels in examples)
      - quantity: Exactly one per input grid.
actions:
  - action_type: horizontal_shift
    target: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 3 positions
relationships:
  - type: preservation
    element: contiguous_block
    attributes: [color, length]
  - type: transformation
    element: contiguous_block
    attribute: start_position
    details: output_start_position = input_start_position + 3
inferred_rules:
  - The grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The background color remains constant.
  - Only the single non-white block is affected by the transformation.
  - The shift distance (3 positions to the right) is constant across examples.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid dimensions (height and width).
2.  Locate the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input grid.
3.  Determine the color, length, and starting column index of this block.
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting column index.
6.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid at the newly calculated starting column index.
7.  Return the modified grid as the output.
