It consists primarily of white pixels (0), with a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (green, red, or blue in the examples). The length and starting position of this colored block vary between examples.\n*   **Output Grids:** Each output grid mirrors the dimensions (1x13) and the background color (white) of its corresponding input. The non-white colored block from the input is present in the output, preserving its color and length.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is a spatial shift of the non-white colored block. In all three examples, the block is moved exactly 3 positions to the right relative to its starting position in the input grid. The rest of the grid remains white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
