task_description: Shift a colored block horizontally within a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Fixed at 1x13 for all examples.
  - background_color: White (0).
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: Non-white (varies: green(3), red(2), blue(1))
      - shape: Horizontal line segment (1D block)
      - length: Variable (3, 3, 6 pixels in examples)
      - quantity: Exactly one per input grid.
actions:
  - action_type: horizontal_shift
    target: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 3 positions
relationships:
  - type: preservation
    element: contiguous_block
    attributes: [color, length]
  - type: transformation
    element: contiguous_block
    attribute: start_position
    details: output_start_position = input_start_position + 3
inferred_rules:
  - The grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The background color remains constant.
  - Only the single non-white block is affected by the transformation.
  - The shift distance (3 positions to the right) is constant across examples.
