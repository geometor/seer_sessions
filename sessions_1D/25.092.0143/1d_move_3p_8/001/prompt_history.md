Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels. Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (red in example 1, azure in examples 2 and 3) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output (1x9 in all examples). The core transformation involves shifting the colored block horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. The white pixels fill the remaining space. By comparing the start index of the colored block in the input and output across all examples, the block consistently shifts exactly 3 positions to the right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: grid
    properties:
      - type: 1D array (single row)
      - size: constant between input and output (e.g., 1x9)
      - pixels: integers 0-9 representing colors
  - item: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: fills the space not occupied by the colored block
  - item: object
    properties:
      - type: single contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - color: varies (red, azure)
      - shape: horizontal segment
      - integrity: maintained during transformation (pixels within the block stay in the same relative order)
    actions:
      - name: shift
        details:
          - direction: right
          - distance: 3 positions
          - boundary_handling: Within the observed examples, the shift does not cause the block to wrap around or exceed the grid boundary. The white pixels adjust accordingly.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Note its color, length, and starting position (index).
2.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
4.  Calculate the new starting position for the non-white block by adding 3 to its original starting position.
5.  Copy the identified non-white block into the output grid, starting at the calculated new position.
