Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (red in example 1, azure in examples 2 and 3) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output (1x9 in all examples). The core transformation involves shifting the colored block horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. The white pixels fill the remaining space. By comparing the start index of the colored block in the input and output across all examples, the block consistently shifts exactly 3 positions to the right.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
