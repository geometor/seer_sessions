task_elements:
  - item: grid
    properties:
      - type: 1D array (single row)
      - size: constant between input and output (e.g., 1x9)
      - pixels: integers 0-9 representing colors
  - item: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: fills the space not occupied by the colored block
  - item: object
    properties:
      - type: single contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - color: varies (red, azure)
      - shape: horizontal segment
      - integrity: maintained during transformation (pixels within the block stay in the same relative order)
    actions:
      - name: shift
        details:
          - direction: right
          - distance: 3 positions
          - boundary_handling: Within the observed examples, the shift does not cause the block to wrap around or exceed the grid boundary. The white pixels adjust accordingly.
