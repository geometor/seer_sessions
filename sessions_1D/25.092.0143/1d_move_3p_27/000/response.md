*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a single row of pixels. Each input row contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color starting from the leftmost position, followed by white pixels. The output row shows this non-white block shifted to the right by a fixed number of positions (3), with the remaining positions filled with white pixels. The color and length of the non-white block are preserved.

    input_features:
      - object:

      properties:
        direction: right
        distance: 3_pixels
        background_fill: white # Original segment location and trailing space become white
    constraints:
      grid_size_preservation: true # Output grid has the same dimensions as input
      object_preservation: true # The non-white segment's color and length remain unchanged
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right (index 0 onwards) to identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    3.  Store the color and determine the length of this non-white block.
    4.  Copy this identified non-white block into the output grid, starting at index 3 and maintaining its original length and color.
    5.  Return the modified output grid.
