Each input row consists of a contiguous block of three identical non-white pixels starting at the leftmost position, followed by four white pixels. The output row shows this colored block shifted three positions to the right. The three white pixels that were originally immediately after the colored block now appear at the beginning of the output row. The last white pixel remains in the last position. This transformation resembles a cyclic shift or rotation applied to the first six elements of the row, leaving the seventh element unchanged. The amount of shift (3 positions) is equal to the length of the initial colored block.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
