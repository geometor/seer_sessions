task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1
  grid_size:
    width: 7
    height: 1
input_features:
  objects:
    - object_type: block
      color: non-white (variable, consistent within the block)
      shape: horizontal segment
      size: 3 pixels
      position: starts at index 0
    - object_type: background
      color: white
      shape: horizontal segment
      size: 4 pixels
      position: starts at index 3
output_features:
  objects:
    - object_type: background
      color: white
      shape: horizontal segment
      size: 3 pixels
      position: starts at index 0
    - object_type: block (same as input block)
      color: non-white (matches input block color)
      shape: horizontal segment
      size: 3 pixels
      position: starts at index 3
    - object_type: background
      color: white
      shape: single pixel
      size: 1 pixel
      position: index 6
transformation:
  action: cyclic shift (right rotation)
  target_elements: first 6 pixels of the input row
  shift_amount: 3 positions
  preserved_element: the 7th pixel (at index 6) remains unchanged
relationship:
  - The amount of the cyclic shift (3) is equal to the length of the initial non-white block.
  - The color of the non-white block is preserved from input to output.
