**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (rows) of size 1x7. Each input row consists of a contiguous block of three identical non-white pixels starting at the leftmost position, followed by four white pixels. The output row shows this colored block shifted three positions to the right. The three white pixels that were originally immediately after the colored block now appear at the beginning of the output row. The last white pixel remains in the last position. This transformation resembles a cyclic shift or rotation applied to the first six elements of the row, leaving the seventh element unchanged. The amount of shift (3 positions) is equal to the length of the initial colored block.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1
  grid_size:
    width: 7
    height: 1
input_features:
  objects:
    - object_type: block
      color: non-white (variable, consistent within the block)
      shape: horizontal segment
      size: 3 pixels
      position: starts at index 0
    - object_type: background
      color: white
      shape: horizontal segment
      size: 4 pixels
      position: starts at index 3
output_features:
  objects:
    - object_type: background
      color: white
      shape: horizontal segment
      size: 3 pixels
      position: starts at index 0
    - object_type: block (same as input block)
      color: non-white (matches input block color)
      shape: horizontal segment
      size: 3 pixels
      position: starts at index 3
    - object_type: background
      color: white
      shape: single pixel
      size: 1 pixel
      position: index 6
transformation:
  action: cyclic shift (right rotation)
  target_elements: first 6 pixels of the input row
  shift_amount: 3 positions
  preserved_element: the 7th pixel (at index 6) remains unchanged
relationship:
  - The amount of the cyclic shift (3) is equal to the length of the initial non-white block.
  - The color of the non-white block is preserved from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input row, which has a length of 7.
2.  Take the first 6 elements of the input row.
3.  Perform a right cyclic shift (rotation) on these 6 elements by 3 positions.
4.  Keep the 7th element (at index 6) of the input row in its original position (index 6).
5.  Construct the output row by combining the result of the cyclic shift (the new first 6 elements) with the unchanged 7th element.
