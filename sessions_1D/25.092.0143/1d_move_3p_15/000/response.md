Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays) of the same size (1x12).
Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color (blue, azure, gray) surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
The output grid contains the exact same colored block, also surrounded by white pixels.
The key transformation is the horizontal movement (shift) of the colored block within the grid.
Comparing the start position of the colored block in the input and output reveals a consistent pattern:
*   Example 1: Blue block starts at index 0 in input, starts at index 3 in output.
*   Example 2: Azure block starts at index 0 in input, starts at index 3 in output.
*   Example 3: Gray block starts at index 3 in input, starts at index 6 in output.
In all examples, the colored block is shifted exactly 3 positions to the right. The length and color of the block do not change, only its position. The rest of the grid remains white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row
grid_size: constant (1x12)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    properties:
      color: varies (non-white)
      shape: horizontal_line
      length: varies
      position: horizontal
relationships:
  - object_background: The block exists within a white background.
actions:
  - name: horizontal_shift
    target: contiguous_block
    parameters:
      direction: right
      distance: 3 positions
    result: The block's starting index increases by 3, the block retains its color and length, and the background adjusts accordingly.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, length, and starting position (index).
2.  Create a new output row of the same size as the input row, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Calculate the new starting position for the block by adding 3 to its original starting position.
4.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new position.
