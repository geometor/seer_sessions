Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a single row (1D array) of pixels.
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The inputs contain two primary colors: white (0) and one other non-white color (blue=1, green=3, azure=8).
3.  **Object Identification:** Within each input row, there's generally a contiguous block of a single non-white color. The remaining pixels are white (0). These white pixels can appear before and/or after the non-white block.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output, the arrangement of pixels changes. The block of non-white pixels appears shifted to the right relative to its position in the input.
5.  **Shift Pattern:**
    *   In example 1, the 17 blue pixels shift right. The 3 trailing white pixels seem to wrap around to the beginning.
    *   In example 2, the 16 green pixels shift right. The 3 trailing white pixels seem to wrap around to the beginning.
    *   In example 3, the 12 azure pixels shift right. The last 3 pixels of the input (which are white) seem to wrap around to the beginning.
6.  **Consistent Rule:** Across all examples, the transformation appears to be a circular right shift of the entire row by exactly 3 positions.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # Input/output are presented as 1D arrays (rows)
elements:
  - element_type: pixel_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: variable (blue, green, azure in examples)
      - length: variable
      - position: variable within the row
  - element_type: pixel
    description: Individual cells in the row.
    properties:
      - color: white (0) or non-white (1, 3, 8)
transformation:
  type: shift
  direction: right
  magnitude: 3 positions
  behavior: circular # Pixels shifted off the right end reappear on the left end
scope: entire_row # The transformation applies to the whole input row
input_output_relation:
  description: The output row is the input row circularly shifted 3 positions to the right.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Take the input row (1D array).
2.  Perform a circular shift of all elements in the row 3 positions to the right.
3.  The resulting row is the output.
