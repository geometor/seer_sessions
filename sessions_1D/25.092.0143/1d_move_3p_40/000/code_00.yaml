task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # Input/output are presented as 1D arrays (rows)
elements:
  - element_type: pixel_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: variable (blue, green, azure in examples)
      - length: variable
      - position: variable within the row
  - element_type: pixel
    description: Individual cells in the row.
    properties:
      - color: white (0) or non-white (1, 3, 8)
transformation:
  type: shift
  direction: right
  magnitude: 3 positions
  behavior: circular # Pixels shifted off the right end reappear on the left end
scope: entire_row # The transformation applies to the whole input row
input_output_relation:
  description: The output row is the input row circularly shifted 3 positions to the right.
