            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a single row (1D array) of pixels.\n2.  **Pixel Colors:** The inputs contain two primary colors: white (0) and one other non-white color (blue=1, green=3, azure=8).\n3.  **Object Identification:** Within each input row, there's generally a contiguous block of a single non-white color. The remaining pixels are white (0). These white pixels can appear before and/or after the non-white block.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output, the arrangement of pixels changes. The block of non-white pixels appears shifted to the right relative to its position in the input.\n5.  **Shift Pattern:**\n    *   In example 1, the 17 blue pixels shift right. The 3 trailing white pixels seem to wrap around to the beginning.\n    *   In example 2, the 16 green pixels shift right. The 3 trailing white pixels seem to wrap around to the beginning.\n    *   In example 3, the 12 azure pixels shift right. The last 3 pixels of the input (which are white) seem to wrap around to the beginning.\n6.  **Consistent Rule:** Across all examples, the transformation appears to be a circular right shift of the entire row by exactly 3 positions.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
