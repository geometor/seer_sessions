Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The non-white color varies between examples (orange in train_1, yellow in train_2 and train_3). The output grid also contains a single contiguous block of the same non-white color as the input, surrounded by white pixels. The key transformation appears to be a spatial shift of the non-white block. Comparing the start and end positions of the non-white block in the input and output reveals a consistent shift of 3 positions to the right. The length and color of the block remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n"
