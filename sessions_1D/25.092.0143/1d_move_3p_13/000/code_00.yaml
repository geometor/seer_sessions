task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
input_features:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (orange, yellow)
      - length: Varies
      - position: Varies
output_features:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the input object's color
      - length: Same as the input object's length
      - position: Shifted relative to the input object's position
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: the contiguous block of non-white color in the input grid
  - action: calculate_shift
    details: The shift amount is constant across examples.
    input_start_index: index of the first pixel of the block in the input
    output_start_index: index of the first pixel of the block in the output
    shift_amount: output_start_index - input_start_index = 3
  - action: apply_shift
    target: the identified block
    direction: right
    amount: 3 positions
  - action: update_grid
    details: Create the output grid by placing the shifted block and filling the remaining positions with white (0).
relationship:
  - The output block's color and length are identical to the input block's.
  - The output block's starting position is exactly 3 positions to the right of the input block's starting position.
