Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (effectively 1D arrays).
2.  **Color Palette:** Each example uses white (0) as the background color and one other distinct non-white color for a specific segment (red=2, green=3, yellow=4).
3.  **Objects:** The primary object in each input is a single, contiguous horizontal segment (a line) composed of a non-white color. The rest of the grid is the background color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is a spatial shift of the non-white segment. In all provided examples, this segment is moved exactly 3 positions to the right.
5.  **Consistency:** The length of the non-white segment and its color remain unchanged during the transformation. The overall size of the grid also remains constant. The positions vacated by the segment's original location become the background color (white).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a horizontal colored segment to the right.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal line of a single non-white color.
    count: 1 per grid
    properties:
      color: variable (non-white, e.g., red, green, yellow)
      length: variable
      contiguity: horizontal
actions:
  - type: translation
    target: the non-white segment
    properties:
      direction: horizontal (right)
      magnitude: 3 positions
      fill_vacated: replace original segment positions with the background color (white)
relationships:
  - The non-white segment is surrounded by the background color.
  - The output grid retains the dimensions and background color of the input grid.
  - The output segment has the same color and length as the input segment.
  - The starting position of the output segment is 3 positions to the right of the starting position of the input segment.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous segment of non-white pixels within the input grid. Note its color, starting position (index), and length.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Determine the new starting position for the segment by adding 3 to its original starting position.
4.  Copy the identified segment (with its original color and length) into the output grid, beginning at the calculated new starting position.
