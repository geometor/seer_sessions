task_description: Shift a horizontal colored segment to the right.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal line of a single non-white color.
    count: 1 per grid
    properties:
      color: variable (non-white, e.g., red, green, yellow)
      length: variable
      contiguity: horizontal
actions:
  - type: translation
    target: the non-white segment
    properties:
      direction: horizontal (right)
      magnitude: 3 positions
      fill_vacated: replace original segment positions with the background color (white)
relationships:
  - The non-white segment is surrounded by the background color.
  - The output grid retains the dimensions and background color of the input grid.
  - The output segment has the same color and length as the input segment.
  - The starting position of the output segment is 3 positions to the right of the starting position of the input segment.
