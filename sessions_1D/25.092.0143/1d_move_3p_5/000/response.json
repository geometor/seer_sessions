The rest of the grid is the background color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is a spatial shift of the non-white segment. In all provided examples, this segment is moved exactly 3 positions to the right.\n5.  **Consistency:** The length of the non-white segment and its color remain unchanged during the transformation. The overall size of the grid also remains constant. The positions vacated by the segment's original location become the background color (white).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
