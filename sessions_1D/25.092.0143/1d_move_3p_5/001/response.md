"""
Shift a horizontal colored segment 3 positions to the right within a 1D grid.

1. Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels (color > 0).
2. Determine its color, start index, and length.
3. Create an output grid of the same size, filled with the background color (0).
4. Calculate the new start index by adding 3 to the original start index.
5. Place the segment (using its original color and length) into the output grid at the new start index.
