task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D as it's a single row
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable: green, gray, blue in examples)
      shape: horizontal_line
      length: variable (14, 15, 14 in examples)
      location: defined by start and end index in the row
transformation:
  type: translation
  direction: horizontal_right
  magnitude: 3 positions
background: white (color 0)
constraints:
  - Only one non-white object per input row.
  - Object color and length are preserved.
  - Overall grid dimensions remain the same.
relationships:
  - The output object is the input object shifted right by 3 positions.
  - Pixels not part of the shifted object become white.
