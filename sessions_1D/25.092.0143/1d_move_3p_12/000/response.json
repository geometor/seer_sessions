Let's check:\n- Example 1: Green block starts at index 2 in input, index 5 in output. Shift = 5 - 2 = 3.\n- Example 2: Gray block starts at index 2 in input, index 5 in output. Shift = 5 - 2 = 3.\n- Example 3: Blue block starts at index 1 in input, index 4 in output. Shift = 4 - 1 = 3.\nThe transformation consistently shifts the non-white block 3 positions to the right.\n\n## YAML Facts\n"
