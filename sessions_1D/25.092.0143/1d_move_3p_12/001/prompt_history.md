Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

## Perception
The input and output are both single rows (1D arrays) of pixels.
Each input row contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (green, gray, or blue) surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
The output row contains the same contiguous block of the non-white color, but its position is shifted horizontally compared to the input.
The color and length of the non-white block remain unchanged between the input and output.
The shift direction appears to be to the right.
The amount of shift seems constant across all examples. Let's check:
- Example 1: Green block starts at index 2 in input, index 5 in output. Shift = 5 - 2 = 3.
- Example 2: Gray block starts at index 2 in input, index 5 in output. Shift = 5 - 2 = 3.
- Example 3: Blue block starts at index 1 in input, index 4 in output. Shift = 4 - 1 = 3.
The transformation consistently shifts the non-white block 3 positions to the right.

## YAML Facts

```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D as it's a single row
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable: green, gray, blue in examples)
      shape: horizontal_line
      length: variable (14, 15, 14 in examples)
      location: defined by start and end index in the row
transformation:
  type: translation
  direction: horizontal_right
  magnitude: 3 positions
background: white (color 0)
constraints:
  - Only one non-white object per input row.
  - Object color and length are preserved.
  - Overall grid dimensions remain the same.
relationships:
  - The output object is the input object shifted right by 3 positions.
  - Pixels not part of the shifted object become white.
```


## Natural Language Program
1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, starting position, and length.
2.  Create an output row of the same dimensions as the input row, initially filled with white pixels (color 0).
3.  Determine the new starting position for the block by adding 3 to its original starting position.
4.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new position.
