The NumPy operations within the function, particularly comparisons or indexing assuming a 1D structure, would then fail.\n\nFurther analysis using metrics revealed a second layer of complexity: the output grid's length is not always identical to the input grid's length, and the block's length can also change under specific conditions.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the code to robustly handle potentially 2D input by extracting the first row.\n2.  Incorporate the newly discovered rules for determining the output grid length and the output block length based on the input block's start position and the calculated end position of the shifted block.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n"
