**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code failed due to a likely type mismatch ("ambiguous truth value" error), probably caused by the test framework passing a 2D array `[[...]]` instead of the expected 1D array `[...]` to the `transform` function. The NumPy operations within the function, particularly comparisons or indexing assuming a 1D structure, would then fail.

Further analysis using metrics revealed a second layer of complexity: the output grid's length is not always identical to the input grid's length, and the block's length can also change under specific conditions.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the code to robustly handle potentially 2D input by extracting the first row.
2.  Incorporate the newly discovered rules for determining the output grid length and the output block length based on the input block's start position and the calculated end position of the shifted block.

**YAML Facts:**

input_processing:
  - name: ensure_1D
    logic: If input grid is 2D with shape (1, N), extract the first row to get a 1D array of length N. Otherwise, assume input is already 1D. Let the length of the resulting 1D row be 'input_row_length'.

      if new_end_index < (input_row_length - 1):

    logic: Create a 1D row of background_color with the calculated 'output_row_length'. Place the block (using 'block_color' and 'output_block_length') starting at 'new_start_index'. Clip placement to output row bounds if necessary (though logic implies it should fit).
relationships:
  - type: spatial_shift
    object: contiguous_block
    direction: right

  - type: length_adjustment
    object: contiguous_block
    condition: The block's start index in the input is 0.
    effect: The block's length in the output is reduced by 1.
  - type: output_size_adjustment
    condition: The calculated end index of the shifted block (considering potential length adjustment) falls before the second-to-last position of the original input row.
    effect: The output row's length is 1 less than the input row's length.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Interpret the input grid as a single row of pixels. If provided as a 2D grid (1xN), use the first (only) row. Note the length of this input row (`L_in`).
2.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels. Record its color (`C`), starting index (`S_in`), and length (`Len_in`).
3.  Calculate the target starting index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index: `S_out = S_in + 3`.
4.  Determine the length the block will have in the output (`Len_out`): If the block started at index 0 in the input (`S_in == 0`), its output length is one less than its input length (`Len_out = Len_in - 1`). Otherwise, the length remains the same (`Len_out = Len_in`).
5.  Determine the length of the final output row (`L_out`): Calculate the index where the shifted block will end: `E_out = S_out + Len_out - 1`. If this end index `E_out` is less than the second-to-last index of the input row (`L_in - 2`), then the output row length `L_out` will be one less than the input length (`L_out = L_in - 1`). Otherwise, the output row length will be the same as the input length (`L_out = L_in`).
6.  Create a new row of length `L_out` filled with the background color (white, 0).
7.  Place the block of color `C` with its determined output length `Len_out` into the new row, starting at the calculated output index `S_out`.
