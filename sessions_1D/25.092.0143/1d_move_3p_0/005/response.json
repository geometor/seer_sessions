Calculates a new start position by shifting the block 3 positions to the right.\n3. Adjusts the block's length for the output: if the block started at index 0 in the input, its output length is reduced by 1; otherwise, the length remains the same.\n4. Adjusts the total length of the output row: if the calculated end position of the (potentially length-adjusted) block in the output is less than the original input length minus 2, the output row length is reduced by 1 compared to the input; otherwise, the output length matches the input length.\n5. Creates the output row with the calculated length, filled with white (0), and places the (potentially length-adjusted) block at its new calculated start position, clipped to the bounds of the output row.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_non_white_block(row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of non-white pixels in a 1D array.\n\n    Args:\n        row (np.array): A 1D numpy array representing the input row.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (color, start_index, length) if a block is found,\n               (None, -1, 0) otherwise.
