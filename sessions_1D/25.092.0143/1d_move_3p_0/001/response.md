"""
Transforms an input 1D grid (row) by identifying a single contiguous block of a non-white color and shifting it 3 positions to the right. The background is filled with white (0).

1. Finds the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row.
2. Determines the block's color, start index, and length.
3. Creates a new row of the same length, filled with white pixels (0).
4. Calculates the new start index for the block by adding 3 to the original start index.
5. Places the identified block (with its original color and length) into the new row starting at the calculated new start index.
