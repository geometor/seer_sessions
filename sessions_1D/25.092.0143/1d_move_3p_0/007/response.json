Calculates a new start position by shifting the block 3 positions to the right.\n3. Adjusts the block's length for the output: if the block started at index 0 in the input, its output length is reduced by 1; otherwise, the length remains the same.\n4. The total length of the output row is always the same as the input row length.\n5. Creates the output row with the same length as the input, filled with white (0), and places the (potentially length-adjusted) block at its new calculated start position, clipped to the bounds of the output row.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_non_white_block(row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of non-white pixels in a 1D array.\n\n    Args:\n        row (np.array): A 1D numpy array representing the input row.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (color, start_index, length) if a block is found,\n               (None, -1, 0) otherwise.
