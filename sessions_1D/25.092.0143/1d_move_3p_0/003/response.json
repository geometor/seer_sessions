Interpret the input grid as a single row (handling 1xN input). Note its length (L_in).\n2. Find the contiguous non-white block: color (C), start index (S_in), length (Len_in).\n3. Calculate the new start index: S_out = S_in + 3.\n4. Calculate the output block length (Len_out): If S_in == 0, Len_out = Len_in - 1; otherwise, Len_out = Len_in.\n5. Calculate the output row length (L_out): If the new end index (S_out + Len_out - 1) is less than L_in - 2, then L_out = L_in - 1; otherwise, L_out = L_in.\n6. Create an output row of length L_out filled with white (0).\n7. Place the block (C, Len_out) into the output row starting at S_out, respecting row boundaries.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_non_white_block(row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of non-white pixels in a 1D array.\n\n    Args:\n        row (np.array): A 1D numpy array representing the input row.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (color, start_index, length) if a block is found,\n               (None, -1, 0) otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    non_white_indices = np.where(row != 0)[0]\n    if len(non_white_indices) == 0:\n        return None, -1, 0  # No non-white pixels found\n\n    start_index = non_white_indices[0]\n    color = row[start_index]\n    length = 0\n    # Iterate from the start index to find the length of the contiguous block of the *same* color\n    for i in range(start_index, len(row)):\n        if row[i] == color:\n            length += 1\n        else:\n            break # End of the block of this specific color\n\n    return int(color), int(start_index), int(length) # Ensure ints\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n\n    # Ensure input is treated as 1D\n    if input_array.ndim > 1:\n        if input_array.shape[0] == 1:\n            input_row = input_array[0] # Extract the first row if shape is (1, N)\n        elif input_array.shape[1] == 1:\n             input_row = input_array.flatten() # Treat as row if shape is (N, 1)\n        else:\n            # Handle unexpected multi-row input - for this task, assume error or take first row\n            # Based on the problem description, we expect 1D or 1xN\n            input_row = input_array[0] \n    else:\n        input_row = input_array\n\n    input_row_length = len(input_row)\n\n    # Find the non-white block in the input row\n    block_color, block_start_index, block_length = find_non_white_block(input_row)\n\n    # Handle case where no block is found - return an output based on length rules\n    if block_color is None:\n        # If no block, no shift happens.
