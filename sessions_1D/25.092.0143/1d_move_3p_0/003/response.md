```python
"""
Transforms an input 1D grid (potentially passed as 1xN) by identifying a single contiguous block of a non-white color, shifting it 3 positions to the right, and potentially adjusting the block's length and the overall output row length based on specific conditions.

1. Interpret the input grid as a single row (handling 1xN input). Note its length (L_in).
2. Find the contiguous non-white block: color (C), start index (S_in), length (Len_in).
3. Calculate the new start index: S_out = S_in + 3.
4. Calculate the output block length (Len_out): If S_in == 0, Len_out = Len_in - 1; otherwise, Len_out = Len_in.
5. Calculate the output row length (L_out): If the new end index (S_out + Len_out - 1) is less than L_in - 2, then L_out = L_in - 1; otherwise, L_out = L_in.
6. Create an output row of length L_out filled with white (0).
7. Place the block (C, Len_out) into the output row starting at S_out, respecting row boundaries.
