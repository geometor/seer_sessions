Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single rows (1D grids) of pixels represented by integer color codes.
2.  **Objects:** Each input row contains two main elements:
    *   A contiguous block (segment) of a single non-white color (red '2', orange '7', azure '8').
    *   A background of white pixels ('0').
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal shift of the non-white block.
4.  **Shift Direction:** In all examples, the non-white block moves to the right.
5.  **Shift Amount:** The magnitude of the rightward shift is consistently 3 positions across all examples.
    *   Example 1: Red block starts at index 0, moves to index 3 (shift = 3).
    *   Example 2: Orange block starts at index 4, moves to index 7 (shift = 3).
    *   Example 3: Azure block starts at index 1, moves to index 4 (shift = 3).
6.  **Background Handling:** The positions vacated by the shifted block are filled with the background color (white '0'). The positions pushed "off" the right end are also effectively replaced by white pixels as the block shifts into existing white pixel locations. The overall length of the row remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input row and locate the single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
2.  Identify the color, the starting index (position), and the length of this non-white block.
3.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output row by adding 3 to its starting index in the input row.
4.  Create a new row with the same total length as the input row, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Copy the identified non-white block into the new row, placing it starting at the calculated target starting index.
