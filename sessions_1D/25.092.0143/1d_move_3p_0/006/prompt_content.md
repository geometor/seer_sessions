"""
Transforms an input 1D grid (row) based on the following rules:
1. Finds the single contiguous block of a non-white color in the input row.
2. Calculates a new start position by shifting the block 3 positions to the right.
3. Adjusts the block's length for the output: if the block started at index 0 in the input, its output length is reduced by 1; otherwise, the length remains the same.
4. Adjusts the total length of the output row: if the calculated end position of the (potentially length-adjusted) block in the output is less than the original input length minus 2, the output row length is reduced by 1 compared to the input; otherwise, the output length matches the input length.
5. Creates the output row with the calculated length, filled with white (0), and places the (potentially length-adjusted) block at its new calculated start position, clipped to the bounds of the output row.
