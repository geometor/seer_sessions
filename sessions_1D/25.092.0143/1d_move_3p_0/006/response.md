**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation as a rightward shift of the non-white block by 3 positions. However, it failed to account for subtle variations in the block's length and the output grid's total length based on the block's starting position. The provided code implemented a simple shift and incorrectly introduced a rule for changing the output row length, leading to mismatches in examples 1 and 2, specifically regarding the length of the shifted block and the total length of the output row. The strategy is to refine the rules by carefully observing the conditions under which the block length changes and confirming if the output row length ever changes.

**Metrics Analysis:**

Let's analyze each example to confirm the patterns.

    output_length = len(output_row)

    non_white_indices_in = np.where(input_row != 0)[0]
    non_white_indices_out = np.where(output_row != 0)[0]

    if len(non_white_indices_in) == 0:

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Shift:** The calculated shift (`block_start_out` - `block_start_in`) is consistently 3 for all examples.
*   **Row Length:** The `output_length` is always equal to the `input_length` (25) in all examples. The previous assumption about variable output length was incorrect.
*   **Block Length:**
    *   Example 1: `block_start_in` is 0, `block_length_in` is 16, `block_length_out` is 15 (decreased by 1).
    *   Example 2: `block_start_in` is 4, `block_length_in` is 7, `block_length_out` is 7 (unchanged).
    *   Example 3: `block_start_in` is 1, `block_length_in` is 20, `block_length_out` is 20 (unchanged). Note: My manual count in the initial thought process for example 3 was off by 1, the code execution correctly identifies 20.

**Confirmed Rule:** The non-white block is shifted 3 positions to the right. If the block's starting index in the input is 0, its length is reduced by 1 in the output. Otherwise, its length remains unchanged. The total length of the output row is always the same as the input row length.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Analyze the input row to find the single contiguous block of non-white pixels. Record its color (C), starting index (S_in), and length (L_in). Note the total length of the input row (N_in).
2.  Determine the output row length (N_out), which is always equal to the input row length (N_out = N_in).
3.  Calculate the starting index for the block in the output row (S_out) by adding 3 to the input starting index (S_out = S_in + 3).
4.  Calculate the length of the block in the output row (L_out):
    *   If the input starting index (S_in) was 0, then the output length is one less than the input length (L_out = L_in - 1).
    *   Otherwise (if S_in > 0), the output length is the same as the input length (L_out = L_in).
    *   Ensure the calculated output length (L_out) is not negative; if the calculation results in a negative value, use 0 instead.
5.  Create a new output row of length N_out, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Place the block, using its original color (C) and calculated output length (L_out), into the new output row starting at the calculated output starting index (S_out). Ensure the block placement respects the boundaries of the output row (i.e., do not write pixels beyond index N_out - 1).
