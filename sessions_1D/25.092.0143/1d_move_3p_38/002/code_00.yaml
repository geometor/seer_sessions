    constraints:
      - color_preservation: True
      - length_preservation: True
      - wrap_around: False # Pixels shifted beyond the boundary are lost
implicit_rules:
  - The space vacated by the shifted block becomes the background color (white, 0).
  - The space into which the block shifts (if previously occupied by background) takes on the block's color.
