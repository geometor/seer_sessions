The background is white (0), and the block retains its color and length.\n\nThe Python code provided implemented this logic but failed during testing with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the `transform` function was called with NumPy arrays as input, while the internal logic (especially `find_non_white_block`) was written assuming Python lists. Comparisons like `pixel != 0` within the loop behave differently when `pixel` is an element from a NumPy array versus a standard Python list in certain conditional contexts, leading to this error.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the transformation rule by re-examining the examples and gathering metrics.\n2.  Refine the description of the input/output data format (1D sequence/array).\n3.  Update the Natural Language Program to be precise about the transformation.\n4.  The Coder phase will then need to adjust the Python implementation to correctly handle NumPy arrays if that is indeed the input format used by the testing environment.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's gather metrics for each training example using code execution.\n\n"
