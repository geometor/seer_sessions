task_type: transformation
input_domain: 1D_grid
output_domain: 1D_grid
grid_properties:
  size_relation: same_size
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    color: non_white (variable, e.g., yellow, green)
    background_color: white (0)
    count: 1_per_grid
actions:
  - action_type: spatial_translation
    direction: right
    magnitude: 3_positions
    target: the_non_white_contiguous_block
relationships:
  - The position of the non-white block changes between input and output.
  - All other pixels (white background) remain white, although their positions might effectively change relative to the shifted block.
