Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output grid is the same size as the input, but the colored block has been shifted horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. The specific color of the block changes between examples (orange, gray, magenta), but the transformation logic remains the same. The background remains white.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
