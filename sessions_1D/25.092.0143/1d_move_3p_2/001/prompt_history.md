Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception:**

The input and output grids are single rows (1x30).
Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal segment (an object) of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
The output grid also contains a single contiguous horizontal segment of the same non-white color and the same length as the input segment, surrounded by white pixels.
Comparing the input and output grids, the colored segment appears to have been shifted horizontally to the right.
In train_1, the magenta (6) segment shifts from columns 1-10 to columns 4-13, a shift of 3 columns to the right.
In train_2, the blue (1) segment shifts from columns 4-20 to columns 7-23, a shift of 3 columns to the right.
In train_3, the gray (5) segment shifts from columns 4-11 to columns 7-14, a shift of 3 columns to the right.
The amount of shift is consistently 3 columns to the right across all examples.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: 1 row, 30 columns (consistent across examples)
  - background_color: white (0)

Input Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segment
  - count: 1 per input grid
  - color: non-white (magenta(6), blue(1), gray(5))
  - length: variable (10, 17, 8)
  - location: variable horizontal position

Output Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segment
  - count: 1 per output grid
  - properties:
      - color: identical to the input object's color
      - length: identical to the input object's length
  - location: horizontally shifted relative to the input object

Transformation:
  - type: horizontal translation (shift)
  - object_acted_upon: the single non-white horizontal segment
  - direction: right
  - magnitude: 3 columns
  - background: remains unchanged (white)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in the input grid. Note its color, starting column index, and ending column index.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Determine the new starting column index for the segment by adding 3 to the original starting column index.
4.  Determine the new ending column index for the segment by adding 3 to the original ending column index.
5.  Place the segment (using its original color and length) into the output grid at the new calculated starting and ending column indices.
