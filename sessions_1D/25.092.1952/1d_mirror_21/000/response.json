In the examples, this object is always 3 pixels wide.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship**: The mobile object and the maroon pixel are separated by exactly one white pixel (0).\n5.  **Transformation Pattern**: The core transformation seems to be a change in the relative positions of the mobile object and the maroon pixel. The mobile object moves from one side of the maroon pixel to the other. The maroon pixel itself does not move. The single white pixel separator is maintained.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Note its position (index).\n3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at the same position in the output grid.\n4.  Locate the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). This is the mobile object. Note its color, length, and starting index.\n5.  Determine if the mobile object is to the left or right of the maroon pixel in the input grid.\n6.  Calculate the new starting position for the mobile object in the output grid:\n    *   If the mobile object was to the left of the maroon pixel in the input: its new starting position will be `maroon_pixel_index + 2`.\n    *   If the mobile object was to the right of the maroon pixel in the input: its new starting position will be `maroon_pixel_index - object_length - 1`.\n7.  Place the mobile object (using its original color and length) starting at the calculated new position in the output grid. Ensure the single white pixel (0) gap between the mobile object and the maroon pixel is present."
