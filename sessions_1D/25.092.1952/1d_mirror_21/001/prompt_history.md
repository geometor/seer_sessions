Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (a single row).
2.  **Key Colors**:
    *   White (0) serves as the background color.
    *   Maroon (9) appears as a single, stationary pixel in each example.
    *   Another color (blue=1, magenta=6, gray=5) forms a contiguous block of pixels (an object).
3.  **Object Identification**:
    *   There's a fixed object: the single maroon pixel (9).
    *   There's a mobile object: the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels. In the examples, this object is always 3 pixels wide.
4.  **Spatial Relationship**: The mobile object and the maroon pixel are separated by exactly one white pixel (0).
5.  **Transformation Pattern**: The core transformation seems to be a change in the relative positions of the mobile object and the maroon pixel. The mobile object moves from one side of the maroon pixel to the other. The maroon pixel itself does not move. The single white pixel separator is maintained.

**Facts (YAML):**

    details: If mobile_object is left of separator, move it to the right. If right, move to the left. Maintain the 1-pixel white separation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Note its position (index).
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at the same position in the output grid.
4.  Locate the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). This is the mobile object. Note its color, length, and starting index.
5.  Determine if the mobile object is to the left or right of the maroon pixel in the input grid.
6.  Calculate the new starting position for the mobile object in the output grid:
    *   If the mobile object was to the left of the maroon pixel in the input: its new starting position will be `maroon_pixel_index + 2`.
    *   If the mobile object was to the right of the maroon pixel in the input: its new starting position will be `maroon_pixel_index - object_length - 1`.
7.  Place the mobile object (using its original color and length) starting at the calculated new position in the output grid. Ensure the single white pixel (0) gap between the mobile object and the maroon pixel is present.
