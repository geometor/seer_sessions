"""
Moves a contiguous colored block within a single-row grid across a separator 
pixel (maroon, 9), maintaining the relative distance (number of background 
pixels) between the block and the separator.

The transformation operates solely on the first (and only) row of the grid.
The block moves from its original side of the separator to the opposite side.
The separator's position remains unchanged.
The block's color and length remain unchanged.
The block's original position in the row is filled with the background color (white, 0).
The relative distance is preserved in the new position on the opposite side.
The block overwrites background pixels at its destination.
