task_description: Move a colored block across a separator pixel within a 1D array, maintaining relative distance.
input_output_structure:
  type: 1D array (list of integers)
  dimensionality: 1
  size: Variable length (observed length 16 in examples)
elements:
  - object: separator
    attributes:
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
      role: fixed pivot point
  - object: colored_block
    attributes:
      color: C (any color except white(0) or maroon(9))
      shape: contiguous horizontal segment (1D)
      count: 1
      role: mobile element
      properties:
        - length (number of pixels)
        - color
  - object: background
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
      role: fills empty space, replaces original block position
relationships:
  - type: spatial_1d
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: separator
    details: The block exists entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the separator's index.
  - type: relative_distance_1d
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: separator
    details: Defined as the number of background pixels between the block's nearest edge and the separator pixel.
    calculation:
      if_left: separator_index - 1 - block_end_index
      if_right: block_start_index - (separator_index + 1)
transformation:
  action: mirror_position
  target: colored_block
  pivot: separator
  details:
    - Identify the single separator pixel (maroon, 9) and its index `s`.
    - Identify the single contiguous block of color `C` (not 0 or 9), noting its color `C`, start index `b_start`, end index `b_end`, and length `L = b_end - b_start + 1`.
    - Determine if the block is left (`b_end < s`) or right (`b_start > s`) of the separator.
    - Calculate the distance `d` (number of background pixels) between the block and the separator based on its side.
    - Create a new 1D array of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
    - Place the separator pixel (maroon, 9) at index `s` in the new array.
    - Calculate the new start index `b'_start` and end index `b'_end` for the block on the opposite side of the separator, such that the distance `d` is preserved.
      - If original block was left: `b'_start = s + 1 + d`, `b'_end = b'_start + L - 1`.
      - If original block was right: `b'_end = s - 1 - d`, `b'_start = b'_end - L + 1`.
    - Fill the segment from `b'_start` to `b'_end` (inclusive) in the new array with the block's color `C`.
