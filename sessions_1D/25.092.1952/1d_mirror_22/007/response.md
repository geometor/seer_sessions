"""
Moves a contiguous colored block within a single-row grid across a separator pixel 
(maroon, 9), maintaining the relative distance (number of background pixels) 
between the block and the separator.

The transformation operates on a 2D grid assumed to have exactly one row (1xN shape).
The block moves from its original side of the separator to the opposite side within that row.
The separator's position remains unchanged.
The block's color and length remain unchanged.
The block's original position in the row is effectively replaced by the background 
color (white, 0) when the output row is initialized.
The relative distance (number of background pixels between the block's nearest edge 
and the separator) is preserved in the new position on the opposite side.
The block overwrites background pixels at its destination in the output row.
