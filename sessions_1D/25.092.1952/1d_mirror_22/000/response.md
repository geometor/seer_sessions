Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (rows) of pixels.
*   Each grid contains a background color (white, 0).
*   Each grid contains a single separator pixel (maroon, 9).
*   Each grid contains one contiguous block of a single color C, where C is not white (0) or maroon (9). This block acts as the primary "object". In the examples, this object is gray (5), blue (1), or green (3).
*   The key transformation involves the object block and the separator pixel. The object block appears to move from one side of the separator pixel to the other.
*   The separator pixel (maroon, 9) remains in the same absolute position in all examples.
*   The object block maintains its color and size (length).
*   The space previously occupied by the object block becomes background (white).
*   The position where the object block moves to appears to have been background (white) previously.
*   The relative spacing between the object block and the separator seems important. Observing the number of white pixels between the block and the separator, this spacing appears constant but mirrored across the separator.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored block across a separator pixel while maintaining relative distance.

elements:
  - object: separator
    attributes:
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
      role: pivot point, position remains fixed
  - object: colored_block
    attributes:
      color: C (any color except white(0) or maroon(9))
      shape: contiguous horizontal block (1D)
      count: 1
      role: mobile element
  - object: background
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
      role: fills empty space, replaces the original position of the colored_block

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: separator
    details: The block is either to the left or right of the separator, separated by zero or more background pixels.
  - type: relative_distance
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: separator
    details: The number of background pixels ('distance') between the nearest edge of the block and the separator.

transformation:
  action: move
  target: colored_block
  details:
    - The block moves from one side of the separator to the other (left-to-right or right-to-left).
    - The separator's position remains unchanged.
    - The block's original position is filled with the background color.
    - The 'relative_distance' (number of intervening background pixels) between the block and the separator is preserved in the new position on the opposite side.
    - The block overwrites background pixels at its destination.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid of the same size as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Find the index `s` of the separator pixel (maroon, 9) in the input grid.
3.  Place the separator pixel (maroon, 9) at index `s` in the output grid.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of a single color `C` (where `C` is not white (0) and not maroon (9)) in the input grid. Record its color `C`, its start index `i_start`, and its end index `i_end`.
5.  Determine if the block is to the left (`i_end < s`) or right (`i_start > s`) of the separator.
6.  Calculate the distance `d` (number of background pixels) between the block and the separator in the input:
    *   If the block is to the left, `d = s - 1 - i_end`.
    *   If the block is to the right, `d = i_start - (s + 1)`.
7.  Calculate the new position (`i'_start`, `i'_end`) for the block in the output grid, placing it on the opposite side of the separator while maintaining the distance `d`:
    *   If the block was to the left in the input, calculate the new position on the right:
        *   `i'_start = s + 1 + d`
        *   `i'_end = i'_start + (i_end - i_start)`
    *   If the block was to the right in the input, calculate the new position on the left:
        *   `i'_end = s - 1 - d`
        *   `i'_start = i'_end - (i_end - i_start)`
8.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from index `i'_start` to `i'_end` (inclusive) with the color `C`.
