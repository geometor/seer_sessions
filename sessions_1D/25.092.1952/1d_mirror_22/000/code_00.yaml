task_description: Move a colored block across a separator pixel while maintaining relative distance.

elements:
  - object: separator
    attributes:
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
      role: pivot point, position remains fixed
  - object: colored_block
    attributes:
      color: C (any color except white(0) or maroon(9))
      shape: contiguous horizontal block (1D)
      count: 1
      role: mobile element
  - object: background
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
      role: fills empty space, replaces the original position of the colored_block

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: separator
    details: The block is either to the left or right of the separator, separated by zero or more background pixels.
  - type: relative_distance
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: separator
    details: The number of background pixels ('distance') between the nearest edge of the block and the separator.

transformation:
  action: move
  target: colored_block
  details:
    - The block moves from one side of the separator to the other (left-to-right or right-to-left).
    - The separator's position remains unchanged.
    - The block's original position is filled with the background color.
    - The 'relative_distance' (number of intervening background pixels) between the block and the separator is preserved in the new position on the opposite side.
    - The block overwrites background pixels at its destination.
