This block acts as the primary \"object\". In the examples, this object is gray (5), blue (1), or green (3).\n*   The key transformation involves the object block and the separator pixel. The object block appears to move from one side of the separator pixel to the other.\n*   The separator pixel (maroon, 9) remains in the same absolute position in all examples.\n*   The object block maintains its color and size (length).\n*   The space previously occupied by the object block becomes background (white).\n*   The position where the object block moves to appears to have been background (white) previously.\n*   The relative spacing between the object block and the separator seems important. Observing the number of white pixels between the block and the separator, this spacing appears constant but mirrored across the separator.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
