task_description: Move a colored block within a single-row grid across a separator pixel, maintaining relative distance.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  shape: 1xN (one row, variable number of columns)
  background_color: white (0)

elements:
  - object: separator
    attributes:
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1 (per row)
      position: fixed within the row
      role: pivot point
  - object: colored_block
    attributes:
      color: C (any color except white(0) or maroon(9))
      shape: contiguous horizontal block (within the single row)
      count: 1 (per row)
      role: mobile element
      properties: [color, start_index, end_index, length]
  - object: background_pixels
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
      role: fills empty space, replaces original block position, defines distance metric

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: separator
    details: Within the row, the block is either entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the separator.
  - type: relative_distance
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: separator
    metric: Number of background pixels (white, 0) directly between the block's nearest edge and the separator pixel.
    details: This distance is preserved during the transformation.

transformation:
  action: move_and_replace
  target: colored_block
  reference: separator
  details:
    - The input is a 1xN grid. The output is a 1xN grid of the same dimensions.
    - Create the output grid initialized with the background color (white, 0).
    - Identify the single row in the input grid. All subsequent operations apply to this row.
    - Locate the separator pixel (maroon, 9) in the row and place it at the same index in the output row.
    - Locate the contiguous block of color C (not white or maroon), recording its color, start index, end index, and length.
    - Determine if the block is to the left or right of the separator.
    - Calculate the 'distance' (number of background pixels) between the block and the separator.
    - Calculate the new start and end indices for the block in the output row, placing it on the opposite side of the separator while maintaining the calculated 'distance'.
    - Fill the calculated new indices in the output row with the block's color C.
