            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it was designed to handle a 1D list (`List[int]`) as input, whereas the ARC task examples provide 2D grids (`List[List[int]]`), specifically grids with a single row (1xN shape). The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly indicates that numpy arrays were used in boolean contexts (like `if` conditions) where a single boolean was expected, likely stemming from operations on the 2D input structure when 1D was assumed.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (finding separator, finding colored block, calculating distance, moving block to the opposite side while preserving distance) appears correct based on visual inspection and preliminary calculations run via `tool_code`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to correct the implementation details to properly handle the 2D grid input format, even though the actual transformation logic applies only to the contents of the single row within that grid. The natural language program and YAML facts need minor adjustments to reflect this 1xN structure accurately.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Structure:** All training examples use input and output grids of shape (1, N), meaning one row and N columns. N is 16 for all provided examples.\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Shape: 1x16)\n    *   Separator (9) at index 9.\n    *   Block (5) from index 4 to 7. Block is left of separator.\n    *   Distance: `9 - 1 - 7 = 1` background pixel (index 8) between block and separator.\n    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]]` (Shape: 1x16)\n    *   New block position: Right of separator, distance 1. New start index = `9 + 1 + 1 = 11`. New end index = `11 + (7-4) = 14`. This matches the output.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Shape: 1x16)\n    *   Separator (9) at index 6.\n    *   Block (1) from index 1 to 4. Block is left of separator.\n    *   Distance: `6 - 1 - 4 = 1` background pixel (index 5) between block and separator.\n    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Shape: 1x16)\n    *   New block position: Right of separator, distance 1. New start index = `6 + 1 + 1 = 8`. New end index = `8 + (4-1) = 11`. This matches the output.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Shape: 1x16)\n    *   Separator (9) at index 5.\n    *   Block (3) from index 0 to 3. Block is left of separator.\n    *   Distance: `5 - 1 - 3 = 1` background pixel (index 4) between block and separator.\n    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Shape: 1x16)\n    *   New block position: Right of separator, distance 1. New start index = `5 + 1 + 1 = 7`. New end index = `7 + (3-0) = 10`. This matches the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
