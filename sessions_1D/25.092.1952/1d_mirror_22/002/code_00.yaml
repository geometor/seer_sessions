task_description: Move a colored block within a single-row grid across a separator pixel, maintaining relative distance.

grid_properties:
  - dimension: 2D (always 1 row)
  - background_color: white (0)

elements:
  - object: separator
    attributes:
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
      position: fixed within the row
      role: pivot point
  - object: colored_block
    attributes:
      color: C (any color except white(0) or maroon(9))
      shape: contiguous horizontal block (within the single row)
      count: 1
      role: mobile element
      length: constant between input and output
  - object: background_pixels
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
      role: fill empty space, replace original block position

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: separator
    details: The block is located entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the separator within the row.
  - type: relative_distance
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: separator
    details: The number of background pixels between the block's nearest edge and the separator pixel. This distance is preserved during the transformation.

transformation:
  action: move
  target: colored_block
  details:
    - The transformation operates solely on the first (and only) row of the grid.
    - The block moves from its original side of the separator to the opposite side.
    - The separator's position remains unchanged.
    - The block's color and length remain unchanged.
    - The block's original position in the row is filled with the background color (white, 0).
    - The 'relative_distance' (number of intervening background pixels) between the block and the separator is preserved in the new position on the opposite side.
    - The block overwrites background pixels at its destination.
