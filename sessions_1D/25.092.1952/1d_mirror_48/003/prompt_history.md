**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (lists) of integers representing colors.
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   `9` (maroon) appears exactly once in each input and output and seems to act as a fixed point or pivot.
    *   `0` (white) acts as the background or empty space.
    *   A single other non-zero color (blue `1`, yellow `4`, or red `2`) forms a contiguous segment in each example.
3.  **Transformation:** The primary action is the movement of the contiguous colored segment (non-`0`, non-`9`).
4.  **Movement Pattern:**
    *   The colored segment moves from one side of the `9` pixel to the other.
    *   The segment itself remains unchanged (same color, same length).
    *   The `9` pixel remains in the same position.
    *   The distance (measured in the number of intervening `0` pixels) between the segment and the `9` pixel appears to be preserved during the move to the opposite side.
    *   The rest of the array positions are filled with `0`. The overall length of the array remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored segment across a pivot point.
elements:
  - object: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True
  - object: segment
    color: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
      - variable_color: True
      - variable_length: True (although constant within a single example)
      - moves: True
  - object: background
    color: 0 (white)
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: True
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [segment, pivot]
    details: segment is located on one side of the pivot, separated by a specific number of background pixels.
action:
  - name: move_segment
    actor: segment
    reference: pivot
    details: The segment is relocated to the opposite side of the pivot, maintaining the same separation distance (number of background pixels). The original location of the segment is filled with background pixels.
constraints:
  - array_length_constant: True
  - pivot_position_constant: True
  - segment_color_constant: True
  - segment_length_constant: True
  - separation_distance_constant: True (number of background pixels between segment and pivot)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input array.
2.  Locate the index (position) of the unique `9` (maroon) pixel (the pivot).
3.  Locate the contiguous segment of non-zero, non-`9` colored pixels. Record its color, starting index, and length.
4.  Determine if the segment is to the left or right of the pivot pixel.
5.  Calculate the distance (number of `0` background pixels) between the segment and the pivot pixel.
6.  Create a new output array of the same length as the input array, initially filled with `0` (white) pixels.
7.  Place the `9` (maroon) pixel in the output array at the same index it occupied in the input array.
8.  Determine the new starting index for the segment in the output array:
    *   If the segment was originally to the left of the pivot, place it to the right, maintaining the calculated distance. The new start index will be `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
    *   If the segment was originally to the right of the pivot, place it to the left, maintaining the calculated distance. The new start index will be `pivot_index - distance - segment_length`.
9.  Fill the segment's positions in the output array (starting at the new index for its length) with its original color.
10. Return the completed output array.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'
**General Assessment:**

The primary issue identified is a type mismatch error (`AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`). The provided input data is being processed as NumPy arrays, while the initial code implementation incorrectly assumed standard Python lists and used list-specific methods like `.index()`.

The strategy to resolve this involves refactoring the Python code to utilize NumPy functions and array manipulation techniques for tasks such as finding element indices, identifying segments, and calculating distances. The underlying logic of the transformation (identifying pivot and segment, calculating distance, and repositioning the segment) appears sound based on the initial analysis and needs to be correctly implemented using NumPy.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's re-examine the examples assuming NumPy array inputs.

The metrics confirm the initial analysis:
*   A single pivot (color `9`) exists in each input.
*   A single contiguous segment of another color exists.
*   The segment moves from one side of the pivot to the other.
*   The distance (number of background `0`s) between the segment and the pivot is maintained.
*   The calculated new starting position for the segment matches the observed starting position in the output examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored segment across a pivot point within a 1D array.
array_properties:
  - type: 1D numpy array
  - element_type: integer (representing colors 0-9)
  - length_constant: True (across input/output pairs)
elements:
  - object: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True (index remains the same in input and output)
  - object: segment
    color: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True (forms an unbroken block of pixels)
      - variable_color: True (can be different colors in different examples)
      - variable_length: True (can have different lengths in different examples)
      - moves: True
      - shape_invariant: True (length and color do not change during transformation)
  - object: background
    color: 0 (white)
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: True
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [segment, pivot]
    properties:
      - side: Segment is either to the left or right of the pivot index.
      - distance: Defined as the count of background (0) pixels strictly between the segment and the pivot. This distance is preserved during the transformation.
action:
  - name: relocate_segment
    actor: segment
    reference: pivot
    details: The segment is moved from its original side of the pivot to the opposite side. The new position ensures the distance (count of background pixels between segment and pivot) remains the same as in the input. The original location occupied by the segment is replaced by the background color (0).
constraints:
  - pivot_position_constant: True
  - segment_color_constant: True (within a single transformation)
  - segment_length_constant: True (within a single transformation)
  - separation_distance_constant: True (number of background pixels between segment and pivot is preserved)
  - single_pivot: True (exactly one '9' in the input)
  - single_segment: True (exactly one contiguous block of non-zero, non-9 color)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 1D NumPy array.
2.  Create an output array of the same size, initialized with the background color (`0`).
3.  Locate the index of the unique pivot element (color `9`) in the input array.
4.  Place the pivot element (`9`) into the output array at the same index.
5.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-zero, non-`9` colored elements in the input array. Determine its color, starting index, and length.
6.  Determine if the segment is located to the left or right of the pivot index.
7.  Calculate the distance between the segment and the pivot by counting the number of background elements (`0`) located strictly between the end of the segment (if left) or start of the segment (if right) and the pivot index.
8.  Calculate the new starting index for the segment in the output array:
    *   If the segment was originally to the left of the pivot, the new start index is `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
    *   If the segment was originally to the right of the pivot, the new start index is `pivot_index - distance - segment_length`.
9.  Place the segment (using its original color and length) into the output array starting at the calculated new index.
10. Return the completed output array.
