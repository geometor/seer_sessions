task_description: Move a colored segment across a pivot point within a 1D array.
array_properties:
  - type: 1D numpy array
  - element_type: integer (representing colors 0-9)
  - length_constant: True (across input/output pairs)
elements:
  - object: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True (index remains the same in input and output)
  - object: segment
    color: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True (forms an unbroken block of pixels)
      - variable_color: True (can be different colors in different examples)
      - variable_length: True (can have different lengths in different examples)
      - moves: True
      - shape_invariant: True (length and color do not change during transformation)
  - object: background
    color: 0 (white)
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: True
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [segment, pivot]
    properties:
      - side: Segment is either to the left or right of the pivot index.
      - distance: Defined as the count of background (0) pixels strictly between the segment and the pivot. This distance is preserved during the transformation.
action:
  - name: relocate_segment
    actor: segment
    reference: pivot
    details: The segment is moved from its original side of the pivot to the opposite side. The new position ensures the distance (count of background pixels between segment and pivot) remains the same as in the input. The original location occupied by the segment is replaced by the background color (0).
constraints:
  - pivot_position_constant: True
  - segment_color_constant: True (within a single transformation)
  - segment_length_constant: True (within a single transformation)
  - separation_distance_constant: True (number of background pixels between segment and pivot is preserved)
  - single_pivot: True (exactly one '9' in the input)
  - single_segment: True (exactly one contiguous block of non-zero, non-9 color)
