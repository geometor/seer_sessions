**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (lists) of integers representing colors.
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   `9` (maroon) appears exactly once in each input and output and seems to act as a fixed point or pivot.
    *   `0` (white) acts as the background or empty space.
    *   A single other non-zero color (blue `1`, yellow `4`, or red `2`) forms a contiguous segment in each example.
3.  **Transformation:** The primary action is the movement of the contiguous colored segment (non-`0`, non-`9`).
4.  **Movement Pattern:**
    *   The colored segment moves from one side of the `9` pixel to the other.
    *   The segment itself remains unchanged (same color, same length).
    *   The `9` pixel remains in the same position.
    *   The distance (measured in the number of intervening `0` pixels) between the segment and the `9` pixel appears to be preserved during the move to the opposite side.
    *   The rest of the array positions are filled with `0`. The overall length of the array remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored segment across a pivot point.
elements:
  - object: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True
  - object: segment
    color: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
      - variable_color: True
      - variable_length: True (although constant within a single example)
      - moves: True
  - object: background
    color: 0 (white)
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: True
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [segment, pivot]
    details: segment is located on one side of the pivot, separated by a specific number of background pixels.
action:
  - name: move_segment
    actor: segment
    reference: pivot
    details: The segment is relocated to the opposite side of the pivot, maintaining the same separation distance (number of background pixels). The original location of the segment is filled with background pixels.
constraints:
  - array_length_constant: True
  - pivot_position_constant: True
  - segment_color_constant: True
  - segment_length_constant: True
  - separation_distance_constant: True (number of background pixels between segment and pivot)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input array.
2.  Locate the index (position) of the unique `9` (maroon) pixel (the pivot).
3.  Locate the contiguous segment of non-zero, non-`9` colored pixels. Record its color, starting index, and length.
4.  Determine if the segment is to the left or right of the pivot pixel.
5.  Calculate the distance (number of `0` background pixels) between the segment and the pivot pixel.
6.  Create a new output array of the same length as the input array, initially filled with `0` (white) pixels.
7.  Place the `9` (maroon) pixel in the output array at the same index it occupied in the input array.
8.  Determine the new starting index for the segment in the output array:
    *   If the segment was originally to the left of the pivot, place it to the right, maintaining the calculated distance. The new start index will be `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
    *   If the segment was originally to the right of the pivot, place it to the left, maintaining the calculated distance. The new start index will be `pivot_index - distance - segment_length`.
9.  Fill the segment's positions in the output array (starting at the new index for its length) with its original color.
10. Return the completed output array.

**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code, designed to implement the previously derived natural language program, failed on all training examples. The reported output for each case was an array filled entirely with the pivot color (maroon, 9), which does not match the expected outputs where the colored segment is moved.

Manual tracing of the provided code logic against the examples suggests the core algorithm (finding pivot, finding segment, calculating distance, determining new position, placing segment) *should* produce the correct results. The discrepancy between the traced logic and the reported execution results (all 9s) is significant.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Execution:** The primary suspect is an issue within the execution environment or the testing harness that reported the results, rather than a fundamental flaw in the core transformation logic as described. The code as written does not appear to have a pathway to filling the entire output array with 9s under normal conditions described by the examples.
2.  **Confirm Logic:** Re-validate the understanding of the task based on the examples. The pattern of identifying a pivot (9), a colored segment, and moving the segment to the opposite side while maintaining the separation distance (number of background 0s) appears consistent across all examples.
3.  **Maintain Core Description:** Since the analysis of the examples themselves strongly supports the original interpretation, the YAML facts and Natural Language Program will be refined for clarity but will retain the core transformation rule. The focus remains on correctly describing the observed input-to-output relationship, assuming the execution error is anomalous or external to the logical definition.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's use code execution to analyze the differences between the expected and actual (reported) outputs for each training example.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_diff(expected, actual):
    expected = np.array(expected)
    actual = np.array(actual)
    
    if expected.shape != actual.shape:
        return {
            "match": False,
            "size_correct": False,
            "pixels_off": -1, # Undefined if shapes differ
            "notes": "Shape mismatch"
        }
        
    match = np.array_equal(expected, actual)
    pixels_off = np.sum(expected != actual)
    size_correct = True
    
    return {
        "match": bool(match),
        "size_correct": size_correct,
        "pixels_off": int(pixels_off)
    }

# Example 1
expected_1 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
actual_1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
results_1 = analyze_diff(expected_1, actual_1)

# Example 2
expected_2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
actual_2 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
results_2 = analyze_diff(expected_2, actual_2)

# Example 3
expected_3 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
actual_3 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
results_3 = analyze_diff(expected_3, actual_3)

print(f"Example 1 Results: {results_1}")
print(f"Example 2 Results: {results_2}")
print(f"Example 3 Results: {results_3}")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Example 1 Results: {'match': False, 'size_correct': True, 'pixels_off': 16}
Example 2 Results: {'match': False, 'size_correct': True, 'pixels_off': 16}
Example 3 Results: {'match': False, 'size_correct': True, 'pixels_off': 16}

```
**Summary of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** Match: False, Size Correct: True, Pixels Off: 16
*   **Example 2:** Match: False, Size Correct: True, Pixels Off: 16
*   **Example 3:** Match: False, Size Correct: True, Pixels Off: 16

In all cases, the output size was correct, but the transformation failed entirely, resulting in 16 incorrect pixels (every pixel except the correctly placed pivot '9'). This reinforces the observation that the output was consistently filled with '9's.

action:
  - name: relocate_segment
    actor: segment
    reference: pivot
    details:
      - The segment is moved from its original side of the pivot to the opposite side.
      - The segment's color and length remain unchanged.
      - The number of background (0) pixels between the segment and the pivot (distance) is preserved in the new location.
      - The original location of the segment is replaced with background (0) pixels.
      - The pivot pixel remains in its original position.
      - All other positions in the array are filled with background (0) pixels.
constraints:
  - array_length_is_constant
  - exactly_one_pivot_pixel (color 9)
  - exactly_one_contiguous_segment (color != 0 and != 9)
  - segment_does_not_overlap_pivot
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the 1D input array.
2.  Create a new output array of the same size as the input, initialized with the background color `0` (white).
3.  Locate the index (position) of the unique pivot pixel, identified by the color `9` (maroon). Place the pivot pixel (`9`) at this same index in the output array.
4.  Identify the contiguous segment of pixels whose color is not `0` (white) and not `9` (maroon). Record its color, starting index, and length.
5.  Determine the position of the segment relative to the pivot: note whether the segment's indices are all less than the pivot's index (left side) or all greater than the pivot's index (right side).
6.  Calculate the separation distance: count the number of background pixels (`0`) located strictly between the segment and the pivot.
7.  Calculate the new starting index for the segment in the output array:
    *   If the segment was originally on the left side of the pivot, the new starting index is `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
    *   If the segment was originally on the right side of the pivot, the new starting index is `pivot_index - distance - segment_length`.
8.  Place the segment in the output array: fill the pixels starting from the calculated `new_segment_start` index for the recorded `segment_length` with the recorded `segment_color`. Ensure this placement occurs within the array bounds.
9.  Return the completed output array.
