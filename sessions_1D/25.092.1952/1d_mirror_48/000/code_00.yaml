task_description: Move a colored segment across a pivot point.
elements:
  - object: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True
  - object: segment
    color: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
      - variable_color: True
      - variable_length: True (although constant within a single example)
      - moves: True
  - object: background
    color: 0 (white)
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: True
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [segment, pivot]
    details: segment is located on one side of the pivot, separated by a specific number of background pixels.
action:
  - name: move_segment
    actor: segment
    reference: pivot
    details: The segment is relocated to the opposite side of the pivot, maintaining the same separation distance (number of background pixels). The original location of the segment is filled with background pixels.
constraints:
  - array_length_constant: True
  - pivot_position_constant: True
  - segment_color_constant: True
  - segment_length_constant: True
  - separation_distance_constant: True (number of background pixels between segment and pivot)
