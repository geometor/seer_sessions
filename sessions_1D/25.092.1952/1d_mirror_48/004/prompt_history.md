**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (lists) of integers representing colors.
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   `9` (maroon) appears exactly once in each input and output and seems to act as a fixed point or pivot.
    *   `0` (white) acts as the background or empty space.
    *   A single other non-zero color (blue `1`, yellow `4`, or red `2`) forms a contiguous segment in each example.
3.  **Transformation:** The primary action is the movement of the contiguous colored segment (non-`0`, non-`9`).
4.  **Movement Pattern:**
    *   The colored segment moves from one side of the `9` pixel to the other.
    *   The segment itself remains unchanged (same color, same length).
    *   The `9` pixel remains in the same position.
    *   The distance (measured in the number of intervening `0` pixels) between the segment and the `9` pixel appears to be preserved during the move to the opposite side.
    *   The rest of the array positions are filled with `0`. The overall length of the array remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored segment across a pivot point.
elements:
  - object: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True
  - object: segment
    color: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
      - variable_color: True
      - variable_length: True (although constant within a single example)
      - moves: True
  - object: background
    color: 0 (white)
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: True
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [segment, pivot]
    details: segment is located on one side of the pivot, separated by a specific number of background pixels.
action:
  - name: move_segment
    actor: segment
    reference: pivot
    details: The segment is relocated to the opposite side of the pivot, maintaining the same separation distance (number of background pixels). The original location of the segment is filled with background pixels.
constraints:
  - array_length_constant: True
  - pivot_position_constant: True
  - segment_color_constant: True
  - segment_length_constant: True
  - separation_distance_constant: True (number of background pixels between segment and pivot)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input array.
2.  Locate the index (position) of the unique `9` (maroon) pixel (the pivot).
3.  Locate the contiguous segment of non-zero, non-`9` colored pixels. Record its color, starting index, and length.
4.  Determine if the segment is to the left or right of the pivot pixel.
5.  Calculate the distance (number of `0` background pixels) between the segment and the pivot pixel.
6.  Create a new output array of the same length as the input array, initially filled with `0` (white) pixels.
7.  Place the `9` (maroon) pixel in the output array at the same index it occupied in the input array.
8.  Determine the new starting index for the segment in the output array:
    *   If the segment was originally to the left of the pivot, place it to the right, maintaining the calculated distance. The new start index will be `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
    *   If the segment was originally to the right of the pivot, place it to the left, maintaining the calculated distance. The new start index will be `pivot_index - distance - segment_length`.
9.  Fill the segment's positions in the output array (starting at the new index for its length) with its original color.
10. Return the completed output array.
