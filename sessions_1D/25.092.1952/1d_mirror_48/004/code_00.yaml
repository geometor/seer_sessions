task_description: Move a colored segment relative to a fixed pivot point in a 1D array.
array_properties:
  - type: 1-dimensional
  - element_type: integer (representing colors)
  - constant_length: True (within a single task instance)
elements:
  - object: pivot
    identifier: unique pixel with color 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True (relative to the array bounds)
  - object: segment
    identifier: contiguous block of pixels with the same color, excluding 0 (white) and 9 (maroon)
    count: 1 (per example)
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
      - uniform_color: True (within the segment)
      - variable_color: True (can be 1, 2, 4, etc. across different examples)
      - variable_length: True (can be different lengths across different examples)
      - moves: True
  - object: background
    identifier: pixels with color 0 (white)
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: True
      - acts_as_spacer: True (determines distance)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [segment, pivot]
    properties:
      - side: The segment is located either entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the pivot.
      - distance: Measured by the number of background (0) pixels directly between the end of the segment and the pivot.
action:
  - name: relocate_segment
    actor: segment
    reference: pivot
    details:
      - The segment is moved from its original side of the pivot to the opposite side.
      - The segment's color and length remain unchanged.
      - The number of background (0) pixels between the segment and the pivot (distance) is preserved in the new location.
      - The original location of the segment is replaced with background (0) pixels.
      - The pivot pixel remains in its original position.
      - All other positions in the array are filled with background (0) pixels.
constraints:
  - array_length_is_constant
  - exactly_one_pivot_pixel (color 9)
  - exactly_one_contiguous_segment (color != 0 and != 9)
  - segment_does_not_overlap_pivot
