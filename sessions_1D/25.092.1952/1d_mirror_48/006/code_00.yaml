task_description: Relocate a horizontal colored segment across a pivot point within a 2D grid, preserving horizontal distance.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  shape_constraints: Input and Output shapes are identical (typically 1xN in examples).
elements:
  - object: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True # (row, col) remains constant
  - object: segment
    color: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
    count: 1
    shape: horizontal contiguous block (1xWidth)
    properties:
      - variable_color: True
      - variable_length: True (width varies between examples)
      - moves: True
      - location_constraint: Always found in the same row as the pivot in examples.
  - object: background
    color: 0 (white)
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: True
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [segment, pivot]
    details: Located in the same row. Separated horizontally by a number of background pixels.
action:
  - name: move_segment_horizontally
    actor: segment
    reference: pivot
    details: The segment is relocated horizontally to the opposite side of the pivot's column, within the same row. The number of background pixels horizontally separating the segment and the pivot column is preserved. The original location of the segment is filled with background pixels.
constraints:
  - grid_shape_constant: True
  - pivot_position_constant: True
  - segment_color_constant: True
  - segment_shape_constant: True # (length/width remains the same)
  - segment_row_constant: True # Stays in the same row
  - horizontal_separation_distance_constant: True # (number of background pixels between segment column bounds and pivot column)
