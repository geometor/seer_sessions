Transformation Rule:
Identifies a unique pivot element (color 9) and a single contiguous segment of another color (non-0, non-9) within a 1D numpy array.
The segment is then moved to the opposite side of the pivot element, while maintaining the exact same number of background pixels (color 0) between the segment and the pivot as existed in the input array.
The pivot's position remains fixed. The segment's color and length remain unchanged. All other positions in the output array are filled with the background color (0).
