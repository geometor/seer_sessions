Transformation Rule: Move a contiguous block of non-background (0), non-pivot (9) colored pixels 
relative to a fixed pivot pixel (9) within a 1D array (represented as a 1xN grid). The 
number of background pixels (0) between the object block and the pivot in the input 
determines the spacing between the pivot and the relocated object block in the output.

1.  Receive the input grid (a 1xN NumPy array).
2.  Create the output grid as a NumPy array of the same shape as the input, initialized 
    entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Locate the column index of the single pivot pixel (maroon, 9) in the input grid's 
    row. Let this be `pivot_index`.
4.  Place the pivot pixel (maroon, 9) into the output grid at row 0, column `pivot_index`.
5.  Find the contiguous horizontal block of non-white (not 0), non-pivot (not 9) pixels 
    in the input grid's row. Record the sequence of pixel values in this block 
    (`object_data`) and note its starting and ending column indices in the input row 
    (`object_start_index`, `object_end_index`).
6.  Count the number of background pixels (0) located in the input row strictly between 
    the column `object_end_index + 1` and the column `pivot_index - 1`. Let this count 
    be `gap_size`. (Handle the case where no pixels are between them, `gap_size = 0`).
7.  Calculate the starting column index for the object block in the output grid: 
    `output_object_start_index = pivot_index + gap_size + 1`.
8.  Copy the `object_data` sequence into the output grid's row, starting at column 
    `output_object_start_index`. Ensure the placement does not write beyond the bounds 
    of the grid row.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
