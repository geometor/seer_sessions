The \nnumber of background pixels (0) between the object block and the pivot in the input \ndetermines the spacing between the pivot and the relocated object block in the output.\n\n1.  Receive the input grid (a 1xN NumPy array).\n2.  Create the output grid as a NumPy array of the same shape as the input, initialized \n    entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n3.  Locate the column index of the single pivot pixel (maroon, 9) in the input grid's \n    row. Let this be `pivot_index`.\n4.  Place the pivot pixel (maroon, 9) into the output grid at row 0, column `pivot_index`.\n5.  Find the contiguous horizontal block of non-white (not 0), non-pivot (not 9) pixels \n    in the input grid's row. Record the sequence of pixel values in this block \n    (`object_data`) and note its starting and ending column indices in the input row \n    (`object_start_index`, `object_end_index`).\n6.  Count the number of background pixels (0) located in the input row strictly between \n    the column `object_end_index + 1` and the column `pivot_index - 1`. Let this count \n    be `gap_size`. (Handle the case where no pixels are between them, `gap_size = 0`).\n7.  Calculate the starting column index for the object block in the output grid: \n    `output_object_start_index = pivot_index + gap_size + 1`.\n8.  Copy the `object_data` sequence into the output grid's row, starting at column \n    `output_object_start_index`. Ensure the placement does not write beyond the bounds \n    of the grid row.\n9.  Return the completed output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pivot_index(grid_row: np.ndarray) -> Optional[int]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the pivot element (9) in a 1D array.\"\"\"\n    pivot_indices = np.where(grid_row == 9)[0]\n    if len(pivot_indices) == 1:\n        return pivot_indices[0]\n    return None # Pivot not found or multiple pivots\n\ndef find_object_block(grid_row: np.ndarray) -> Optional[Tuple[np.ndarray, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of non-0, non-9 pixels in a 1D array.\n    Returns the block data (as ndarray), start index, and end index.\n    \"\"\"\n    object_data_list: List[int] = []\n    object_start_index = -1\n    object_end_index = -1\n    in_block = False\n    block_color = -1\n\n    for i, val in enumerate(grid_row):\n        is_object_pixel = (val != 0 and val != 9)\n\n        if is_object_pixel:\n            if not in_block:  # Start of a new block\n                # Check if this is the first block encountered\n                if object_start_index != -1: \n                     # Found a second block, only want the first\n                     object_end_index = i - 1 # Previous index was end\n                     break\n                object_start_index = i\n                block_color = val\n                in_block = True\n                object_data_list.append(val)\n            elif val == block_color: # Continue existing block\n                object_data_list.append(val)\n            else: # Encountered a different color - end of block\n                  object_end_index = i - 1\n                  in_block = False\n                  # Stop after finding the first complete block\n                  break \n        elif in_block: # End of the block (found 0 or 9)\n            object_end_index = i - 1\n            in_block = False\n            # Stop after finding the first complete block\n            break \n\n    # Handle case where block goes to the end of the row\n    if in_block and object_end_index == -1:\n        object_end_index = len(grid_row) - 1\n\n    if object_start_index != -1:\n        return np.array(object_data_list), object_start_index, object_end_index\n    else:\n        return None # No object block found\n\ndef calculate_gap_size(grid_row: np.ndarray, object_end_index: int, pivot_index: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of 0s between the object and the pivot.\"\"\"\n    # Assuming object is before pivot based on examples\n    if object_end_index >= pivot_index - 1:\n         return 0 # No space between or overlapping/adjacent\n\n    gap_slice = grid_row[object_end_index + 1 : pivot_index]\n    gap_size = np.sum(gap_slice == 0)\n    return gap_size\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to move the object block relative to the pivot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate input shape (assuming 1xN or Nx1 for 1D interpretation)\n    if input_grid.shape[0] != 1 and input_grid.shape[1] != 1:\n         # Handle cases not matching the 1D structure observed in examples\n         # For now, assume it's 1xN as seen in training\n         if input_grid.shape[0] > 1:\n            print(f\"Warning: Input grid has shape {input_grid.shape}.
