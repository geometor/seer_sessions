Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the elements:**

1.  **Data Format:** The input and output are presented as sequences of numbers (0-9), representing colors. Although ARC tasks usually involve 2D grids, these examples strongly suggest a 1D array or sequence manipulation, as the number of elements (26) doesn't easily form a standard small grid, and the transformation seems linear.
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   `0` (white) acts as the background or empty space.
    *   `9` (maroon) appears exactly once in each input and seems to act as a fixed point or pivot.
    *   Other colors (`5` gray, `4` yellow, `1` blue) form contiguous blocks.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   **Pivot:** A single maroon pixel (`9`). Its position remains unchanged in the output.
    *   **Object Block:** A contiguous sequence of identical non-white, non-maroon pixels (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5 5`, `4 4 4 4 4 4`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`). This block is present in the input and is relocated in the output.
    *   **Background/Gap:** White pixels (`0`) fill the rest of the space. The number of white pixels between the Object Block and the Pivot seems important.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The core transformation involves moving the Object Block.
    *   The Pivot pixel (`9`) stays in its original position.
    *   The Object Block is removed from its original position (implicitly filled with white `0`s).
    *   The Object Block is placed in the output array *after* the Pivot pixel.
    *   Crucially, the number of white (`0`) pixels that separated the end of the Object Block and the Pivot in the input is preserved as a gap between the Pivot and the start of the relocated Object Block in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored block relative to a fixed pivot point in a 1D array, preserving the gap between them.
elements:
  - type: Array
    description: Input and Output are 1D arrays of color pixels.
    properties:
      - length: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 26 in examples).
      - values: Integers 0-9 representing colors.
  - type: Pivot Pixel
    description: A single pixel with a specific color (maroon, value 9).
    properties:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
      - count: Exactly one per array.
    relationships:
      - Its position relative to the start/end of the array.
      - Its position relative to the Object Block.
    actions:
      - Remains in its original index position in the output array.
  - type: Object Block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels, excluding white (0) and the Pivot color (9).
    properties:
      - contiguity: Pixels are adjacent in the 1D array.
      - uniformity: All pixels within the block have the same color.
      - color: Varies per example (e.g., 5, 4, 1), but is not 0 or 9.
      - count: Exactly one block per array (in examples).
    relationships:
      - Its position (start and end index) relative to the Pivot Pixel.
    actions:
      - Is removed from its original location in the input.
      - Is placed in the output array.
  - type: Gap
    description: The sequence of white (0) pixels between the Object Block and the Pivot Pixel in the input array.
    properties:
      - content: Consists only of white (0) pixels.
      - size: The number of white pixels in the sequence. Can be zero or more.
    relationships:
      - Located spatially between the Object Block and the Pivot.
    actions:
      - The size of this gap is preserved in the output.
      - In the output, a gap of the same size (number of 0s) is placed between the Pivot Pixel and the relocated Object Block.
transformation:
  input: 1D Array
  output: 1D Array
  steps:
    - Identify the index (`pivot_index`) of the Pivot Pixel (maroon, 9).
    - Identify the Object Block (contiguous, non-white, non-maroon pixels), its pixel values (`object_data`), start index (`object_start`), and end index (`object_end`).
    - Calculate the `gap_size` (number of white pixels) between `object_end` and `pivot_index` in the input array. Handle cases where the object is before or after the pivot.
    - Create a new array of the same length as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
    - Place the Pivot Pixel (9) at `pivot_index` in the new array.
    - Calculate the starting position for the relocated Object Block: `new_object_start = pivot_index + gap_size + 1`.
    - Place the `object_data` into the new array starting at `new_object_start`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Find the index of the single pivot pixel (the maroon '9') in the input array. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Place the pivot pixel (maroon '9') into the output array at `pivot_index`.
4.  Find the contiguous block of non-white (not '0'), non-pivot (not '9') pixels in the input array. Record the sequence of pixel values in this block (`object_data`) and note its start and end indices in the input (`object_start_index`, `object_end_index`).
5.  Determine the number of background pixels ('0') located strictly between the object block and the pivot pixel in the input array. Let this count be `gap_size`. If the object ends at index `i` and the pivot is at index `j > i`, the gap size is the number of zeros between index `i+1` and `j-1`. If the pivot is at index `j` and the object starts at index `k > j`, the gap size is the number of zeros between index `j+1` and `k-1`. (Based on the examples, the object always appears before the pivot).
6.  Calculate the starting index for the object block in the output array: `output_object_start_index = pivot_index + gap_size + 1`.
7.  Place the `object_data` sequence into the output array, starting at `output_object_start_index`.

Transformation Rule:
Move a contiguous block of non-background (0), non-pivot (9) colored pixels 
relative to a fixed pivot pixel (9) within a 1D array.

1.  Identify the single pivot pixel (maroon '9') and its index (`pivot_index`).
2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels with the same color, which is neither 
    white ('0') nor maroon ('9'). Record its color, data (`object_data`), 
    start index (`object_start_index`), and end index (`object_end_index`).
3.  Calculate the number of background pixels ('0') strictly between the end of the 
    object block and the pivot pixel in the input array (`gap_size`). Based on the 
    examples, the object appears before the pivot.
4.  Initialize an output array of the same size as the input, filled with the 
    background color (white '0').
5.  Place the pivot pixel ('9') at `pivot_index` in the output array.
6.  Calculate the starting index for the object block in the output array: 
    `output_object_start_index = pivot_index + gap_size + 1`.
7.  Place the `object_data` into the output array, starting at 
    `output_object_start_index`.
