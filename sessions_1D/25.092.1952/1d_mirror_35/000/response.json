            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of the elements:**\n\n1.  **Data Format:** The input and output are presented as sequences of numbers (0-9), representing colors. Although ARC tasks usually involve 2D grids, these examples strongly suggest a 1D array or sequence manipulation, as the number of elements (26) doesn't easily form a standard small grid, and the transformation seems linear.\n2.  **Key Colors:**\n    *   `0` (white) acts as the background or empty space.\n    *   `9` (maroon) appears exactly once in each input and seems to act as a fixed point or pivot.\n    *   Other colors (`5` gray, `4` yellow, `1` blue) form contiguous blocks.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Pivot:** A single maroon pixel (`9`). Its position remains unchanged in the output.\n    *   **Object Block:** A contiguous sequence of identical non-white, non-maroon pixels (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5 5`, `4 4 4 4 4 4`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`). This block is present in the input and is relocated in the output.\n    *   **Background/Gap:** White pixels (`0`) fill the rest of the space. The number of white pixels between the Object Block and the Pivot seems important.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The core transformation involves moving the Object Block.\n    *   The Pivot pixel (`9`) stays in its original position.\n    *   The Object Block is removed from its original position (implicitly filled with white `0`s).\n    *   The Object Block is placed in the output array *after* the Pivot pixel.\n    *   Crucially, the number of white (`0`) pixels that separated the end of the Object Block and the Pivot in the input is preserved as a gap between the Pivot and the start of the relocated Object Block in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find the index of the single pivot pixel (the maroon '9') in the input array. Let this be `pivot_index`.\n3.  Place the pivot pixel (maroon '9') into the output array at `pivot_index`.\n4.  Find the contiguous block of non-white (not '0'), non-pivot (not '9') pixels in the input array. Record the sequence of pixel values in this block (`object_data`) and note its start and end indices in the input (`object_start_index`, `object_end_index`).\n5.  Determine the number of background pixels ('0') located strictly between the object block and the pivot pixel in the input array. Let this count be `gap_size`. If the object ends at index `i` and the pivot is at index `j > i`, the gap size is the number of zeros between index `i+1` and `j-1`. If the pivot is at index `j` and the object starts at index `k > j`, the gap size is the number of zeros between index `j+1` and `k-1`. (Based on the examples, the object always appears before the pivot).\n6.  Calculate the starting index for the object block in the output array: `output_object_start_index = pivot_index + gap_size + 1`.\n7.  Place the `object_data` sequence into the output array, starting at `output_object_start_index`."
