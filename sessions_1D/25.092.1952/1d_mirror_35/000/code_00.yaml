task_description: Move a colored block relative to a fixed pivot point in a 1D array, preserving the gap between them.
elements:
  - type: Array
    description: Input and Output are 1D arrays of color pixels.
    properties:
      - length: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 26 in examples).
      - values: Integers 0-9 representing colors.
  - type: Pivot Pixel
    description: A single pixel with a specific color (maroon, value 9).
    properties:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
      - count: Exactly one per array.
    relationships:
      - Its position relative to the start/end of the array.
      - Its position relative to the Object Block.
    actions:
      - Remains in its original index position in the output array.
  - type: Object Block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels, excluding white (0) and the Pivot color (9).
    properties:
      - contiguity: Pixels are adjacent in the 1D array.
      - uniformity: All pixels within the block have the same color.
      - color: Varies per example (e.g., 5, 4, 1), but is not 0 or 9.
      - count: Exactly one block per array (in examples).
    relationships:
      - Its position (start and end index) relative to the Pivot Pixel.
    actions:
      - Is removed from its original location in the input.
      - Is placed in the output array.
  - type: Gap
    description: The sequence of white (0) pixels between the Object Block and the Pivot Pixel in the input array.
    properties:
      - content: Consists only of white (0) pixels.
      - size: The number of white pixels in the sequence. Can be zero or more.
    relationships:
      - Located spatially between the Object Block and the Pivot.
    actions:
      - The size of this gap is preserved in the output.
      - In the output, a gap of the same size (number of 0s) is placed between the Pivot Pixel and the relocated Object Block.
transformation:
  input: 1D Array
  output: 1D Array
  steps:
    - Identify the index (`pivot_index`) of the Pivot Pixel (maroon, 9).
    - Identify the Object Block (contiguous, non-white, non-maroon pixels), its pixel values (`object_data`), start index (`object_start`), and end index (`object_end`).
    - Calculate the `gap_size` (number of white pixels) between `object_end` and `pivot_index` in the input array. Handle cases where the object is before or after the pivot.
    - Create a new array of the same length as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
    - Place the Pivot Pixel (9) at `pivot_index` in the new array.
    - Calculate the starting position for the relocated Object Block: `new_object_start = pivot_index + gap_size + 1`.
    - Place the `object_data` into the new array starting at `new_object_start`.
