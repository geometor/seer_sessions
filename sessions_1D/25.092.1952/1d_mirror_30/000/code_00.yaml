task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: pivot
    identifier: maroon_pixel
    properties:
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
      position: fixed (remains same in output)
    role: center_of_transformation
  - object_type: line
    identifier: colored_line
    properties:
      color: variable (non-white, non-maroon)
      count: 1
      shape: contiguous_horizontal_segment
      length: variable
      position: variable
    role: object_being_transformed
transformation:
  action: reflection
  actor: colored_line
  reference_point: position of maroon_pixel
  details: Each pixel of the colored_line is moved to a new position such that its distance and direction from the maroon_pixel are reversed.
constraints:
  - The maroon_pixel's position does not change.
  - The colored_line's color and length do not change.
  - The colored_line does not overlap the maroon_pixel in input or output.
