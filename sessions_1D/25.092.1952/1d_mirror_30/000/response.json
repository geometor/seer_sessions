Its position remains unchanged between input and output.\n    *   A line object: A contiguous sequence of pixels of a single color (yellow, orange, or red in the examples), distinct from white and maroon.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the line object. Its position changes relative to the pivot pixel. Comparing the input and output, the line object appears to be reflected or mirrored across the position of the maroon pivot pixel. The color and length of the line object remain the same.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Locate the index (position) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Place a maroon pixel at the *same* index in the output grid. Let this index be `maroon_index`.\n3.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white, non-maroon pixels in the input grid. Note their color (`line_color`) and their indices.\n4.  For each pixel belonging to this colored line at index `i` in the input grid:\n    a.  Calculate the pixel's displacement relative to the maroon pixel: `displacement = i - maroon_index`.\n    b.  Calculate the new index for this pixel in the output grid by reflecting the displacement: `new_index = maroon_index - displacement`. (Alternatively: `new_index = 2 * maroon_index - i`).\n    c.
