task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D # Specifically 1xN
  grid_shape: constant (1 row, variable columns) # All examples are 1x25
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: pivot
    identifier: maroon_pixel
    properties:
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
      shape: single_pixel
      position: fixed (row 0, column index varies but is same in input/output)
    role: center_of_transformation
  - object_type: line
    identifier: colored_line_segment
    properties:
      color: variable (non-white, non-maroon; e.g., yellow(4), orange(7), red(2))
      count: 1
      shape: contiguous_horizontal_segment (within row 0)
      length: variable (e.g., 6 pixels in all examples)
      position: variable (column indices change)
    role: object_being_transformed
transformation:
  action: reflection
  actor: colored_line_segment
  reference_point: column index of the maroon_pixel
  axis_of_reflection: vertical line passing through the maroon_pixel
  details: Each pixel of the colored_line segment, located at column 'c_in' in the input, is moved to a new column 'c_out' in the output. The relationship is c_out = pivot_col - (c_in - pivot_col), or c_out = 2 * pivot_col - c_in. The row index remains 0.
constraints:
  - The grid structure is always 1 row.
  - The maroon_pixel's position (row 0, specific column) does not change.
  - The colored_line_segment's color and length do not change.
  - The colored_line_segment exists entirely within row 0.
  - The colored_line_segment does not overlap the maroon_pixel in input or output.
