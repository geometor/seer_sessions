Previous Code:
```python
"""
Reflect a colored line object across a stationary maroon pivot pixel in a 1D grid.

The input is a 1D grid (represented as a list of integers) containing:
- Background pixels (white, 0).
- A single pivot pixel (maroon, 9).
- A contiguous line object of a single color (non-white, non-maroon).

The transformation performs the following steps:
1. Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (0).
2. Locate the index of the maroon pivot pixel (9) in the input grid.
3. Place the maroon pixel at the same index in the output grid.
4. Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the line object) in the input grid, noting their color and indices.
5. For each pixel of the line object at index 'i' in the input:
   a. Calculate its displacement relative to the maroon pixel's index ('maroon_index'): displacement = i - maroon_index.
   b. Calculate the new index for this pixel in the output grid by reflecting the displacement: new_index = maroon_index - displacement.
   c. Place a pixel of the line object's color at 'new_index' in the output grid.
6. Return the completed output grid.
