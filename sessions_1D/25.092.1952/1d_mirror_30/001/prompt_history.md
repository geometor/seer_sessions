Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (or single rows).
2.  **Key Pixels:** Each grid contains three types of pixels:
    *   Background pixels: Represented by white (0).
    *   A single pivot pixel: Represented by maroon (9). Its position remains unchanged between input and output.
    *   A line object: A contiguous sequence of pixels of a single color (yellow, orange, or red in the examples), distinct from white and maroon.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the line object. Its position changes relative to the pivot pixel. Comparing the input and output, the line object appears to be reflected or mirrored across the position of the maroon pivot pixel. The color and length of the line object remain the same.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: pivot
    identifier: maroon_pixel
    properties:
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
      position: fixed (remains same in output)
    role: center_of_transformation
  - object_type: line
    identifier: colored_line
    properties:
      color: variable (non-white, non-maroon)
      count: 1
      shape: contiguous_horizontal_segment
      length: variable
      position: variable
    role: object_being_transformed
transformation:
  action: reflection
  actor: colored_line
  reference_point: position of maroon_pixel
  details: Each pixel of the colored_line is moved to a new position such that its distance and direction from the maroon_pixel are reversed.
constraints:
  - The maroon_pixel's position does not change.
  - The colored_line's color and length do not change.
  - The colored_line does not overlap the maroon_pixel in input or output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the index (position) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Place a maroon pixel at the *same* index in the output grid. Let this index be `maroon_index`.
3.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white, non-maroon pixels in the input grid. Note their color (`line_color`) and their indices.
4.  For each pixel belonging to this colored line at index `i` in the input grid:
    a.  Calculate the pixel's displacement relative to the maroon pixel: `displacement = i - maroon_index`.
    b.  Calculate the new index for this pixel in the output grid by reflecting the displacement: `new_index = maroon_index - displacement`. (Alternatively: `new_index = 2 * maroon_index - i`).
    c.  Place a pixel of `line_color` at `new_index` in the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
