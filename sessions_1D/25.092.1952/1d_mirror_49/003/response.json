Identifies a single maroon (9) pixel which acts as a fixed pivot point.\n2. Identifies a single contiguous block (object) of a non-white (0), non-maroon (9) color.\n3. Calculates the gap (number of white pixels) between the object and the maroon pivot.\n4. Moves the object to the opposite side of the maroon pivot in the output grid, maintaining the original gap size.\n5. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, with the maroon pivot in its original position and the object relocated.
