For instance, if the object was 1 white pixel away from the maroon pixel on the left, it moves to be 1 white pixel away on the right. If it was 3 white pixels away on the left, it moves to be 3 white pixels away on the right.\n    *   The color and size (length) of the object remain unchanged.\n4.  **Invariance:** The grid dimensions, the position of the maroon pixel, and the object's properties (color, size) are invariant. The background pixels are rearranged to accommodate the object's new position.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
