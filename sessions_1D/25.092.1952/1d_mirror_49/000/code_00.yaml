Grid:
  type: 1D array (row vector)
  dimensions: Constant (1x19 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)

Elements:
  - type: Separator
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    position: Fixed between input and output
    role: Acts as a pivot point for rearrangement

  - type: Object
    color: Any non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., blue, green, red)
    shape: Contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color (constant)
      - size/length (constant)
      - position (changes relative to the separator)

Relationships:
  - Object_Separator_Proximity:
    description: The object is separated from the separator by a gap of one or more white pixels.
    property: gap_size (number of white pixels between object and separator)
    state: Preserved during transformation

Actions:
  - Move_Object:
    target: Object
    reference: Separator
    rule: Move the object to the opposite side of the separator.
    constraint: Maintain the original gap_size between the object and the separator in the new position.
    effect: The object occupies a new range of indices in the output grid, mirrored across the separator relative to its gap.

Output_Construction:
  - Initialize: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).
  - Place_Separator: Copy the separator (maroon pixel) to its original position in the output grid.
  - Place_Moved_Object: Place the object (with original color and size) in its calculated new position in the output grid, maintaining the original gap relative to the separator.
