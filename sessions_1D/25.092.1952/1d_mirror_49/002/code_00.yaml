Grid:
  type: 1D array (list of integers)
  dimensions: Constant (1x19 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)

Elements:
  - type: Pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    position: Fixed relative to the grid boundaries.
    role: Acts as a central reference point for the transformation.

  - type: Object
    color: Any non-white, non-maroon color (blue=1, green=3, red=2 in examples)
    shape: Contiguous horizontal block (sequence of identical pixels)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color (invariant)
      - length (invariant)
      - position (changes relative to the pivot)

Relationships:
  - Object_Pivot_Separation:
    description: The object is separated from the pivot by a gap of zero or more white pixels.
    property: gap_size (number of white pixels strictly between the object's nearest edge and the pivot)
    state: Invariant during transformation.

Actions:
  - Relocate_Object:
    target: Object
    reference: Pivot
    rule: Move the object from its original side of the pivot (left or right) to the opposite side.
    constraint: Maintain the original gap_size between the object's nearest edge and the pivot in the new location.
    effect: The object occupies a new range of indices in the output grid.

Output_Construction:
  - Initialize: Create an output grid (1D list) of the same length as the input, filled with the background color (white).
  - Place_Pivot: Copy the pivot (maroon pixel) to its original index in the output grid.
  - Calculate_New_Position: Determine the required start and end indices for the relocated object based on the pivot index, object length, original side (left/right), and the invariant gap_size.
  - Place_Relocated_Object: Fill the calculated range of indices in the output grid with the object's original color.
