Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are both single rows (1-dimensional grids) of the same length (19 pixels in these examples).
2.  **Key Elements:** Each grid contains:
    *   A background of white pixels (0).
    *   Exactly one maroon pixel (9).
    *   A single contiguous block (object) of another color (blue=1, green=3, red=2).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement based on the position of the maroon pixel.
    *   The maroon pixel (9) acts as a fixed pivot or separator; its position remains unchanged between input and output.
    *   The colored object (blue, green, or red block) moves from one side of the maroon pixel to the other side.
    *   The distance (number of white pixels) between the object and the maroon pixel seems to be preserved during this move. For instance, if the object was 1 white pixel away from the maroon pixel on the left, it moves to be 1 white pixel away on the right. If it was 3 white pixels away on the left, it moves to be 3 white pixels away on the right.
    *   The color and size (length) of the object remain unchanged.
4.  **Invariance:** The grid dimensions, the position of the maroon pixel, and the object's properties (color, size) are invariant. The background pixels are rearranged to accommodate the object's new position.

## Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  type: 1D array (row vector)
  dimensions: Constant (1x19 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)

Elements:
  - type: Separator
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    position: Fixed between input and output
    role: Acts as a pivot point for rearrangement

  - type: Object
    color: Any non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., blue, green, red)
    shape: Contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color (constant)
      - size/length (constant)
      - position (changes relative to the separator)

Relationships:
  - Object_Separator_Proximity:
    description: The object is separated from the separator by a gap of one or more white pixels.
    property: gap_size (number of white pixels between object and separator)
    state: Preserved during transformation

Actions:
  - Move_Object:
    target: Object
    reference: Separator
    rule: Move the object to the opposite side of the separator.
    constraint: Maintain the original gap_size between the object and the separator in the new position.
    effect: The object occupies a new range of indices in the output grid, mirrored across the separator relative to its gap.

Output_Construction:
  - Initialize: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).
  - Place_Separator: Copy the separator (maroon pixel) to its original position in the output grid.
  - Place_Moved_Object: Place the object (with original color and size) in its calculated new position in the output grid, maintaining the original gap relative to the separator.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the index (position) of the single maroon (9) pixel within the input row. This position remains fixed in the output.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the "object"). Record its color, its starting index, and its ending index.
3.  Determine if the object is located to the left or the right of the maroon pixel by comparing their indices.
4.  Calculate the gap size: the number of white (0) pixels strictly between the object and the maroon pixel.
5.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
6.  Place the maroon (9) pixel in the output row at the same index it occupied in the input row.
7.  Calculate the new position for the object in the output row:
    *   If the object was originally to the left of the maroon pixel, its new starting index will be `maroon_index + gap_size + 1`.
    *   If the object was originally to the right of the maroon pixel, its new ending index will be `maroon_index - gap_size - 1`. Calculate the corresponding starting index based on the object's length.
8.  Fill the calculated range of indices in the output row with the object's original color.
