**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 1-dimensional arrays (1x18).
2.  **Key Colors:** Three colors are primarily involved: white (0), maroon (9), and another color (yellow - 4 in this example, gray - 5 in others).
3.  **Persistent Elements:**
    *   A single maroon pixel (9) acts as a fixed reference point or marker. Its position does not change between input and output.
    *   A contiguous block of a non-white, non-maroon color exists (e.g., `4 4 4 4 4`). This block constitutes the primary "object" being manipulated.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the colored object block.
    *   In the input, the object block (`4 4 4 4 4`) is located at the beginning (indices 0-4).
    *   The marker pixel (`9`) is at index 6.
    *   In the output, the marker pixel (`9`) remains at index 6.
    *   The object block (`4 4 4 4 4`) is now located starting at index 8.
    *   The original location of the object block is filled with white pixels (0).
5.  **Relative Positioning:** The object block moves from its original position to a new position relative to the fixed maroon marker. Specifically, it moves to the position starting two indices *after* the marker's index (Marker at index `i`, Object starts at index `i+2`). The space between the marker and the object (index `i+1`) is filled with a white pixel.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - grid_dimensions:
      type: ثابت # constant
      value: 1x18 (inferred from example)
  - background_color:
      id: 0
      name: white
  - marker:
      id: 9
      name: maroon
      shape: single pixel
      role: fixed reference point
      property: position remains unchanged
  - movable_object:
      property: contiguous block of pixels
      color: non-white and non-maroon (e.g., 4 - yellow, 5 - gray)
      role: element to be relocated
      relationship_to_marker_input: varies
      relationship_to_marker_output: starts two positions after the marker's index
  - action:
      type: move
      target: movable_object
      destination: new position relative to the marker
      details:
        - The original position of the movable_object is filled with the background_color (white).
        - The new position starts two indices after the marker's index.
        - The index immediately following the marker becomes background_color (white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid; note its index (marker_index).
2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor maroon (9); note its pixels (object_pixels) and its starting index (original_start_index) and ending index (original_end_index).
3.  Create a new grid identical to the input grid.
4.  Fill the cells in the new grid from original_start_index to original_end_index with white (0) pixels.
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the object block as `new_start_index = marker_index + 2`.
6.  Place the object_pixels into the new grid starting at `new_start_index`.
