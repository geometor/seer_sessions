Its position does not change between input and output.\n    *   A contiguous block of a non-white, non-maroon color exists (e.g., `4 4 4 4 4`). This block constitutes the primary \"object\" being manipulated.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the colored object block.\n    *   In the input, the object block (`4 4 4 4 4`) is located at the beginning (indices 0-4).\n    *   The marker pixel (`9`) is at index 6.\n    *   In the output, the marker pixel (`9`) remains at index 6.\n    *   The object block (`4 4 4 4 4`) is now located starting at index 8.\n    *   The original location of the object block is filled with white pixels (0).\n5.  **Relative Positioning:** The object block moves from its original position to a new position relative to the fixed maroon marker. Specifically, it moves to the position starting two indices *after* the marker's index (Marker at index `i`, Object starts at index `i+2`). The space between the marker and the object (index `i+1`) is filled with a white pixel.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
