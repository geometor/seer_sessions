            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the key components (marker, object, background) and the nature of the transformation (moving the object relative to the marker). However, the specific formula derived initially (`marker_index + 2`) was based only on the first example and proved incorrect for the others. The subsequent code used a different formula (`2 * marker_index - original_end_index`), which, as confirmed by manual tracing and code execution simulation, correctly describes the transformation for all provided training examples.\n\nThe error encountered during testing (`ValueError: The truth value of an array...`) indicates an issue not with the core logic (the reflection formula) but likely with the implementation's handling of data types, specifically assuming list input while potentially receiving a NumPy array, leading to ambiguous boolean comparisons. The strategy is to refine the implementation to explicitly handle the input as a 1D list of integers and apply the validated reflection formula.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by simulating the transformation logic derived from the examples (`new_start_index = (2 * marker_index) - original_end_index`) on the training data.\n\n"

The color itself varies (yellow-4, gray-5). Its length and position also vary.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The object's position is transformed relative to the marker. The simulation confirms that calculating the new start index as `(2 * marker_index) - original_end_index` correctly predicts the object's position in the output for all examples. This represents a reflection of the object across the marker, where the marker acts as the center of symmetry. The original position of the object is filled with the background color (white, 0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
