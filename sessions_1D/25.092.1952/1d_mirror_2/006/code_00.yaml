task_elements:
  - grid_representation:
      type: 1D array (list of integers)
      dimensions: variable, consistently 1x18 in examples
  - background_color:
      id: 0
      name: white
      role: fills empty space, replaces original object location
  - marker:
      id: 9
      name: maroon
      shape: single pixel
      quantity: exactly one per grid
      role: fixed point of reference for transformation
      property: position remains unchanged between input and output
  - movable_object:
      definition: the first contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither background (0) nor marker (9)
      properties:
        - color: varies (e.g., 4 - yellow, 5 - gray) but consistent within the block
        - length: varies
        - start_index: varies (original_start_index)
        - end_index: varies (original_end_index)
      quantity: exactly one per grid (based on examples)
      role: element to be repositioned
  - action:
      type: reflect and move
      target: movable_object
      reference: marker position (marker_index)
      destination_rule:
        - Calculate the new start index: `new_start_index = (2 * marker_index) - original_end_index`
      details:
        - Create a new grid filled with the background_color.
        - Place the marker at its original `marker_index` in the new grid.
        - Place the `movable_object` (sequence of pixels) into the new grid starting at `new_start_index`.
