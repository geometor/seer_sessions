Identifies the first contiguous block of pixels (the 'object') whose color is neither background (white, 0) nor the marker color. Notes the object's pixel sequence (`object_pixels`) and its ending index in the input grid (`original_end_index`).\n3. Creates a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n4. Places the marker pixel at its original index (`marker_index`) in the new grid.\n5. Calculates a new starting index for the object (`new_start_index`) using the formula: `new_start_index = (2 * marker_index) - original_end_index`. This effectively reflects the object's position relative to the marker, mapping the original end position to the new start position.\n6. Places the object's pixels (`object_pixels`) into the new grid, starting at the calculated `new_start_index`.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\n# Define constants for colors used in this task\nBACKGROUND_COLOR = 0\nMARKER_COLOR = 9\n\ndef find_marker_index(grid: List[int], marker_color: int) -> Optional[int]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the first occurrence of the marker color.\"\"\"\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        if pixel == marker_color:\n            return i\n    return None # Marker not found\n\ndef find_object(grid: List[int], exclude_colors: List[int]) -> Optional[Tuple[List[int], int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of pixels whose color is not in exclude_colors.\n    Searches from the beginning of the grid.\n    Returns: A tuple containing (object_pixels, start_index, end_index) or None if no such object is found.\n             object_pixels: A list of the pixel values forming the object.\n             start_index: The starting index of the object in the grid.\n             end_index: The ending index of the object in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    object_pixels = []\n    start_index = -1\n    end_index = -1\n    current_object_color = -1\n\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        is_excluded = pixel in exclude_colors\n        \n        if not is_excluded: # Pixel is part of a potential object\n            if start_index == -1: # Start of a new potential object\n                start_index = i\n                current_object_color = pixel\n                object_pixels.append(pixel)\n            elif pixel == current_object_color: # Continuing the current object\n                object_pixels.append(pixel)\n            else: # Found a different non-excluded color, the previous object ends here\n                end_index = i - 1\n                # We only care about the *first* object found\n                return object_pixels, start_index, end_index\n        elif start_index != -1: # Pixel is excluded, marks the end of the current object\n            end_index = i - 1\n            # We only care about the *first* object found\n            return object_pixels, start_index, end_index\n\n    # Check if an object was found and extends to the end of the grid\n    if start_index != -1:\n        end_index = len(grid) - 1\n        return object_pixels, start_index, end_index\n\n    # No object found matching the criteria\n    return None\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the reflection transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid_size = len(input_grid)\n    exclude_colors = [BACKGROUND_COLOR, MARKER_COLOR]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Initialize Output Grid ---\n    # Create a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color\n    output_grid = [BACKGROUND_COLOR] * grid_size\n\n    # --- Step 2: Find Marker ---\n    # Identify the single marker pixel (maroon, 9) and its index\n    marker_index = find_marker_index(input_grid, MARKER_COLOR)\n    \n    # Handle case where marker is not found (though examples suggest it's always present)\n    if marker_index is None:\n        # print(\"Warning: Marker pixel not found.
