```python
"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on a reflection rule around a marker pixel.
1. Identifies a single 'marker' pixel (maroon, 9) and its index (`marker_index`).
2. Identifies the first contiguous block of pixels (the 'object') whose color is neither background (white, 0) nor the marker color. Notes the object's pixel sequence (`object_pixels`) and its ending index in the input grid (`original_end_index`).
3. Creates a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color (white, 0).
4. Places the marker pixel at its original index (`marker_index`) in the new grid.
5. Calculates a new starting index for the object (`new_start_index`) using the formula: `new_start_index = (2 * marker_index) - original_end_index`. This effectively reflects the object's position relative to the marker.
6. Places the object's pixels (`object_pixels`) into the new grid, starting at the calculated `new_start_index`, ensuring placement stays within grid boundaries.
