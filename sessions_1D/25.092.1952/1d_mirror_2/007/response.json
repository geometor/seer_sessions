Identifies a single 'marker' pixel (maroon, 9) and its index (`marker_index`).\n2. Identifies the first contiguous block of pixels (the 'object') whose color is neither background (white, 0) nor the marker color. Notes the object's pixel sequence (`object_pixels`) and its ending index in the input grid (`original_end_index`).\n3. Creates a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n4. Places the marker pixel at its original index (`marker_index`) in the new grid.\n5. Calculates a new starting index for the object (`new_start_index`) using the formula: `new_start_index = (2 * marker_index) - original_end_index`. This effectively reflects the object's position relative to the marker.\n6. Places the object's pixels (`object_pixels`) into the new grid, starting at the calculated `new_start_index`, ensuring placement stays within grid boundaries.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\n# Define constants for colors used in this task\nBACKGROUND_COLOR = 0\nMARKER_COLOR = 9\n\ndef find_marker_index(grid: List[int], marker_color: int) -> Optional[int]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the first occurrence of the marker color.\"\"\"\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        if pixel == marker_color:\n            return i\n    return None # Marker not found\n\ndef find_object(grid: List[int], exclude_colors: List[int]) -> Optional[Tuple[List[int], int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of pixels whose color is not in exclude_colors.\n    Searches from the beginning of the grid.\n    Returns: A tuple containing (object_pixels, start_index, end_index) or None if no such object is found.\n             object_pixels: A list of the pixel values forming the object.\n             start_index: The starting index of the object in the grid.\n             end_index: The ending index of the object in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    object_pixels = []\n    start_index = -1\n    end_index = -1\n    current_object_color = -1\n\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        is_excluded = pixel in exclude_colors\n        \n        if not is_excluded: # Pixel is part of a potential object\n            if start_index == -1: # Start of a new potential object\n                start_index = i\n                current_object_color = pixel\n                object_pixels.append(pixel)\n            elif pixel == current_object_color: # Continuing the current object\n                object_pixels.append(pixel)\n            else: # Found a different non-excluded color, the previous object ends here\n                end_index = i - 1\n                # We only care about the *first* object found\n                return object_pixels, start_index, end_index\n        elif start_index != -1: # Pixel is excluded, marks the end of the current object\n            end_index = i - 1\n            # We only care about the *first* object found\n            return object_pixels, start_index, end_index\n\n    # Check if an object was found and extends to the end of the grid\n    if start_index != -1:\n        end_index = len(grid) - 1\n        return object_pixels, start_index, end_index\n\n    # No object found matching the criteria\n    return None\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the reflection transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Initialization ---\n    grid_size = len(input_grid)\n    exclude_colors = [BACKGROUND_COLOR, MARKER_COLOR]\n    # Initialize output_grid with the background color\n    output_grid = [BACKGROUND_COLOR] * grid_size\n\n    # --- Find Marker ---\n    # Find the index of the marker pixel (color 9)\n    marker_index = find_marker_index(input_grid, MARKER_COLOR)\n    \n    # If marker not found, return the initialized background grid (or handle as error)\n    if marker_index is None:\n        # print(\"Warning: Marker pixel not found.\") \n        return output_grid \n\n    # --- Place Marker ---\n    # Place the marker pixel into the output grid at its original index\n    # Basic bounds check, although marker_index should be valid if found\n    if 0 <= marker_index < grid_size:\n         output_grid[marker_index] = MARKER_COLOR\n\n    # --- Find Object ---\n    # Find the first contiguous object (non-background, non-marker)\n    object_info = find_object(input_grid, exclude_colors)\n\n    # If object not found, return the grid with only the marker placed\n    if object_info is None:\n        # print(\"Warning: Movable object not found.\")\n        return output_grid \n\n    object_pixels, _original_start_index, original_end_index = object_info\n    object_length = len(object_pixels)\n\n    # --- Calculate New Position ---\n    # Calculate the new starting index using the reflection formula: new_start = 2 * marker - original_end\n    new_start_index = (2 * marker_index) - original_end_index\n\n    # --- Place Object ---\n    # Place the object's pixels into the output grid starting at the new index\n    # Iterate and place pixel by pixel, checking bounds for each placement\n    for i in range(object_length):\n        current_output_index = new_start_index + i\n        # Check if the calculated index is valid for the output grid\n        if 0 <= current_output_index < grid_size:\n            output_grid[current_output_index] = object_pixels[i]\n        # else: # Optional: Log if object pixels fall out of bounds\n            # print(f\"Warning: Object pixel placement out of bounds at index {current_output_index}.\")\n\n    # --- Return Result ---\n    return output_grid\n```"
