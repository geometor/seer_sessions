Identifies the first contiguous block of pixels (the 'object') whose color is neither background (white, 0) nor the marker color. Notes the object's pixel sequence (`object_pixels`), start index (`original_start_index`), and end index (`original_end_index`).\n3. Calculates a new starting index for the object using the formula: `new_start_index = 2 * marker_index - original_end_index`.\n4. Creates a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color.\n5. Places the marker pixel at its original index (`marker_index`) in the new grid.\n6. Places the object's pixels (`object_pixels`) into the new grid, starting at the calculated `new_start_index`.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\n# Define constants for colors\nBACKGROUND_COLOR = 0\nMARKER_COLOR = 9\n\ndef find_marker_index(grid: List[int], marker_color: int) -> Optional[int]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the first occurrence of the marker color.\"\"\"\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        if pixel == marker_color:\n            return i\n    return None # Marker not found\n\ndef find_object(grid: List[int], exclude_colors: List[int]) -> Optional[Tuple[List[int], int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of pixels whose color is not in exclude_colors.\n    Returns: (object_pixels, start_index, end_index) or None if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    object_pixels = []\n    start_index = -1\n    end_index = -1\n    current_object_color = -1\n\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        if pixel not in exclude_colors:\n            if start_index == -1: # Start of a potential object\n                start_index = i\n                current_object_color = pixel\n                object_pixels.append(pixel)\n            elif pixel == current_object_color: # Continuing the object\n                object_pixels.append(pixel)\n            else: # Found a different non-excluded color, object ended at i-1\n                end_index = i - 1\n                return object_pixels, start_index, end_index\n        elif start_index != -1: # End of the object block (encountered excluded color)\n            end_index = i - 1\n            return object_pixels, start_index, end_index\n\n    # Check if object runs until the end of the grid\n    if start_index != -1:\n        end_index = len(grid) - 1\n        return object_pixels, start_index, end_index\n\n    return None # No object found\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid_size = len(input_grid)\n    exclude_colors = [BACKGROUND_COLOR, MARKER_COLOR]\n\n    # 1.
