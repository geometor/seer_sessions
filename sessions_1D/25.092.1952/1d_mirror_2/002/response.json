            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: a marker pixel (maroon, 9), a movable object (contiguous block of another color), and a background (white, 0). The transformation was correctly identified as moving the object relative to the marker. However, the initial hypothesis about the relative positioning (`marker_index + 2`) was based only on the first example and did not generalize.\n\nThe error reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") was likely a consequence of the testing framework encountering an unexpected array structure due to the incorrect transformation logic, rather than an issue within the provided Python code's syntax itself (assuming the test harness adheres to passing standard Python lists or 1D numpy arrays compatible with list operations).\n\nThe core issue was the incorrect rule for determining the object's new position. By analyzing all three training examples, a new rule based on the relationship between the marker's position and the object's *original ending position* has been derived.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe will assume the grids are 1-dimensional arrays (vectors) based on the consistency of the derived rule across examples.\n\n"
