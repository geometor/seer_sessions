task_elements:
  - grid_dimensions:
      type: constant
      value: 1x18 (inferred)
  - background_color:
      id: 0
      name: white
  - marker:
      id: 9
      name: maroon
      shape: single pixel
      role: fixed reference point
      property: position remains unchanged between input and output grid construction.
  - movable_object:
      property: contiguous block of pixels in the input grid
      color: non-white and non-maroon (e.g., 4 - yellow, 5 - gray)
      role: element to be relocated
      shape: 1D segment (preserved in output)
  - action:
      type: move
      target: movable_object
      details:
        - Find the single marker pixel and its index (`marker_index`).
        - Find the contiguous block of non-background, non-marker pixels (the object). Note its color, sequence of pixels (`object_pixels`), start index (`original_start_index`), and end index (`original_end_index`).
        - Calculate the new starting index for the object: `new_start_index = 2 * marker_index - original_end_index`.
        - Create a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color.
        - Place the marker pixel at `marker_index` in the new grid.
        - Place the `object_pixels` into the new grid starting at `new_start_index`.
