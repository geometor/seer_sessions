"""
Identify the single maroon (9) pixel (marker) and its index.
Identify the contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor maroon (9) (movable object), noting its color, pixels, start and end indices.
Create a new grid filled with white (0) pixels, the same size as the input.
Place the maroon marker in the new grid at its original index.
Calculate the new starting index for the movable object as marker_index + 2.
Place the movable object's pixels into the new grid starting at the calculated new index.
Return the modified grid.
