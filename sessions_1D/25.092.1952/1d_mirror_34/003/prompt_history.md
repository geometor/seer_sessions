## Perception

The input and output are both 1x12 grids (or 1D arrays).
Each input contains:
1.  A single maroon pixel (9).
2.  A contiguous block of three identical pixels of another color (green, gray, or yellow in the examples).
3.  A white pixel (0) immediately preceding the maroon pixel (9).
4.  Other pixels are white (0).

The transformation rule involves rearranging these elements relative to the maroon pixel (9), which acts as an anchor, maintaining its absolute position.
Specifically:
-   The maroon pixel (9) stays in the same location (index).
-   The block of three identical pixels moves from its original position to a new position starting two indices after the maroon pixel.
-   The white pixel (0) that was originally immediately *before* the maroon pixel moves to the position immediately *after* the maroon pixel.
-   All other positions in the grid, including the original positions of the moved block and the original positions of any other pixels (except the anchor), become white (0).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Find the index (position) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Let this be `anchor_idx`.
3.  Find the contiguous block of three identical non-white, non-maroon pixels in the input grid. Store the sequence of these three pixel values as `colored_block`.
4.  Locate the pixel immediately before the maroon pixel in the input grid (this pixel will have the value 0). Store this value as `pre_anchor_pixel`.
5.  Place the maroon pixel (9) into the output grid at index `anchor_idx`.
6.  Place the `pre_anchor_pixel` (value 0) into the output grid at index `anchor_idx + 1`.
7.  Place the sequence of three pixels stored in `colored_block` into the output grid, starting at index `anchor_idx + 2`.
8.  The output grid is now complete.

## Assessment

The previous attempt failed due to a type mismatch error: the code expected standard Python lists with an `.index()` method, but the input grids were provided as NumPy arrays, which lack this method. The core logic described in the natural language program and observed in the examples appears sound. The transformation consistently identifies a maroon anchor pixel (9), a preceding white pixel (0), and a block of three identical colored pixels, then rearranges them relative to the anchor's original position in the output grid.

The strategy is to update the understanding to explicitly note the input data type (NumPy array) and ensure the subsequent coding phase uses appropriate NumPy functions for array manipulation (like `np.where` for finding indices and array slicing/assignment for placing elements). The logical steps of the transformation remain unchanged.

## Metrics

No code execution is needed to gather metrics, as the error was a type error preventing execution. The logical analysis based on the examples confirms the pattern:

*   **Input Grid Size:** Consistently 1x12.
*   **Output Grid Size:** Consistently 1x12.
*   **Anchor Pixel:** Always one maroon pixel (9). Its index varies (4, 5, 4).
*   **Colored Block:** Always a block of 3 identical pixels (3, 5, 4). Their color varies. Their starting index varies (0, 1, 0).
*   **Pre-Anchor Pixel:** Always one white pixel (0) immediately before the anchor pixel. Its index varies (3, 4, 3).
*   **Transformation:** The relative positions in the output are consistent: `anchor`, `pre-anchor`, `colored_block[0]`, `colored_block[1]`, `colored_block[2]`. The anchor maintains its absolute input index.
