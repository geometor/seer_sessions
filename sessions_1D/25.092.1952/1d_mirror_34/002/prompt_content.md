"""
Rearranges elements in a 1x12 grid based on the position of a maroon anchor pixel (9).

The transformation involves:
1. Finding the index of the maroon pixel (9), which serves as an anchor.
2. Identifying the contiguous block of three identical non-white, non-maroon pixels.
3. Identifying the white pixel (0) immediately preceding the anchor pixel.
4. Creating a new output grid filled with white pixels (0).
5. Placing the anchor pixel (9) at its original index in the output grid.
6. Placing the preceding white pixel (0) immediately after the anchor pixel in the output grid.
7. Placing the identified block of three pixels starting two positions after the anchor pixel in the output grid.
