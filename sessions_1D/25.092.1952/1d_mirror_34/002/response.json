            "text": "## Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt failed due to a type mismatch error: the code expected standard Python lists with an `.index()` method, but the input grids were provided as NumPy arrays, which lack this method. The core logic described in the natural language program and observed in the examples appears sound. The transformation consistently identifies a maroon anchor pixel (9), a preceding white pixel (0), and a block of three identical colored pixels, then rearranges them relative to the anchor's original position in the output grid.\n\nThe strategy is to update the understanding to explicitly note the input data type (NumPy array) and ensure the subsequent coding phase uses appropriate NumPy functions for array manipulation (like `np.where` for finding indices and array slicing/assignment for placing elements). The logical steps of the transformation remain unchanged.\n\n## Metrics\n\nNo code execution is needed to gather metrics, as the error was a type error preventing execution. The logical analysis based on the examples confirms the pattern:\n\n*   **Input Grid Size:** Consistently 1x12.\n*   **Output Grid Size:** Consistently 1x12.\n*   **Anchor Pixel:** Always one maroon pixel (9). Its index varies (4, 5, 4).\n*   **Colored Block:** Always a block of 3 identical pixels (3, 5, 4). Their color varies. Their starting index varies (0, 1, 0).\n*   **Pre-Anchor Pixel:** Always one white pixel (0) immediately before the anchor pixel. Its index varies (3, 4, 3).\n*   **Transformation:** The relative positions in the output are consistent: `anchor`, `pre-anchor`, `colored_block[0]`, `colored_block[1]`, `colored_block[2]`. The anchor maintains its absolute input index.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
