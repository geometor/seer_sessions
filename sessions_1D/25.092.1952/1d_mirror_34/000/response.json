A contiguous block of three identical pixels of another color (green, gray, or yellow in the examples).\n3.  A white pixel (0) immediately preceding the maroon pixel (9).\n4.  Other pixels are white (0).\n\nThe transformation rule involves rearranging these elements relative to the maroon pixel (9), which acts as an anchor, maintaining its absolute position.\nSpecifically:\n-   The maroon pixel (9) stays in the same location (index).\n-   The block of three identical pixels moves from its original position to a new position starting two indices after the maroon pixel.\n-   The white pixel (0) that was originally immediately *before* the maroon pixel moves to the position immediately *after* the maroon pixel.\n-   All other positions in the grid, including the original positions of the moved block and the original positions of any other pixels (except the anchor), become white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
