  input: [1, 12]
  output: [1, 12]
objects:
  - id: anchor_pixel
    description: A single pixel with value 9 (maroon).
    properties:
      color: maroon
      value: 9
      count: 1
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous block of 3 identical pixels.
    properties:
      color: non-white, non-maroon (e.g., green, gray, yellow)
      length: 3
      count: 1
  - id: pre_anchor_pixel
    description: The pixel immediately preceding the anchor_pixel in the input.
    properties:
      color: white
      value: 0
      location: index = anchor_pixel_index - 1
  - id: background_pixel
    description: Pixels with value 0 (white) used for filling space.
    properties:
      color: white
      value: 0
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: colored_block
    object2: anchor_pixel
    relation: colored_block appears before anchor_pixel in the input.
  - type: adjacency
    object1: pre_anchor_pixel
    object2: anchor_pixel
    relation: pre_anchor_pixel is immediately before anchor_pixel in the input.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: anchor_pixel
    result: store its index (anchor_idx)
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block
    result: store its pixel values (block_pixels)
  - action: identify
    target: pre_anchor_pixel
    result: store its value (which is 0)
