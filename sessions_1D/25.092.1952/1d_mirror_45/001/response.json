Identify the unique maroon pixel (value 9), which acts as a fixed pivot.\n2. Locate a contiguous block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels situated to the left of the pivot. This block is always separated from the pivot by exactly one white pixel.\n3. Move this identified block to the right side of the pivot.\n4. The block's original position is filled with white pixels.\n5. On the right side, the block is placed such that it is separated from the pivot by exactly one white pixel, mirroring the separation pattern from the input. Specifically, if the block ended at index `pivot_index - 2` in the input, it starts at index `pivot_index + 2` in the output.\n6. The pivot pixel and all other white pixels remain in their original positions, except for those overwritten during the block's removal and placement.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pivot(grid_1d):\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the pivot pixel (value 9).\"\"\"\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid_1d):\n        if pixel == 9:\n            return i\n    return -1 # Should not happen based on examples\n\ndef find_block_left(grid_1d, pivot_index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels\n    to the left of the pivot, separated by one white pixel.\n    Returns (start_index, end_index, block_pixels) or None if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    if pivot_index < 2 or grid_1d[pivot_index - 1] != 0:\n        return None # Separator condition not met\n\n    block_pixels = []\n    block_start = -1\n    block_end = -1\n    block_color = -1\n\n    # Search backwards from pivot_index - 2\n    for i in range(pivot_index - 2, -1, -1):\n        pixel_value = grid_1d[i]\n        if pixel_value != 0 and pixel_value != 9:\n            if block_color == -1: # First non-zero/non-nine pixel found\n                block_color = pixel_value\n                block_end = i\n                block_start = i\n                block_pixels.insert(0, pixel_value)\n            elif pixel_value == block_color: # Continue the block\n                block_start = i\n                block_pixels.insert(0, pixel_value)\n            else: # Different color or invalid pixel encountered, block ends here\n                break\n        elif block_color != -1: # Zero or nine encountered after block started\n            break # Block ends here\n        else: # Still searching (found 0 or 9 before block start)\n            break # No block immediately before separator\n\n    if block_start != -1:\n        return block_start, block_end, block_pixels\n    else:\n        return None\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule: moves a colored block from the left \n    of a pivot (9) to its right, maintaining a one-pixel white separation.\n\n    Args:\n      input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid (expected 1xN).\n\n    Returns:\n      A list of lists representing the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Ensure input is in a usable 1D format (list or numpy array)\n    # ARC standard is list of lists, even for 1 row.\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or not input_grid or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):\n         # Handle unexpected format if necessary, or assume valid input\n         # For simplicity, we'll assume it's a list containing one list (the row)\n         pass \n         \n    grid_1d = np.array(input_grid[0], dtype=int)\n    output_grid_1d = grid_1d.copy()\n    grid_width = len(grid_1d)\n\n    # 1.
