The length remains constant between input and output for each example (1x13).\n2.  **Colors Used:** The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon (9), and one other color which varies between examples (blue (1) in train_1 and train_3, yellow (4) in train_2).\n3.  **Key Features:**\n    *   There is always exactly one maroon (9) pixel in the grid. This pixel seems to act as a central pivot or separator.\n    *   There is a contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]` or `[4, 4, 4]`) located to the left of the maroon pixel in the input.\n    *   This colored block is always separated from the maroon pixel by exactly one white (0) pixel in the input.\n    *   The right side of the maroon pixel in the input consists entirely of white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The core transformation involves moving the colored block from the left side of the maroon pivot to the right side.\n    *   The original position of the colored block becomes white pixels.\n    *   The colored block reappears on the right side of the maroon pivot.\n    *   Crucially, the spatial relationship (separation by one white pixel) is mirrored on the right side. The block that ended one position *before* the separating white pixel on the left now starts one position *after* the separating white pixel on the right.\n    *   The maroon pivot pixel itself remains stationary.\n    *   All other white pixels remain unchanged, except those overwritten by the moved block or those replacing the block's original position.\n\n## YAML Fact Sheet\n\n"
