task_description: Move a colored block relative to a fixed pivot pixel.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  size_constraints: Width remains constant between input and output.
  palette: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # Full palette, though examples use a subset.

elements:
  - element: pivot
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      count: 1 per grid.
      role: Acts as a stationary reference point for the transformation.
  - element: block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
    properties:
      location_input: Located to the left of the pivot.
      separation_input: Separated from the pivot by exactly one white (0) pixel.
      count: 1 per grid (in the provided examples).
  - element: background
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      role: Fills the space not occupied by the pivot or the block, acts as a separator.

actions:
  - action: identify_pivot
    input: input_grid
    output: index of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - action: identify_block
    input: input_grid, pivot_index
    output: start_index, end_index, and pixel values of the block located left of the pivot and separated by one white pixel.
  - action: remove_block
    input: working_grid, block_start_index, block_end_index
    output: modified_grid where the block's original position is filled with white (0) pixels.
  - action: place_block
    input: working_grid, pivot_index, block_pixel_values
    output: modified_grid where the block is placed to the right of the pivot, separated by one white pixel.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_separation
    element1: block
    element2: pivot
    details_input: The block ends at index `pivot_index - 2`. The pixel at `pivot_index - 1` is white (0).
    details_output: The block starts at index `pivot_index + 2`. The pixel at `pivot_index + 1` is white (0).
  - type: transformation
    element: block
    details: Moves from the left side of the pivot to the right side, mirroring its separation distance.
