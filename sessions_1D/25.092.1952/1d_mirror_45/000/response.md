Okay, let's analyze the provided examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** All inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (1xN grids). The length remains constant between input and output for each example (1x13).
2.  **Colors Used:** The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon (9), and one other color which varies between examples (blue (1) in train_1 and train_3, yellow (4) in train_2).
3.  **Key Features:**
    *   There is always exactly one maroon (9) pixel in the grid. This pixel seems to act as a central pivot or separator.
    *   There is a contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]` or `[4, 4, 4]`) located to the left of the maroon pixel in the input.
    *   This colored block is always separated from the maroon pixel by exactly one white (0) pixel in the input.
    *   The right side of the maroon pixel in the input consists entirely of white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The core transformation involves moving the colored block from the left side of the maroon pivot to the right side.
    *   The original position of the colored block becomes white pixels.
    *   The colored block reappears on the right side of the maroon pivot.
    *   Crucially, the spatial relationship (separation by one white pixel) is mirrored on the right side. The block that ended one position *before* the separating white pixel on the left now starts one position *after* the separating white pixel on the right.
    *   The maroon pivot pixel itself remains stationary.
    *   All other white pixels remain unchanged, except those overwritten by the moved block or those replacing the block's original position.

## YAML Fact Sheet


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored block relative to a fixed pivot pixel.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  size_constraints: Width remains constant between input and output.
  palette: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # Full palette, though examples use a subset.

elements:
  - element: pivot
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      count: 1 per grid.
      role: Acts as a stationary reference point for the transformation.
  - element: block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
    properties:
      location_input: Located to the left of the pivot.
      separation_input: Separated from the pivot by exactly one white (0) pixel.
      count: 1 per grid (in the provided examples).
  - element: background
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      role: Fills the space not occupied by the pivot or the block, acts as a separator.

actions:
  - action: identify_pivot
    input: input_grid
    output: index of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - action: identify_block
    input: input_grid, pivot_index
    output: start_index, end_index, and pixel values of the block located left of the pivot and separated by one white pixel.
  - action: remove_block
    input: working_grid, block_start_index, block_end_index
    output: modified_grid where the block's original position is filled with white (0) pixels.
  - action: place_block
    input: working_grid, pivot_index, block_pixel_values
    output: modified_grid where the block is placed to the right of the pivot, separated by one white pixel.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_separation
    element1: block
    element2: pivot
    details_input: The block ends at index `pivot_index - 2`. The pixel at `pivot_index - 1` is white (0).
    details_output: The block starts at index `pivot_index + 2`. The pixel at `pivot_index + 1` is white (0).
  - type: transformation
    element: block
    details: Moves from the left side of the pivot to the right side, mirroring its separation distance.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the index (position) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white (not 0), non-maroon (not 9) pixels located immediately to the left of the white pixel at `pivot_index - 1`. Record the starting index (`block_start`), ending index (`block_end`), and the sequence of pixel values (`block_pixels`) of this block.
4.  Change the pixels in the output grid from `block_start` to `block_end` (inclusive) to white (0).
5.  Determine the target starting position for the block on the right side: `target_start = pivot_index + 2`.
6.  Determine the target ending position: `target_end = target_start + length(block_pixels) - 1`.
7.  Place the recorded `block_pixels` into the output grid starting at `target_start` and ending at `target_end`.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
