"""
Relocates the entire grid row containing a specific colored object based on the row position of a marker pixel (maroon, 9).
1. Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid and fill it completely with the background color (white, 0).
2. Locate the coordinates (row R_marker, column C_marker) of the single marker pixel (maroon, 9) in the input grid.
3. Identify the row in the input grid that contains one or more pixels of a single color C where C is not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record the index of this row as R_object_source.
4. Determine the destination row index (R_object_dest) for this row in the output grid by calculating R_marker + 1.
5. Copy the entire contents of the row R_object_source from the input grid into the row R_object_dest of the output grid.
6. Copy the marker pixel (maroon, 9) from the input grid into the output grid at its original coordinates (R_marker, C_marker), overwriting any pixel potentially placed there in step 5.
