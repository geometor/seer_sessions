Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** The data is presented as a flat list of integers (colors). Given the context of ARC, this likely represents a 1D array or potentially a flattened 2D grid, although the transformation seems 1D.
*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved are:
    *   White (0) - Appears to be the background color.
    *   Maroon (9) - Acts as a specific marker or reference point.
    *   Other colors (Green 3, Red 2, Orange 7) - Form contiguous blocks (objects).
*   **Structure:** In each input, there is:
    *   A contiguous block of a single color (Green, Red, or Orange).
    *   A single Maroon pixel (9).
    *   The rest are White pixels (0).
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the colored block.
    *   The colored block's original position is filled with White (0).
    *   The Maroon pixel (9) remains in its original position in the output.
    *   The colored block is placed in the output array starting *two positions* after the Maroon pixel. The position immediately after the Maroon pixel becomes White (0).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Relocate a colored block based on the position of a marker pixel.

elements:
  - element_type: background
    color_code: 0
    color_name: white
    role: Fills empty space and replaces the original position of the moved object.
  - element_type: marker
    color_code: 9
    color_name: maroon
    role: Acts as a fixed reference point for the relocation. Its position determines the destination of the colored_block.
    properties:
      - count: 1 per grid
  - element_type: object
    name: colored_block
    role: The entity that is moved.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (e.g., 3/green, 2/red, 7/orange), but is not 0 or 9.
      - shape: Contiguous 1D sequence (block) of a single color.
      - count: 1 per grid

transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block
    details: Find the contiguous sequence of pixels whose color is not white (0) or maroon (9). Record its color, length, and original start/end indices.
  - action: identify
    target: marker
    details: Find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel.
  - action: initialize_output
    details: Create a new 1D array of the same size as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: place_marker
    target: marker
    destination: output array
    details: Copy the marker pixel (maroon, 9) to the output array at the same index it occupied in the input array.
  - action: place_object
    target: colored_block
    destination: output array
    details: Copy the identified colored_block into the output array. The block starts at the index equal to the marker's index plus 2. The block retains its original color and length.

relationships:
  - type: relative_positioning
    source: colored_block
    reference: marker
    details: The final position of the colored_block is determined relative to the marker's position (marker_index + 2).
  - type: replacement
    target: original position of colored_block
    replacement: background color (white, 0)
    details: The space previously occupied by the colored_block in the input is filled with the background color in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output array of the same size as the input array and fill it with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white (0) and non-maroon (9) pixels in the input array. Store its color and length (this is the "object").
3.  Locate the index of the maroon (9) pixel in the input array (this is the "marker index").
4.  Place the maroon (9) pixel into the output array at the marker index.
5.  Place the object (the colored block identified in step 2) into the output array, starting at the index calculated as `marker index + 2`.
