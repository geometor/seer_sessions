The comparison logic failed because it was applied to array slices instead of single boolean values.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the examples assuming a 2D grid structure, identify the correct transformation logic based on rows and columns, and update the representation (YAML) and the procedural description (Natural Language Program) accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's analyze the examples assuming a 2D structure. Based on the total number of elements (24), common ARC grid shapes like 4x6 or 6x4 are likely. The visual layout in the previous step suggests 4x6.\n\n"

Ensure this placement does not overwrite the marker pixel if the destination row is the same as the marker's original row (although this case doesn't occur in examples, it's a logical consideration). *Correction based on examples:* The marker is placed *first*, and then the object row overwrites that row *if* `marker_row_index + 1` happens to be the marker's original row index. However, the examples show the marker always remains, implying the moved row *replaces* the content at the destination row, *except* for the marker's original position if it happens to fall within that destination row. *Revisiting examples:* The marker is *always* preserved.
