            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis incorrectly interpreted the input as a 1D array. The failed results strongly suggest the task operates on a 2D grid. The provided inputs and outputs, each containing 24 elements, strongly imply a 4x6 or 6x4 grid structure. Visualizing the data as 4x6 grids reveals a consistent pattern: an entire row containing a non-background, non-marker color (the \"object row\") is moved. Its destination row index is determined by the row index of the marker pixel (maroon, 9). Specifically, the object row is placed in the row *directly below* the marker's row. The marker pixel itself remains in its original position in the output grid.\n\nThe previous code attempted to implement this 2D logic, including reshaping the flat input list. However, it failed to place the object row correctly in the output during execution testing, resulting in an output grid containing only the background and the marker. This indicates a potential flaw in either the object row identification, the calculation of the destination index, the array slicing/assignment for placing the row, or the handling of the grid shape.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Explicitly assume the input represents a 4x6 grid. Refine the grid reshaping logic.\n2.  Re-verify the logic for identifying the \"object row\" (the row containing non-background, non-marker colors).\n3.  Re-verify the logic for identifying the \"marker row\" (the row containing the maroon pixel).\n4.  Confirm the destination row index calculation (`marker_row + 1`).\n5.  Ensure the object row is correctly copied from the input grid to the calculated destination row in the output grid.\n6.  Ensure the marker pixel is correctly placed in the output grid at its original coordinates, potentially overwriting any pixel placed there by the object row movement (though this doesn't happen in the examples).\n7.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this 2D row-based transformation.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"

Move to row 2, start col 0 -> `[3,3,3,3,3,3]`. Matches.\n        *   Train 2: Block `[2,2,2,2,2,2]` starts col 0. Move to row 2, start col 0 -> `[2,2,2,2,2,2]`. Matches.\n        *   Train 3: Block `[7,7,7,7,7]` starts col 1. Move to row 3, start col 0 -> `[7,7,7,7,7,0]`. Matches.\n    *   Hypothesis B: Move the block, place it starting at the marker's column in the destination row.\n        *   Train 1: Marker col 1. Block `[3,3,3,3,3,3]`. Move to row 2, start col 1 -> `[0,3,3,3,3,3]`. Does *not* match output `[3,3,3,3,3,3]`.\n\n    Hypothesis A seems correct. The transformation identifies the contiguous block of the main object color within its source row, then places that block into the destination row (`marker_row + 1`) starting at column 0.\n\n*   **Source Row Clearing:** The original location of the object row in the input is filled with background color (0) in the output (`input_object_row_cleared_in_output: true`), except for the marker if it happened to be in that row (not the case here).\n\n**Revised Understanding:**\n\nThe transformation operates on a 4x6 grid. It identifies the contiguous block of the primary object color (non-0, non-9) and its source row. It identifies the marker's row and column. It creates a blank output grid. It copies the identified *object block* (not the whole row) into the output grid at row `marker_row + 1`, starting the block at column 0. Finally, it places the marker pixel at its original coordinates in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
