"""
Transforms an input grid by relocating the entire row containing a colored object based on the row position of a marker pixel (maroon, 9).
1. Reshape the input flat list into a 2D grid (assuming 4x6 based on examples).
2. Create a new output grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color (white, 0).
3. Locate the coordinates (row R_marker, column C_marker) of the marker pixel (maroon, 9) in the input grid.
4. Identify the source row (R_object_source) in the input grid that contains pixels of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9). Store the contents of this row.
5. Calculate the destination row index (R_object_dest) for the object row in the output grid as R_marker + 1.
6. Copy the entire object row content into the output grid at row R_object_dest, if the index is valid.
7. Place the marker pixel (maroon, 9) back into the output grid at its original coordinates (R_marker, C_marker).
