Reshape the input flat list into a 2D grid (assuming 4x6 based on examples).\n2. Create a new output grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n3. Locate the coordinates (row R_marker, column C_marker) of the marker pixel (maroon, 9) in the input grid.\n4. Identify the source row (R_object_source) in the input grid that contains pixels of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9). Store the contents of this row.\n5. Calculate the destination row index (R_object_dest) for the object row in the output grid as R_marker + 1.\n6. Copy the entire object row content into the output grid at row R_object_dest, if the index is valid.\n7. Place the marker pixel (maroon, 9) back into the output grid at its original coordinates (R_marker, C_marker).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_marker(grid, marker_color=9):\n    \"\"\"Finds the coordinates (row, col) of the first occurrence of the marker color.\"\"\"\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == marker_color)\n    if len(coords) > 0:\n        return tuple(coords[0]) # Return (row, col)\n    else:\n        return None # Marker not found\n\ndef find_object_row(grid, background_color=0, marker_color=9):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index and content of the row containing the primary object.\n    The object is identified by having pixels of a single color C where C is not background or marker.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_rows, num_cols = grid.shape\n    for r_idx in range(num_rows):\n        row = grid[r_idx, :]\n        unique_colors = np.unique(row)\n        # Check if there's any color in the row other than background or marker\n        object_colors_present = [c for c in unique_colors if c != background_color and c != marker_color]\n        if len(object_colors_present) > 0:\n            # We found the row containing the object segment.\n            # Return the index of this row and its full content.\n            return r_idx, row\n    return -1, None # Object row not found\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving the object row relative to the marker row.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list to numpy array, attempting to reshape\n    input_arr = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    rows, cols = -1, -1\n\n    # --- Determine Grid Shape ---\n    # Basic heuristic for the 24-element examples -> 4x6\n    # A more general solution would need shape info or better inference.\n    if input_arr.ndim == 1:\n        size = input_arr.shape[0]\n        if size == 24: # Specific case for the examples provided\n            try:\n                # Let's try 4x6 first as it matches the visual layout often seen\n                input_arr = input_arr.reshape((4, 6))\n                rows, cols = 4, 6\n            except ValueError:\n                 # Maybe it's 6x4?
