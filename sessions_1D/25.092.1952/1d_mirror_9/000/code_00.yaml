task_description: Relocate a colored block based on the position of a marker pixel.

elements:
  - element_type: background
    color_code: 0
    color_name: white
    role: Fills empty space and replaces the original position of the moved object.
  - element_type: marker
    color_code: 9
    color_name: maroon
    role: Acts as a fixed reference point for the relocation. Its position determines the destination of the colored_block.
    properties:
      - count: 1 per grid
  - element_type: object
    name: colored_block
    role: The entity that is moved.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (e.g., 3/green, 2/red, 7/orange), but is not 0 or 9.
      - shape: Contiguous 1D sequence (block) of a single color.
      - count: 1 per grid

transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block
    details: Find the contiguous sequence of pixels whose color is not white (0) or maroon (9). Record its color, length, and original start/end indices.
  - action: identify
    target: marker
    details: Find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel.
  - action: initialize_output
    details: Create a new 1D array of the same size as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: place_marker
    target: marker
    destination: output array
    details: Copy the marker pixel (maroon, 9) to the output array at the same index it occupied in the input array.
  - action: place_object
    target: colored_block
    destination: output array
    details: Copy the identified colored_block into the output array. The block starts at the index equal to the marker's index plus 2. The block retains its original color and length.

relationships:
  - type: relative_positioning
    source: colored_block
    reference: marker
    details: The final position of the colored_block is determined relative to the marker's position (marker_index + 2).
  - type: replacement
    target: original position of colored_block
    replacement: background color (white, 0)
    details: The space previously occupied by the colored_block in the input is filled with the background color in the output.
