Given the context of ARC, this likely represents a 1D array or potentially a flattened 2D grid, although the transformation seems 1D.\n*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved are:\n    *   White (0) - Appears to be the background color.\n    *   Maroon (9) - Acts as a specific marker or reference point.\n    *   Other colors (Green 3, Red 2, Orange 7) - Form contiguous blocks (objects).\n*   **Structure:** In each input, there is:\n    *   A contiguous block of a single color (Green, Red, or Orange).\n    *   A single Maroon pixel (9).\n    *   The rest are White pixels (0).\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the colored block.\n    *   The colored block's original position is filled with White (0).\n    *   The Maroon pixel (9) remains in its original position in the output.\n    *   The colored block is placed in the output array starting *two positions* after the Maroon pixel. The position immediately after the Maroon pixel becomes White (0).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
