*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating a 1-dimensional grid of pixels. In the provided example, the input grid contains a contiguous block of green pixels and a single maroon pixel, surrounded by white pixels. The maroon pixel appears to act as a stationary pivot point. The green block is located to the left of the maroon pixel in the input. In the output, the green block has moved to the right side of the maroon pixel, maintaining a one-pixel (white) separation. The size and color of the green block remain unchanged. The position of the maroon pixel also remains unchanged. The background remains white.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_dimensions:
      - rows: 1
      - cols: 21 # Based on linear representation
    objects:
      - id: object_1
        color: green (3)
        representation: contiguous block

        attributes:
          - size: 6 pixels
          - shape: horizontal line segment
      - id: pivot_object
        color: maroon (9)
        representation: single pixel

        attributes:
          - size: 1 pixel
          - stationary: true
      - id: background
        color: white (0)
        representation: remaining pixels
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        input: object_1 is left of pivot_object, separated by one white pixel (index 8).
        output: object_1 is right of pivot_object, separated by one white pixel (index 10).
    actions:
      - type: move
        target: object_1
        reference: pivot_object
        details: Move object_1 from one side of pivot_object to the other, maintaining a one-pixel separation. The space previously occupied by object_1 becomes background (white).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid and note its position (index). This is the pivot point.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Note its color, start index, end index, and length. This is the movable object.
    3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
    4.  Place the maroon (9) pixel in the output grid at the same position (index) it occupied in the input grid.
    5.  Determine the relative position of the movable object with respect to the pivot point in the input grid (left or right).
    6.  If the movable object was to the left of the pivot point in the input grid:
        *   Calculate the starting position for the object in the output grid as `pivot_index + 2`.
        *   Place the movable object (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at this calculated position.
    7.  If the movable object was to the right of the pivot point in the input grid:
        *   Calculate the starting position for the object in the output grid as `pivot_index - 1 - object_length`.
        *   Place the movable object (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at this calculated position.
    8.  The final output grid is the result of these placements.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: reflecting a colored object across a stationary maroon pivot pixel while preserving the gap between them. However, the Python code failed due to an input format mismatch. The test harness likely passes the input grid as a standard ARC 2D list-of-lists (e.g., `[[...]]`), even for grids that are effectively 1D. The `transform` function expected this but failed because the check `if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):` indicated the input wasn't conforming.

The strategy is to:
1.  Assume the standard `list[list[int]]` format for inputs.
2.  Adjust the input handling within the `transform` function to correctly extract the 1D data from the `input_grid[0]`.
3.  Verify the reflection and gap preservation logic against all three training examples using metrics.
4.  Refine the natural language program and facts based on the consistent pattern observed across all examples.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the structure of each training example to confirm the pattern.

```
Ah, the `numpy.int64` type isn't directly JSON serializable. I need to explicitly convert the numpy integers to standard Python integers before creating the JSON output. I already did this for `obj_color`, but need to do it for other integer fields derived from numpy arrays like `pivot_index`, `obj_start`, `obj_end`, `obj_length`, `gap_size`, and `grid_length`.

Let's retry the metric gathering with explicit type casting.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  **Identify Pivot:** Locate the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid's first row. Record its index (position). Place this maroon pixel at the same index in the output grid.
3.  **Identify Object:** Find the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid's first row that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its color, start index, end index, and calculate its length.
4.  **Calculate Input Gap:** Determine the number of white (0) pixels strictly between the identified object block and the pivot pixel in the input grid.
    *   If the object is to the left of the pivot (`object_end_index < pivot_index`), the gap size is `pivot_index - object_end_index - 1`.
    *   If the object is to the right of the pivot (`object_start_index > pivot_index`), the gap size is `object_start_index - pivot_index - 1`.
5.  **Calculate Output Position:** Determine the starting index for the object in the output grid based on reflecting it across the pivot while preserving the calculated gap size.
    *   If the object was to the left of the pivot in the input, the new start index is `pivot_index + 1 + gap_size`.
    *   If the object was to the right of the pivot in the input, the new start index is `pivot_index - 1 - gap_size - object_length + 1`.
6.  **Place Object:** Place the identified object (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated new start index. Ensure the placement respects grid boundaries (though not required by examples, it's good practice).
7.  **Finalize:** The grid constructed in the previous steps is the final output.
