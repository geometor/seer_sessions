grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D (represented as list of lists)
  effective_dimensionality: 1D (all action occurs on the first row)
  height: 1 (constant across examples)
  width: 21 (constant across examples)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1 (per example)
    shape: single pixel
    attributes:
      - stationary: true (position is identical in input and output)
      - location: variable index (9 in ex1, 11 in ex2 & ex3)

  - id: movable_object
    color: variable (green=3 in ex1, gray=5 in ex2, yellow=4 in ex3)
    count: 1 (per example)
    shape: contiguous horizontal block (line segment)
    attributes:
      - size: variable length (6 in ex1, 5 in ex2, 6 in ex3)
      - contiguous: true
      - uniform_color: true

relationships:
  - type: spatial (input)
    between: [movable_object, pivot]
    details: The movable_object is located entirely to one side (left) of the pivot, separated by a gap of white pixels.
    gap_size: variable (1 in ex1, 2 in ex2 & ex3) computed as `abs(pivot_index - closest_object_edge_index) - 1`

actions:
  - type: identify
    target: pivot
    result: store pivot index
  - type: identify
    target: movable_object
    result: store object color, start index, end index, length
  - type: calculate
    inputs: [pivot index, object start index, object end index]
    result: store input gap size
  - type: reflect
    target: movable_object
    axis: pivot pixel index
    constraint: preserve gap size
    details: Move the movable_object from its original side of the pivot to the opposite side, maintaining the same number of white pixels between the object and the pivot as in the input.
  - type: compose_output
    elements: [background, pivot, reflected movable_object]
    details: Create a new grid of the original dimensions filled with the background color. Place the pivot at its original index. Place the movable_object at its new reflected position.

consistency_check:
  - property: object color
    result: unchanged between input and output
  - property: object length
    result: unchanged between input and output
  - property: pivot position
    result: unchanged between input and output
  - property: gap size
    result: unchanged between input and output
