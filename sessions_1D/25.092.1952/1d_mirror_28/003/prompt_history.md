*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating a 1-dimensional grid of pixels. In the provided example, the input grid contains a contiguous block of green pixels and a single maroon pixel, surrounded by white pixels. The maroon pixel appears to act as a stationary pivot point. The green block is located to the left of the maroon pixel in the input. In the output, the green block has moved to the right side of the maroon pixel, maintaining a one-pixel (white) separation. The size and color of the green block remain unchanged. The position of the maroon pixel also remains unchanged. The background remains white.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_dimensions:
      - rows: 1

      - id: object_1

    relationships:

        input: object_1 is left of pivot_object, separated by one white pixel (index 8).
        output: object_1 is right of pivot_object, separated by one white pixel (index 10).
    actions:
      - type: move
        target: object_1
        reference: pivot_object
        details: Move object_1 from one side of pivot_object to the other, maintaining a one-pixel separation. The space previously occupied by object_1 becomes background (white).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid and note its position (index). This is the pivot point.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Note its color, start index, end index, and length. This is the movable object.
    3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
    4.  Place the maroon (9) pixel in the output grid at the same position (index) it occupied in the input grid.
    5.  Determine the relative position of the movable object with respect to the pivot point in the input grid (left or right).
    6.  If the movable object was to the left of the pivot point in the input grid:
        *   Calculate the starting position for the object in the output grid as `pivot_index + 2`.
        *   Place the movable object (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at this calculated position.
    7.  If the movable object was to the right of the pivot point in the input grid:
        *   Calculate the starting position for the object in the output grid as `pivot_index - 1 - object_length`.
        *   Place the movable object (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at this calculated position.
    8.  The final output grid is the result of these placements.

**General Assessment**

The initial code successfully identified the pivot (maroon pixel) and the movable object (contiguous block of another color) but incorrectly calculated the object's final position. The error arose from assuming a fixed one-pixel gap between the pivot and the object in the output, based solely on the first example. Examples 2 and 3 reveal that the size of the gap (number of white pixels) between the object and the pivot in the input is preserved in the output. The object essentially reflects across the pivot, maintaining the original separation distance. The strategy is to modify the position calculation to account for the measured input gap size.
