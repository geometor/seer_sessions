In the provided example, the input grid contains a contiguous block of green pixels and a single maroon pixel, surrounded by white pixels. The maroon pixel appears to act as a stationary pivot point. The green block is located to the left of the maroon pixel in the input. In the output, the green block has moved to the right side of the maroon pixel, maintaining a one-pixel (white) separation. The size and color of the green block remain unchanged. The position of the maroon pixel also remains unchanged. The background remains white.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
