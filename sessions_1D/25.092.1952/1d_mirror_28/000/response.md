*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating a 1-dimensional grid of pixels. In the provided example, the input grid contains a contiguous block of green pixels and a single maroon pixel, surrounded by white pixels. The maroon pixel appears to act as a stationary pivot point. The green block is located to the left of the maroon pixel in the input. In the output, the green block has moved to the right side of the maroon pixel, maintaining a one-pixel (white) separation. The size and color of the green block remain unchanged. The position of the maroon pixel also remains unchanged. The background remains white.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_dimensions:
      - rows: 1
      - cols: 21 # Based on linear representation
    objects:
      - id: object_1
        color: green (3)
        representation: contiguous block
        input_location: indices 2-7
        output_location: indices 11-16
        attributes:
          - size: 6 pixels
          - shape: horizontal line segment
      - id: pivot_object
        color: maroon (9)
        representation: single pixel
        input_location: index 9
        output_location: index 9
        attributes:
          - size: 1 pixel
          - stationary: true
      - id: background
        color: white (0)
        representation: remaining pixels
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        input: object_1 is left of pivot_object, separated by one white pixel (index 8).
        output: object_1 is right of pivot_object, separated by one white pixel (index 10).
    actions:
      - type: move
        target: object_1
        reference: pivot_object
        details: Move object_1 from one side of pivot_object to the other, maintaining a one-pixel separation. The space previously occupied by object_1 becomes background (white).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid and note its position (index). This is the pivot point.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Note its color, start index, end index, and length. This is the movable object.
    3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
    4.  Place the maroon (9) pixel in the output grid at the same position (index) it occupied in the input grid.
    5.  Determine the relative position of the movable object with respect to the pivot point in the input grid (left or right).
    6.  If the movable object was to the left of the pivot point in the input grid:
        *   Calculate the starting position for the object in the output grid as `pivot_index + 2`.
        *   Place the movable object (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at this calculated position.
    7.  If the movable object was to the right of the pivot point in the input grid:
        *   Calculate the starting position for the object in the output grid as `pivot_index - 1 - object_length`.
        *   Place the movable object (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at this calculated position.
    8.  The final output grid is the result of these placements.
