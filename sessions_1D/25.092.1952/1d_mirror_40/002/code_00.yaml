task_description: Reposition a sequence of colored pixels within a 1D array based on its spatial relationship to a fixed maroon pixel. The operation resembles reflecting the sequence's end position across the maroon pixel to determine its new start position.

data_structure:
  type: 1D array (list) of integers
  constraints:
    - length: fixed for a given task instance (e.g., 23 in examples)
    - values: integers 0-9 representing colors

elements:
  - object: background
    pixel_value: 0
    color_name: white
    role: Fills the array initially and where other objects are not present.
  - object: pivot_marker
    pixel_value: 9
    color_name: maroon
    properties:
      - count: exactly one per array
      - position_index: fixed (remains the same from input to output)
    role: Acts as a static reference point for the transformation.
  - object: colored_sequence
    pixel_value: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 4: yellow, 7: orange)
    color_name: variable
    properties:
      - contiguity: forms a single contiguous block of identical pixels
      - count: exactly one per array
      - color: preserved during transformation
      - length: preserved during transformation
      - position_indices: changes from input to output
    role: The dynamic object that is moved.

relationships:
  - type: relative_positioning
    object1: colored_sequence (input)
    object2: pivot_marker
    characteristic: The number of pixels between the end index of the colored_sequence and the index of the pivot_marker. Let this be `distance = index(pivot_marker) - end_index(colored_sequence_input)`.
    rule: This `distance` determines the starting position of the sequence in the output relative to the pivot marker.
  - type: output_placement
    object1: colored_sequence (output)
    object2: pivot_marker
    characteristic: The starting index of the colored_sequence in the output array.
    rule: `output_start_index = index(pivot_marker) + distance`. The sequence maintains its original color and length, occupying indices from `output_start_index` to `output_start_index + length - 1`.

actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    details: Create a new 1D array of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: locate_pivot
    target: input array
    details: Find the index of the pivot_marker (pixel value 9). Let this be `maroon_index`.
  - action: place_pivot
    target: output array
    details: Set the pixel at `maroon_index` in the output array to 9.
  - action: locate_sequence
    target: input array
    details: Find the contiguous sequence of pixels with values other than 0 and 9. Record its color (`sequence_color`), start index (`input_start_index`), end index (`input_end_index`), and length (`sequence_length`).
  - action: calculate_distance
    inputs: `maroon_index`, `input_end_index`
    details: Calculate `distance = maroon_index - input_end_index`.
  - action: calculate_output_position
    inputs: `maroon_index`, `distance`
    details: Calculate `output_start_index = maroon_index + distance`.
  - action: place_sequence
    target: output array
    inputs: `output_start_index`, `sequence_color`, `sequence_length`
    details: Fill the pixels in the output array from `output_start_index` to `output_start_index + sequence_length - 1` with `sequence_color`, ensuring not to overwrite the already placed pivot marker (though observed examples do not show overlap).
