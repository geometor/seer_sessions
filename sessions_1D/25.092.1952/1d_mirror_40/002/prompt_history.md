Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Data Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or sequences of integers (pixels). The length of the array is consistent across all examples (23 elements).
2.  **Colors:** The arrays contain white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9), and a contiguous sequence of another color (yellow '4' or orange '7').
3.  **Key Elements:**
    *   **Maroon Pixel (9):** Acts as a fixed reference point or pivot. Its position remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   **Colored Sequence:** A block of identical, non-white, non-maroon pixels (e.g., `4 4 4 4 4 4` or `7 7 7 7 7`). This sequence moves its position.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves repositioning the colored sequence relative to the fixed maroon pixel. The color and length of the sequence are preserved.
5.  **Movement Logic:** The movement seems related to the distance between the colored sequence and the maroon pixel. Specifically, the distance from the *end* of the colored sequence to the maroon pixel in the input dictates the distance from the maroon pixel to the *start* of the colored sequence in the output. It's like reflecting the endpoint across the maroon pixel to find the new start point.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Reposition a sequence of colored pixels based on its distance from a fixed maroon pixel in a 1D array.

elements:
  - object: background
    pixel_value: 0
    color_name: white
    role: Fills the array initially and where other objects are not present.
  - object: pivot_marker
    pixel_value: 9
    color_name: maroon
    properties:
      - count: exactly one per array
      - position: fixed (remains the same from input to output)
    role: Acts as a reference point for repositioning the colored sequence.
  - object: colored_sequence
    pixel_value: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 4, 7)
    color_name: variable (e.g., yellow, orange)
    properties:
      - contiguity: forms a single contiguous block
      - count: exactly one per array
      - color: preserved during transformation
      - length: preserved during transformation
      - position: changes from input to output
    role: The object that is moved.

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: colored_sequence
    object2: pivot_marker
    characteristic_input: Distance from the end index of the colored_sequence to the index of the pivot_marker.
    characteristic_output: Distance from the index of the pivot_marker to the start index of the colored_sequence.
    rule: The input distance equals the output distance.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot_marker
    details: Find the index of the pixel with value 9.
  - action: identify
    target: colored_sequence
    details: Find the contiguous sequence of pixels with values other than 0 and 9. Record its color, start index, and end index.
  - action: calculate
    details: Calculate the distance `d = index(pivot_marker) - end_index(colored_sequence_input)`.
  - action: calculate
    target: colored_sequence
    details: Determine the new start index for the sequence in the output: `new_start_index = index(pivot_marker) + d`.
  - action: construct_output
    details: Create a new array of the same size as the input, filled with white (0). Place the pivot_marker at its original index. Place the colored_sequence (with original color and length) starting at the calculated `new_start_index`.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array and note its index (`maroon_index`). Place this maroon pixel at the same `maroon_index` in the output array.
3.  Identify the contiguous sequence of colored pixels (neither white '0' nor maroon '9') in the input array. Note its color (`sequence_color`), its starting index (`input_start_index`), and its ending index (`input_end_index`). Calculate its length (`sequence_length = input_end_index - input_start_index + 1`).
4.  Calculate the distance (`d`) from the end of the input sequence to the maroon pixel: `d = maroon_index - input_end_index`.
5.  Determine the starting index for the sequence in the output array: `output_start_index = maroon_index + d`.
6.  Place the colored sequence, using `sequence_color` and `sequence_length`, into the output array, starting at `output_start_index`. Ensure the placement doesn't overwrite the maroon pixel if their positions overlap (though based on examples, overlap doesn't seem to occur). The sequence should occupy indices from `output_start_index` to `output_start_index + sequence_length - 1`.

"""
Reposition a sequence of colored pixels based on its distance from a fixed maroon pixel in a 1D array.

1. Initialize the output array as the same size as the input, filled with white pixels (0).
2. Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array and place it at the same index in the output array.
3. Identify the contiguous sequence of colored pixels (neither white '0' nor maroon '9') in the input array. Note its color, start index, end index, and length.
4. Calculate the distance 'd' from the end of the input sequence to the maroon pixel.
5. Determine the starting index for the sequence in the output array by adding the distance 'd' to the maroon pixel's index.
6. Place the identified colored sequence into the output array at the calculated starting index.
