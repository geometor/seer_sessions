"""
Reposition a sequence of colored pixels based on its distance from a fixed maroon pixel in a 1D array.

1. Initialize the output array as the same size as the input, filled with white pixels (0).
2. Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array and place it at the same index in the output array.
3. Identify the contiguous sequence of colored pixels (neither white '0' nor maroon '9') in the input array. Note its color, start index, end index, and length.
4. Calculate the distance 'd' from the end of the input sequence to the maroon pixel.
5. Determine the starting index for the sequence in the output array by adding the distance 'd' to the maroon pixel's index.
6. Place the identified colored sequence into the output array at the calculated starting index.
