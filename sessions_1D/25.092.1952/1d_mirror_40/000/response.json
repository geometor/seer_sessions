            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Data Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or sequences of integers (pixels). The length of the array is consistent across all examples (23 elements).\n2.  **Colors:** The arrays contain white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9), and a contiguous sequence of another color (yellow '4' or orange '7').\n3.  **Key Elements:**\n    *   **Maroon Pixel (9):** Acts as a fixed reference point or pivot. Its position remains unchanged from input to output.\n    *   **Colored Sequence:** A block of identical, non-white, non-maroon pixels (e.g., `4 4 4 4 4 4` or `7 7 7 7 7`). This sequence moves its position.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves repositioning the colored sequence relative to the fixed maroon pixel. The color and length of the sequence are preserved.\n5.  **Movement Logic:** The movement seems related to the distance between the colored sequence and the maroon pixel. Specifically, the distance from the *end* of the colored sequence to the maroon pixel in the input dictates the distance from the maroon pixel to the *start* of the colored sequence in the output. It's like reflecting the endpoint across the maroon pixel to find the new start point.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array and note its index (`maroon_index`). Place this maroon pixel at the same `maroon_index` in the output array.\n3.  Identify the contiguous sequence of colored pixels (neither white '0' nor maroon '9') in the input array. Note its color (`sequence_color`), its starting index (`input_start_index`), and its ending index (`input_end_index`). Calculate its length (`sequence_length = input_end_index - input_start_index + 1`).\n4.  Calculate the distance (`d`) from the end of the input sequence to the maroon pixel: `d = maroon_index - input_end_index`.\n5.  Determine the starting index for the sequence in the output array: `output_start_index = maroon_index + d`.\n6.  Place the colored sequence, using `sequence_color` and `sequence_length`, into the output array, starting at `output_start_index`. Ensure the placement doesn't overwrite the maroon pixel if their positions overlap (though based on examples, overlap doesn't seem to occur). The sequence should occupy indices from `output_start_index` to `output_start_index + sequence_length - 1`."
