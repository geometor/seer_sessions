task_description: Reposition a sequence of colored pixels based on its distance from a fixed maroon pixel in a 1D array.

elements:
  - object: background
    pixel_value: 0
    color_name: white
    role: Fills the array initially and where other objects are not present.
  - object: pivot_marker
    pixel_value: 9
    color_name: maroon
    properties:
      - count: exactly one per array
      - position: fixed (remains the same from input to output)
    role: Acts as a reference point for repositioning the colored sequence.
  - object: colored_sequence
    pixel_value: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 4, 7)
    color_name: variable (e.g., yellow, orange)
    properties:
      - contiguity: forms a single contiguous block
      - count: exactly one per array
      - color: preserved during transformation
      - length: preserved during transformation
      - position: changes from input to output
    role: The object that is moved.

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: colored_sequence
    object2: pivot_marker
    characteristic_input: Distance from the end index of the colored_sequence to the index of the pivot_marker.
    characteristic_output: Distance from the index of the pivot_marker to the start index of the colored_sequence.
    rule: The input distance equals the output distance.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot_marker
    details: Find the index of the pixel with value 9.
  - action: identify
    target: colored_sequence
    details: Find the contiguous sequence of pixels with values other than 0 and 9. Record its color, start index, and end index.
  - action: calculate
    details: Calculate the distance `d = index(pivot_marker) - end_index(colored_sequence_input)`.
  - action: calculate
    target: colored_sequence
    details: Determine the new start index for the sequence in the output: `new_start_index = index(pivot_marker) + d`.
  - action: construct_output
    details: Create a new array of the same size as the input, filled with white (0). Place the pivot_marker at its original index. Place the colored_sequence (with original color and length) starting at the calculated `new_start_index`.
