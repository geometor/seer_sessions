Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Data Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or sequences of integers (pixels). The length of the array is consistent across all examples (23 elements).
2.  **Colors:** The arrays contain white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9), and a contiguous sequence of another color (yellow '4' or orange '7').
3.  **Key Elements:**
    *   **Maroon Pixel (9):** Acts as a fixed reference point or pivot. Its position remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   **Colored Sequence:** A block of identical, non-white, non-maroon pixels (e.g., `4 4 4 4 4 4` or `7 7 7 7 7`). This sequence moves its position.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves repositioning the colored sequence relative to the fixed maroon pixel. The color and length of the sequence are preserved.
5.  **Movement Logic:** The movement seems related to the distance between the colored sequence and the maroon pixel. Specifically, the distance from the *end* of the colored sequence to the maroon pixel in the input dictates the distance from the maroon pixel to the *start* of the colored sequence in the output. It's like reflecting the endpoint across the maroon pixel to find the new start point.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Reposition a sequence of colored pixels based on its distance from a fixed maroon pixel in a 1D array.

elements:
  - object: background
    pixel_value: 0
    color_name: white
    role: Fills the array initially and where other objects are not present.
  - object: pivot_marker
    pixel_value: 9
    color_name: maroon
    properties:
      - count: exactly one per array
      - position: fixed (remains the same from input to output)
    role: Acts as a reference point for repositioning the colored sequence.
  - object: colored_sequence
    pixel_value: non-zero, non-9 (e.g., 4, 7)
    color_name: variable (e.g., yellow, orange)
    properties:
      - contiguity: forms a single contiguous block
      - count: exactly one per array
      - color: preserved during transformation
      - length: preserved during transformation
      - position: changes from input to output
    role: The object that is moved.

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: colored_sequence
    object2: pivot_marker
    characteristic_input: Distance from the end index of the colored_sequence to the index of the pivot_marker.
    characteristic_output: Distance from the index of the pivot_marker to the start index of the colored_sequence.
    rule: The input distance equals the output distance.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot_marker
    details: Find the index of the pixel with value 9.
  - action: identify
    target: colored_sequence
    details: Find the contiguous sequence of pixels with values other than 0 and 9. Record its color, start index, and end index.
  - action: calculate
    details: Calculate the distance `d = index(pivot_marker) - end_index(colored_sequence_input)`.
  - action: calculate
    target: colored_sequence
    details: Determine the new start index for the sequence in the output: `new_start_index = index(pivot_marker) + d`.
  - action: construct_output
    details: Create a new array of the same size as the input, filled with white (0). Place the pivot_marker at its original index. Place the colored_sequence (with original color and length) starting at the calculated `new_start_index`.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array and note its index (`maroon_index`). Place this maroon pixel at the same `maroon_index` in the output array.
3.  Identify the contiguous sequence of colored pixels (neither white '0' nor maroon '9') in the input array. Note its color (`sequence_color`), its starting index (`input_start_index`), and its ending index (`input_end_index`). Calculate its length (`sequence_length = input_end_index - input_start_index + 1`).
4.  Calculate the distance (`d`) from the end of the input sequence to the maroon pixel: `d = maroon_index - input_end_index`.
5.  Determine the starting index for the sequence in the output array: `output_start_index = maroon_index + d`.
6.  Place the colored sequence, using `sequence_color` and `sequence_length`, into the output array, starting at `output_start_index`. Ensure the placement doesn't overwrite the maroon pixel if their positions overlap (though based on examples, overlap doesn't seem to occur). The sequence should occupy indices from `output_start_index` to `output_start_index + sequence_length - 1`.
