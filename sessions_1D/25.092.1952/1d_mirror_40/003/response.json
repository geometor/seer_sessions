The operation resembles reflecting the sequence's end position across the maroon pixel to determine its new start position.\n\n1. Assume the input is a one-dimensional array (list) of pixels.\n2. Create a new output array of the same size as the input, initially filled with white pixels (0).\n3. Find the index of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array; let this be `maroon_index`. Place a maroon pixel (9) at `maroon_index` in the output array.\n4. Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels in the input array. Record its color (`sequence_color`), its ending index (`input_end_index`), and its length (`sequence_length`).\n5. Calculate the spatial distance (`d`) between the end of the input sequence and the maroon pixel: `d = maroon_index - input_end_index`. This represents the number of pixels strictly between the sequence and the pivot.\n6. Calculate the starting index for the sequence in the output array (`output_start_index`) by adding this distance `d` to the maroon pixel's index: `output_start_index = maroon_index + d`.\n7. Place the colored sequence into the output array: starting at `output_start_index`, fill the next `sequence_length` positions with the `sequence_color`. Ensure array bounds are respected and that the maroon pixel at `maroon_index` is not overwritten if an overlap were theoretically possible.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef find_pivot(grid_list):\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the pivot marker (9).\"\"\"\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid_list):\n        if pixel == 9:\n            return i\n    return -1 # Pivot not found\n\n\ndef find_colored_sequence(grid_list):\n    \"\"\"Finds the color, start index, end index, and length of the colored sequence.\"\"\"\n    start_index = -1\n    end_index = -1\n    sequence_color = -1\n    length = 0\n    in_sequence = False\n\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid_list):\n        # Detect start of a potential sequence\n        if not in_sequence and pixel != 0 and pixel != 9:\n            start_index = i\n            sequence_color = pixel\n            length = 1\n            in_sequence = True\n        # Continue the current sequence\n        elif in_sequence and pixel == sequence_color:\n            length += 1\n        # End the sequence if a different pixel is found\n        elif in_sequence and pixel != sequence_color:\n            end_index = i - 1\n            return sequence_color, start_index, end_index, length\n\n    # Handle case where sequence runs to the end of the grid\n    if in_sequence:\n        end_index = len(grid_list) - 1\n        return sequence_color, start_index, end_index, length\n\n    # Sequence not found\n    return -1, -1, -1, 0\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by repositioning the colored sequence relative\n    to the maroon pivot marker.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is treated as a flat list\n    # If input_grid is a numpy array (e.g., shape (1, N)), flatten it.\n    if hasattr(input_grid, 'flatten'):\n         input_list = list(input_grid.flatten())\n    else:\n         # Assume it's already list-like\n         input_list = list(input_grid)\n\n    grid_size = len(input_list)\n\n    # Initialize output_grid with white (0)\n    output_grid = [0] * grid_size\n\n    # Locate the pivot marker (maroon, 9)\n    maroon_index = find_pivot(input_list)\n    if maroon_index == -1:\n        # If no pivot, maybe return original or empty grid?
