Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The data appears as a sequence of numbers, likely representing pixels in a 1D array or a flattened 2D grid. Since all examples have 29 elements (a prime number), it's most probable they represent a 1D array of length 29.
2.  **Key Elements:**
    *   **Background:** The predominant color is white (0).
    *   **Marker Pixel:** Each example features a single maroon pixel (9). This pixel's position remains unchanged between the input and output.
    *   **Colored Block:** Each input contains one contiguous block of a single color other than white or maroon (red (2), green (3), or magenta (6)). This block is always located entirely *before* the maroon pixel in the input.
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   The background pixels in the output are primarily white (0).
    *   The maroon marker pixel (9) stays in its original position.
    *   The colored block (red, green, or magenta) is moved. In the output, it is located entirely *after* the maroon pixel.
    *   The relative positioning seems important. The number of white pixels between the end of the colored block and the maroon marker in the input appears to be equal to the number of white pixels between the maroon marker and the start of the colored block in the output. The block essentially "jumps" over the marker, maintaining its distance.
4.  **State Preservation:** The color and length of the colored block remain unchanged. The position of the maroon marker pixel remains unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array, but filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array. Note its index (`marker_index`).
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at `marker_index` in the output array.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input array that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Note its color, length (`block_length`), and the index of its last pixel (`block_end_index`).
5.  Calculate the distance `D` (number of background pixels) between the end of the colored block and the marker pixel in the input: `D = marker_index - block_end_index - 1`.
6.  Calculate the starting index for the colored block in the output array: `new_start_index = marker_index + 1 + D`.
7.  Place the identified colored block (using its original color and `block_length`) into the output array, starting at `new_start_index`.
```python
"""
Transforms a 1D array by relocating a contiguous block of color relative to a fixed marker pixel (maroon, 9).

The transformation identifies a single maroon pixel (9) and a single contiguous block of another color (not white '0' or maroon '9'). The block, which initially appears before the maroon pixel, is moved to appear after the maroon pixel. The number of white pixels (0) separating the block and the marker remains the same, but the block is now on the other side of the marker.
