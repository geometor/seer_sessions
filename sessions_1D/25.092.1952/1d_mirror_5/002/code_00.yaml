task_description: Relocate a colored block relative to a fixed marker pixel within a grid, treating the grid as a 1D sequence.

input_format: Grid (potentially 2D, e.g., NxM numpy array or list of lists) representing pixels.
processing_format: Input grid is flattened into a 1D sequence for all operations.
output_format: 1D list representing the transformed pixel sequence.

elements:
  - object: background
    pixels:
      - color: white
        value: 0
    properties:
      - fills_most_of_the_sequence

  - object: marker
    pixels:
      - color: maroon
        value: 9
    properties:
      - singleton (appears exactly once in the sequence)
      - fixed_position (its index in the flattened sequence remains the same in input and output)

  - object: colored_block
    pixels:
      - color: variable (not white or maroon)
        value: variable (not 0 or 9)
    properties:
      - contiguous_block (pixels of the same color are adjacent in the 1D sequence)
      - variable_position (relative to the start of the sequence)
      - variable_color
      - variable_length (constant within a single example pair)
      - appears_once_per_sequence
      - located_before_marker (in the input sequence)

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: flatten_input
    actor: system
    target: input_grid
    details: Convert the input grid (potentially 2D) into a 1D sequence.

  - action: identify_marker
    actor: system
    target: marker
    scope: flattened_input
    details: Find the index (`marker_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel.

  - action: identify_block
    actor: system
    target: colored_block
    scope: flattened_input
    details: Find the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) or maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), length (`block_length`), and the index of its last pixel (`block_end_index`).

  - relationship: spatial_distance
    scope: flattened_input
    between: [colored_block, marker]
    measure: count_of_background_pixels
    property: Number of white (0) pixels between the `block_end_index` and the `marker_index`.
    calculation: D = marker_index - block_end_index - 1

  - action: create_output_sequence
    actor: system
    details: Initialize a 1D sequence of the same size as the flattened input, filled with the background color (white, 0).

  - action: place_marker
    actor: system
    target: marker
    destination: output_sequence
    details: Place the maroon (9) pixel at `marker_index` in the output sequence.

  - action: calculate_new_block_position
    actor: system
    target: colored_block
    based_on: [marker_index, spatial_distance (D)]
    details: The new start index for the colored block in the output sequence is `new_start_index = marker_index + 1 + D`.

  - action: place_block
    actor: system
    target: colored_block
    destination: output_sequence
    details: Place the colored block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index`.
