            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code implementation correctly identified the core logic: finding a marker (maroon pixel '9'), identifying a colored block, calculating the distance between them, and repositioning the block on the other side of the marker while maintaining the distance. The failure wasn't in the conceptual understanding but likely in handling the input data format within the testing environment. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly suggests that the code attempted a boolean comparison on a NumPy array containing multiple elements, rather than a single scalar value. This typically happens when iterating over a multi-dimensional array row by row, instead of element by element, or if the input was passed in an unexpected format (e.g., a 2D array) to functions expecting 1D sequences or scalar pixels during iteration.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to ensure the input grid, regardless of its initial dimensions (e.g., 1xN, Nx1, or potentially MxN though examples seem 1D-like), is treated as a flattened, one-dimensional sequence for the purpose of identifying the marker, the block, and their relative positions. The core transformation logic operates on this 1D representation.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's re-verify the logic using the provided examples, assuming the input needs flattening.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n"
