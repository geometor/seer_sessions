The colored block, initially positioned before the marker, is relocated to appear after the marker. The number of background pixels (white, 0) separating the block and the marker is preserved, meaning the block effectively 'jumps' over the marker while maintaining its relative distance. The output is returned as a 1D list.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_marker(grid_flat, marker_color=9):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the first occurrence of the marker color in a flattened grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_flat (np.array): A 1D numpy array representing the flattened grid.\n        marker_color (int): The value of the marker pixel to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the marker pixel, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    indices = np.where(grid_flat == marker_color)[0]\n    return indices[0] if len(indices) > 0 else -1\n\ndef find_colored_block(grid_flat, background_color=0, marker_color=9):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the color, start index, and end index of the first contiguous colored block\n    (not background or marker color) in a flattened grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_flat (np.array): A 1D numpy array representing the flattened grid.\n        background_color (int): The value of the background pixel.\n        marker_color (int): The value of the marker pixel.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (block_color, start_index, end_index) if found,\n               otherwise (None, -1, -1).\n    \"\"\"\n    block_color = None\n    start_index = -1\n    end_index = -1\n    in_block = False\n\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid_flat):\n        is_block_pixel = (pixel != background_color and pixel != marker_color)\n        if is_block_pixel:\n            if not in_block:\n                # Start of a new block\n                block_color = pixel\n                start_index = i\n                in_block = True\n            # Update end_index as long as we are in the block\n            end_index = i\n        elif in_block:\n            # End of the block found (since we assume only one block)\n            break\n\n    return block_color, start_index, end_index\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list or list[list] or np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A 1D list representing the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constants\n    background_color = 0\n    marker_color = 9\n\n    # 1.
