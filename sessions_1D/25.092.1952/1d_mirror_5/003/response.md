```python
"""
Transforms a grid by treating it as a 1D sequence, identifying a fixed marker pixel (maroon, 9) and a contiguous block of another color (not white '0' or maroon '9'). The colored block, initially positioned before the marker, is relocated to appear after the marker. The number of background pixels (white, 0) separating the block and the marker is preserved, meaning the block effectively 'jumps' over the marker while maintaining its relative distance. The output is returned as a 1D list.
