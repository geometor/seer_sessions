Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The data appears as a sequence of numbers, likely representing pixels in a 1D array or a flattened 2D grid. Since all examples have 29 elements (a prime number), it's most probable they represent a 1D array of length 29.
2.  **Key Elements:**
    *   **Background:** The predominant color is white (0).
    *   **Marker Pixel:** Each example features a single maroon pixel (9). This pixel's position remains unchanged between the input and output.
    *   **Colored Block:** Each input contains one contiguous block of a single color other than white or maroon (red (2), green (3), or magenta (6)). This block is always located entirely *before* the maroon pixel in the input.
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   The background pixels in the output are primarily white (0).
    *   The maroon marker pixel (9) stays in its original position.
    *   The colored block (red, green, or magenta) is moved. In the output, it is located entirely *after* the maroon pixel.
    *   The relative positioning seems important. The number of white pixels between the end of the colored block and the maroon marker in the input appears to be equal to the number of white pixels between the maroon marker and the start of the colored block in the output. The block essentially "jumps" over the marker, maintaining its distance.
4.  **State Preservation:** The color and length of the colored block remain unchanged. The position of the maroon marker pixel remains unchanged.

task_description: Relocate a colored block relative to a fixed marker pixel in a 1D array.

elements:
  - object: background
    pixels:
      - color: white
        value: 0
    properties:
      - fills_most_of_the_array

  - object: marker
    pixels:
      - color: maroon
        value: 9
    properties:
      - singleton (appears exactly once)
      - fixed_position (its index is the same in input and output)

  - object: colored_block
    pixels:
      - color: [red, green, magenta] # Variable color
        value: [2, 3, 6] # Variable value, but not 0 or 9
    properties:
      - contiguous_block (pixels of the same color are adjacent)
      - variable_position
      - variable_color
      - variable_length (though constant within a single example pair)
      - appears_once_per_array

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: marker
    details: find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel.

  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: colored_block
    details: find the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) or maroon (9). Record its color, start index, and end index.

  - relationship: spacing_before
    between: [colored_block, marker]
    scope: input
    measure: distance_in_pixels
    property: number of white (0) pixels between the end index of the colored_block and the index of the marker. Let this be D.
    calculation: D = (marker_index - colored_block_end_index - 1)

  - action: create_output_array
    actor: system
    details: initialize an array of the same size as the input, filled with white (0) pixels.

  - action: place_marker
    actor: system
    target: marker
    destination: output_array
    details: place the maroon (9) pixel at its original index in the output array.

  - action: calculate_new_position
    actor: system
    target: colored_block
    based_on: [marker_index, spacing_before (D)]
    details: the new start index for the colored block is (marker_index + 1 + D).

  - action: place_block
    actor: system
    target: colored_block
    destination: output_array
    details: place the colored block (using its original color and length) starting at the calculated new position in the output array.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array, but filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array. Note its index (`marker_index`).
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at `marker_index` in the output array.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input array that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Note its color, length (`block_length`), and the index of its last pixel (`block_end_index`).
5.  Calculate the distance `D` (number of background pixels) between the end of the colored block and the marker pixel in the input: `D = marker_index - block_end_index - 1`.
6.  Calculate the starting index for the colored block in the output array: `new_start_index = marker_index + 1 + D`.
7.  Place the identified colored block (using its original color and `block_length`) into the output array, starting at `new_start_index`.
