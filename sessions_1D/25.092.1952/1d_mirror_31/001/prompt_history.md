Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays) of the same length (1x15 in the examples).
2.  **Color Palette**: The grids use white (0), maroon (9), and one other color per example (magenta-6, orange-7, yellow-4).
3.  **Key Objects**:
    *   A single, stationary maroon pixel (9).
    *   A contiguous horizontal block (object) of a single color (magenta, orange, or yellow in the examples). This block always consists of 4 pixels in the examples.
    *   Background white pixels (0).
4.  **Initial State**: In all input examples, the colored block appears to the left of the maroon pixel. There is at least one white pixel between the block and the maroon pixel.
5.  **Transformation**: The core transformation is the repositioning (movement) of the colored block.
6.  **Movement Rule**: The colored block moves from its original position to a new position located to the right of the maroon pixel. Specifically, the block starts at the column index that is 2 positions to the right of the maroon pixel's column index.
7.  **Object Integrity**: The colored block retains its color and size (length) during the move.
8.  **Stationary Element**: The maroon pixel (9) does not move; it remains in the same position in the output as in the input.
9.  **Background Filling**: The original location previously occupied by the colored block is filled with white pixels (0) in the output grid. The rest of the grid remains white, except for the stationary maroon pixel and the moved block.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored block relative to a fixed maroon pixel in a 1D grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  size_relation: Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - object_type: block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white (0), non-maroon (9) (e.g., magenta-6, orange-7, yellow-4)
      - contiguity: horizontally contiguous pixels of the same color
      - size: variable length (4 pixels in examples)
    initial_position: left of the maroon pixel
    action: moves to a new position
    final_position: starts 2 cells to the right of the maroon pixel
    preservation: color and size are preserved

  - object_type: marker
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
    initial_position: fixed (index 8 in examples)
    action: remains stationary
    final_position: same as initial position
    role: acts as a reference point for the block's final position

transformation_rules:
  - rule: Identify the maroon marker pixel and its index.
  - rule: Identify the colored block (color, start index, length).
  - rule: Create a new grid filled with the background color (white).
  - rule: Place the maroon marker pixel in the new grid at its original index.
  - rule: Calculate the new starting index for the block: (maroon marker index + 2).
  - rule: Place the colored block (using its original color and length) in the new grid starting at the calculated new index.
  - rule: The original position of the block is implicitly overwritten by the background color during the creation of the new grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Create an output grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Find the index (column position) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid. Let this be `maroon_index`.
4.  Place a maroon (9) pixel in the output grid at `maroon_index`.
5.  Find the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record the color (`block_color`), the starting index (`block_start_index`), and the length (`block_length`) of this block.
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output grid: `new_block_start_index = maroon_index + 2`.
7.  Place the block into the output grid: Fill the cells from `new_block_start_index` to `new_block_start_index + block_length - 1` with `block_color`.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
