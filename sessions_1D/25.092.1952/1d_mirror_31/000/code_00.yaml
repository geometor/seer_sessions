task_description: Move a colored block relative to a fixed maroon pixel in a 1D grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  size_relation: Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - object_type: block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white (0), non-maroon (9) (e.g., magenta-6, orange-7, yellow-4)
      - contiguity: horizontally contiguous pixels of the same color
      - size: variable length (4 pixels in examples)
    initial_position: left of the maroon pixel
    action: moves to a new position
    final_position: starts 2 cells to the right of the maroon pixel
    preservation: color and size are preserved

  - object_type: marker
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
    initial_position: fixed (index 8 in examples)
    action: remains stationary
    final_position: same as initial position
    role: acts as a reference point for the block's final position

transformation_rules:
  - rule: Identify the maroon marker pixel and its index.
  - rule: Identify the colored block (color, start index, length).
  - rule: Create a new grid filled with the background color (white).
  - rule: Place the maroon marker pixel in the new grid at its original index.
  - rule: Calculate the new starting index for the block: (maroon marker index + 2).
  - rule: Place the colored block (using its original color and length) in the new grid starting at the calculated new index.
  - rule: The original position of the block is implicitly overwritten by the background color during the creation of the new grid.
