This block always consists of 4 pixels in the examples.\n    *   Background white pixels (0).\n4.  **Initial State**: In all input examples, the colored block appears to the left of the maroon pixel. There is at least one white pixel between the block and the maroon pixel.\n5.  **Transformation**: The core transformation is the repositioning (movement) of the colored block.\n6.  **Movement Rule**: The colored block moves from its original position to a new position located to the right of the maroon pixel. Specifically, the block starts at the column index that is 2 positions to the right of the maroon pixel's column index.\n7.  **Object Integrity**: The colored block retains its color and size (length) during the move.\n8.  **Stationary Element**: The maroon pixel (9) does not move; it remains in the same position in the output as in the input.\n9.  **Background Filling**: The original location previously occupied by the colored block is filled with white pixels (0) in the output grid. The rest of the grid remains white, except for the stationary maroon pixel and the moved block.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output grid: `new_block_start_index = maroon_index + 2`.\n7.
