Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN)
  background_color: white (0)
  format: numpy array

Objects:
  - object_id: red_block
    color: red (2)
    shape: contiguous_horizontal_block
    size: 3 pixels (width)
    count: 1
  - object_id: maroon_pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    shape: single_pixel
    size: 1 pixel
    count: 1

Relationships_Input:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: red_block
    object2: maroon_pixel
    details: red_block is to the left of maroon_pixel
  - type: adjacency
    object1: red_block (rightmost pixel)
    object2: maroon_pixel
    separation: 1 white (0) pixel (index difference = 2)

Relationships_Output:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: red_block
    object2: maroon_pixel
    details: red_block is to the right of maroon_pixel
  - type: adjacency
    object1: maroon_pixel
    object2: red_block (leftmost pixel)
    separation: 1 white (0) pixel (index difference = 2)

Actions:
  - action: identify
    target: red_block
    attributes: start_index
  - action: identify
    target: maroon_pixel
    attributes: index
  - action: create_output_grid
    properties: same dimensions as input, filled with background color (white, 0)
  - action: place_object
    target: maroon_pixel
    destination_grid: output_grid
    position: same index as in input_grid
  - action: calculate_target_position
    target: red_block
    reference_object: maroon_pixel
    rule: start_index = maroon_pixel_index + 2
  - action: place_object
    target: red_block
    destination_grid: output_grid
    position: calculated_target_position

Invariant:
  - The index of the maroon_pixel remains constant.
  - The composition of the red_block (three red pixels) remains constant.
  - The background color remains white.
  - The grid dimensions remain constant.
