Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 1D arrays (or single rows) of pixels.
*   Each grid contains primarily white pixels (0).
*   There are two distinct non-white features in each input:
    *   A single maroon pixel (9).
    *   A contiguous block of three red pixels (2 2 2).
*   In the input grids, the red block always appears to the left of the maroon pixel.
*   In the output grids, the positions are reversed: the maroon pixel appears to the left of the red block.
*   The relative spacing between the end of the red block and the maroon pixel in the input is one white pixel (`2 0 9`).
*   The relative spacing between the maroon pixel and the start of the red block in the output is also one white pixel (`9 0 2`).
*   The position of the maroon pixel itself does not change between the input and output.
*   The transformation involves relocating the red block relative to the fixed maroon pixel.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D)
  background_color: white (0)

Objects:
  - object_id: red_block
    color: red (2)
    shape: contiguous_block
    size: 3 pixels (width)
    count: 1
  - object_id: maroon_pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    shape: single_pixel
    size: 1 pixel
    count: 1

Relationships_Input:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: red_block
    object2: maroon_pixel
    details: red_block is to the left of maroon_pixel
  - type: spacing
    object1: red_block
    object2: maroon_pixel
    details: separated by one white (0) pixel (specifically, the rightmost pixel of red_block is two positions left of maroon_pixel)

Relationships_Output:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: red_block
    object2: maroon_pixel
    details: red_block is to the right of maroon_pixel
  - type: spacing
    object1: maroon_pixel
    object2: red_block
    details: separated by one white (0) pixel (specifically, maroon_pixel is two positions left of the leftmost pixel of red_block)

Actions:
  - action: identify
    target: red_block
    attributes: position
  - action: identify
    target: maroon_pixel
    attributes: position
  - action: maintain_position
    target: maroon_pixel
  - action: move
    target: red_block
    destination: new position relative to maroon_pixel
    details: The red block is moved from the left side of the maroon pixel to the right side, maintaining a one-pixel white gap.

Invariant:
  - The position of the maroon_pixel remains constant.
  - The composition of the red_block (three red pixels) remains constant.
  - The background color remains white.
  - The grid size remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the position (index) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid.
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at the same position in the output grid.
4.  Locate the contiguous block of three red pixels (2 2 2) in the input grid.
5.  Determine the target starting position for the red block in the output grid: this position is two steps to the right of the maroon pixel's index.
6.  Place the block of three red pixels (2 2 2) starting at this target position in the output grid.
