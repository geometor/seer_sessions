Transformation Rule:
1. Accept the input grid, which is a 1xN numpy array.
2. Determine the dimensions (height=1, width=N) of the input grid.
3. Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (1xN), filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4. Locate the column index of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid's row.
5. Place the maroon pixel (9) at the same column index in the output grid's row.
6. Calculate the target starting column index for the red block in the output grid: this index is maroon_pixel_index + 2.
7. Define the red block as the sequence [2, 2, 2].
8. Place the red block sequence into the output grid's row, starting at the calculated target column index. Ensure the block fits within the grid width.
9. Return the completed output grid.
