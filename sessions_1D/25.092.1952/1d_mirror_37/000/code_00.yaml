Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D)
  background_color: white (0)

Objects:
  - object_id: red_block
    color: red (2)
    shape: contiguous_block
    size: 3 pixels (width)
    count: 1
  - object_id: maroon_pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    shape: single_pixel
    size: 1 pixel
    count: 1

Relationships_Input:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: red_block
    object2: maroon_pixel
    details: red_block is to the left of maroon_pixel
  - type: spacing
    object1: red_block
    object2: maroon_pixel
    details: separated by one white (0) pixel (specifically, the rightmost pixel of red_block is two positions left of maroon_pixel)

Relationships_Output:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: red_block
    object2: maroon_pixel
    details: red_block is to the right of maroon_pixel
  - type: spacing
    object1: maroon_pixel
    object2: red_block
    details: separated by one white (0) pixel (specifically, maroon_pixel is two positions left of the leftmost pixel of red_block)

Actions:
  - action: identify
    target: red_block
    attributes: position
  - action: identify
    target: maroon_pixel
    attributes: position
  - action: maintain_position
    target: maroon_pixel
  - action: move
    target: red_block
    destination: new position relative to maroon_pixel
    details: The red block is moved from the left side of the maroon pixel to the right side, maintaining a one-pixel white gap.

Invariant:
  - The position of the maroon_pixel remains constant.
  - The composition of the red_block (three red pixels) remains constant.
  - The background color remains white.
  - The grid size remains constant.
