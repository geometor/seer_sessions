## Perception

The input and output are presented as one-dimensional arrays or single-row grids. Each grid contains three main components:
1.  A background color, which is white (0).
2.  A single marker pixel, which is maroon (9).
3.  A contiguous horizontal block of a single color (gray (5) or magenta (6)), which I'll call the "main block".

The transformation involves repositioning the main block relative to the marker pixel. Key observations:
*   The marker pixel's position remains unchanged between the input and output.
*   The main block's color and length remain unchanged.
*   The main block is always to the left of the marker in the input grid.
*   The main block is always to the right of the marker in the output grid.
*   The original position of the main block is replaced with the background color (white) in the output.
*   The distance between the marker and the right edge of the block in the input grid is equal to the distance between the marker and the left edge of the block in the output grid.

      The distance 'd' between the marker's position and the rightmost pixel
      of the main_block in the input grid determines the starting position
      of the main_block in the output grid.
      The output starting position is marker's position + d.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the single marker pixel (maroon, 9) in the input grid and record its index (`marker_idx`).
3.  Place the marker pixel (maroon, 9) at `marker_idx` in the output grid.
4.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the "main block") in the input grid.
5.  Record the color (`block_color`), length (`block_len`), and the index of the rightmost pixel (`block_right_idx`) of the main block.
6.  Calculate the distance `d` between the marker and the right edge of the main block in the input: `d = marker_idx - block_right_idx`.
7.  Calculate the starting index for the main block in the output grid: `output_start_idx = marker_idx + d`.
8.  Place the main block into the output grid: Starting at `output_start_idx`, fill the next `block_len` pixels with `block_color`.

Transforms a 1D grid by reflecting a colored block across a marker pixel.

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the single marker pixel (maroon, 9) in the input grid and record its index (`marker_idx`).
3.  Place the marker pixel (maroon, 9) at `marker_idx` in the output grid.
4.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the "main block") entirely to the left of the marker in the input grid.
5.  Record the color (`block_color`), length (`block_len`), and the index of the rightmost pixel (`block_right_idx`) of the main block.
6.  Calculate the distance `d` between the marker and the right edge of the main block in the input: `d = marker_idx - block_right_idx`. This represents the gap between the block and the marker.
7.  Calculate the starting index for the main block in the output grid: `output_start_idx = marker_idx + d`. This places the block to the right of the marker with the same gap `d`.
8.  Place the main block into the output grid: Starting at `output_start_idx`, fill the next `block_len` pixels with `block_color`.
