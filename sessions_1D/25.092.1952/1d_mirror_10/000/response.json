A background color, which is white (0).\n2.  A single marker pixel, which is maroon (9).\n3.  A contiguous horizontal block of a single color (gray (5) or magenta (6)), which I'll call the \"main block\".\n\nThe transformation involves repositioning the main block relative to the marker pixel. Key observations:\n*   The marker pixel's position remains unchanged between the input and output.\n*   The main block's color and length remain unchanged.\n*   The main block is always to the left of the marker in the input grid.\n*   The main block is always to the right of the marker in the output grid.\n*   The original position of the main block is replaced with the background color (white) in the output.\n*   The distance between the marker and the right edge of the block in the input grid is equal to the distance between the marker and the left edge of the block in the output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
