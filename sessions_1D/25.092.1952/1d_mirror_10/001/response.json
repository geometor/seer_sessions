Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n2.  Locate the single marker pixel (maroon, 9) in the input grid and record its index (`marker_idx`).\n3.  Place the marker pixel (maroon, 9) at `marker_idx` in the output grid.\n4.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the \"main block\") entirely to the left of the marker in the input grid.\n5.  Record the color (`block_color`), length (`block_len`), and the index of the rightmost pixel (`block_right_idx`) of the main block.\n6.  Calculate the distance `d` between the marker and the right edge of the main block in the input: `d = marker_idx - block_right_idx`. This represents the gap between the block and the marker.\n7.  Calculate the starting index for the main block in the output grid: `output_start_idx = marker_idx + d`. This places the block to the right of the marker with the same gap `d`.\n8.  Place the main block into the output grid: Starting at `output_start_idx`, fill the next `block_len` pixels with `block_color`.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_marker(row):\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the marker (9).\"\"\"\n    try:\n        return row.index(9)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1 # Marker not found\n\ndef find_block_left_of_marker(row, marker_idx):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the contiguous block of non-0, non-9 color immediately left of the marker.\n    Returns (block_color, block_len, block_right_idx) or (None, 0, -1) if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_color = None\n    block_right_idx = -1\n    block_len = 0\n    \n    # 1.
