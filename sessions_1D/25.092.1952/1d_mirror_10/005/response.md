"""
Transforms a 1xN grid by finding a single maroon (9) marker pixel and a 
contiguous block of a single non-white(0), non-maroon(9) color located entirely 
to the left of the marker. The block is then moved ('reflected') to the right 
side of the marker such that the distance (number of cells) between the 
marker and the block's closest edge remains the same. The block's color and 
length are preserved. The marker's position remains unchanged. The original 
position of the block is filled with the background color (white, 0).
