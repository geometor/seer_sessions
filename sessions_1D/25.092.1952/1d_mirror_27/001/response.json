Identify the pivot element, which is the maroon (9) pixel. Assume there is exactly one pivot per row.\n2. Create an output row of the same size, initialized with white (0) pixels.\n3. Place the pivot (9) in the output row at the same column index it had in the input row.\n4. Find the contiguous block of non-white pixels (the 'Object') located before the pivot in the input row. This object is the one immediately preceding the pivot, potentially separated by some white (0) pixels.\n5. Identify the contiguous block of white (0) pixels (the 'Separator') located between the end of the Object and the pivot in the input row. The Separator's length can be zero if the Object is immediately adjacent to the pivot.\n6. In the output row, place the Separator immediately after the pivot. Since the output is initialized to white, this step effectively reserves the space.\n7. In the output row, place the Object immediately after the Separator. The Object retains its original color and length.\n8. All other positions in the output row remain white (0).\n9.
