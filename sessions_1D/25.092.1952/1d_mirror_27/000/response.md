Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be 1D arrays or single rows from a larger 2D grid. The transformation seems to operate independently on each such row.
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   `white` (0) acts as the background or filler color.
    *   `maroon` (9) acts as a special marker or pivot point within the row.
    *   Other colors (`green` (3), `yellow` (4) in the examples) form contiguous blocks (objects) that are manipulated.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The central action involves rearranging elements around the `maroon` (9) pivot pixel. Specifically, a block of non-`white` color and the adjacent `white` space located *before* the pivot are moved to the position *after* the pivot.
4.  **Object Identification:** The primary object being moved is the contiguous block of a single non-`white` color that immediately precedes the `maroon` pivot (potentially separated by some `white` pixels).
5.  **Separator Identification:** The contiguous block of `white` pixels located between the colored object and the `maroon` pivot also seems to be part of the moved elements, maintaining its position relative to the colored object (it stays between the pivot and the object after the move).
6.  **Invariance:** The `maroon` (9) pixel itself stays in its original column index. The length of the row remains unchanged. Pixels far from the pivot (e.g., initial `white` pixels before the object, `white` pixels after the pivot in the input) are effectively replaced by `white` in the output unless they become occupied by the moved object/separator.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Type: 1D Array (or Row of 2D Grid)

Elements:
  - type: Pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: Background / Separator / Filler
  - type: Pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    role: Pivot
    properties: Unique within the row (based on examples)
  - type: Object
    definition: Contiguous block of non-white pixels
    location: Precedes the Pivot pixel in the input
    role: Primary element to be moved
  - type: Separator
    definition: Contiguous block of white pixels
    location: Between the Object and the Pivot in the input
    role: Element moved along with the Object

Transformation: Rearrangement around Pivot

Input_Structure:
  - Row: [Prefix_White?, Object, Separator, Pivot, Suffix]

Output_Structure:
  - Row: [Prefix_White', Pivot, Separator, Object, Suffix_White']
    constraints:
      - Pivot maintains its original column index.
      - Length of Separator and Object are preserved.
      - Order relative to Pivot is changed: (Object, Separator, Pivot) -> (Pivot, Separator, Object)
      - All other positions become white (0).

Relationships:
  - Object is the non-white block nearest to the Pivot, on the side before it.
  - Separator is the white block between the Object and the Pivot.
  - Pivot's position dictates the split point for rearrangement.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  For each row in the input grid:
2.  Create a new output row of the same length, initially filled with `white` (0) pixels.
3.  Locate the index of the `maroon` (9) pixel (the Pivot).
4.  Place the `maroon` (9) pixel in the output row at the same index.
5.  Identify the contiguous block of non-`white` pixels (the Object) that is located before the Pivot in the input row and is closest to it. Note its color and length.
6.  Identify the contiguous block of `white` (0) pixels (the Separator) located immediately between the end of the Object and the Pivot in the input row. Note its length (can be zero).
7.  Determine the starting index for placing the Separator in the output row: it is the index immediately after the Pivot.
8.  Place the Separator block (a sequence of `white` (0) pixels of the determined length) into the output row starting at this index.
9.  Determine the starting index for placing the Object in the output row: it is the index immediately after the Separator.
10. Place the Object block (a sequence of its original color and length) into the output row starting at this index.
11. The output row is now complete.
12. Combine all processed output rows to form the final output grid.
