The transformation seems to operate independently on each such row.\n2.  **Key Colors:**\n    *   `white` (0) acts as the background or filler color.\n    *   `maroon` (9) acts as a special marker or pivot point within the row.\n    *   Other colors (`green` (3), `yellow` (4) in the examples) form contiguous blocks (objects) that are manipulated.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The central action involves rearranging elements around the `maroon` (9) pivot pixel. Specifically, a block of non-`white` color and the adjacent `white` space located *before* the pivot are moved to the position *after* the pivot.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The primary object being moved is the contiguous block of a single non-`white` color that immediately precedes the `maroon` pivot (potentially separated by some `white` pixels).\n5.  **Separator Identification:** The contiguous block of `white` pixels located between the colored object and the `maroon` pivot also seems to be part of the moved elements, maintaining its position relative to the colored object (it stays between the pivot and the object after the move).\n6.  **Invariance:** The `maroon` (9) pixel itself stays in its original column index. The length of the row remains unchanged. Pixels far from the pivot (e.g., initial `white` pixels before the object, `white` pixels after the pivot in the input) are effectively replaced by `white` in the output unless they become occupied by the moved object/separator.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
