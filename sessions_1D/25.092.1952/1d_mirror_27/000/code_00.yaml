Grid_Type: 1D Array (or Row of 2D Grid)

Elements:
  - type: Pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: Background / Separator / Filler
  - type: Pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    role: Pivot
    properties: Unique within the row (based on examples)
  - type: Object
    definition: Contiguous block of non-white pixels
    location: Precedes the Pivot pixel in the input
    role: Primary element to be moved
  - type: Separator
    definition: Contiguous block of white pixels
    location: Between the Object and the Pivot in the input
    role: Element moved along with the Object

Transformation: Rearrangement around Pivot

Input_Structure:
  - Row: [Prefix_White?, Object, Separator, Pivot, Suffix]

Output_Structure:
  - Row: [Prefix_White', Pivot, Separator, Object, Suffix_White']
    constraints:
      - Pivot maintains its original column index.
      - Length of Separator and Object are preserved.
      - Order relative to Pivot is changed: (Object, Separator, Pivot) -> (Pivot, Separator, Object)
      - All other positions become white (0).

Relationships:
  - Object is the non-white block nearest to the Pivot, on the side before it.
  - Separator is the white block between the Object and the Pivot.
  - Pivot's position dictates the split point for rearrangement.
