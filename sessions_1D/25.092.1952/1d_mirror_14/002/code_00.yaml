task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_size: Variable (Examples are 1x17, but could differ)
  background_color: white (0)
  relevant_row_identified_by: Contains both pivot and object pixels.
elements:
  - type: pivot_pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1 per grid
    location: Within the single relevant row.
    properties:
      - stationary # its position does not change between input and output
  - type: object
    color: non-white, non-maroon (variable: orange, blue, red in examples)
    count: 1 per grid
    shape: contiguous horizontal segment
    location: Within the single relevant row.
    properties:
      - movable # its position changes between input and output
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    element1: object
    element2: pivot_pixel
    relation: The object's horizontal position relative to the pivot pixel is reflected within their shared row.
actions:
  - name: identify_relevant_row
    input: input_grid
    process: Find the unique row index containing both the maroon (9) pixel and the contiguous segment of non-white, non-maroon pixels.
    output: row_index
  - name: find_pivot_column
    input:
      - input_grid
      - row_index
    target: maroon (9) pixel within the specified row
    output: pivot_col_index
  - name: find_object_in_row
    input:
      - input_grid
      - row_index
      - pivot_col_index
    target: contiguous segment of non-white(0), non-maroon(9) pixels in the specified row
    output:
      - object_color
      - object_col_indices # List of column indices relative to the row
  - name: reflect_object_in_row
    input:
      - object_col_indices
      - pivot_col_index
    process: For each object column index `c`, calculate the reflected column index `c' = 2 * pivot_col_index - c`.
    output: reflected_object_col_indices
  - name: construct_output
    input:
      - input_grid_shape
      - row_index
      - pivot_col_index
      - object_color
      - reflected_object_col_indices
    process:
      - Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
      - Place the pivot color (maroon, 9) at its original position (row_index, pivot_col_index).
      - Place the object_color at the calculated reflected positions (row_index, reflected_col_index) for each `reflected_col_index`.
      # Note: Assumes other rows remain background, as seen in examples. If inputs had multiple rows with content, this might need adjustment.
    output: output_grid
transformation_type: Horizontal reflection within a specific row, identified by the co-occurrence of a pivot point (maroon pixel) and a colored object.
