Okay, let's analyze this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (represented as a 1xN row vector). The size appears consistent across examples (1x17).
*   **Colors/Pixels:**
    *   White (0) serves as the background.
    *   Maroon (9) appears exactly once in each input grid and remains stationary in the output.
    *   Other colors (orange (7), blue (1), red (2)) form contiguous horizontal segments (objects). There is only one such object in each input.
*   **Objects:**
    *   There is a single maroon pixel (9), which seems to be a pivot or anchor point.
    *   There is a single contiguous block of another color (orange, blue, or red).
*   **Transformation:** The colored object (non-white, non-maroon) changes its position relative to the maroon pixel. The object seems to be reflected across the position of the maroon pixel. The maroon pixel itself does not move. The background pixels (white) fill the space left by the object and the space previously occupied by white pixels where the object moves to.

**YAML Facts:**

task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
  grid_size: Constant (1x17 in examples)

      count: 1
      properties:
        - stationary # its position does not change between input and output
    - type: object
      color: non-white, non-maroon (variable: orange, blue, red in examples)
      count: 1
      shape: contiguous horizontal segment
      properties:
        - movable # its position changes between input and output
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    element1: object
    element2: pivot_pixel
    relation: The object's position relative to the pivot pixel changes.
actions:
  - name: find_pivot

    target: maroon (9) pixel
    output: index_of_pivot
  - name: find_object
    input: input_grid
    target: contiguous segment of non-white, non-maroon pixels
    output:
      - object_color
      - indices_of_object_pixels
  - name: reflect_object
    input:
      - object_indices
      - pivot_index
    process: For each object index `i`, calculate the reflected index `i' = 2 * pivot_index - i`.
    output: reflected_object_indices
  - name: construct_output
    input:
      - grid_dimensions
      - pivot_index
      - object_color
      - reflected_object_indices
    process:
      - Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color (white).
      - Place the pivot color (maroon) at the pivot_index.
      - Place the object_color at the reflected_object_indices.
    output: output_grid
transformation_type: Reflection across a fixed point (maroon pixel).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white).
2.  Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid and note its index (`pivot_index`). Place this maroon pixel at the `pivot_index` in the output grid.
3.  Identify the contiguous segment of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Note the color (`object_color`) and the indices (`object_indices`) of these pixels in the input grid.
4.  For each index `i` in the `object_indices`:
    a. Calculate the reflected index `reflected_index = (2 * pivot_index) - i`.
    b. Place the `object_color` at the `reflected_index` in the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
