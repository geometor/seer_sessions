task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
  grid_size: Constant (1x17 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  elements:
    - type: pivot_pixel
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
      properties:
        - stationary # its position does not change between input and output
    - type: object
      color: non-white, non-maroon (variable: orange, blue, red in examples)
      count: 1
      shape: contiguous horizontal segment
      properties:
        - movable # its position changes between input and output
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    element1: object
    element2: pivot_pixel
    relation: The object's position relative to the pivot pixel changes.
actions:
  - name: find_pivot
    input: input_grid
    target: maroon (9) pixel
    output: index_of_pivot
  - name: find_object
    input: input_grid
    target: contiguous segment of non-white, non-maroon pixels
    output:
      - object_color
      - indices_of_object_pixels
  - name: reflect_object
    input:
      - object_indices
      - pivot_index
    process: For each object index `i`, calculate the reflected index `i' = 2 * pivot_index - i`.
    output: reflected_object_indices
  - name: construct_output
    input:
      - grid_dimensions
      - pivot_index
      - object_color
      - reflected_object_indices
    process:
      - Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color (white).
      - Place the pivot color (maroon) at the pivot_index.
      - Place the object_color at the reflected_object_indices.
    output: output_grid
transformation_type: Reflection across a fixed point (maroon pixel).
