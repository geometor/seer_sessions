The size appears consistent across examples (1x17).\n*   **Colors/Pixels:**\n    *   White (0) serves as the background.\n    *   Maroon (9) appears exactly once in each input grid and remains stationary in the output.\n    *   Other colors (orange (7), blue (1), red (2)) form contiguous horizontal segments (objects). There is only one such object in each input.\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   There is a single maroon pixel (9), which seems to be a pivot or anchor point.\n    *   There is a single contiguous block of another color (orange, blue, or red).\n*   **Transformation:** The colored object (non-white, non-maroon) changes its position relative to the maroon pixel. The object seems to be reflected across the position of the maroon pixel. The maroon pixel itself does not move. The background pixels (white) fill the space left by the object and the space previously occupied by white pixels where the object moves to.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
