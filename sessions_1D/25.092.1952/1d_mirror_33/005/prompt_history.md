*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays).
    *   Each grid contains exactly one maroon pixel (color 9).
    *   Each grid contains one contiguous horizontal line object of a single color (blue, gray, or red in the examples), different from maroon and white.
    *   The rest of the grid cells are white (color 0).
    *   The maroon pixel's position remains unchanged between the input and output.
    *   The colored line object moves from one side of the maroon pixel to the other.
    *   The distance (number of white pixels) between the colored line object and the maroon pixel is preserved during the move. The object essentially reflects across the maroon pixel, maintaining the gap.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_manipulation

    objects:

    background_color: 0 (white)
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The line object is located either to the left or right of the pivot object.
      - type: distance
        description: The number of white pixels between the line object and the pivot object is constant.
    actions:
      - type: move/reflect
        target: line_object
        reference: pivot_object
        details: The line object is moved to the opposite side of the pivot object, maintaining the original separation distance (number of white pixels).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's dimensions, filled with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. This is the pivot point. Place the maroon pixel at the same position in the output grid.
    3.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels in the input grid. Note its color and length.
    4.  Determine the position of this block relative to the pivot point (left or right).
    5.  Count the number of white pixels (0) separating the block from the pivot point in the input grid. Let this count be `distance`.
    6.  Determine the starting position for the block in the output grid:
        *   If the block was to the left of the pivot in the input, its new starting position in the output will be `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
        *   If the block was to the right of the pivot in the input, its new starting position in the output will be `pivot_index - distance - block_length`.
    7.  Place the block (with its original color and length) starting at the calculated position in the output grid.

**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because it expected the input grid to be a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[0, 1, 1, ...]]`), representing a 2D grid with one row. However, the actual input format provided in the examples (`0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`) is a flat sequence of numbers, likely intended to be interpreted as a single list or a 1D array directly. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests the code was trying to evaluate a multi-element NumPy array in a boolean context, which happens when the input format assumption is wrong (e.g., `if not input_grid`).

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the code's input handling to accept a 1D list or array directly.
2.  Verify the core transformation logic (reflection across the pivot) remains valid for this 1D interpretation.
3.  Use code execution to confirm the structure and properties of the input/output examples.
4.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the 1D nature of the data and the transformation.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single list/array)
input_format: list of integers
output_format: list of integers
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    shape: single_element
    properties:
      - fixed_position: true # Position in output is same as input
  - type: block # Changed from 'line' to be more general for 1D
    color: any non-zero, non-maroon color (1, 2, 5 in examples)
    count: 1
    shape: contiguous_block (1D segment)
    properties:
      - variable_color
      - variable_length
      - moves_relative_to_pivot
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The block object is located either entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the pivot element.
  - type: distance
    description: The number of background (0) elements separating the block object and the pivot element is constant between input and output.
actions:
  - type: reflect # More descriptive than move/reflect
    target: block_object
    reference: pivot_element
    details: The block object is moved to the opposite side of the pivot element, maintaining the original separation distance (number of background elements). The object's color and length remain unchanged.
constraints:
  - Input and output lists have the same length.
  - Exactly one pivot element (9) exists.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of non-zero, non-pivot color exists.
  - The block and pivot do not overlap.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a single list of integers.
2.  Create an output list of the same length as the input, filled entirely with the background color (0).
3.  Locate the index of the single pivot element (color 9) in the input list.
4.  Place the pivot element (9) into the output list at the same index.
5.  Locate the contiguous block of elements in the input list whose color is not the background color (0) and not the pivot color (9). Record this block's color, start index, and end index.
6.  Calculate the length of the block (`block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).
7.  Determine if the block is to the left (`block_end_index < pivot_index`) or right (`block_start_index > pivot_index`) of the pivot in the input list.
8.  Calculate the separation distance:
    *   If the block is left, the distance is `pivot_index - block_end_index - 1`.
    *   If the block is right, the distance is `block_start_index - pivot_index - 1`.
    *   (The distance is the count of background elements between the block and the pivot).
9.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output list:
    *   If the block was originally left, the new start index is `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
    *   If the block was originally right, the new start index is `pivot_index - distance - block_length`.
10. Fill the elements in the output list from the `new_start_index` for `block_length` positions with the block's original color.
11. Return the completed output list.
