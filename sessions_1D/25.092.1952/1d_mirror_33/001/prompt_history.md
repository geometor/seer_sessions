*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays).
    *   Each grid contains exactly one maroon pixel (color 9).
    *   Each grid contains one contiguous horizontal line object of a single color (blue, gray, or red in the examples), different from maroon and white.
    *   The rest of the grid cells are white (color 0).
    *   The maroon pixel's position remains unchanged between the input and output.
    *   The colored line object moves from one side of the maroon pixel to the other.
    *   The distance (number of white pixels) between the colored line object and the maroon pixel is preserved during the move. The object essentially reflects across the maroon pixel, maintaining the gap.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_manipulation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    objects:
      - type: pivot
        color: 9 (maroon)
        count: 1
        shape: single_pixel
        properties:
          - fixed_position: true
      - type: line
        color: any non-zero, non-maroon color (1, 2, 5 in examples)
        count: 1
        shape: horizontal_line (contiguous block)
        properties:
          - variable_color
          - variable_length
          - moves_relative_to_pivot
    background_color: 0 (white)
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The line object is located either to the left or right of the pivot object.
      - type: distance
        description: The number of white pixels between the line object and the pivot object is constant.
    actions:
      - type: move/reflect
        target: line_object
        reference: pivot_object
        details: The line object is moved to the opposite side of the pivot object, maintaining the original separation distance (number of white pixels).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's dimensions, filled with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. This is the pivot point. Place the maroon pixel at the same position in the output grid.
    3.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels in the input grid. Note its color and length.
    4.  Determine the position of this block relative to the pivot point (left or right).
    5.  Count the number of white pixels (0) separating the block from the pivot point in the input grid. Let this count be `distance`.
    6.  Determine the starting position for the block in the output grid:
        *   If the block was to the left of the pivot in the input, its new starting position in the output will be `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
        *   If the block was to the right of the pivot in the input, its new starting position in the output will be `pivot_index - distance - block_length`.
    7.  Place the block (with its original color and length) starting at the calculated position in the output grid.
