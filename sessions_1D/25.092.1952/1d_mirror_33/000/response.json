The object essentially reflects across the maroon pixel, maintaining the gap.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. This is the pivot point. Place the maroon pixel at the same position in the output grid.\n    3.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels in the input grid. Note its color and length.\n    4.  Determine the position of this block relative to the pivot point (left or right).\n    5.  Count the number of white pixels (0) separating the block from the pivot point in the input grid. Let this count be `distance`.\n    6.  Determine the starting position for the block in the output grid:\n        *   If the block was to the left of the pivot in the input, its new starting position in the output will be `pivot_index + distance + 1`.\n        *   If the block was to the right of the pivot in the input, its new starting position in the output will be `pivot_index - distance - block_length`.\n    7.
