task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row, typically represented as a 1xN grid)
input_format: List containing a single List of integers (e.g., [[0, 1, 9, 0]])
output_format: List containing a single List of integers (e.g., [[0, 9, 1, 0]])
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    shape: single_pixel
    properties:
      - fixed_position: true # Position remains constant from input to output.
  - type: movable_block
    color: any non-zero, non-maroon color (variable)
    count: 1
    shape: contiguous_horizontal_line (variable length)
    properties:
      - variable_color
      - variable_length
      - moves_relative_to_pivot
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The movable_block is located entirely to one side (left or right) of the pivot object in the input.
  - type: distance
    description: The number of background pixels (0) separating the movable_block from the pivot object is measured.
actions:
  - type: reflect
    target: movable_block
    reference: pivot_object
    details: |
      The movable_block is moved to the opposite side of the pivot object.
      The separation distance (number of background pixels between the block and the pivot) is preserved in the new position.
      The block's color and length remain unchanged.
output_grid_construction:
  - Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
  - Place the pivot pixel (9) at its original index.
  - Place the movable_block at its calculated reflected position.
