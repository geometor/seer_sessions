            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code execution failed on all training examples, consistently returning the original input grid instead of the transformed output. The simulation using `tool_code` confirmed that the core logic (finding the pivot, finding the object, calculating distance, determining the new position, and placing the object) is mathematically sound and produces the correct result for Example 1 when executed in isolation.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests the failure likely stemmed from an implementation issue within the `transform` function provided to the test harness, rather than a flaw in the underlying transformation logic derived from the examples. Potential causes include:\n1.  Incorrect handling of the input grid format (e.g., expecting `[...]` vs. `[[...]]`).\n2.  An incorrect early `return` statement (perhaps returning `input_grid` itself under some condition).\n3.  A subtle interaction with list/numpy array types.\n4.  An undetected exception causing the function to return prematurely or incorrectly.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to trust the core reflection logic derived from the observations and simulation but to ensure the implementation is robust, specifically addressing input parsing and output formatting to match the expected ARC standard (typically `List[List[int]]`).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe `tool_code` simulation confirmed the following for Example 1:\n*   Input: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   Grid Size: 24\n*   Pivot Index (color 9): 10\n*   Object (color 1): Start=1, End=6, Length=6\n*   Position Relative to Pivot: Left\n*   Separation Distance (white pixels): 3 (`pivot_index` - `object_end` - 1 = 10 - 6 - 1)\n*   New Object Start Index: 14 (`pivot_index` + `distance` + 1 = 10 + 3 + 1)\n*   New Object End Index (exclusive): 20 (`new_object_start` + `object_length` = 14 + 6)\n*   Calculated Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected output)\n\nSimilar calculations for Examples 2 and 3 also align with the reflection logic.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
