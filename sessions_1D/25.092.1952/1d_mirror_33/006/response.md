**General Assessment:**

The previous code execution failed on all training examples, consistently returning the original input grid instead of the transformed output. The simulation using `tool_code` confirmed that the core logic (finding the pivot, finding the object, calculating distance, determining the new position, and placing the object) is mathematically sound and produces the correct result for Example 1 when executed in isolation.

This discrepancy suggests the failure likely stemmed from an implementation issue within the `transform` function provided to the test harness, rather than a flaw in the underlying transformation logic derived from the examples. Potential causes include:
1.  Incorrect handling of the input grid format (e.g., expecting `[...]` vs. `[[...]]`).
2.  An incorrect early `return` statement (perhaps returning `input_grid` itself under some condition).
3.  A subtle interaction with list/numpy array types.
4.  An undetected exception causing the function to return prematurely or incorrectly.

The strategy moving forward is to trust the core reflection logic derived from the observations and simulation but to ensure the implementation is robust, specifically addressing input parsing and output formatting to match the expected ARC standard (typically `List[List[int]]`).

**Metrics:**

The `tool_code` simulation confirmed the following for Example 1:
*   Input: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   Grid Size: 24
*   Pivot Index (color 9): 10
*   Object (color 1): Start=1, End=6, Length=6
*   Position Relative to Pivot: Left
*   Separation Distance (white pixels): 3 (`pivot_index` - `object_end` - 1 = 10 - 6 - 1)
*   New Object Start Index: 14 (`pivot_index` + `distance` + 1 = 10 + 3 + 1)
*   New Object End Index (exclusive): 20 (`new_object_start` + `object_length` = 14 + 6)
*   Calculated Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected output)

Similar calculations for Examples 2 and 3 also align with the reflection logic.

background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: pivot

      - moves_relative_to_pivot
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The movable_block is located entirely to one side (left or right) of the pivot object in the input.
  - type: distance
    description: The number of background pixels (0) separating the movable_block from the pivot object is measured.
actions:
  - type: reflect
    target: movable_block
    reference: pivot_object
    details: |
      The movable_block is moved to the opposite side of the pivot object.
      The separation distance (number of background pixels between the block and the pivot) is preserved in the new position.
      The block's color and length remain unchanged.
output_grid_construction:
  - Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
  - Place the pivot pixel (9) at its original index.
  - Place the movable_block at its calculated reflected position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a list containing a single list of integers representing the grid row.
2.  Create a new list of the same size as the input row, initialized with the background color (white, 0). This will be the output row.
3.  Locate the index of the single pivot pixel (maroon, 9) in the input row.
4.  Place the pivot pixel (9) at this same index in the output row.
5.  Locate the contiguous block of non-background (0), non-pivot (9) pixels in the input row. Record its color, start index, and end index. Calculate its length.
6.  Determine if the block is to the left (`block_end_index < pivot_index`) or right (`block_start_index > pivot_index`) of the pivot.
7.  Calculate the separation distance: the number of background pixels (0) strictly between the block and the pivot.
    *   If left: `distance = pivot_index - block_end_index - 1`.
    *   If right: `distance = block_start_index - pivot_index - 1`.
8.  Calculate the starting index for the block in the output row:
    *   If the block was originally to the left, the new start index is `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
    *   If the block was originally to the right, the new start index is `pivot_index - distance - block_length`.
9.  Place the block (using its recorded color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new start index. Ensure the placement is within the grid bounds.
10. Return the completed output row, wrapped in a list to match the standard ARC format `[[...]]`.
