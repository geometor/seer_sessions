task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row in a 2D grid)
input_format: List containing a single list of integers (e.g., [[0, 1, 9, ...]])
output_format: List containing a single list of integers
objects:
  - type: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    shape: single_pixel
    properties:
      - fixed_position: true # Its index remains the same in the output
  - type: movable_line
    color: any non-zero, non-maroon color (1, 2, 5 in examples)
    count: 1
    shape: horizontal_line (contiguous block of same-colored pixels)
    properties:
      - variable_color
      - variable_length
      - moves_relative_to_pivot
background_color: 0 (white)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The movable_line object is located entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the pivot object in the input grid.
  - type: distance
    description: There is a gap of zero or more background (white) pixels between the movable_line object and the pivot object.
actions:
  - type: reflect
    target: movable_line_object
    reference: pivot_object
    details:
      - The movable_line object is moved to the opposite side of the pivot object.
      - The number of background (white) pixels separating the object from the pivot is preserved in the new location.
      - The pivot object itself does not move.
      - The color and length of the movable_line object remain unchanged.
