Use a.any() or a.all()\". This error typically arises in NumPy when an operation expecting a single boolean value (like in an `if` condition) receives an array of booleans.\n\nLooking at the code, the most likely source of this error is the initial input handling block:\n"

This conditional logic might interact unexpectedly with how the testing environment passes the `input_grid` or with NumPy's type/value handling, leading to the ambiguous truth value error somewhere down the line, even if not directly in this block.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Standardize Input Handling:** Modify the code to strictly expect the input as a list containing a single list (representing the row), i.e., `[[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]`. Extract this inner list directly. This removes the ambiguity and aligns with the ARC standard.\n2.  **Verify Core Logic:** Use `tool_code` to calculate the key parameters (pivot position, object details, distance, calculated new position) for each training example based on the reflection hypothesis. Compare these calculated values against the actual output grids to confirm the reflection logic is correct.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the standardized input handling and the confirmed reflection mechanism.\n\n## Gather Metrics\n\nLet's verify the core parameters and the reflection calculation for each example.\n"
