## General Assessment

The previous code failed on all training examples with the error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This error typically arises in NumPy when an operation expecting a single boolean value (like in an `if` condition) receives an array of booleans.

Looking at the code, the most likely source of this error is the initial input handling block:

```python
    if isinstance(input_grid[0], list): # Handle potential [[...]] format
         grid_1d = np.array(input_grid[0])
    else:
         grid_1d = np.array(input_grid) # Assume already flat list
```

This attempts to handle two possible input formats (`[[...]]` or `[...]`). However, the standard ARC format is a list of lists (2D array), even for a single row. This conditional logic might interact unexpectedly with how the testing environment passes the `input_grid` or with NumPy's type/value handling, leading to the ambiguous truth value error somewhere down the line, even if not directly in this block.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Standardize Input Handling:** Modify the code to strictly expect the input as a list containing a single list (representing the row), i.e., `[[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]`. Extract this inner list directly. This removes the ambiguity and aligns with the ARC standard.
2.  **Verify Core Logic:** Use `tool_code` to calculate the key parameters (pivot position, object details, distance, calculated new position) for each training example based on the reflection hypothesis. Compare these calculated values against the actual output grids to confirm the reflection logic is correct.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the standardized input handling and the confirmed reflection mechanism.

## Gather Metrics

```
The metrics confirm that the core logic for identifying the pivot, the object, the distance, and calculating the new reflected position is correct. The `calculated_new_start` and `calculated_new_end` match the `actual_output_start` and `actual_output_end` for all training examples. This reinforces the conclusion that the error stems from input handling or type conversion within the `transform` function, not the reflection algorithm itself.

    description: There is a gap of zero or more background (white) pixels between the movable_line object and the pivot object.
actions:
  - type: reflect
    target: movable_line_object

    details:
      - The movable_line object is moved to the opposite side of the pivot object.
      - The number of background (white) pixels separating the object from the pivot is preserved in the new location.
      - The pivot object itself does not move.
      - The color and length of the movable_line object remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, which is a list containing a single list representing the row (e.g., `input_grid = [[0, 1, 1, 9, 0]]`). Extract the inner list as the working grid row.
2.  Create an output row of the same size as the input row, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Locate the index (position) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input row. This is the `pivot_index`.
4.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at the `pivot_index` in the output row.
5.  Identify the contiguous block (horizontal line) of non-white (0) and non-maroon (9) pixels in the input row. Record its color (`object_color`), start index (`object_start`), end index (`object_end`), and calculate its length (`object_length = object_end - object_start + 1`).
6.  Determine if the object is to the left (`object_end < pivot_index`) or right (`object_start > pivot_index`) of the pivot.
7.  Calculate the distance (number of white pixels) between the object and the pivot:
    *   If the object is to the left, `distance = pivot_index - object_end - 1`.
    *   If the object is to the right, `distance = object_start - pivot_index - 1`.
    *   Ensure distance is non-negative (it can be 0 if adjacent).
8.  Calculate the `new_object_start` index for the object in the output row:
    *   If the object was originally to the left, the new start index is `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
    *   If the object was originally to the right, the new start index is `pivot_index - distance - object_length`.
9.  Place the object (using `object_color`) into the output row, starting at `new_object_start` and continuing for `object_length` pixels.
10. Return the output row wrapped in a list to match the standard ARC format (e.g., `[[output_row...]]`).
