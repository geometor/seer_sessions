task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single list/array)
input_format: list of integers
output_format: list of integers
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    shape: single_element
    properties:
      - fixed_position: true # Position in output is same as input
  - type: block # Changed from 'line' to be more general for 1D
    color: any non-zero, non-maroon color (1, 2, 5 in examples)
    count: 1
    shape: contiguous_block (1D segment)
    properties:
      - variable_color
      - variable_length
      - moves_relative_to_pivot
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The block object is located either entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the pivot element.
  - type: distance
    description: The number of background (0) elements separating the block object and the pivot element is constant between input and output.
actions:
  - type: reflect # More descriptive than move/reflect
    target: block_object
    reference: pivot_element
    details: The block object is moved to the opposite side of the pivot element, maintaining the original separation distance (number of background elements). The object's color and length remain unchanged.
constraints:
  - Input and output lists have the same length.
  - Exactly one pivot element (9) exists.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of non-zero, non-pivot color exists.
  - The block and pivot do not overlap.
