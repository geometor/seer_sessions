The dimensions remain constant.\n2.  **Colors:** The colors present are white (0), orange (7), and maroon (9). These colors are preserved in the output.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a horizontal block of three orange pixels (`7 7 7`) and a single maroon pixel (`9`), separated by a white pixel (`0`). The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.\n    *   **Output:** Also contains the same orange block (`7 7 7`) and the single maroon pixel (`9`), separated by a white pixel (`0`). The rest is white.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The maroon pixel (`9`) appears to be stationary; it's at index 5 in both the input and output.\n    *   The orange block (`7 7 7`) changes position. In the input, it is to the left of the maroon pixel (indices 1-3). In the output, it is to the right of the maroon pixel (indices 7-9).\n    *   The relative spacing seems important. In the input, there is one white pixel between the orange block and the maroon pixel (`...7 0 9...`). In the output, there is also one white pixel between the maroon pixel and the orange block (`...9 0 7...`).\n    *   The transformation appears to involve moving the orange block from one side of the maroon pixel to the other, maintaining the same separation distance (one white pixel).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the contiguous block of identical, non-white, non-pivot pixels (the movable object, orange `7 7 7` in this case). Note its shape, color, and position relative to the pivot pixel.\n3.  Count the number of background pixels (white, color 0) separating the movable object and the pivot pixel.\n4.  Determine which side of the pivot pixel the movable object is on (left or right).\n5.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n6.  Place the pivot pixel in the new grid at its original position.\n7.  Place the movable object in the new grid on the *opposite* side of the pivot pixel from its original position.\n8.  Ensure the number of background pixels separating the movable object and the pivot pixel in the new grid is identical to the separation distance counted in step 3."
