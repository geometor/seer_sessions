  output: [1, 14]
objects:
  - id: pivot_object
    color: 9 # maroon
    shape: 1x1 pixel
    attributes:
      - stationary: True
  - id: movable_object
    color: 7 # orange (can vary in other examples)
    shape: horizontal_block (1x3 in this example)
    attributes:

      - color_consistent: True
  - id: background
    color: 0 # white
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object_ids: [movable_object, pivot_object]
    initial_state: movable_object is left of pivot_object
    final_state: movable_object is right of pivot_object
  - type: separation_distance
    object_ids: [movable_object, pivot_object]
    value: 1 # number of background pixels between objects
    constraint: constant
actions:
  - action: move
    target_object_id: movable_object
    reference_object_id: pivot_object
    details: Moves the movable_object to the opposite side of the pivot_object while maintaining the separation distance.
