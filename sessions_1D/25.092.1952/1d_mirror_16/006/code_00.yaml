dimensionality: 1D # 1xN grid
objects:
  - type: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: central fixed point for transformation
  - type: movable_object
    color: variable (blue(1) or gray(5) in examples)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line segment
    location: initially to the left of the pivot
    property: might start at grid index 0 or later
  - type: left_gap
    color: white (0)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line segment (can be size 0)
    location: between movable_object and pivot in input
    property: size influences right_gap size
  - type: right_gap
    color: white (0)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line segment
    location: between pivot and movable_object in output
    property:
      size_rule: >
        if movable_object started at index 0 in input,
          right_gap_size = left_gap_size.
        else,
          right_gap_size = left_gap_size + 1.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills space not occupied by other objects or gaps

rule_summary: >
  The contiguous block of color to the left of the maroon pivot is moved to the right side.
  The maroon pivot's position remains fixed. The number of white pixels placed between
  the pivot and the block on the right side depends on the block's original starting position:
  if the block started at index 0, the gap size is preserved; otherwise, the gap size is increased by one.
  All other positions become white.
