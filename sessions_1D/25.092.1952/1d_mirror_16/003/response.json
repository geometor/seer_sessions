If the identified colored block started at \nindex 0 in the input array, the 'right gap' size equals the 'left gap' size. Otherwise (if the block \nstarted at index > 0, or if no block was found adjacent to the left gap), the 'right gap' size is \nthe 'left gap' size plus one.\n\nFinally, the identified colored block is placed in the output array, starting immediately after the \ncalculated 'right gap' (i.e., starting at index: pivot_index + 1 + right_gap_size). \nAll other positions in the output array remain white (0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_pivot(grid_np):\n  \"\"\"Finds the index of the pivot color (9).
