It finds the contiguous block \nof a single non-white, non-maroon color located to the left of the pivot, possibly \nseparated by a gap of white pixels (0). The size of this 'left gap' is measured.\n\nAn output grid of the same size is created, filled with white (0). The pivot (9) is \nplaced at its original index. \n\nA 'right gap' size is calculated: if the identified colored block started at index 0 \nin the input, the 'right gap' size equals the 'left gap' size. Otherwise (if the block \nstarted after index 0, or if no block was found), the 'right gap' size is the \n'left gap' size plus one.\n\nFinally, the identified colored block (if found) is placed in the output grid, starting \nimmediately after this calculated 'right gap' (i.e., starting at index: \npivot_index + 1 + right_gap_size).
