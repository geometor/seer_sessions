Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input and output are represented as 1D arrays (or single rows) of colored pixels.
*   Each input contains a single maroon pixel (9), which seems to act as a central point or pivot.
*   To the left of the maroon pixel, there is a contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels (the "object"), possibly separated from the maroon pixel by one or more white pixels (0).
*   The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).
*   In the output, the maroon pixel remains in the same position relative to the start of the array.
*   The "object" (the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels) is moved to the right side of the maroon pixel.
*   The number of white pixels separating the object from the maroon pixel is preserved during the move. If there were `N` white pixels between the object and the maroon pixel in the input (on the left side), there will be `N` white pixels between the maroon pixel and the object in the output (on the right side).
*   All pixels in the output that are not part of the maroon pixel or the moved object (including the gap) are white (0).

**YAML Facts:**

rule_summary: The contiguous block of color to the left of the maroon pixel is moved to the right of the maroon pixel, preserving the number of white spaces originally between them. The maroon pixel's position remains fixed relative to the grid boundaries. All other positions become white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the position (index) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at `pivot_index` in the output grid.
4.  Scan leftwards from `pivot_index - 1` in the input grid. Count the number of consecutive white pixels (0) until a non-white pixel is encountered or the start of the grid is reached. Store this count as `gap_size`.
5.  Identify the sequence of pixels forming the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon color found immediately to the left of the gap (or immediately left of the pivot if `gap_size` is 0). Store this sequence as `movable_object`.
6.  In the output grid, place the `movable_object` sequence starting at the index `pivot_index + 1 + gap_size`. Ensure the white pixels representing the gap (of size `gap_size`) correctly occupy the indices from `pivot_index + 1` up to, but not including, the start of the `movable_object`.

The transformation moves this colored block to the right side of the pivot, preserving the size of the gap (number of white pixels) between the pivot and the block.

"""
Transforms a 1D numpy array based on a pivot and object mirroring rule with a conditional gap.

The transformation identifies a single maroon pixel (9) which acts as a pivot. 
It then finds the contiguous block of a single non-white, non-maroon color located immediately to the left 
of a potential gap of white pixels (0), which itself is immediately to the left of the pivot.
The size of this 'left gap' (number of white pixels between the object/start and the pivot) is measured.

An output array of the same size is created, initially filled with white pixels (0).
The pivot (9) is placed in the output array at its original index.

The transformation then calculates a 'right gap' size. If the identified colored block started at 
index 0 in the input array, the 'right gap' size equals the 'left gap' size. Otherwise (if the block 
started at index > 0, or if no block was found adjacent to the left gap), the 'right gap' size is 
the 'left gap' size plus one.

Finally, the identified colored block is placed in the output array, starting immediately after the 
calculated 'right gap' (i.e., starting at index: pivot_index + 1 + right_gap_size). 
All other positions in the output array remain white (0).

**Assessment:**

The previous code execution resulted in highly incorrect outputs (`[9]`) for all training examples, indicating a fundamental flaw in the implementation rather than just a misunderstanding of the core transformation logic. The outputs did not match the expected size or content, suggesting issues with array initialization, element placement, or the return value of the `transform` function.

However, the detailed re-analysis of the input-output pairs reveals a subtle but crucial detail missed or incorrectly implemented previously: the size of the gap (white space) inserted to the *right* of the pivot in the output depends on whether the original colored block started at the very beginning (index 0) of the input array.

*   If the colored block starts at index 0 (Examples 1 & 2), the gap size to the right of the pivot in the output is the *same* as the gap size found to the left of the pivot in the input.
*   If the colored block starts *after* index 0 (Example 3, starting at index 1), the gap size to the right of the pivot in the output is *one greater* than the gap size found to the left of the pivot in the input.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation to correctly capture this conditional gap logic. The core steps (find pivot, find object left, measure left gap, place pivot, place object right) remain, but the calculation of the *right* gap size needs adjustment based on the object's starting position.

  The contiguous block of color to the left of the maroon pivot is moved to the right side.
  The maroon pivot's position remains fixed. The number of white pixels placed between
  the pivot and the block on the right side depends on the block's original starting position:
  if the block started at index 0, the gap size is preserved; otherwise, the gap size is increased by one.
  All other positions become white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filling it with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the index of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at `pivot_index` in the output grid.
4.  Scan leftwards from `pivot_index - 1` in the input grid to identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (`movable_object`) and the sequence of white pixels between this block and the pivot (`left_gap`). Record the pixels of the `movable_object`, its starting index (`object_start_index`), and the number of pixels in the `left_gap` (`left_gap_size`). If no `movable_object` is found, proceed as if `object_start_index` is -1 and `movable_object` is empty.
5.  Determine the size of the gap to place on the right side (`right_gap_size`):
    *   If a `movable_object` was found AND `object_start_index` is 0, then set `right_gap_size = left_gap_size`.
    *   Otherwise (if no object was found, or if `object_start_index > 0`), set `right_gap_size = left_gap_size + 1`.
6.  Calculate the starting index for the `movable_object` in the output grid: `output_object_start_index = pivot_index + 1 + right_gap_size`.
7.  Place the pixels of the `movable_object` into the output grid, starting at `output_object_start_index`, ensuring placement stays within the grid boundaries. (The white pixels for the `right_gap` are implicitly handled because the output grid was initialized to white).
