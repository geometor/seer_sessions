Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input and output are represented as 1D arrays (or single rows) of colored pixels.
*   Each input contains a single maroon pixel (9), which seems to act as a central point or pivot.
*   To the left of the maroon pixel, there is a contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels (the "object"), possibly separated from the maroon pixel by one or more white pixels (0).
*   The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).
*   In the output, the maroon pixel remains in the same position relative to the start of the array.
*   The "object" (the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels) is moved to the right side of the maroon pixel.
*   The number of white pixels separating the object from the maroon pixel is preserved during the move. If there were `N` white pixels between the object and the maroon pixel in the input (on the left side), there will be `N` white pixels between the maroon pixel and the object in the output (on the right side).
*   All pixels in the output that are not part of the maroon pixel or the moved object (including the gap) are white (0).

**YAML Facts:**

  - type: movable_object
    color: variable (blue(1) or gray(5) in examples)

rule_summary: The contiguous block of color to the left of the maroon pixel is moved to the right of the maroon pixel, preserving the number of white spaces originally between them. The maroon pixel's position remains fixed relative to the grid boundaries. All other positions become white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the position (index) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at `pivot_index` in the output grid.
4.  Scan leftwards from `pivot_index - 1` in the input grid. Count the number of consecutive white pixels (0) until a non-white pixel is encountered or the start of the grid is reached. Store this count as `gap_size`.
5.  Identify the sequence of pixels forming the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon color found immediately to the left of the gap (or immediately left of the pivot if `gap_size` is 0). Store this sequence as `movable_object`.
6.  In the output grid, place the `movable_object` sequence starting at the index `pivot_index + 1 + gap_size`. Ensure the white pixels representing the gap (of size `gap_size`) correctly occupy the indices from `pivot_index + 1` up to, but not including, the start of the `movable_object`.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt failed drastically, producing only the pivot element (`[9]`) instead of the fully transformed array for all examples. This suggests a fundamental error in either the array manipulation (initialization, element placement) or the final return statement within the `transform` function, rather than a subtle logical error in identifying the object or gap. The conditional gap logic identified (`right_gap = left_gap` if object starts at index 0, else `right_gap = left_gap + 1`) appears correct based on re-examining the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Core Functionality:** Use code execution to test the provided `transform` function directly with the example inputs to confirm if the error is within the function itself or potentially in the testing environment previously used.
2.  **Analyze Execution:** If the function works correctly in the tool execution, the issue might have been external. If it still fails, pinpoint the exact step causing the incorrect output (e.g., object placement loop, array slicing, final conversion).
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the conditional gap rule identified.

**Metrics Gathering:**

**Analysis of Execution Results:**

The code execution shows that the `transform` function, as provided in the second code block of the prompt, correctly processes all three training examples. The conditional gap logic (`right_gap_size = left_gap_size if starts_with_object else left_gap_size + 1`) is implemented and functions as expected based on the examples.

This indicates the previous reported failure (outputting only `[9]`) was likely due to an issue outside the function's code itself, possibly in the testing harness or environment used for the initial evaluation. The core logic appears sound.

**YAML Facts:**

  - single contiguous object: block of non-white, non-maroon color

  - background: white (0) pixels fill the rest
output_features:
  - grid size: same as input
  - pivot pixel: maroon (9), same position as input
  - object: same pixels as input object
  - object location: right of the pivot
  - right gap: zero or more white (0) pixels between the pivot and the object

rule_summary: Identify the maroon pivot (9). Find the contiguous colored block and the white gap to its left. Create a new grid. Place the pivot at its original position. Calculate the right gap size: if the block started at index 0, the right gap equals the left gap; otherwise, the right gap is the left gap plus one. Place the colored block to the right of the pivot, separated by this calculated right gap. Fill remaining space with white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the size (length) of the input grid. Create an output grid of the same size, initially filled with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the index of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at `pivot_index` in the output grid.
4.  Scan leftwards from `pivot_index - 1` in the input grid to find the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (`the_block`) and measure the number of white pixels between `the_block` and the pivot (`left_gap_size`). Record the starting index of `the_block` (`block_start_index`). If no such block exists, proceed as if `the_block` is empty and `block_start_index` is invalid (-1).
5.  Calculate the size of the gap to be placed on the right side of the pivot (`right_gap_size`):
    *   If `the_block` was found and its `block_start_index` is 0, then set `right_gap_size` equal to `left_gap_size`.
    *   Otherwise (if `the_block` was not found, or if `block_start_index` is greater than 0), set `right_gap_size` equal to `left_gap_size + 1`.
6.  If `the_block` was found:
    *   Calculate the starting index for placing `the_block` in the output grid: `output_block_start_index = pivot_index + 1 + right_gap_size`.
    *   Place the pixels of `the_block` into the output grid, starting at `output_block_start_index`, checking to ensure placement stays within the grid boundaries.
7.  The output grid, now containing the pivot, the calculated right gap (implicitly as white pixels), the moved block (if found), and white background pixels, is the result.
