Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input and output are represented as 1D arrays (or single rows) of colored pixels.
*   Each input contains a single maroon pixel (9), which seems to act as a central point or pivot.
*   To the left of the maroon pixel, there is a contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels (the "object"), possibly separated from the maroon pixel by one or more white pixels (0).
*   The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).
*   In the output, the maroon pixel remains in the same position relative to the start of the array.
*   The "object" (the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels) is moved to the right side of the maroon pixel.
*   The number of white pixels separating the object from the maroon pixel is preserved during the move. If there were `N` white pixels between the object and the maroon pixel in the input (on the left side), there will be `N` white pixels between the maroon pixel and the object in the output (on the right side).
*   All pixels in the output that are not part of the maroon pixel or the moved object (including the gap) are white (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # or 1xN grid
objects:
  - type: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: acts as a center for rearrangement
  - type: movable_object
    color: variable (blue(1) or gray(5) in examples)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line segment
    location: initially to the left of the pivot
    relationship_to_pivot: separated by a gap of zero or more white pixels
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills space not occupied by other objects
  - type: gap
    color: white (0)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line segment
    location: between movable_object and pivot in input; between pivot and movable_object in output
    property: preserves its length during transformation
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot (maroon pixel)
    result: pivot_index
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous non-white block left of pivot (movable_object)
    result: object_pixels, object_start_index, object_length
  - action: measure
    target: space between object_end_index and pivot_index
    result: gap_size (count of white pixels)
  - action: construct_output
    size: same as input
    initial_fill: white (0)
  - action: place
    target: pivot (maroon pixel)
    location: pivot_index in output
  - action: place
    target: gap (white pixels)
    location: starting at pivot_index + 1 in output
    count: gap_size
  - action: place
    target: movable_object (object_pixels)
    location: starting at pivot_index + 1 + gap_size in output
rule_summary: The contiguous block of color to the left of the maroon pixel is moved to the right of the maroon pixel, preserving the number of white spaces originally between them. The maroon pixel's position remains fixed relative to the grid boundaries. All other positions become white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the position (index) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at `pivot_index` in the output grid.
4.  Scan leftwards from `pivot_index - 1` in the input grid. Count the number of consecutive white pixels (0) until a non-white pixel is encountered or the start of the grid is reached. Store this count as `gap_size`.
5.  Identify the sequence of pixels forming the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon color found immediately to the left of the gap (or immediately left of the pivot if `gap_size` is 0). Store this sequence as `movable_object`.
6.  In the output grid, place the `movable_object` sequence starting at the index `pivot_index + 1 + gap_size`. Ensure the white pixels representing the gap (of size `gap_size`) correctly occupy the indices from `pivot_index + 1` up to, but not including, the start of the `movable_object`.
```python
import numpy as np # Although not strictly necessary for 1D lists, it's common in ARC tasks

"""
The transformation identifies a single maroon pixel (9) which acts as a pivot. 
It then finds the contiguous block of a single non-white, non-maroon color located to the left of the pivot. 
This block might be separated from the pivot by a gap of one or more white pixels (0).
The transformation moves this colored block to the right side of the pivot, preserving the size of the gap (number of white pixels) between the pivot and the block. 
The pivot itself remains in its original position relative to the grid boundaries. 
All other positions in the output grid are filled with white (0).
