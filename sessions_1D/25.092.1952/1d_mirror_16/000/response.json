If there were `N` white pixels between the object and the maroon pixel in the input (on the left side), there will be `N` white pixels between the maroon pixel and the object in the output (on the right side).\n*   All pixels in the output that are not part of the maroon pixel or the moved object (including the gap) are white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
