task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # or 1xN grid
objects:
  - type: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: acts as a center for rearrangement
  - type: movable_object
    color: variable (blue(1) or gray(5) in examples)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line segment
    location: initially to the left of the pivot
    relationship_to_pivot: separated by a gap of zero or more white pixels
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills space not occupied by other objects
  - type: gap
    color: white (0)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line segment
    location: between movable_object and pivot in input; between pivot and movable_object in output
    property: preserves its length during transformation
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot (maroon pixel)
    result: pivot_index
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous non-white block left of pivot (movable_object)
    result: object_pixels, object_start_index, object_length
  - action: measure
    target: space between object_end_index and pivot_index
    result: gap_size (count of white pixels)
  - action: construct_output
    size: same as input
    initial_fill: white (0)
  - action: place
    target: pivot (maroon pixel)
    location: pivot_index in output
  - action: place
    target: gap (white pixels)
    location: starting at pivot_index + 1 in output
    count: gap_size
  - action: place
    target: movable_object (object_pixels)
    location: starting at pivot_index + 1 + gap_size in output
rule_summary: The contiguous block of color to the left of the maroon pixel is moved to the right of the maroon pixel, preserving the number of white spaces originally between them. The maroon pixel's position remains fixed relative to the grid boundaries. All other positions become white.
