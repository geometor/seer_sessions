Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels represented by integer color codes.
*   **Key Colors:** White (0) serves as the background. Maroon (9) appears as a single, static pixel. Another color (gray (5) in train\_1, green (3) in train\_2 and train\_3) forms a contiguous block.
*   **Objects:**
    *   A single maroon (9) pixel (the "pivot").
    *   A contiguous block of a single color other than white or maroon (the "colored block").
    *   White (0) pixels acting as background/spacing.
*   **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves changing the position of the "colored block" relative to the "pivot" pixel. The block moves from one side of the pivot to the other.
*   **Invariants:**
    *   The grid dimensions remain the same (1x19 in the examples).
    *   The maroon (9) pivot pixel itself doesn't change color or position relative to the grid *boundaries* during the swap logic, but its position relative to the *colored block* flips.
    *   The colored block retains its color and length.
    *   The number of white pixels directly *between* the colored block and the pivot pixel is preserved during the move.

**YAML Fact Document:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Components:** Scan the input row to find the single maroon (9) pixel (the "pivot") and the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9) (the "colored block").
2.  **Identify Spacing:** Determine the sequence of white (0) pixels located directly between the pivot and the colored block (the "spacing pixels"). Note their count.
3.  **Determine Relative Position:** Check if the colored block is currently positioned to the left or the right of the pivot pixel.
4.  **Calculate New Position:** Prepare to place the colored block on the *opposite* side of the pivot compared to its input position.
5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new row of the same length, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
    *   Place the pivot pixel at its original index.
    *   If the colored block was originally to the left:
        *   Place the spacing pixels immediately to the right of the pivot.
        *   Place the colored block immediately to the right of the spacing pixels.
    *   If the colored block was originally to the right:
        *   Place the spacing pixels immediately to the left of the pivot.
        *   Place the colored block immediately to the left of the spacing pixels.
    *   Ensure all other pixels in the output row remain white (0).

## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed, producing empty outputs for all training examples. The provided Python code includes logic for identifying a pivot pixel (maroon 9), a colored block (contiguous non-white, non-maroon pixels), and the spacing (white 0 pixels) between them. The intended transformation is to move the colored block and the spacing pixels to the opposite side of the pivot.

The empty output (`[]`) reported in the results is unexpected given the explicit return statements in the provided code (`[[]]`, `input_grid`, `[output_row]`). This discrepancy suggests a potential issue outside the core logic, possibly:
1.  An uncaught runtime error within the Python function (e.g., index out of bounds during slicing/placement).
2.  An issue with how the testing environment calls the function or interprets its output/errors.
3.  A subtle flaw in the identification or placement logic that wasn't apparent initially.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Verify Core Logic:** Re-confirm the transformation rule by meticulously analyzing the input/output pairs.
2.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** Use code execution to extract precise indices, lengths, and contents of the pivot, block, and spacing for each example to ensure the pattern holds and identify potential edge cases (like zero spacing).
3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML fact document and the natural language program to incorporate these precise details and ensure clarity, focusing on the exact sequence of operations needed for reconstruction. Assume the core concept (swapping sides around the pivot) is correct but refine the implementation details.

**Summary of Metrics:**
- **Grid Size:** Consistently 1x19 for both input and output.
- **Pivot:** Always present (color 9), index varies, remains unchanged between input and output.
- **Colored Block:** Always a single contiguous block of non-0, non-9 color. Length and color remain unchanged. Moves from one side of the pivot to the other.
- **Spacing:** Always present between block and pivot, consists only of white (0) pixels. The *content* and *length* of the spacing sequence remain unchanged, but it moves with the block to the opposite side of the pivot. Example 3 shows spacing can be of length 1.
- **Transformation:** The pivot stays fixed. The unit composed of `[colored_block, spacing_pixels]` (if block is left) or `[spacing_pixels, colored_block]` (if block is right) effectively "jumps" over the pivot to the other side, maintaining the internal order of block and spacing.

    properties:
      - content: variable # Specific sequence of white pixels
      - length: variable (e.g., 2 in ex1/ex2, 1 in ex3)
      - content_invariant: true # Sequence of white pixels does not change
      - length_invariant: true # Length does not change
    role: maintains separation distance between block and pivot

relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: The colored_block and pivot are separated only by the spacing_sequence. Either block-spacing-pivot or pivot-spacing-block.
  - type: relative_position
    object1: colored_block
    object2: pivot
    state: [left_of, right_of] # Determined by block indices relative to pivot index

actions:
  - action: identify_pivot
    target: pixel with color 9
    result: pivot_index
  - action: identify_colored_block
    target: contiguous sequence of non-zero, non-nine pixels
    result: block_content, block_start_index, block_end_index
  - action: identify_spacing_sequence
    target: sequence of zero pixels between block_end_index and pivot_index (if block is left), or between pivot_index and block_start_index (if block is right)
    result: spacing_content, spacing_length
  - action: determine_relative_position
    input: block_end_index, pivot_index
    result: is_left (boolean)
  - action: construct_output_grid
    details:
      1. Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with background_color (0).
      2. Place the pivot pixel (9) at its original pivot_index.
      3. If the block was originally 'is_left':
         - Place spacing_content immediately to the right of the pivot (index pivot_index + 1).
         - Place block_content immediately to the right of the spacing.
      4. If the block was originally not 'is_left' (i.e., right):
         - Place spacing_content immediately to the left of the pivot (ending at index pivot_index - 1).
         - Place block_content immediately to the left of the spacing.
      5. Ensure all other grid cells remain background_color (0).

constraints:
  - Only one pivot (9) exists.
  - Only one contiguous colored block (non-0, non-9) exists.
  - Pixels between the block and pivot must be background color (0).
  - The combined length of the block, spacing, and pivot must fit within the grid boundaries when moved to the opposite side.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a new output row with the same length as the input row, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  **Locate Pivot:** Find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input row. Let this be `pivot_index`. Place the maroon (9) pixel at `pivot_index` in the output row.
3.  **Locate Colored Block:** Find the contiguous sequence of pixels in the input row that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its content (the sequence of pixel values), its start index `block_start`, and its end index `block_end`.
4.  **Determine Input Side:** Compare `block_end` with `pivot_index`.
    *   If `block_end < pivot_index`, the block is on the left side.
    *   If `block_start > pivot_index`, the block is on the right side.
5.  **Extract Spacing:**
    *   If the block is on the left, extract the sequence of pixels from the input row between `block_end + 1` and `pivot_index - 1` (inclusive). This is the `spacing_sequence`.
    *   If the block is on the right, extract the sequence of pixels from the input row between `pivot_index + 1` and `block_start - 1` (inclusive). This is the `spacing_sequence`.
6.  **Place Components in Output:**
    *   **If the block was on the left in the input:**
        *   Calculate the start index for the spacing in the output: `output_spacing_start = pivot_index + 1`.
        *   Place the `spacing_sequence` into the output row starting at `output_spacing_start`.
        *   Calculate the start index for the block in the output: `output_block_start = output_spacing_start + length(spacing_sequence)`.
        *   Place the recorded `block_content` into the output row starting at `output_block_start`.
    *   **If the block was on the right in the input:**
        *   Calculate the start index for the block in the output: `output_block_start = pivot_index - length(spacing_sequence) - length(block_content)`.
        *   Place the recorded `block_content` into the output row starting at `output_block_start`.
        *   Calculate the start index for the spacing in the output: `output_spacing_start = output_block_start + length(block_content)`.
        *   Place the `spacing_sequence` into the output row starting at `output_spacing_start`.
7.  **Finalize:** The output row now contains the background, the pivot in its original position, and the spacing sequence and colored block relocated to the opposite side of the pivot while preserving their content and order relative to each other. Return this output row.
