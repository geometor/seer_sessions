## General Assessment

The previous code execution resulted in failure for all training examples, producing empty output grids `[[]]` instead of the expected transformations. Manual tracing of the algorithm's logic using the provided training examples, however, indicates that the core transformation steps (identifying pivot, block, spacing, and repositioning to the opposite side while preserving spacing) are conceptually correct and *should* produce the expected outputs for these specific cases.

The discrepancy suggests potential issues:
1.  **Execution Environment/Input Handling:** The testing framework might be passing the input in an unexpected format, causing the initial validation `if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or len(input_grid) != 1 or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):` to fail, leading to the `[[]]` return. Alternatively, an uncaught exception during execution might be caught by the harness, resulting in an empty output report.
2.  **Subtle Bug/Edge Case:** Although the core logic seems sound for the examples, there might be a subtle off-by-one error in indexing or slicing, or an unhandled edge case (e.g., block or spacing hitting the grid boundaries after the move) that wasn't triggered in the manual trace but causes failure in actual execution. The code includes bounds checks that return `input_grid`, but the test reported `[[]]`, which is confusing and might point to an uncaught exception or a specific behavior of the test harness.

**Strategy:**
Assume the core logic (find pivot, find block, find spacing, flip side) is correct. Re-verify the implementation details, especially list indexing and slicing for placement. Ensure robust handling of potential errors (e.g., missing components, out-of-bounds placement) by returning the original input grid, as designed in the previous code, rather than crashing or returning `[[]]`. Refine the documentation (YAML, NL Program) to clearly reflect this logic. Since the manual trace was successful, the existing NL program and YAML facts are likely accurate representations of the intended transformation for the given examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  **Find Pivot:** Locate the index of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input row. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  **Place Pivot:** Set the pixel at `pivot_index` in the output row to maroon (9).
4.  **Find Colored Block:** Scan the input row to find the contiguous sequence of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its starting index (`block_start`), ending index (`block_end`), and its content (the list of pixel values, `block_content`).
5.  **Find Spacing:** Identify the sequence of pixels in the input row located strictly between the colored block and the pivot.
    *   If the block is to the left (`block_end < pivot_index`), the spacing is the content from index `block_end + 1` up to (but not including) `pivot_index`.
    *   If the block is to the right (`block_start > pivot_index`), the spacing is the content from index `pivot_index + 1` up to (but not including) `block_start`.
    Record this sequence as `spacing_content`. (Note: `spacing_content` will consist only of white (0) pixels and may be empty if the block is adjacent to the pivot).
6.  **Determine Placement Side:** Check if the colored block was to the left (`block_end < pivot_index`) or right (`block_start > pivot_index`) of the pivot in the input row.
7.  **Place Block and Spacing in Output:**
    *   **If the block was LEFT in the input:** Calculate the starting index for the spacing in the output row as `pivot_index + 1`. Calculate the starting index for the block in the output row as `pivot_index + 1 + length(spacing_content)`. Place the `spacing_content` and then the `block_content` into the output row at these calculated starting indices.
    *   **If the block was RIGHT in the input:** Calculate the starting index for the block in the output row as `pivot_index - length(spacing_content) - length(block_content)`. Calculate the starting index for the spacing in the output row as `pivot_index - length(spacing_content)`. Place the `block_content` and then the `spacing_content` into the output row at these calculated starting indices.
8.  **Finalize:** The output row, now containing the background, the repositioned block, the preserved spacing, and the pivot, is the final result. Ensure that the placement calculation does not result in indices outside the valid range of the row; if it would, the transformation might be considered impossible (handle as an error, potentially by returning the original input).
