task_description: Relocates a contiguous colored block and its adjacent spacing pixels to the opposite side of a fixed pivot pixel within a 1D grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  size_invariant: true # Size remains constant (1x19 in examples)
  background_color: 0 # white

objects:
  - object: pivot
    color: 9 # maroon
    shape: single pixel
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - index: variable # Position within the grid
      - invariant: true # Position and color do not change during transformation
    role: static reference point

  - object: colored_block
    color: non-zero, non-nine # e.g., gray (5), green (3)
    shape: contiguous horizontal block
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - content: variable # Specific sequence of pixel colors
      - length: variable
      - color: variable # The single color making up the block
      - content_invariant: true # Content does not change
      - length_invariant: true # Length does not change
      - color_invariant: true # Color does not change
    role: primary element to be moved

  - object: spacing_sequence
    color: 0 # white
    shape: contiguous horizontal block (can be empty or length >= 1)
    location: directly between the colored_block and the pivot
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - content: variable # Specific sequence of white pixels
      - length: variable (e.g., 2 in ex1/ex2, 1 in ex3)
      - content_invariant: true # Sequence of white pixels does not change
      - length_invariant: true # Length does not change
    role: maintains separation distance between block and pivot

relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: The colored_block and pivot are separated only by the spacing_sequence. Either block-spacing-pivot or pivot-spacing-block.
  - type: relative_position
    object1: colored_block
    object2: pivot
    state: [left_of, right_of] # Determined by block indices relative to pivot index

actions:
  - action: identify_pivot
    target: pixel with color 9
    result: pivot_index
  - action: identify_colored_block
    target: contiguous sequence of non-zero, non-nine pixels
    result: block_content, block_start_index, block_end_index
  - action: identify_spacing_sequence
    target: sequence of zero pixels between block_end_index and pivot_index (if block is left), or between pivot_index and block_start_index (if block is right)
    result: spacing_content, spacing_length
  - action: determine_relative_position
    input: block_end_index, pivot_index
    result: is_left (boolean)
  - action: construct_output_grid
    details:
      1. Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with background_color (0).
      2. Place the pivot pixel (9) at its original pivot_index.
      3. If the block was originally 'is_left':
         - Place spacing_content immediately to the right of the pivot (index pivot_index + 1).
         - Place block_content immediately to the right of the spacing.
      4. If the block was originally not 'is_left' (i.e., right):
         - Place spacing_content immediately to the left of the pivot (ending at index pivot_index - 1).
         - Place block_content immediately to the left of the spacing.
      5. Ensure all other grid cells remain background_color (0).

constraints:
  - Only one pivot (9) exists.
  - Only one contiguous colored block (non-0, non-9) exists.
  - Pixels between the block and pivot must be background color (0).
  - The combined length of the block, spacing, and pivot must fit within the grid boundaries when moved to the opposite side.
