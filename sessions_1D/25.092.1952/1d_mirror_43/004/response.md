## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed, producing empty outputs for all training examples. The provided Python code includes logic for identifying a pivot pixel (maroon 9), a colored block (contiguous non-white, non-maroon pixels), and the spacing (white 0 pixels) between them. The intended transformation is to move the colored block and the spacing pixels to the opposite side of the pivot.

The empty output (`[]`) reported in the results is unexpected given the explicit return statements in the provided code (`[[]]`, `input_grid`, `[output_row]`). This discrepancy suggests a potential issue outside the core logic, possibly:
1.  An uncaught runtime error within the Python function (e.g., index out of bounds during slicing/placement).
2.  An issue with how the testing environment calls the function or interprets its output/errors.
3.  A subtle flaw in the identification or placement logic that wasn't apparent initially.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Verify Core Logic:** Re-confirm the transformation rule by meticulously analyzing the input/output pairs.
2.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** Use code execution to extract precise indices, lengths, and contents of the pivot, block, and spacing for each example to ensure the pattern holds and identify potential edge cases (like zero spacing).
3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML fact document and the natural language program to incorporate these precise details and ensure clarity, focusing on the exact sequence of operations needed for reconstruction. Assume the core concept (swapping sides around the pivot) is correct but refine the implementation details.

**Summary of Metrics:**
- **Grid Size:** Consistently 1x19 for both input and output.
- **Pivot:** Always present (color 9), index varies, remains unchanged between input and output.
- **Colored Block:** Always a single contiguous block of non-0, non-9 color. Length and color remain unchanged. Moves from one side of the pivot to the other.
- **Spacing:** Always present between block and pivot, consists only of white (0) pixels. The *content* and *length* of the spacing sequence remain unchanged, but it moves with the block to the opposite side of the pivot. Example 3 shows spacing can be of length 1.
- **Transformation:** The pivot stays fixed. The unit composed of `[colored_block, spacing_pixels]` (if block is left) or `[spacing_pixels, colored_block]` (if block is right) effectively "jumps" over the pivot to the other side, maintaining the internal order of block and spacing.

  - action: construct_output_grid
    details:
      1. Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with background_color (0).
      2. Place the pivot pixel (9) at its original pivot_index.
      3. If the block was originally 'is_left':
         - Place spacing_content immediately to the right of the pivot (index pivot_index + 1).
         - Place block_content immediately to the right of the spacing.
      4. If the block was originally not 'is_left' (i.e., right):
         - Place spacing_content immediately to the left of the pivot (ending at index pivot_index - 1).
         - Place block_content immediately to the left of the spacing.
      5. Ensure all other grid cells remain background_color (0).

constraints:
  - Only one pivot (9) exists.
  - Only one contiguous colored block (non-0, non-9) exists.
  - Pixels between the block and pivot must be background color (0).
  - The combined length of the block, spacing, and pivot must fit within the grid boundaries when moved to the opposite side.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a new output row with the same length as the input row, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  **Locate Pivot:** Find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input row. Let this be `pivot_index`. Place the maroon (9) pixel at `pivot_index` in the output row.
3.  **Locate Colored Block:** Find the contiguous sequence of pixels in the input row that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its content (the sequence of pixel values), its start index `block_start`, and its end index `block_end`.
4.  **Determine Input Side:** Compare `block_end` with `pivot_index`.
    *   If `block_end < pivot_index`, the block is on the left side.
    *   If `block_start > pivot_index`, the block is on the right side.
5.  **Extract Spacing:**
    *   If the block is on the left, extract the sequence of pixels from the input row between `block_end + 1` and `pivot_index - 1` (inclusive). This is the `spacing_sequence`.
    *   If the block is on the right, extract the sequence of pixels from the input row between `pivot_index + 1` and `block_start - 1` (inclusive). This is the `spacing_sequence`.
6.  **Place Components in Output:**
    *   **If the block was on the left in the input:**
        *   Calculate the start index for the spacing in the output: `output_spacing_start = pivot_index + 1`.
        *   Place the `spacing_sequence` into the output row starting at `output_spacing_start`.
        *   Calculate the start index for the block in the output: `output_block_start = output_spacing_start + length(spacing_sequence)`.
        *   Place the recorded `block_content` into the output row starting at `output_block_start`.
    *   **If the block was on the right in the input:**
        *   Calculate the start index for the block in the output: `output_block_start = pivot_index - length(spacing_sequence) - length(block_content)`.
        *   Place the recorded `block_content` into the output row starting at `output_block_start`.
        *   Calculate the start index for the spacing in the output: `output_spacing_start = output_block_start + length(block_content)`.
        *   Place the `spacing_sequence` into the output row starting at `output_spacing_start`.
7.  **Finalize:** The output row now contains the background, the pivot in its original position, and the spacing sequence and colored block relocated to the opposite side of the pivot while preserving their content and order relative to each other. Return this output row.
