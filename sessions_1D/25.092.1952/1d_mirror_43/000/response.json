Maroon (9) appears as a single, static pixel. Another color (gray (5) in train\\_1, green (3) in train\\_2 and train\\_3) forms a contiguous block.\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   A single maroon (9) pixel (the \"pivot\").\n    *   A contiguous block of a single color other than white or maroon (the \"colored block\").\n    *   White (0) pixels acting as background/spacing.\n*   **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves changing the position of the \"colored block\" relative to the \"pivot\" pixel. The block moves from one side of the pivot to the other.\n*   **Invariants:**\n    *   The grid dimensions remain the same (1x19 in the examples).\n    *   The maroon (9) pivot pixel itself doesn't change color or position relative to the grid *boundaries* during the swap logic, but its position relative to the *colored block* flips.\n    *   The colored block retains its color and length.\n    *   The number of white pixels directly *between* the colored block and the pivot pixel is preserved during the move.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
