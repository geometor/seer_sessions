task_description: Repositioning a colored block relative to a fixed pivot pixel in a 1D grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: 0 (white)

objects:
  - object: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    shape: single pixel
    quantity: 1
    role: static reference point for repositioning
  - object: colored_block
    color: non-white (0), non-maroon (9) # e.g., gray (5), green (3)
    shape: contiguous horizontal block
    quantity: 1
    role: element to be moved
  - object: spacing_pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    location: directly between the pivot and the colored_block
    role: maintains distance during repositioning
  - object: background_pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    location: fills the rest of the grid
    role: background filler

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: colored_block
    object2: pivot
    states: [left_of, right_of] # Input state determines the output state
  - type: adjacency
    object1: colored_block
    object2: spacing_pixels
    object3: pivot
    description: The colored_block and pivot are separated by the spacing_pixels.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot pixel (color 9)
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block (contiguous non-white, non-maroon pixels)
  - action: identify
    target: spacing_pixels (white pixels between pivot and colored_block)
  - action: determine
    property: relative position (is colored_block left or right of pivot?)
  - action: move
    target: colored_block
    details: Relocate the colored_block to the opposite side of the pivot.
  - action: preserve
    target: spacing_pixels
    details: Maintain the same sequence/count of spacing_pixels between the pivot and the repositioned colored_block.
  - action: reconstruct
    target: output grid
    details: Assemble the grid with the pivot, spacing_pixels, and moved colored_block in their new configuration, filling remaining space with background_pixels.

constraints:
  - The grid size remains constant.
  - The color and size of the colored_block remain constant.
  - The color of the pivot remains constant.
  - The number/sequence of spacing_pixels between the block and pivot remains constant.
