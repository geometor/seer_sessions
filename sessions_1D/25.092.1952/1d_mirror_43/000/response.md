Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels represented by integer color codes.
*   **Key Colors:** White (0) serves as the background. Maroon (9) appears as a single, static pixel. Another color (gray (5) in train\_1, green (3) in train\_2 and train\_3) forms a contiguous block.
*   **Objects:**
    *   A single maroon (9) pixel (the "pivot").
    *   A contiguous block of a single color other than white or maroon (the "colored block").
    *   White (0) pixels acting as background/spacing.
*   **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves changing the position of the "colored block" relative to the "pivot" pixel. The block moves from one side of the pivot to the other.
*   **Invariants:**
    *   The grid dimensions remain the same (1x19 in the examples).
    *   The maroon (9) pivot pixel itself doesn't change color or position relative to the grid *boundaries* during the swap logic, but its position relative to the *colored block* flips.
    *   The colored block retains its color and length.
    *   The number of white pixels directly *between* the colored block and the pivot pixel is preserved during the move.

task_description: Repositioning a colored block relative to a fixed pivot pixel in a 1D grid.

grid_properties:

  background_color: 0 (white)

objects:
  - object: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    shape: single pixel
    quantity: 1
    role: static reference point for repositioning
  - object: colored_block
    color: non-white (0), non-maroon (9) # e.g., gray (5), green (3)
    shape: contiguous horizontal block
    quantity: 1
    role: element to be moved
  - object: spacing_pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    location: directly between the pivot and the colored_block
    role: maintains distance during repositioning
  - object: background_pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    location: fills the rest of the grid
    role: background filler

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: colored_block
    object2: pivot
    states: [left_of, right_of] # Input state determines the output state
  - type: adjacency
    object1: colored_block

    description: The colored_block and pivot are separated by the spacing_pixels.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot pixel (color 9)
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block (contiguous non-white, non-maroon pixels)
  - action: identify
    target: spacing_pixels (white pixels between pivot and colored_block)
  - action: determine
    property: relative position (is colored_block left or right of pivot?)
  - action: move
    target: colored_block
    details: Relocate the colored_block to the opposite side of the pivot.
  - action: preserve
    target: spacing_pixels
    details: Maintain the same sequence/count of spacing_pixels between the pivot and the repositioned colored_block.
  - action: reconstruct
    target: output grid
    details: Assemble the grid with the pivot, spacing_pixels, and moved colored_block in their new configuration, filling remaining space with background_pixels.

constraints:
  - The grid size remains constant.
  - The color and size of the colored_block remain constant.
  - The color of the pivot remains constant.
  - The number/sequence of spacing_pixels between the block and pivot remains constant.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Components:** Scan the input row to find the single maroon (9) pixel (the "pivot") and the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9) (the "colored block").
2.  **Identify Spacing:** Determine the sequence of white (0) pixels located directly between the pivot and the colored block (the "spacing pixels"). Note their count.
3.  **Determine Relative Position:** Check if the colored block is currently positioned to the left or the right of the pivot pixel.
4.  **Calculate New Position:** Prepare to place the colored block on the *opposite* side of the pivot compared to its input position.
5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new row of the same length, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
    *   Place the pivot pixel at its original index.
    *   If the colored block was originally to the left:
        *   Place the spacing pixels immediately to the right of the pivot.
        *   Place the colored block immediately to the right of the spacing pixels.
    *   If the colored block was originally to the right:
        *   Place the spacing pixels immediately to the left of the pivot.
        *   Place the colored block immediately to the left of the spacing pixels.
    *   Ensure all other pixels in the output row remain white (0).
