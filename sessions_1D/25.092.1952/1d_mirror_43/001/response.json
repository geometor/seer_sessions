Determine if the colored block is to the left or right of the pivot pixel.\n3. Count the number of white (0) pixels (the \"spacing\") that are directly between the colored block and the pivot pixel.\n4. Create an output row of the same length, initially filled with white (0) pixels.\n5. Place the pivot pixel (9) in the output row at the same position it occupied in the input row.\n6.
