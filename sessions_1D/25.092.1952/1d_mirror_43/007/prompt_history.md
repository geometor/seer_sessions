Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels represented by integer color codes.
*   **Key Colors:** White (0) serves as the background. Maroon (9) appears as a single, static pixel. Another color (gray (5) in train\_1, green (3) in train\_2 and train\_3) forms a contiguous block.
*   **Objects:**
    *   A single maroon (9) pixel (the "pivot").
    *   A contiguous block of a single color other than white or maroon (the "colored block").
    *   White (0) pixels acting as background/spacing.
*   **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves changing the position of the "colored block" relative to the "pivot" pixel. The block moves from one side of the pivot to the other.
*   **Invariants:**
    *   The grid dimensions remain the same (1x19 in the examples).
    *   The maroon (9) pivot pixel itself doesn't change color or position relative to the grid *boundaries* during the swap logic, but its position relative to the *colored block* flips.
    *   The colored block retains its color and length.
    *   The number of white pixels directly *between* the colored block and the pivot pixel is preserved during the move.

**YAML Fact Document:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Components:** Scan the input row to find the single maroon (9) pixel (the "pivot") and the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9) (the "colored block").
2.  **Identify Spacing:** Determine the sequence of white (0) pixels located directly between the pivot and the colored block (the "spacing pixels"). Note their count.
3.  **Determine Relative Position:** Check if the colored block is currently positioned to the left or the right of the pivot pixel.
4.  **Calculate New Position:** Prepare to place the colored block on the *opposite* side of the pivot compared to its input position.
5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new row of the same length, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
    *   Place the pivot pixel at its original index.
    *   If the colored block was originally to the left:
        *   Place the spacing pixels immediately to the right of the pivot.
        *   Place the colored block immediately to the right of the spacing pixels.
    *   If the colored block was originally to the right:
        *   Place the spacing pixels immediately to the left of the pivot.
        *   Place the colored block immediately to the left of the spacing pixels.
    *   Ensure all other pixels in the output row remain white (0).

## General Assessment

The previous code execution resulted in failure for all training examples, producing empty output grids `[[]]` instead of the expected transformations. Manual tracing of the algorithm's logic using the provided training examples, however, indicates that the core transformation steps (identifying pivot, block, spacing, and repositioning to the opposite side while preserving spacing) are conceptually correct and *should* produce the expected outputs for these specific cases.

The discrepancy suggests potential issues:
1.  **Execution Environment/Input Handling:** The testing framework might be passing the input in an unexpected format, causing the initial validation `if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or len(input_grid) != 1 or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):` to fail, leading to the `[[]]` return. Alternatively, an uncaught exception during execution might be caught by the harness, resulting in an empty output report.
2.  **Subtle Bug/Edge Case:** Although the core logic seems sound for the examples, there might be a subtle off-by-one error in indexing or slicing, or an unhandled edge case (e.g., block or spacing hitting the grid boundaries after the move) that wasn't triggered in the manual trace but causes failure in actual execution. The code includes bounds checks that return `input_grid`, but the test reported `[[]]`, which is confusing and might point to an uncaught exception or a specific behavior of the test harness.

**Strategy:**
Assume the core logic (find pivot, find block, find spacing, flip side) is correct. Re-verify the implementation details, especially list indexing and slicing for placement. Ensure robust handling of potential errors (e.g., missing components, out-of-bounds placement) by returning the original input grid, as designed in the previous code, rather than crashing or returning `[[]]`. Refine the documentation (YAML, NL Program) to clearly reflect this logic. Since the manual trace was successful, the existing NL program and YAML facts are likely accurate representations of the intended transformation for the given examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  **Find Pivot:** Locate the index of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input row. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  **Place Pivot:** Set the pixel at `pivot_index` in the output row to maroon (9).
4.  **Find Colored Block:** Scan the input row to find the contiguous sequence of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its starting index (`block_start`), ending index (`block_end`), and its content (the list of pixel values, `block_content`).
5.  **Find Spacing:** Identify the sequence of pixels in the input row located strictly between the colored block and the pivot.
    *   If the block is to the left (`block_end < pivot_index`), the spacing is the content from index `block_end + 1` up to (but not including) `pivot_index`.
    *   If the block is to the right (`block_start > pivot_index`), the spacing is the content from index `pivot_index + 1` up to (but not including) `block_start`.
    Record this sequence as `spacing_content`. (Note: `spacing_content` will consist only of white (0) pixels and may be empty if the block is adjacent to the pivot).
6.  **Determine Placement Side:** Check if the colored block was to the left (`block_end < pivot_index`) or right (`block_start > pivot_index`) of the pivot in the input row.
7.  **Place Block and Spacing in Output:**
    *   **If the block was LEFT in the input:** Calculate the starting index for the spacing in the output row as `pivot_index + 1`. Calculate the starting index for the block in the output row as `pivot_index + 1 + length(spacing_content)`. Place the `spacing_content` and then the `block_content` into the output row at these calculated starting indices.
    *   **If the block was RIGHT in the input:** Calculate the starting index for the block in the output row as `pivot_index - length(spacing_content) - length(block_content)`. Calculate the starting index for the spacing in the output row as `pivot_index - length(spacing_content)`. Place the `block_content` and then the `spacing_content` into the output row at these calculated starting indices.
8.  **Finalize:** The output row, now containing the background, the repositioned block, the preserved spacing, and the pivot, is the final result. Ensure that the placement calculation does not result in indices outside the valid range of the row; if it would, the transformation might be considered impossible (handle as an error, potentially by returning the original input).
