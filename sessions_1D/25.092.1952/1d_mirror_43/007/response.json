Identify the contiguous block of pixels of a single color (not white 0 and not maroon 9) (the \"colored block\").\n3. Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels (the \"spacing\") directly between the colored block and the pivot pixel.\n4. Determine if the colored block is initially to the left or right of the pivot.\n5. Construct an output row of the same length, initialized with white (0) pixels.\n6. Place the pivot pixel (9) in the output row at its original index.\n7. Place the identified spacing sequence and the colored block into the output row on the *opposite* side of the pivot compared to their input position, maintaining the same content and relative order (i.e., if spacing was between block and pivot, it remains between block and pivot on the other side).
