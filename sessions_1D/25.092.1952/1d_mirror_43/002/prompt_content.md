Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the single maroon (9) pixel (the "pivot") and the contiguous block of pixels of another single color (not white 0 and not maroon 9) (the "colored block") in the input row.
2. Determine if the colored block is to the left or right of the pivot pixel.
3. Count the number of white (0) pixels (the "spacing") that are directly between the colored block and the pivot pixel.
4. Create an output row of the same length, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
5. Place the pivot pixel (9) in the output row at the same position it occupied in the input row.
6. Place the colored block in the output row on the opposite side of the pivot compared to its position in the input row, maintaining the same number of white (0) spacing pixels between the block and the pivot.
