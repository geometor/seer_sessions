Okay, the "list index out of range" error across all examples indicates a flaw in how indices are calculated or used, particularly when placing the moved block into the output list. The manual trace suggested the logic *should* work, so we need to pinpoint the exact calculation step that leads to an invalid index.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

1.  **Error Source:** The error consistently points to accessing or assigning to an index outside the valid range (0 to length-1) of the `output_row` list. This is most likely happening during the slice assignment: `output_row[new_block_start:new_block_end] = block_content`. Even though there's a bounds check (`if new_block_end <= row_len:` and `if new_block_start >= 0:`), there might be an off-by-one error in the calculation of `new_block_start`, `new_block_end`, or `spacing_len`, or the check itself might be insufficient for all cases (though it looks standard).
2.  **Verification:** The core logic (identify pivot, identify block, calculate spacing, determine direction, calculate new position) seems conceptually correct based on the examples. The implementation details need verification.
3.  **Strategy:** Use `tool_code` to execute the calculation steps of the existing logic for each example input and print the intermediate values (`pivot_index`, block details, `spacing_len`, calculated new indices). This will reveal if the calculated indices are indeed out of bounds *before* the assignment is attempted, confirming the calculation error. Then, refine the index calculation logic in the natural language program and the subsequent code.

**Metrics Gathering:**
