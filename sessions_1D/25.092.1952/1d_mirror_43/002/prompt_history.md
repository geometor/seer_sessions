Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels represented by integer color codes.
*   **Key Colors:** White (0) serves as the background. Maroon (9) appears as a single, static pixel. Another color (gray (5) in train\_1, green (3) in train\_2 and train\_3) forms a contiguous block.
*   **Objects:**
    *   A single maroon (9) pixel (the "pivot").
    *   A contiguous block of a single color other than white or maroon (the "colored block").
    *   White (0) pixels acting as background/spacing.
*   **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves changing the position of the "colored block" relative to the "pivot" pixel. The block moves from one side of the pivot to the other.
*   **Invariants:**
    *   The grid dimensions remain the same (1x19 in the examples).
    *   The maroon (9) pivot pixel itself doesn't change color or position relative to the grid *boundaries* during the swap logic, but its position relative to the *colored block* flips.
    *   The colored block retains its color and length.
    *   The number of white pixels directly *between* the colored block and the pivot pixel is preserved during the move.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Components:** Scan the input row to find the single maroon (9) pixel (the "pivot") and the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9) (the "colored block").
2.  **Identify Spacing:** Determine the sequence of white (0) pixels located directly between the pivot and the colored block (the "spacing pixels"). Note their count.
3.  **Determine Relative Position:** Check if the colored block is currently positioned to the left or the right of the pivot pixel.
4.  **Calculate New Position:** Prepare to place the colored block on the *opposite* side of the pivot compared to its input position.
5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new row of the same length, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
    *   Place the pivot pixel at its original index.
    *   If the colored block was originally to the left:
        *   Place the spacing pixels immediately to the right of the pivot.
        *   Place the colored block immediately to the right of the spacing pixels.
    *   If the colored block was originally to the right:
        *   Place the spacing pixels immediately to the left of the pivot.
        *   Place the colored block immediately to the left of the spacing pixels.
    *   Ensure all other pixels in the output row remain white (0).

Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the single maroon (9) pixel (the "pivot") and the contiguous block of pixels of another single color (not white 0 and not maroon 9) (the "colored block") in the input row.
2. Determine if the colored block is to the left or right of the pivot pixel.
3. Count the number of white (0) pixels (the "spacing") that are directly between the colored block and the pivot pixel.
4. Create an output row of the same length, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
5. Place the pivot pixel (9) in the output row at the same position it occupied in the input row.
6. Place the colored block in the output row on the opposite side of the pivot compared to its position in the input row, maintaining the same number of white (0) spacing pixels between the block and the pivot.
