            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (or grids with height 1).\n2.  **Key Colors**: Three colors seem significant:\n    *   White (0): Acts as background/padding/separator.\n    *   Maroon (9): Appears as a single, unique pixel.\n    *   Another Color (e.g., Orange (7), Green (3)): Appears as a contiguous block of pixels.\n3.  **Objects**: We can identify distinct objects within the input grid:\n    *   A single Maroon pixel (value 9).\n    *   A contiguous block of another color (e.g., `77777`, `33333`, `3333`). Let's call this the \"Colored Block\".\n    *   A contiguous block of one or more White pixels (0) separating the Maroon pixel and the Colored Block. Let's call this the \"Separator\".\n    *   Remaining White pixels forming the background/padding.\n4.  **Transformation**: Comparing input and output, the core transformation involves rearranging the Maroon pixel, the Colored Block, and the Separator.\n    *   The relative order of the Maroon pixel and the Colored Block is reversed in the output. In all examples, the input order is `Colored Block - Separator - Maroon Pixel`, and the output order is `Maroon Pixel - Separator - Colored Block`.\n    *   The Separator block maintains its position *relative* to the Maroon pixel and the Colored Block (it stays between them).\n    *   Crucially, the absolute position (index) of the Maroon pixel (9) remains unchanged from input to output.\n    *   The output grid is constructed by placing the Maroon pixel at its original index, followed immediately by the Separator, followed immediately by the Colored Block. All other positions are filled with White (0).\n5.  **Invariance**: The dimensions of the grid remain the same. The colors and lengths of the Maroon pixel, Colored Block, and Separator remain the same. Only their positions relative to each other and the grid boundaries change, anchored by the fixed position of the Maroon pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
