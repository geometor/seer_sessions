Grid:
  Type: 1D array of integers (colors)
  Properties:
    - height: 1
    - width: variable (e.g., 18 in examples)
    - pixels: values from 0-9

Objects:
  - Name: Colored Block
    Description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not White (0) and not Maroon (9).
    Properties:
      - color: C
      - length: L_cb >= 1
      - sequence: [C, C, ..., C]
      - input_start_index: I_cb_start
  - Name: Maroon Pixel
    Description: A single pixel with the color Maroon (9).
    Properties:
      - color: 9
      - length: 1
      - sequence: [9]
      - input_index: I_m
  - Name: Separator
    Description: A contiguous sequence of White (0) pixels located between the Colored Block and the Maroon Pixel in the input.
    Properties:
      - color: 0
      - length: L_s >= 1
      - sequence: [0, 0, ..., 0]
      - input_start_index: I_s_start

Relationships:
  - Spatial Input: The input grid contains the sequence `... Colored Block | Separator | Maroon Pixel ...` or `... Maroon Pixel | Separator | Colored Block ...`. (Examples show the former).
  - Spatial Output: The output grid contains the sequence `... Maroon Pixel | Separator | Colored Block ...`.
  - Positional Invariance: The index of the Maroon Pixel in the output grid (`O_m`) is the same as its index in the input grid (`I_m`). `O_m = I_m`.
  - Adjacency Output: In the output grid, the Separator starts immediately after the Maroon Pixel, and the Colored Block starts immediately after the Separator.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify the Colored Block, Maroon Pixel, and Separator in the input grid.
  - Action: Record the sequence data for Colored Block and Separator.
  - Action: Record the index (`I_m`) of the Maroon Pixel.
  - Action: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with White (0).
  - Action: Place the Maroon Pixel (9) into the output grid at index `I_m`.
  - Action: Place the Separator sequence into the output grid starting at index `I_m + 1`.
  - Action: Place the Colored Block sequence into the output grid starting at index `I_m + 1 + length(Separator)`.
