A single Maroon (9) pixel.\n    b. A contiguous block of a single color C (where C is not White (0) and not Maroon (9)).\n    c. A sequence of White (0) pixels (Separator) located between the Colored Block and the Maroon Pixel in the input.\n2. Determines the index (maroon_index) of the Maroon pixel.\n3. Records the sequence of pixels for the Colored Block and the Separator.\n4. Constructs an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with White (0).\n5. Places the Maroon pixel (9) into the output grid at its original `maroon_index`.\n6. Places the recorded Separator sequence immediately following the Maroon pixel in the output grid.\n7. Places the recorded Colored Block sequence immediately following the Separator sequence in the output grid.\n8. Ensures that placed sequences do not exceed the grid boundaries.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport math # Not used in this version, but available\n# No other specific libraries like numpy needed for this list-based approach\n\ndef find_maroon_pixel(row):\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the single Maroon (9) pixel.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        return row.index(9)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1 # Indicate not found\n\ndef find_colored_block(row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the contiguous block of non-White(0), non-Maroon(9) color.\n    Assumes only one such block exists per row based on examples.\n    Returns: tuple (sequence, start_index, end_index_exclusive) or (None, -1, -1) if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    start_index = -1\n    end_index = -1\n    block_color = -1\n    in_block = False\n\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(row):\n        if not in_block:\n            # Look for the start of a block (non-0, non-9)\n            if pixel != 0 and pixel != 9:\n                in_block = True\n                start_index = i\n                block_color = pixel\n                sequence.append(pixel)\n        else: # Already in a block\n            # Check if the current pixel continues the block\n            if pixel == block_color:\n                sequence.append(pixel)\n            else:\n                # Block ends here (found different color, 0, or 9)\n                end_index = i\n                break # Stop searching once the first block is found and ends\n\n    # Handle case where the block extends to the end of the row\n    if in_block and end_index == -1:\n        end_index = len(row)\n\n    if not in_block: # Block never started\n        return None, -1, -1\n    else:\n        return sequence, start_index, end_index\n\ndef find_separator(row, block_end_index, maroon_index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the sequence of White(0) pixels between the colored block and the maroon pixel.\n    Assumes block appears before maroon pixel based on examples.
