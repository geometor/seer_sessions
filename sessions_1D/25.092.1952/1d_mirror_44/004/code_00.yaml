Grid:
  Type: 1D array (list of lists with one inner list)
  Properties:
    - height: 1
    - width: variable
    - background_color: 0 (White)

Input_Objects:
  - Name: Maroon_Pixel
    Description: The single pixel with value 9.
    Properties:
      - color: 9
      - input_index: I_m (variable)
  - Name: Colored_Block
    Description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not 0 and not 9. Assumed to be unique in the input row.
    Properties:
      - color: C (variable)
      - sequence: S_cb (list of C)
      - length: L_cb = len(S_cb)
      - input_start_index: I_cb_start (variable)
      - input_end_index_exclusive: I_cb_end (variable) # I_cb_start + L_cb
  - Name: Separator
    Description: A contiguous sequence of 0-valued pixels located between the Colored_Block and the Maroon_Pixel in the input.
    Properties:
      - color: 0
      - sequence: S_s (list of 0)
      - length: L_s = len(S_s)
      - location: Between I_cb_end and I_m (assuming I_cb_end <= I_m based on examples)
      - calculation: input_row[I_cb_end : I_m]

Transformation:
  - Goal: Rearrange the three objects (Maroon_Pixel, Separator, Colored_Block) relative to the Maroon_Pixel's original position.
  - Steps:
    1. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
    2. Identify the Maroon_Pixel and its `input_index` (I_m).
    3. Identify the Colored_Block and its `sequence` (S_cb).
    4. Identify the Separator based on the indices of the other two objects, getting its `sequence` (S_s).
    5. Place the Maroon_Pixel (9) in the output grid at index `I_m`.
    6. Define the starting index for the separator placement: `O_s_start = I_m + 1`.
    7. Place the Separator sequence `S_s` into the output grid starting at index `O_s_start`, ensuring not to exceed grid boundaries. The number of elements placed is `min(L_s, width - O_s_start)`.
    8. Define the starting index for the colored block placement: `O_cb_start = O_s_start + L_s_placed` (where L_s_placed is the actual number of separator elements placed).
    9. Place the Colored_Block sequence `S_cb` into the output grid starting at index `O_cb_start`, ensuring not to exceed grid boundaries. The number of elements placed is `min(L_cb, width - O_cb_start)`.

Output_Structure:
  - The output grid contains the Maroon_Pixel at its original index `I_m`.
  - Immediately following the Maroon_Pixel (starting at `I_m + 1`) is the Separator sequence `S_s`.
  - Immediately following the Separator sequence is the Colored_Block sequence `S_cb`.
  - All other positions in the output grid are filled with the background color (0).
  - Format: List containing a single list (row).
