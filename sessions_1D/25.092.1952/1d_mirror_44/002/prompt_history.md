Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (or grids with height 1).
2.  **Key Colors**: Three colors seem significant:
    *   White (0): Acts as background/padding/separator.
    *   Maroon (9): Appears as a single, unique pixel.
    *   Another Color (e.g., Orange (7), Green (3)): Appears as a contiguous block of pixels.
3.  **Objects**: We can identify distinct objects within the input grid:
    *   A single Maroon pixel (value 9).
    *   A contiguous block of another color (e.g., `77777`, `33333`, `3333`). Let's call this the "Colored Block".
    *   A contiguous block of one or more White pixels (0) separating the Maroon pixel and the Colored Block. Let's call this the "Separator".
    *   Remaining White pixels forming the background/padding.
4.  **Transformation**: Comparing input and output, the core transformation involves rearranging the Maroon pixel, the Colored Block, and the Separator.
    *   The relative order of the Maroon pixel and the Colored Block is reversed in the output. In all examples, the input order is `Colored Block - Separator - Maroon Pixel`, and the output order is `Maroon Pixel - Separator - Colored Block`.
    *   The Separator block maintains its position *relative* to the Maroon pixel and the Colored Block (it stays between them).
    *   Crucially, the absolute position (index) of the Maroon pixel (9) remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   The output grid is constructed by placing the Maroon pixel at its original index, followed immediately by the Separator, followed immediately by the Colored Block. All other positions are filled with White (0).
5.  **Invariance**: The dimensions of the grid remain the same. The colors and lengths of the Maroon pixel, Colored Block, and Separator remain the same. Only their positions relative to each other and the grid boundaries change, anchored by the fixed position of the Maroon pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array of integers (colors)
  Properties:
    - height: 1
    - width: variable (e.g., 18 in examples)
    - pixels: values from 0-9

Objects:
  - Name: Colored Block
    Description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not White (0) and not Maroon (9).
    Properties:
      - color: C
      - length: L_cb >= 1
      - sequence: [C, C, ..., C]
      - input_start_index: I_cb_start
  - Name: Maroon Pixel
    Description: A single pixel with the color Maroon (9).
    Properties:
      - color: 9
      - length: 1
      - sequence: [9]
      - input_index: I_m
  - Name: Separator
    Description: A contiguous sequence of White (0) pixels located between the Colored Block and the Maroon Pixel in the input.
    Properties:
      - color: 0
      - length: L_s >= 1
      - sequence: [0, 0, ..., 0]
      - input_start_index: I_s_start

Relationships:
  - Spatial Input: The input grid contains the sequence `... Colored Block | Separator | Maroon Pixel ...` or `... Maroon Pixel | Separator | Colored Block ...`. (Examples show the former).
  - Spatial Output: The output grid contains the sequence `... Maroon Pixel | Separator | Colored Block ...`.
  - Positional Invariance: The index of the Maroon Pixel in the output grid (`O_m`) is the same as its index in the input grid (`I_m`). `O_m = I_m`.
  - Adjacency Output: In the output grid, the Separator starts immediately after the Maroon Pixel, and the Colored Block starts immediately after the Separator.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify the Colored Block, Maroon Pixel, and Separator in the input grid.
  - Action: Record the sequence data for Colored Block and Separator.
  - Action: Record the index (`I_m`) of the Maroon Pixel.
  - Action: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with White (0).
  - Action: Place the Maroon Pixel (9) into the output grid at index `I_m`.
  - Action: Place the Separator sequence into the output grid starting at index `I_m + 1`.
  - Action: Place the Colored Block sequence into the output grid starting at index `I_m + 1 + length(Separator)`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Components**:
    *   Scan the input grid to locate the single Maroon pixel (value 9). Record its index (`maroon_index`).
    *   Scan the input grid to locate the contiguous block of non-White (0), non-Maroon (9) pixels. Record this block's color sequence (`colored_block_sequence`).
    *   Determine the sequence of White (0) pixels that lies directly between the `colored_block_sequence` and the Maroon pixel in the input. Record this sequence (`separator_sequence`).
2.  **Construct Output**:
    *   Create a new grid (`output_grid`) with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with White pixels (0).
    *   Place the Maroon pixel (9) into the `output_grid` at the recorded `maroon_index`.
    *   Place the `separator_sequence` into the `output_grid` starting at the index immediately following the Maroon pixel (`maroon_index + 1`).
    *   Place the `colored_block_sequence` into the `output_grid` starting at the index immediately following the end of the `separator_sequence` (`maroon_index + 1 + length(separator_sequence)`).
3.  **Finalize**: The `output_grid` now holds the result.
```python
import numpy as np # Used for array manipulation if needed, though basic list operations suffice here

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms a 1D input grid based on the following rules:
    1. Locates a single Maroon (9) pixel.
    2. Locates a contiguous block of a single color C (where C is not White (0) and not Maroon (9)).
    3. Locates the contiguous block of White (0) pixels acting as a separator between the Maroon pixel and the colored block in the input.
    4. Constructs the output grid by keeping the Maroon pixel at its original position, placing the separator sequence immediately after it, and placing the colored block sequence immediately after the separator.
    5. Fills all other positions in the output grid with White (0).
