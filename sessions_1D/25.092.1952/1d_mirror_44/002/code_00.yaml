Grid:
  Type: 1D array (list of lists with one inner list)
  Properties:
    - height: 1
    - width: variable (e.g., 18 in examples)
    - pixels: integers 0-9 (colors)
    - background_color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Name: Colored Block
    Identifier: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not White (0) and not Maroon (9).
    Properties:
      - color: C (e.g., 7, 3)
      - sequence: List of C values (e.g., `[7,7,7,7,7]`, `[3,3,3,3,3]`, `[3,3,3,3]`)
      - length: L_cb >= 1
      - input_start_index: Start index in the input grid.
      - input_end_index: End index (exclusive) in the input grid.
      - uniqueness: Assumed to be the only such block in the grid.
  - Name: Maroon Pixel
    Identifier: A single pixel with the color Maroon (9).
    Properties:
      - color: 9
      - sequence: `[9]`
      - length: 1
      - input_index: Index in the input grid. (e.g., 10, 7, 7)
      - uniqueness: Exactly one instance in the grid.
  - Name: Separator
    Identifier: A contiguous sequence of White (0) pixels located spatially between the Colored Block and the Maroon Pixel in the input grid.
    Properties:
      - color: 0
      - sequence: List of 0 values (e.g., `[0]`, `[0]`, `[0,0]`)
      - length: L_s >= 1 (based on examples)
      - input_start_index: Start index in the input grid.
      - input_end_index: End index (exclusive) in the input grid.

Relationships:
  - Input Spatial Order: In all examples, the order is `(Padding) - Colored Block - Separator - Maroon Pixel - (Padding)`.
  - Output Spatial Order: In the output, the order becomes `(Padding) - Maroon Pixel - Separator - Colored Block - (Padding)`.
  - Positional Anchor: The Maroon Pixel's index remains unchanged from input to output (`output_maroon_index = input_maroon_index`).
  - Adjacency: In the output, the Separator starts immediately after the Maroon Pixel, and the Colored Block starts immediately after the Separator.

Transformation:
  - Step 1: Identify the `Maroon Pixel` and record its `input_index`.
  - Step 2: Identify the `Colored Block` and record its `sequence`.
  - Step 3: Identify the `Separator` sequence located between the `Colored Block` and the `Maroon Pixel` in the input.
  - Step 4: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the `background_color` (White, 0).
  - Step 5: Place the `Maroon Pixel` (9) into the output grid at its original `input_index`.
  - Step 6: Place the `Separator` sequence into the output grid, starting at the index immediately following the `Maroon Pixel` (`input_index + 1`).
  - Step 7: Place the `Colored Block` sequence into the output grid, starting at the index immediately following the end of the placed `Separator`.
  - Step 8: Any remaining positions in the output grid retain the `background_color`.
