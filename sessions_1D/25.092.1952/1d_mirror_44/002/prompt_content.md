def transform(input_grid):

    Transforms a 1D input grid based on the following rules:
    1. Locates a single Maroon (9) pixel.
    2. Locates a contiguous block of a single color C (where C is not White (0) and not Maroon (9)).
    3. Locates the contiguous block of White (0) pixels acting as a separator between the Maroon pixel and the colored block in the input.
    4. Constructs the output grid by keeping the Maroon pixel at its original position, placing the separator sequence immediately after it, and placing the colored block sequence immediately after the separator.
    5. Fills all other positions in the output grid with White (0).
