"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (represented as a list within a list) based on the following rule:
1. Identifies three key components in the input row:
    a. A single Maroon (9) pixel.
    b. A contiguous block of a single color C (where C is not White (0) and not Maroon (9)).
    c. A sequence of White (0) pixels (Separator) located between the Colored Block and the Maroon Pixel in the input.
2. Determines the index (maroon_index) of the Maroon pixel.
3. Records the sequence of pixels for the Colored Block and the Separator.
4. Constructs an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with White (0).
5. Places the Maroon pixel (9) into the output grid at its original `maroon_index`.
6. Places the recorded Separator sequence immediately following the Maroon pixel in the output grid.
7. Places the recorded Colored Block sequence immediately following the Separator sequence in the output grid.
8. Ensures that placed sequences do not exceed the grid boundaries.
