InputGrid:
  Type: 1D list/array of integers (colors)
  Structure: Typically provided as a list containing a single list [[...]]
  Properties:
    - height: 1
    - width: variable (e.g., 18 in examples)
    - pixels: values 0-9 (White, Maroon, others)

OutputGrid:
  Type: 1D list/array of integers (colors)
  Structure: Same dimensions and format as InputGrid.
  Properties:
    - Derived from InputGrid based on transformation rule.
    - Primarily composed of White(0) background.

Objects:
  - Name: Maroon_Pixel
    Identifier: The single pixel with value 9.
    Properties:
      - color: 9 (Maroon)
      - length: 1
      - input_index: `I_m` (Index in the input row)
      - output_index: `O_m` (Index in the output row)
    Invariant: `O_m == I_m`. Its position remains fixed.

  - Name: Colored_Block
    Identifier: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color `C`, where `C` is not 0 (White) and not 9 (Maroon). Assumed to be unique per input row based on examples.
    Properties:
      - color: `C` (e.g., 7 or 3 in examples)
      - sequence: `S_cb` (The list of pixels forming the block, e.g., `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`)
      - length: `L_cb` = `len(S_cb)`
      - input_start_index: `I_cb_start`
      - input_end_index: `I_cb_end` (exclusive)

  - Name: Separator
    Identifier: A contiguous sequence of White (0) pixels located directly between the `Colored_Block` and the `Maroon_Pixel` in the input row.
    Properties:
      - color: 0 (White)
      - sequence: `S_s` (The list of pixels forming the separator, e.g., `[0]` or `[0, 0]`)
      - length: `L_s` = `len(S_s)`
      - input_start_index: `I_s_start` (equal to `I_cb_end` if block is before maroon)
      - input_end_index: `I_s_end` (equal to `I_m` if block is before maroon)
    Constraint: May be empty if `Colored_Block` and `Maroon_Pixel` are adjacent in input. (Although examples show length >= 1).

Transformation_Rule:
  Anchor: The `Maroon_Pixel`. Its index `I_m` in the input determines its index `O_m` in the output (`O_m = I_m`).
  Rearrangement: The output sequence is constructed by placing components relative to the anchor.
  Steps:
    1. Initialize `OutputGrid` with White (0) pixels.
    2. Place `Maroon_Pixel` (value 9) at index `O_m`.
    3. Place `Separator` sequence `S_s` immediately *after* `Maroon_Pixel`, starting at index `O_m + 1`.
    4. Place `Colored_Block` sequence `S_cb` immediately *after* the placed `Separator`, starting at index `O_m + 1 + L_s`.
  Boundary_Handling: If placing `S_s` or `S_cb` would extend beyond the grid width, only the part that fits is placed.
  Input_Order_Assumption: All examples show the `Colored_Block` appearing before the `Maroon_Pixel` in the input row. The `Separator` is found between them. The transformation logic reverses this relative order in the output.
