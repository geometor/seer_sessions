Identifies three key components in the input row:\n    a. A single Maroon (9) pixel (Anchor).\n    b. A contiguous block of a single color C (Colored_Block), where C is not White (0) and not Maroon (9).\n    c. A sequence of White (0) pixels (Separator) located between the Colored_Block and the Anchor in the input.\n2. Determines the index (maroon_index) of the Anchor pixel in the input. This index is preserved in the output.\n3. Records the pixel sequences for the Colored_Block and the Separator.\n4. Constructs an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with White (0).\n5. Places the Anchor pixel (9) into the output grid at its original `maroon_index`.\n6. Places the recorded Separator sequence immediately following the Anchor pixel in the output grid.\n7. Places the recorded Colored_Block sequence immediately following the Separator sequence in the output grid.\n8. Ensures that placed sequences do not exceed the grid boundaries, truncating them if necessary.\nThe relative order of the Colored_Block and Anchor is effectively reversed around the Separator in the output, anchored by the Anchor's original position.\n\"\"\"\n\n# No specific imports needed beyond standard Python list operations\n# import numpy as np # Only needed if direct numpy operations were required\n\n# --- Helper Functions ---\n\ndef find_maroon_pixel(row):\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the single Maroon (9) pixel.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        return row.index(9)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1 # Indicate not found\n\ndef find_colored_block(row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of non-White(0), non-Maroon(9) color.\n    Assumes only one such block exists per row based on examples.\n    Returns: tuple (sequence, start_index, end_index_exclusive) or (None, -1, -1) if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    start_index = -1\n    end_index = -1\n    block_color = -1\n    in_block = False\n    width = len(row)\n\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(row):\n        if not in_block:\n            # Look for the start of a block (non-0, non-9)\n            if pixel != 0 and pixel != 9:\n                in_block = True\n                start_index = i\n                block_color = pixel\n                sequence.append(pixel)\n        else: # Already in a block\n            # Check if the current pixel continues the block\n            if pixel == block_color:\n                sequence.append(pixel)\n            else:\n                # Block ends here (found different color, 0, or 9)\n                end_index = i\n                break # Stop searching once the first block is found and ends\n\n    # Handle case where the block extends to the end of the row\n    if in_block and end_index == -1:\n        end_index = width\n\n    if not in_block: # Block never started\n        return None, -1, -1\n    else:\n        return sequence, start_index, end_index\n\ndef find_separator(row, block_end_index, maroon_index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the sequence of White(0) pixels between the colored block and the maroon pixel.\n    Assumes block appears before maroon pixel based on examples.
