Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (or grids with height 1).
2.  **Key Colors**: Three colors seem significant:
    *   White (0): Acts as background/padding/separator.
    *   Maroon (9): Appears as a single, unique pixel.
    *   Another Color (e.g., Orange (7), Green (3)): Appears as a contiguous block of pixels.
3.  **Objects**: We can identify distinct objects within the input grid:
    *   A single Maroon pixel (value 9).
    *   A contiguous block of another color (e.g., `77777`, `33333`, `3333`). Let's call this the "Colored Block".
    *   A contiguous block of one or more White pixels (0) separating the Maroon pixel and the Colored Block. Let's call this the "Separator".
    *   Remaining White pixels forming the background/padding.
4.  **Transformation**: Comparing input and output, the core transformation involves rearranging the Maroon pixel, the Colored Block, and the Separator.
    *   The relative order of the Maroon pixel and the Colored Block is reversed in the output. In all examples, the input order is `Colored Block - Separator - Maroon Pixel`, and the output order is `Maroon Pixel - Separator - Colored Block`.
    *   The Separator block maintains its position *relative* to the Maroon pixel and the Colored Block (it stays between them).
    *   Crucially, the absolute position (index) of the Maroon pixel (9) remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   The output grid is constructed by placing the Maroon pixel at its original index, followed immediately by the Separator, followed immediately by the Colored Block. All other positions are filled with White (0).
5.  **Invariance**: The dimensions of the grid remain the same. The colors and lengths of the Maroon pixel, Colored Block, and Separator remain the same. Only their positions relative to each other and the grid boundaries change, anchored by the fixed position of the Maroon pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array of integers (colors)
  Properties:
    - height: 1
    - width: variable (e.g., 18 in examples)
    - pixels: values from 0-9

Objects:
  - Name: Colored Block
    Description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not White (0) and not Maroon (9).
    Properties:
      - color: C
      - length: L_cb >= 1
      - sequence: [C, C, ..., C]
      - input_start_index: I_cb_start
  - Name: Maroon Pixel
    Description: A single pixel with the color Maroon (9).
    Properties:
      - color: 9
      - length: 1
      - sequence: [9]
      - input_index: I_m
  - Name: Separator
    Description: A contiguous sequence of White (0) pixels located between the Colored Block and the Maroon Pixel in the input.
    Properties:
      - color: 0
      - length: L_s >= 1
      - sequence: [0, 0, ..., 0]
      - input_start_index: I_s_start

Relationships:
  - Spatial Input: The input grid contains the sequence `... Colored Block | Separator | Maroon Pixel ...` or `... Maroon Pixel | Separator | Colored Block ...`. (Examples show the former).
  - Spatial Output: The output grid contains the sequence `... Maroon Pixel | Separator | Colored Block ...`.
  - Positional Invariance: The index of the Maroon Pixel in the output grid (`O_m`) is the same as its index in the input grid (`I_m`). `O_m = I_m`.
  - Adjacency Output: In the output grid, the Separator starts immediately after the Maroon Pixel, and the Colored Block starts immediately after the Separator.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify the Colored Block, Maroon Pixel, and Separator in the input grid.
  - Action: Record the sequence data for Colored Block and Separator.
  - Action: Record the index (`I_m`) of the Maroon Pixel.
  - Action: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with White (0).
  - Action: Place the Maroon Pixel (9) into the output grid at index `I_m`.
  - Action: Place the Separator sequence into the output grid starting at index `I_m + 1`.
  - Action: Place the Colored Block sequence into the output grid starting at index `I_m + 1 + length(Separator)`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Components**:
    *   Scan the input grid to locate the single Maroon pixel (value 9). Record its index (`maroon_index`).
    *   Scan the input grid to locate the contiguous block of non-White (0), non-Maroon (9) pixels. Record this block's color sequence (`colored_block_sequence`).
    *   Determine the sequence of White (0) pixels that lies directly between the `colored_block_sequence` and the Maroon pixel in the input. Record this sequence (`separator_sequence`).
2.  **Construct Output**:
    *   Create a new grid (`output_grid`) with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with White pixels (0).
    *   Place the Maroon pixel (9) into the `output_grid` at the recorded `maroon_index`.
    *   Place the `separator_sequence` into the `output_grid` starting at the index immediately following the Maroon pixel (`maroon_index + 1`).
    *   Place the `colored_block_sequence` into the `output_grid` starting at the index immediately following the end of the `separator_sequence` (`maroon_index + 1 + length(separator_sequence)`).
3.  **Finalize**: The `output_grid` now holds the result.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed due to a `ValueError` related to ambiguous boolean evaluation, likely triggered when the testing framework provided the input grid as a NumPy array instead of a standard Python list of lists. The core transformation logic (identifying the maroon pixel, the colored block, the separator, and rearranging them based on the maroon pixel's fixed position) appears correct based on the visual examples. The strategy is to:

1.  Modify the input handling/validation part of the code to be robust to both list-based and NumPy array inputs.
2.  Confirm the properties (indices, sequences) of the identified objects (Maroon Pixel, Colored Block, Separator) across all examples using code execution.
3.  Refine the YAML documentation and Natural Language Program based on these confirmed properties and the understanding of the required rearrangement.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Type: 1D list/array of integers (colors)
  Structure: Typically provided as a list containing a single list [[...]]
  Properties:
    - height: 1
    - width: variable (e.g., 18 in examples)
    - pixels: values 0-9 (White, Maroon, others)

OutputGrid:
  Type: 1D list/array of integers (colors)
  Structure: Same dimensions and format as InputGrid.
  Properties:
    - Derived from InputGrid based on transformation rule.
    - Primarily composed of White(0) background.

Objects:
  - Name: Maroon_Pixel
    Identifier: The single pixel with value 9.
    Properties:
      - color: 9 (Maroon)
      - length: 1
      - input_index: `I_m` (Index in the input row)
      - output_index: `O_m` (Index in the output row)
    Invariant: `O_m == I_m`. Its position remains fixed.

  - Name: Colored_Block
    Identifier: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color `C`, where `C` is not 0 (White) and not 9 (Maroon). Assumed to be unique per input row based on examples.
    Properties:
      - color: `C` (e.g., 7 or 3 in examples)
      - sequence: `S_cb` (The list of pixels forming the block, e.g., `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`)
      - length: `L_cb` = `len(S_cb)`
      - input_start_index: `I_cb_start`
      - input_end_index: `I_cb_end` (exclusive)

  - Name: Separator
    Identifier: A contiguous sequence of White (0) pixels located directly between the `Colored_Block` and the `Maroon_Pixel` in the input row.
    Properties:
      - color: 0 (White)
      - sequence: `S_s` (The list of pixels forming the separator, e.g., `[0]` or `[0, 0]`)
      - length: `L_s` = `len(S_s)`
      - input_start_index: `I_s_start` (equal to `I_cb_end` if block is before maroon)
      - input_end_index: `I_s_end` (equal to `I_m` if block is before maroon)
    Constraint: May be empty if `Colored_Block` and `Maroon_Pixel` are adjacent in input. (Although examples show length >= 1).

Transformation_Rule:
  Anchor: The `Maroon_Pixel`. Its index `I_m` in the input determines its index `O_m` in the output (`O_m = I_m`).
  Rearrangement: The output sequence is constructed by placing components relative to the anchor.
  Steps:
    1. Initialize `OutputGrid` with White (0) pixels.
    2. Place `Maroon_Pixel` (value 9) at index `O_m`.
    3. Place `Separator` sequence `S_s` immediately *after* `Maroon_Pixel`, starting at index `O_m + 1`.
    4. Place `Colored_Block` sequence `S_cb` immediately *after* the placed `Separator`, starting at index `O_m + 1 + L_s`.
  Boundary_Handling: If placing `S_s` or `S_cb` would extend beyond the grid width, only the part that fits is placed.
  Input_Order_Assumption: All examples show the `Colored_Block` appearing before the `Maroon_Pixel` in the input row. The `Separator` is found between them. The transformation logic reverses this relative order in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize**: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with White (0) pixels.
2.  **Identify Anchor**: Locate the single Maroon (9) pixel in the input grid's row. Record its index (`maroon_index`).
3.  **Identify Colored Block**: Find the contiguous sequence of identical pixels that are neither White (0) nor Maroon (9). Record this sequence (`colored_block_sequence`) and its start and end indices in the input.
4.  **Identify Separator**: Find the sequence of White (0) pixels located strictly between the end of the `colored_block_sequence` and the `maroon_index` in the input grid. Record this sequence (`separator_sequence`). (This assumes the block occurs before the maroon pixel, as seen in all examples).
5.  **Construct Output**:
    *   Place the Maroon pixel (9) into the output grid at the identified `maroon_index`.
    *   Starting at the index immediately after the Maroon pixel (`maroon_index + 1`), place the `separator_sequence` into the output grid.
    *   Starting at the index immediately after the end of the placed `separator_sequence`, place the `colored_block_sequence` into the output grid.
    *   Ensure that placing the sequences does not write past the end of the output grid; truncate sequences if necessary.
6.  **Finalize**: The output grid now contains the transformed arrangement.
