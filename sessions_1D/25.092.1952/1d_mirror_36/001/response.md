"""
Transforms the input grid by moving a colored line relative to a fixed maroon pixel.
The input grid is expected to be 1-dimensional (a single row) containing:
- Background pixels (white, 0).
- Exactly one anchor pixel (maroon, 9).
- Exactly one contiguous horizontal line (mover) of a single color (not white or maroon),
  positioned entirely to the left of the anchor pixel.

The transformation preserves the grid dimensions, the anchor position, the mover's color,
and the mover's length. It moves the mover from the left side of the anchor to the right
side. The number of white background pixels between the end of the mover and the anchor
in the input grid is preserved as the number of white background pixels between the anchor
and the start of the mover in the output grid.
