            "text": "*   **Perception:**\n    *   The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (represented as single rows).\n    *   Each input grid contains three distinct elements: a background of white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9), and a single contiguous horizontal line of another uniform color (yellow, orange, or magenta in the examples).\n    *   The maroon pixel acts as a fixed anchor point; its position remains unchanged between the input and output grids.\n    *   The colored horizontal line object moves its position relative to the maroon pixel. It is always to the left of the maroon pixel in the input and always to the right in the output.\n    *   The transformation rule calculates the new starting position of the colored line based on its original position relative to the maroon pixel and whether the original line crossed the vertical center of the grid.\n    *   The length and color of the moving line object are preserved in the output.\n    *   The distance (number of pixels) between the end of the line and the maroon pixel in the input (`dist_in`) determines the distance between the maroon pixel and the start of the line in the output (`dist_out`).\n    *   Specifically, `dist_out` equals `dist_in` unless the input line crosses the grid's center, in which case `dist_out = dist_in + 1`.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify the single contiguous horizontal line of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9). Record its color (`line_color`), start index (`line_start`), and end index (`line_end`). Calculate its length (`line_length = line_end - line_start + 1`).\n    3.  Calculate the input distance `dist_in` between the end of the line and the maroon pixel: `dist_in = maroon_pos - line_end`.\n    4.  Determine the width `W` of the grid. Calculate the center index/indices. If `W` is odd, the center index is `floor(W/2)`. If `W` is even, the center indices are `W/2 - 1` and `W/2`.\n    5.  Check if the input line interval [`line_start`, `line_end`] includes the center index (for odd `W`) or either center index (for even `W`). Set a flag `crosses_center` to true if it does, otherwise false.\n    6.  Calculate the output distance `dist_out`: If `crosses_center` is true, `dist_out = dist_in + 1`. Otherwise, `dist_out = dist_in`.\n    7.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n    8.  Place the maroon pixel (color 9) at `maroon_pos` in the output grid.\n    9.  Calculate the new starting index for the line: `new_line_start = maroon_pos + dist_out`.\n    10. Draw the horizontal line using `line_color` and `line_length` starting at `new_line_start` in the output grid."
