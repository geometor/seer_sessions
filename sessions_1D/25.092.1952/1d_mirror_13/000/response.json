A background of white pixels (value 0).\n2.  A single maroon pixel (value 9).\n3.  A single contiguous horizontal block of another color (yellow - 4, or red - 2).\n\nThe output is also a one-dimensional array of the same size.\nThe transformation involves:\n1.  Keeping the maroon pixel (9) in its original position.\n2.  Keeping any white pixels (0) immediately following the maroon pixel in their original positions.\n3.  Removing the original colored block.\n4.  Placing the colored block immediately after the sequence composed of the maroon pixel and the subsequent white pixels. The color and length of the block remain unchanged.\n5.  The rest of the array is filled with white pixels (0).\n\nEssentially, the colored block is moved to a new position defined by the location of the maroon pixel and the white pixels directly adjacent to its right.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
