task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - item: background
    color: white (0)
    structure: fills remaining space
  - item: marker
    color: maroon (9)
    structure: single pixel
    quantity: 1
    role: defines the anchor point for relocation
  - item: movable_block
    color: variable (non-white, non-maroon; e.g., yellow(4), red(2))
    structure: contiguous horizontal block
    quantity: 1
    role: the object being moved
  - item: spacer
    color: white (0)
    structure: contiguous horizontal block (possibly empty)
    location: immediately follows the marker pixel
    role: defines the gap between the marker and the relocated block
relationship:
  - type: positioning
    subject: movable_block
    target: marker & spacer
    rule: The movable_block is placed immediately after the combined sequence of the marker pixel and any immediately following spacer pixels.
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: marker pixel
    result: store its position
  - action: identify
    target: spacer pixels
    location: immediately following marker
    result: store their positions and count
  - action: identify
    target: movable_block
    result: store its color and length
  - action: construct_output
    size: same as input
    steps:
      - initialize with background color (white)
      - place marker pixel at its original position
      - place spacer pixels at their original positions
      - place movable_block starting at the position immediately after the last spacer pixel (or marker pixel if no spacer exists)
