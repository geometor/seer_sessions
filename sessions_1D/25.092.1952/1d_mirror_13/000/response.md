Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is consistently a one-dimensional array (or a 1xN grid) of pixels.
Each input array contains:
1.  A background of white pixels (value 0).
2.  A single maroon pixel (value 9).
3.  A single contiguous horizontal block of another color (yellow - 4, or red - 2).

The output is also a one-dimensional array of the same size.
The transformation involves:
1.  Keeping the maroon pixel (9) in its original position.
2.  Keeping any white pixels (0) immediately following the maroon pixel in their original positions.
3.  Removing the original colored block.
4.  Placing the colored block immediately after the sequence composed of the maroon pixel and the subsequent white pixels. The color and length of the block remain unchanged.
5.  The rest of the array is filled with white pixels (0).

Essentially, the colored block is moved to a new position defined by the location of the maroon pixel and the white pixels directly adjacent to its right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - item: background
    color: white (0)
    structure: fills remaining space
  - item: marker
    color: maroon (9)
    structure: single pixel
    quantity: 1
    role: defines the anchor point for relocation
  - item: movable_block
    color: variable (non-white, non-maroon; e.g., yellow(4), red(2))
    structure: contiguous horizontal block
    quantity: 1
    role: the object being moved
  - item: spacer
    color: white (0)
    structure: contiguous horizontal block (possibly empty)
    location: immediately follows the marker pixel
    role: defines the gap between the marker and the relocated block
relationship:
  - type: positioning
    subject: movable_block
    target: marker & spacer
    rule: The movable_block is placed immediately after the combined sequence of the marker pixel and any immediately following spacer pixels.
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: marker pixel
    result: store its position
  - action: identify
    target: spacer pixels
    location: immediately following marker
    result: store their positions and count
  - action: identify
    target: movable_block
    result: store its color and length
  - action: construct_output
    size: same as input
    steps:
      - initialize with background color (white)
      - place marker pixel at its original position
      - place spacer pixels at their original positions
      - place movable_block starting at the position immediately after the last spacer pixel (or marker pixel if no spacer exists)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input 1D array.
2.  Initialize an output array of the same size, filled with white pixels (0).
3.  Locate the index of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array. Let this be `marker_index`.
4.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at `marker_index` in the output array.
5.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon color (the "colored block") in the input array. Record its color and length.
6.  Determine the index immediately following the maroon pixel (`marker_index + 1`). Let this be `current_index`.
7.  Starting from `current_index`, check consecutive pixels in the input array as long as they are white (0). For each white pixel found, place a white pixel (0) at the corresponding `current_index` in the output array and increment `current_index`.
8.  The final value of `current_index` now marks the position where the colored block should start in the output array.
9.  Place the colored block (using its recorded color and length) into the output array, starting at `current_index`.
