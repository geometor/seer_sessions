**Perception:**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel and one contiguous block of pixels of another single color (e.g., green, red, gray), with the remaining pixels being white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.

The transformation involves repositioning the colored block based on the location of the maroon pixel. The maroon pixel itself remains stationary. The colored block appears to be "reflected" or "mirrored" across the maroon pixel. The distance between the end of the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input is preserved as the distance between the maroon pixel and the start of the colored block in the output. The original location occupied by the colored block becomes white (0) in the output. All other white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x28)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor_Pixel
    Color: maroon (9)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: Static (remains unchanged)
    Role: Acts as a reflection point/anchor.
  - Type: Colored_Block
    Color: Any non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., green, red, gray)
    Quantity: 1
    Property: Contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    Action: Moves position based on reflection across the Anchor_Pixel.
    Original_Position: Becomes white (0) in the output.

Transformation:
  Action: Reflection / Mirroring
  Reference_Point: The Anchor_Pixel (maroon).
  Rule:
    1. Identify the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) and the Colored_Block.
    2. Calculate the distance (d) between the end index of the Colored_Block and the index of the Anchor_Pixel in the input.
    3. Determine the new starting index for the Colored_Block in the output by adding the distance (d) to the index of the Anchor_Pixel.
    4. The length and color of the Colored_Block remain the same.
    5. Place the Colored_Block at its new position in the output grid.
    6. Set the original position of the Colored_Block to white (0) in the output grid.
    7. Keep the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) in its original position.
    8. Keep all other white (0) pixels in their original positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, initially setting all pixels corresponding to the colored block in the input to white (0).
2.  Find the index (`anchor_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid.
3.  Find the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the `colored_block`). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), ending index (`block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`).
4.  Calculate the distance (`d`) between the `block_end_index` and the `anchor_index`. (`d = anchor_index - block_end_index`). Note: This assumes the block is always before the anchor. If the block can be after the anchor, the rule needs generalization (e.g., using absolute distance or signed distance relative to the anchor). Based on the examples, the block is always before the anchor.
5.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_block_start_index`) for the colored block in the output grid: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + d`.
6.  Calculate the new ending index (`new_block_end_index`) for the colored block: `new_block_end_index = new_block_start_index + block_length - 1`.
7.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from `new_block_start_index` to `new_block_end_index` with the `block_color`.
8.  Ensure the maroon (9) pixel remains at `anchor_index` in the output grid (it should be preserved from the initial copy unless overwritten by step 7, which shouldn't happen based on the reflection logic).
9.  The output grid now represents the transformed input.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous code failed on all training examples with the error: "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This error typically arises in Python when a boolean context (like an `if` statement) receives a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values instead of a single `True` or `False`.

Looking at the code and the error message, the most likely cause is the initial validation checks (`if not input_grid` or `if not input_grid[0]`) being evaluated on a NumPy array object instead of a standard Python list. While the function signature specifies `List[List[int]]`, the testing environment might be passing the data differently, possibly as a NumPy array directly, especially if the input grid has only one row.

The core transformation logic (finding the anchor, finding the block, calculating reflection) seems conceptually correct based on the initial analysis, but the implementation needs adjustment to handle the input format robustly and avoid the ambiguity error.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the input handling at the beginning of the `transform` function to reliably extract the first row, whether the input is `List[List[int]]` or potentially a NumPy array.
2.  Use `tool_code` to parse the training examples and extract key metrics (dimensions, anchor index, block details) to confirm the reflection pattern holds consistently.
3.  Update the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program based on the confirmed metrics and the refined understanding of the required implementation adjustments.

## Metrics Gathering

## General Assessment

The previous code failed on all training examples with the error: "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This error typically arises in Python when a boolean context (like an `if` statement) receives a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values instead of a single `True` or `False`.

Looking at the code and the error message, the most likely cause is the initial validation checks (`if not input_grid` or `if not input_grid[0]`) being evaluated on a NumPy array object instead of a standard Python list. While the function signature specifies `List[List[int]]`, the testing environment might be passing the data differently, possibly as a NumPy array directly, especially if the input grid has only one row.

The core transformation logic (finding the anchor, finding the block, calculating reflection) seems conceptually correct based on the initial analysis, but the implementation needs adjustment to handle the input format robustly and avoid the ambiguity error.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the input handling at the beginning of the `transform` function to reliably extract the first row, whether the input is `List[List[int]]` or potentially a NumPy array. Convert explicitly to a NumPy array for processing.
2.  Use `tool_code` to parse the training examples and extract key metrics (dimensions, anchor index, block details) to confirm the reflection pattern holds consistently. (Corrected the JSON serialization issue in the tool code).
3.  Update the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program based on the confirmed metrics and the refined understanding of the required implementation adjustments.

The metrics confirm the initial hypothesis:
*   All grids are 1x28.
*   Each input has exactly one maroon (9) anchor pixel.
*   Each input has exactly one contiguous block of another color (green=3, red=2, gray=5).
*   The colored block always appears *before* the anchor pixel in the input.
*   The output block has the same color and length as the input block.
*   The anchor pixel position remains unchanged.
*   The reflection rule `new_start = anchor + (anchor - block_end)` correctly predicts the output block's starting position in all examples.

## Updated Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row, represented as List[List[int]])
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x28)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor_Pixel
    Color: maroon (9)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: Static (index remains unchanged between input and output)
    Role: Acts as the center point for the reflection transformation.
  - Type: Colored_Block
    Color: Any non-white, non-maroon color (variable, e.g., green, red, gray)
    Quantity: 1
    Property: Contiguous block of pixels of the same color. Always located entirely before the Anchor_Pixel in the input.
    Action: Its position is transformed via reflection across the Anchor_Pixel.
    Input_Position: The original indices occupied by the block become white (0) in the output.
    Output_Position: Determined by the reflection rule.

Transformation:
  Name: Reflection across Anchor
  Rule:
    1. Identify the index of the Anchor_Pixel (`anchor_index`).
    2. Identify the Colored_Block: its color (`block_color`), start index (`block_start_index`), end index (`block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`).
    3. Calculate the distance (`d`) from the end of the block to the anchor: `d = anchor_index - block_end_index`.
    4. Calculate the starting index for the block in the output grid: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + d`.
    5. Create the output grid, initially all white (0), with the same dimensions as the input.
    6. Place the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) at `anchor_index` in the output grid.
    7. Place the Colored_Block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) starting at `new_block_start_index` in the output grid.
  Invariant: Anchor position, block color, block length, grid dimensions.
  Variant: Block position.
```


## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid (expected as `List[List[int]]` but handle potential variations like `np.ndarray` robustly). Extract the first row for processing and convert it into a NumPy array. Determine the width of the row.
2.  Initialize an output NumPy array of the same width, filled with white (0).
3.  Find the index (`anchor_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input row. If exactly one maroon pixel is not found, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  Place the maroon (9) pixel at `anchor_index` in the output array.
5.  Find the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the `colored_block`) in the input row. Identify its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), ending index (`block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`). If a single, contiguous block meeting these criteria is not found, return the input grid unchanged.
6.  Calculate the distance (`d`) between the end of the input block and the anchor pixel: `d = anchor_index - block_end_index`.
7.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_block_start_index`) for the colored block in the output array: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + d`.
8.  Calculate the new ending index (`new_block_end_index`) for the colored block: `new_block_end_index = new_block_start_index + block_length - 1`.
9.  Check if the calculated `new_block_start_index` and `new_block_end_index` are within the valid bounds (0 to width-1) of the output array.
10. If the new block position is within bounds, fill the pixels in the output array from `new_block_start_index` to `new_block_end_index` (inclusive) with the `block_color`.
11. Convert the final output NumPy array back into the `List[List[int]]` format (a list containing a single list of integers).
12. Return the formatted output grid.
