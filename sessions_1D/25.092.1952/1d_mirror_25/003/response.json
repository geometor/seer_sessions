Identifying a single maroon (9) pixel (the anchor) and a single contiguous block of another color (non-white, non-maroon).\n2. Calculating the distance ('d') between the end index of the colored block and the index of the anchor pixel.\n3. Determining the new starting position for the colored block by adding this distance 'd' to the anchor pixel's index.\n4. Creating an output grid of the same size, initially all white (0).\n5. Placing the anchor pixel at its original position in the output grid.\n6. Placing the colored block (with its original color and length) at the newly calculated starting position in the output grid.
