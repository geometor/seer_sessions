**Perception:**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel and one contiguous block of pixels of another single color (e.g., green, red, gray), with the remaining pixels being white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.

The transformation involves repositioning the colored block based on the location of the maroon pixel. The maroon pixel itself remains stationary. The colored block appears to be "reflected" or "mirrored" across the maroon pixel. The distance between the end of the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input is preserved as the distance between the maroon pixel and the start of the colored block in the output. The original location occupied by the colored block becomes white (0) in the output. All other white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x28)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor_Pixel
    Color: maroon (9)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: Static (remains unchanged)
    Role: Acts as a reflection point/anchor.
  - Type: Colored_Block
    Color: Any non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., green, red, gray)
    Quantity: 1
    Property: Contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    Action: Moves position based on reflection across the Anchor_Pixel.
    Original_Position: Becomes white (0) in the output.

Transformation:
  Action: Reflection / Mirroring
  Reference_Point: The Anchor_Pixel (maroon).
  Rule:
    1. Identify the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) and the Colored_Block.
    2. Calculate the distance (d) between the end index of the Colored_Block and the index of the Anchor_Pixel in the input.
    3. Determine the new starting index for the Colored_Block in the output by adding the distance (d) to the index of the Anchor_Pixel.
    4. The length and color of the Colored_Block remain the same.
    5. Place the Colored_Block at its new position in the output grid.
    6. Set the original position of the Colored_Block to white (0) in the output grid.
    7. Keep the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) in its original position.
    8. Keep all other white (0) pixels in their original positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, initially setting all pixels corresponding to the colored block in the input to white (0).
2.  Find the index (`anchor_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid.
3.  Find the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the `colored_block`). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), ending index (`block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`).
4.  Calculate the distance (`d`) between the `block_end_index` and the `anchor_index`. (`d = anchor_index - block_end_index`). Note: This assumes the block is always before the anchor. If the block can be after the anchor, the rule needs generalization (e.g., using absolute distance or signed distance relative to the anchor). Based on the examples, the block is always before the anchor.
5.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_block_start_index`) for the colored block in the output grid: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + d`.
6.  Calculate the new ending index (`new_block_end_index`) for the colored block: `new_block_end_index = new_block_start_index + block_length - 1`.
7.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from `new_block_start_index` to `new_block_end_index` with the `block_color`.
8.  Ensure the maroon (9) pixel remains at `anchor_index` in the output grid (it should be preserved from the initial copy unless overwritten by step 7, which shouldn't happen based on the reflection logic).
9.  The output grid now represents the transformed input.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
Okay, let's analyze the situation. The core logic described in the initial "Perception" seems sound and matches the examples visually: a colored block is reflected across a maroon anchor pixel. However, the provided code fails on all examples with a NumPy-specific error related to boolean ambiguity. This suggests either a flaw in the implementation of the logic (particularly how array indices or conditions are handled) or an unexpected edge case in the data that the code doesn't cover correctly.

**Assessment and Strategy:**

1.  **Error Source:** The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly points to a place in the code where a NumPy array is being used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if numpy_array:`). Given the manual trace seemed correct, this might be happening in an edge case handler within the `_find_colored_block` function, possibly the logic dealing with blocks ending at the array boundary, or less likely, during the array slicing/assignment if indices somehow become arrays.
2.  **Verification:** The immediate next step is to verify the intermediate calculations (anchor position, block boundaries, calculated distance, new block position) for each training example using the existing helper functions (`_find_anchor`, `_find_colored_block`) and the core transformation math. This will confirm if the helper functions are correct and if the calculated transformation matches the expected output geometry.
3.  **Refinement:** If the intermediate calculations are correct, the error likely lies in the grid manipulation part of the `transform` function or a subtle bug in the `_find_colored_block` logic under specific conditions (like a 1-pixel block or a block at the very end). We will use the metrics gathered to refine the understanding and the code. If the calculations are *incorrect*, the core logic or the helper functions need revision.

**Gathering Metrics:**

Let's extract the key parameters for each training example.

**Metrics Analysis:**

The metrics calculation ran successfully using a slightly revised (and simpler) `_find_colored_block` function. Crucially, the calculated `new_start` and `new_end` positions perfectly match the actual positions observed in the output examples (`Match: True` for all).

This confirms:
1.  The core logic (reflection based on distance between block end and anchor) is correct.
2.  The helper functions (`_find_anchor` and the revised `_find_colored_block`) correctly identify the objects and their properties.
3.  The calculation `new_start = anchor_index + (anchor_index - block_end_index)` correctly determines the output position.

Conclusion: Since the logic and calculations are verified, the NumPy error reported previously must stem from the original implementation of `_find_colored_block` (specifically the end-of-row handling which was removed/simplified in the version used for metrics) or potentially from an interaction within the `transform` function not captured by the separate metrics check (though less likely now). The simpler `_find_colored_block` used for metrics is likely more robust.

**Updated Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x28)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor_Pixel
    Color: maroon (9)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: Static (remains unchanged between input and output)
    Role: Acts as a reflection point/anchor.
  - Type: Colored_Block
    Color: One unique color (non-white, non-maroon) per grid
    Quantity: 1
    Property: Contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    Action: Its position changes based on reflection across the Anchor_Pixel.
    Original_Position: Becomes white (0) in the output.

Transformation:
  Name: Reflection across Anchor
  Input: Grid containing one Anchor_Pixel and one Colored_Block.
  Output: Grid of the same dimensions.
  Rule:
    1. Identify the index (`anchor_index`) of the Anchor_Pixel (maroon).
    2. Identify the color (`block_color`), start index (`block_start_index`), end index (`block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`) of the Colored_Block. Assume only one such block exists.
    3. Calculate the distance (`d`) from the end of the block to the anchor: `d = anchor_index - block_end_index`. (Note: This specific calculation assumes the block is always *before* the anchor, which holds true for all examples).
    4. Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + d`.
    5. The block retains its `block_color` and `block_length`.
    6. Create an output grid initialized with the background color (white).
    7. Place the Anchor_Pixel at `anchor_index` in the output grid.
    8. Place the Colored_Block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) starting at `new_block_start_index` in the output grid.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid (a single row of pixels). Note its width.
2.  Find the index (`anchor_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel.
3.  Find the first contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), and ending index (`block_end_index`). Calculate its length (`block_length = block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).
4.  Calculate the positional offset (`distance`) between the anchor and the end of the block: `distance = anchor_index - block_end_index`.
5.  Determine the new starting index (`new_block_start_index`) for the block in the output grid by adding the offset to the anchor's index: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + distance`.
6.  Create a new grid (output grid) of the same width as the input, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
7.  Place the maroon (9) pixel at `anchor_index` in the output grid.
8.  Fill the segment of the output grid starting at `new_block_start_index` for `block_length` pixels with the `block_color`. Ensure this placement occurs within the grid boundaries.
9.  The resulting grid is the final output.
