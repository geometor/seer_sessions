Okay, let's analyze the situation. The core logic described in the initial "Perception" seems sound and matches the examples visually: a colored block is reflected across a maroon anchor pixel. However, the provided code fails on all examples with a NumPy-specific error related to boolean ambiguity. This suggests either a flaw in the implementation of the logic (particularly how array indices or conditions are handled) or an unexpected edge case in the data that the code doesn't cover correctly.

**Assessment and Strategy:**

1.  **Error Source:** The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly points to a place in the code where a NumPy array is being used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if numpy_array:`). Given the manual trace seemed correct, this might be happening in an edge case handler within the `_find_colored_block` function, possibly the logic dealing with blocks ending at the array boundary, or less likely, during the array slicing/assignment if indices somehow become arrays.
2.  **Verification:** The immediate next step is to verify the intermediate calculations (anchor position, block boundaries, calculated distance, new block position) for each training example using the existing helper functions (`_find_anchor`, `_find_colored_block`) and the core transformation math. This will confirm if the helper functions are correct and if the calculated transformation matches the expected output geometry.
3.  **Refinement:** If the intermediate calculations are correct, the error likely lies in the grid manipulation part of the `transform` function or a subtle bug in the `_find_colored_block` logic under specific conditions (like a 1-pixel block or a block at the very end). We will use the metrics gathered to refine the understanding and the code. If the calculations are *incorrect*, the core logic or the helper functions need revision.

**Gathering Metrics:**

Let's extract the key parameters for each training example.

    anchor_indices = np.where(row == 9)[0]
    if len(anchor_indices) == 1:
        return anchor_indices[0]
    return None

def _find_colored_block(row: np.ndarray) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    """Finds the colored block (non-white, non-maroon)."""
    block_color = -1
    block_start_index = -1
    block_end_index = -1

    # Find the start and color of the first block
    for i, pixel in enumerate(row):
        if pixel != 0 and pixel != 9:
            block_color = pixel
            block_start_index = i
            break # Found the start of the first block

    if block_start_index == -1:
        return None # No block found

    # Find the end of this specific block
    block_end_index = block_start_index
    for i in range(block_start_index + 1, len(row)):
        if row[i] == block_color:
            block_end_index = i
        else:
            break # Block ended

    block_length = block_end_index - block_start_index + 1
    return block_color, block_start_index, block_end_index, block_length

**Metrics Analysis:**

The metrics calculation ran successfully using a slightly revised (and simpler) `_find_colored_block` function. Crucially, the calculated `new_start` and `new_end` positions perfectly match the actual positions observed in the output examples (`Match: True` for all).

This confirms:
1.  The core logic (reflection based on distance between block end and anchor) is correct.
2.  The helper functions (`_find_anchor` and the revised `_find_colored_block`) correctly identify the objects and their properties.
3.  The calculation `new_start = anchor_index + (anchor_index - block_end_index)` correctly determines the output position.

Conclusion: Since the logic and calculations are verified, the NumPy error reported previously must stem from the original implementation of `_find_colored_block` (specifically the end-of-row handling which was removed/simplified in the version used for metrics) or potentially from an interaction within the `transform` function not captured by the separate metrics check (though less likely now). The simpler `_find_colored_block` used for metrics is likely more robust.

**Updated Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x28)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor_Pixel
    Color: maroon (9)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: Static (remains unchanged between input and output)
    Role: Acts as a reflection point/anchor.
  - Type: Colored_Block
    Color: One unique color (non-white, non-maroon) per grid
    Quantity: 1
    Property: Contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    Action: Its position changes based on reflection across the Anchor_Pixel.
    Original_Position: Becomes white (0) in the output.

Transformation:
  Name: Reflection across Anchor
  Input: Grid containing one Anchor_Pixel and one Colored_Block.
  Output: Grid of the same dimensions.
  Rule:
    1. Identify the index (`anchor_index`) of the Anchor_Pixel (maroon).
    2. Identify the color (`block_color`), start index (`block_start_index`), end index (`block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`) of the Colored_Block. Assume only one such block exists.
    3. Calculate the distance (`d`) from the end of the block to the anchor: `d = anchor_index - block_end_index`. (Note: This specific calculation assumes the block is always *before* the anchor, which holds true for all examples).
    4. Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + d`.
    5. The block retains its `block_color` and `block_length`.
    6. Create an output grid initialized with the background color (white).
    7. Place the Anchor_Pixel at `anchor_index` in the output grid.
    8. Place the Colored_Block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) starting at `new_block_start_index` in the output grid.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid (a single row of pixels). Note its width.
2.  Find the index (`anchor_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel.
3.  Find the first contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), and ending index (`block_end_index`). Calculate its length (`block_length = block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).
4.  Calculate the positional offset (`distance`) between the anchor and the end of the block: `distance = anchor_index - block_end_index`.
5.  Determine the new starting index (`new_block_start_index`) for the block in the output grid by adding the offset to the anchor's index: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + distance`.
6.  Create a new grid (output grid) of the same width as the input, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
7.  Place the maroon (9) pixel at `anchor_index` in the output grid.
8.  Fill the segment of the output grid starting at `new_block_start_index` for `block_length` pixels with the `block_color`. Ensure this placement occurs within the grid boundaries.
9.  The resulting grid is the final output.
