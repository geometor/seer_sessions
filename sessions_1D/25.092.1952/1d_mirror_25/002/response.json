            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. The core logic described in the initial \"Perception\" seems sound and matches the examples visually: a colored block is reflected across a maroon anchor pixel. However, the provided code fails on all examples with a NumPy-specific error related to boolean ambiguity. This suggests either a flaw in the implementation of the logic (particularly how array indices or conditions are handled) or an unexpected edge case in the data that the code doesn't cover correctly.\n\n**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Error Source:** The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly points to a place in the code where a NumPy array is being used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if numpy_array:`). Given the manual trace seemed correct, this might be happening in an edge case handler within the `_find_colored_block` function, possibly the logic dealing with blocks ending at the array boundary, or less likely, during the array slicing/assignment if indices somehow become arrays.\n2.  **Verification:** The immediate next step is to verify the intermediate calculations (anchor position, block boundaries, calculated distance, new block position) for each training example using the existing helper functions (`_find_anchor`, `_find_colored_block`) and the core transformation math. This will confirm if the helper functions are correct and if the calculated transformation matches the expected output geometry.\n3.  **Refinement:** If the intermediate calculations are correct, the error likely lies in the grid manipulation part of the `transform` function or a subtle bug in the `_find_colored_block` logic under specific conditions (like a 1-pixel block or a block at the very end). We will use the metrics gathered to refine the understanding and the code. If the calculations are *incorrect*, the core logic or the helper functions need revision.\n\n**Gathering Metrics:**\n\nLet's extract the key parameters for each training example.\n"

Crucially, the calculated `new_start` and `new_end` positions perfectly match the actual positions observed in the output examples (`Match: True` for all).\n\nThis confirms:\n1.  The core logic (reflection based on distance between block end and anchor) is correct.\n2.  The helper functions (`_find_anchor` and the revised `_find_colored_block`) correctly identify the objects and their properties.\n3.  The calculation `new_start = anchor_index + (anchor_index - block_end_index)` correctly determines the output position.\n\nConclusion: Since the logic and calculations are verified, the NumPy error reported previously must stem from the original implementation of `_find_colored_block` (specifically the end-of-row handling which was removed/simplified in the version used for metrics) or potentially from an interaction within the `transform` function not captured by the separate metrics check (though less likely now). The simpler `_find_colored_block` used for metrics is likely more robust.\n\n**Updated Facts:**\n\n"
