"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on a reflection rule around a maroon anchor pixel.

1.  Identifies a single maroon (9) pixel (anchor) and a single contiguous block of another color (non-white, non-maroon).
2.  Calculates the distance relationship between the end of the colored block and the anchor pixel.
3.  Reflects the colored block across the anchor pixel. The new starting position of the block is determined by adding the distance (anchor_index - block_end_index) to the anchor index.
4.  The original position of the colored block becomes white (0).
5.  The anchor pixel and all other white pixels remain unchanged.
