**Perception:**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel and one contiguous block of pixels of another single color (e.g., green, red, gray), with the remaining pixels being white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.

The transformation involves repositioning the colored block based on the location of the maroon pixel. The maroon pixel itself remains stationary. The colored block appears to be "reflected" or "mirrored" across the maroon pixel. The distance between the end of the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input is preserved as the distance between the maroon pixel and the start of the colored block in the output. The original location occupied by the colored block becomes white (0) in the output. All other white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x28)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor_Pixel
    Color: maroon (9)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: Static (remains unchanged)
    Role: Acts as a reflection point/anchor.
  - Type: Colored_Block
    Color: Any non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., green, red, gray)
    Quantity: 1
    Property: Contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    Action: Moves position based on reflection across the Anchor_Pixel.
    Original_Position: Becomes white (0) in the output.

Transformation:
  Action: Reflection / Mirroring
  Reference_Point: The Anchor_Pixel (maroon).
  Rule:
    1. Identify the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) and the Colored_Block.
    2. Calculate the distance (d) between the end index of the Colored_Block and the index of the Anchor_Pixel in the input.
    3. Determine the new starting index for the Colored_Block in the output by adding the distance (d) to the index of the Anchor_Pixel.
    4. The length and color of the Colored_Block remain the same.
    5. Place the Colored_Block at its new position in the output grid.
    6. Set the original position of the Colored_Block to white (0) in the output grid.
    7. Keep the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) in its original position.
    8. Keep all other white (0) pixels in their original positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, initially setting all pixels corresponding to the colored block in the input to white (0).
2.  Find the index (`anchor_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid.
3.  Find the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the `colored_block`). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), ending index (`block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`).
4.  Calculate the distance (`d`) between the `block_end_index` and the `anchor_index`. (`d = anchor_index - block_end_index`). Note: This assumes the block is always before the anchor. If the block can be after the anchor, the rule needs generalization (e.g., using absolute distance or signed distance relative to the anchor). Based on the examples, the block is always before the anchor.
5.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_block_start_index`) for the colored block in the output grid: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + d`.
6.  Calculate the new ending index (`new_block_end_index`) for the colored block: `new_block_end_index = new_block_start_index + block_length - 1`.
7.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from `new_block_start_index` to `new_block_end_index` with the `block_color`.
8.  Ensure the maroon (9) pixel remains at `anchor_index` in the output grid (it should be preserved from the initial copy unless overwritten by step 7, which shouldn't happen based on the reflection logic).
9.  The output grid now represents the transformed input.

Transforms a 1D input grid based on a reflection rule around a maroon anchor pixel.

1.  Identifies a single maroon (9) pixel (anchor) and a single contiguous block of another color (non-white, non-maroon).
2.  Calculates the distance relationship between the end of the colored block and the anchor pixel.
3.  Reflects the colored block across the anchor pixel. The new starting position of the block is determined by adding the distance (anchor_index - block_end_index) to the anchor index.
4.  The original position of the colored block becomes white (0).
5.  The anchor pixel and all other white pixels remain unchanged.
