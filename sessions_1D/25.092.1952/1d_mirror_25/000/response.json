Each input grid contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel and one contiguous block of pixels of another single color (e.g., green, red, gray), with the remaining pixels being white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.\n\nThe transformation involves repositioning the colored block based on the location of the maroon pixel. The maroon pixel itself remains stationary. The colored block appears to be \"reflected\" or \"mirrored\" across the maroon pixel. The distance between the end of the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input is preserved as the distance between the maroon pixel and the start of the colored block in the output. The original location occupied by the colored block becomes white (0) in the output. All other white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, initially setting all pixels corresponding to the colored block in the input to white (0).\n2.  Find the index (`anchor_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid.\n3.  Find the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the `colored_block`). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), ending index (`block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`).\n4.  Calculate the distance (`d`) between the `block_end_index` and the `anchor_index`. (`d = anchor_index - block_end_index`). Note: This assumes the block is always before the anchor. If the block can be after the anchor, the rule needs generalization (e.g., using absolute distance or signed distance relative to the anchor). Based on the examples, the block is always before the anchor.\n5.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_block_start_index`) for the colored block in the output grid: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + d`.\n6.  Calculate the new ending index (`new_block_end_index`) for the colored block: `new_block_end_index = new_block_start_index + block_length - 1`.\n7.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from `new_block_start_index` to `new_block_end_index` with the `block_color`.\n8.  Ensure the maroon (9) pixel remains at `anchor_index` in the output grid (it should be preserved from the initial copy unless overwritten by step 7, which shouldn't happen based on the reflection logic).\n9.  The output grid now represents the transformed input."
