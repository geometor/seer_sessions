Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x28)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor_Pixel
    Color: maroon (9)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: Static (remains unchanged)
    Role: Acts as a reflection point/anchor.
  - Type: Colored_Block
    Color: Any non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., green, red, gray)
    Quantity: 1
    Property: Contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    Action: Moves position based on reflection across the Anchor_Pixel.
    Original_Position: Becomes white (0) in the output.

Transformation:
  Action: Reflection / Mirroring
  Reference_Point: The Anchor_Pixel (maroon).
  Rule:
    1. Identify the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) and the Colored_Block.
    2. Calculate the distance (d) between the end index of the Colored_Block and the index of the Anchor_Pixel in the input.
    3. Determine the new starting index for the Colored_Block in the output by adding the distance (d) to the index of the Anchor_Pixel.
    4. The length and color of the Colored_Block remain the same.
    5. Place the Colored_Block at its new position in the output grid.
    6. Set the original position of the Colored_Block to white (0) in the output grid.
    7. Keep the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) in its original position.
    8. Keep all other white (0) pixels in their original positions.
