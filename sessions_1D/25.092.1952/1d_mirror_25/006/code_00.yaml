Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row represented as List[List[int]]).
  Dimensions: Width varies, height is always 1. Stays constant between input/output.
  Background_Color: white (0).

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor_Pixel
    Exists_In: Input and Output.
    Color: maroon (9).
    Quantity: Exactly 1 per grid.
    Position: Defined by its index (`anchor_index`). Remains unchanged between input and output.
    Role: Acts as the point of reflection for the Colored_Block.

  - Type: Colored_Block
    Exists_In: Input and Output (but at different locations).
    Color: Any single color that is not white (0) or maroon (9). Varies between examples.
    Quantity: Exactly 1 per grid.
    Shape: Contiguous horizontal block (run of pixels).
    Properties:
      Color (`block_color`): Preserved between input and output.
      Length (`block_length`): Preserved between input and output.
      Input_Start_Index (`input_block_start_index`): Location in the input grid.
      Input_End_Index (`input_block_end_index`): Location in the input grid.
      Output_Start_Index (`output_block_start_index`): Location in the output grid.
      Output_End_Index (`output_block_end_index`): Location in the output grid.
    Position_Rule: Defined by reflection across the Anchor_Pixel.

Transformation:
  Name: Reflection_Across_Anchor
  Input: Input grid with one Anchor_Pixel and one Colored_Block.
  Output: Output grid of the same dimensions.
  Steps:
    1. Identify the `anchor_index`.
    2. Identify the `block_color`, `input_block_start_index`, `input_block_end_index`, and `block_length` of the Colored_Block in the input.
    3. Calculate the distance offset: `distance = anchor_index - input_block_end_index`. (Implicit assumption: block is always to the left of the anchor).
    4. Calculate the `output_block_start_index = anchor_index + distance`.
    5. Create the output grid, initially filled with white (0).
    6. Place the Anchor_Pixel at `anchor_index` in the output grid.
    7. Place the Colored_Block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) starting at `output_block_start_index` in the output grid. Ensure placement respects grid boundaries.
    8. The location originally occupied by the Colored_Block in the input remains white (0) in the output grid (achieved by starting with a white grid).
