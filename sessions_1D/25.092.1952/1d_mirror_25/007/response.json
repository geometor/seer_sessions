Initializes a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the white (0) background color.\n2.  Locates the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid and records its index (`anchor_index`). Places a maroon (9) pixel at this same `anchor_index` in the output grid.\n3.  Locates the single contiguous block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels in the input grid. Records its color (`block_color`), ending index (`input_block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`).\n4.  Calculates the spatial offset between the end of the input block and the anchor: `distance = anchor_index - input_block_end_index`.\n5.  Calculates the starting index for the block in the output grid: `output_block_start_index = anchor_index + distance`.\n6.  Calculates the ending index for the block in the output grid: `output_block_end_index = output_block_start_index + block_length - 1`.\n7.  Fills the pixels in the output grid from `output_block_start_index` to `output_block_end_index` (inclusive) with the `block_color`, making sure the indices stay within the grid boundaries.\n8.  Returns the completed output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_anchor(row: np.ndarray) -> Optional[int]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the single maroon (9) pixel.\"\"\"\n    anchor_indices = np.where(row == 9)[0]\n    # Expect exactly one anchor\n    if len(anchor_indices) == 1:\n        # Use .item() to convert numpy int to standard python int\n        return anchor_indices[0].item()\n    return None # Return None if zero or more than one anchor found\n\ndef _find_colored_block(row: np.ndarray) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the single contiguous block of a color that is not white (0) or maroon (9).\n    Returns: Tuple (block_color, block_start_index, block_end_index, block_length) or None if no single valid block found.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_color = -1\n    block_start_index = -1\n    block_end_index = -1\n    width = len(row)\n    found_block = False\n\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(row):\n        # Look for the start of a potential block\n        pixel_val = pixel.item() # Ensure standard python int for comparisons\n        if pixel_val != 0 and pixel_val != 9:\n            # Found a non-white, non-maroon pixel\n            if not found_block:\n                # This is the start of the first potential block\n                block_color = pixel_val # Store color\n                block_start_index = i\n                block_end_index = i # Assume length 1 initially\n                found_block = True\n            elif pixel_val == block_color:\n                 # Continue the current block\n                 block_end_index = i\n            else:\n                 # Found a different color - indicates more than one block or noise\n                 # According to the analysis, only one block is expected.\n                 return None # Problem structure violation\n        elif found_block:\n            # We were in a block, but now hit 0 or 9, so the block ends here.\n            break # Exit loop once the block ends\n\n    # Check if a valid block was found\n    if found_block:\n        block_length = block_end_index - block_start_index + 1\n        # Verify only one block: Scan the rest of the array for other colored pixels\n        # This check is important if the problem allows for noise pixels\n        for i in range(block_end_index + 1, width):\n             if row[i].item() != 0 and row[i].item() != 9:\n                 return None # Found another colored pixel after the block ended\n        return block_color, block_start_index, block_end_index, block_length\n    else:\n        # No block start was ever found\n        return None\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the reflection transformation to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Input Validation and Conversion ---\n    # Check if input_grid is a list and contains at least one row (list)\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or len(input_grid) == 0 or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):\n        return input_grid # Return input if format is invalid\n    if len(input_grid[0]) == 0: # Handle empty row case\n        return input_grid\n\n    # Convert the first row (assuming 1D structure) to a NumPy array\n    try:\n        input_row = np.array(input_grid[0], dtype=int)\n    except ValueError:\n        return input_grid # Return input if conversion fails (e.g., non-integers)\n\n    width = len(input_row)\n\n    # --- Find Key Elements ---\n    # Find the maroon anchor pixel's index\n    anchor_index = _find_anchor(input_row)\n    # Find the properties of the colored block\n    block_info = _find_colored_block(input_row)\n\n    # --- Pre-computation Checks ---\n    # If anchor or block is missing or invalid (e.g., multiple blocks),\n    # the specific transformation rule cannot be applied.
