**Perception:**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel and one contiguous block of pixels of another single color (e.g., green, red, gray), with the remaining pixels being white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.

The transformation involves repositioning the colored block based on the location of the maroon pixel. The maroon pixel itself remains stationary. The colored block appears to be "reflected" or "mirrored" across the maroon pixel. The distance between the end of the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input is preserved as the distance between the maroon pixel and the start of the colored block in the output. The original location occupied by the colored block becomes white (0) in the output. All other white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x28)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor_Pixel
    Color: maroon (9)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: Static (remains unchanged)
    Role: Acts as a reflection point/anchor.
  - Type: Colored_Block
    Color: Any non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., green, red, gray)
    Quantity: 1
    Property: Contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    Action: Moves position based on reflection across the Anchor_Pixel.
    Original_Position: Becomes white (0) in the output.

Transformation:
  Action: Reflection / Mirroring
  Reference_Point: The Anchor_Pixel (maroon).
  Rule:
    1. Identify the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) and the Colored_Block.
    2. Calculate the distance (d) between the end index of the Colored_Block and the index of the Anchor_Pixel in the input.
    3. Determine the new starting index for the Colored_Block in the output by adding the distance (d) to the index of the Anchor_Pixel.
    4. The length and color of the Colored_Block remain the same.
    5. Place the Colored_Block at its new position in the output grid.
    6. Set the original position of the Colored_Block to white (0) in the output grid.
    7. Keep the Anchor_Pixel (maroon) in its original position.
    8. Keep all other white (0) pixels in their original positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, initially setting all pixels corresponding to the colored block in the input to white (0).
2.  Find the index (`anchor_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid.
3.  Find the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the `colored_block`). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), ending index (`block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`).
4.  Calculate the distance (`d`) between the `block_end_index` and the `anchor_index`. (`d = anchor_index - block_end_index`). Note: This assumes the block is always before the anchor. If the block can be after the anchor, the rule needs generalization (e.g., using absolute distance or signed distance relative to the anchor). Based on the examples, the block is always before the anchor.
5.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_block_start_index`) for the colored block in the output grid: `new_block_start_index = anchor_index + d`.
6.  Calculate the new ending index (`new_block_end_index`) for the colored block: `new_block_end_index = new_block_start_index + block_length - 1`.
7.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from `new_block_start_index` to `new_block_end_index` with the `block_color`.
8.  Ensure the maroon (9) pixel remains at `anchor_index` in the output grid (it should be preserved from the initial copy unless overwritten by step 7, which shouldn't happen based on the reflection logic).
9.  The output grid now represents the transformed input.

Transforms a 1D input grid based on a reflection rule around a maroon anchor pixel.

1.  Identifies a single maroon (9) pixel (anchor) and a single contiguous block of another color (non-white, non-maroon).
2.  Calculates the distance relationship between the end of the colored block and the anchor pixel.
3.  Reflects the colored block across the anchor pixel. The new starting position of the block is determined by adding the distance (anchor_index - block_end_index) to the anchor index.
4.  The original position of the colored block becomes white (0).
5.  The anchor pixel and all other white pixels remain unchanged.

**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation: reflecting a colored block across a maroon anchor pixel in a 1D grid. The distance calculation (`new_start = anchor_index + (anchor_index - block_end_index)`) appears consistent across all training examples. The provided code implements this logic.

However, the execution results indicate that the code produced output nearly identical to the input, failing to perform the reflection and clearing the original block position. This contradicts the code's explicit logic (initializing output with zeros, placing the anchor, calculating the new position, and placing the block there). This discrepancy suggests either:
1.  A subtle bug in the code's implementation (perhaps in finding the block, handling indices, or array manipulation) that wasn't apparent in the manual trace.
2.  An issue with the execution environment or the reporting of the results in the previous step.

Given that the logic seems sound and matches the examples, the strategy is to:
1.  Re-verify the key parameters (indices, distances) for each example using code execution.
2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be precise based on this verified understanding.
3.  Assume the core logic is correct and the previous code's failure might stem from a subtle implementation error or an external issue. The next step (coding phase) will need to be meticulous in implementing the verified logic.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row represented as List[List[int]]).
  Dimensions: Width varies, height is always 1. Stays constant between input/output.
  Background_Color: white (0).

Objects:
  - Type: Anchor_Pixel
    Exists_In: Input and Output.
    Color: maroon (9).
    Quantity: Exactly 1 per grid.
    Position: Defined by its index (`anchor_index`). Remains unchanged between input and output.
    Role: Acts as the point of reflection for the Colored_Block.

  - Type: Colored_Block
    Exists_In: Input and Output (but at different locations).
    Color: Any single color that is not white (0) or maroon (9). Varies between examples.
    Quantity: Exactly 1 per grid.
    Shape: Contiguous horizontal block (run of pixels).
    Properties:
      Color (`block_color`): Preserved between input and output.
      Length (`block_length`): Preserved between input and output.
      Input_Start_Index (`input_block_start_index`): Location in the input grid.
      Input_End_Index (`input_block_end_index`): Location in the input grid.
      Output_Start_Index (`output_block_start_index`): Location in the output grid.
      Output_End_Index (`output_block_end_index`): Location in the output grid.
    Position_Rule: Defined by reflection across the Anchor_Pixel.

Transformation:
  Name: Reflection_Across_Anchor
  Input: Input grid with one Anchor_Pixel and one Colored_Block.
  Output: Output grid of the same dimensions.
  Steps:
    1. Identify the `anchor_index`.
    2. Identify the `block_color`, `input_block_start_index`, `input_block_end_index`, and `block_length` of the Colored_Block in the input.
    3. Calculate the distance offset: `distance = anchor_index - input_block_end_index`. (Implicit assumption: block is always to the left of the anchor).
    4. Calculate the `output_block_start_index = anchor_index + distance`.
    5. Create the output grid, initially filled with white (0).
    6. Place the Anchor_Pixel at `anchor_index` in the output grid.
    7. Place the Colored_Block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) starting at `output_block_start_index` in the output grid. Ensure placement respects grid boundaries.
    8. The location originally occupied by the Colored_Block in the input remains white (0) in the output grid (achieved by starting with a white grid).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the white (0) background color.
2.  Locate the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid and record its index (`anchor_index`). Place a maroon (9) pixel at this same `anchor_index` in the output grid.
3.  Locate the single contiguous block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels in the input grid. Record its color (`block_color`), ending index (`input_block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`).
4.  Calculate the spatial offset between the end of the input block and the anchor: `distance = anchor_index - input_block_end_index`.
5.  Calculate the starting index for the block in the output grid: `output_block_start_index = anchor_index + distance`.
6.  Calculate the ending index for the block in the output grid: `output_block_end_index = output_block_start_index + block_length - 1`.
7.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from `output_block_start_index` to `output_block_end_index` (inclusive) with the `block_color`, making sure the indices stay within the grid boundaries.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
