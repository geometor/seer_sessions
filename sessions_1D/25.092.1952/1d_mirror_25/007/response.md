"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by reflecting a colored block across a maroon anchor pixel.

1.  Initializes a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the white (0) background color.
2.  Locates the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid and records its index (`anchor_index`). Places a maroon (9) pixel at this same `anchor_index` in the output grid.
3.  Locates the single contiguous block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels in the input grid. Records its color (`block_color`), ending index (`input_block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`).
4.  Calculates the spatial offset between the end of the input block and the anchor: `distance = anchor_index - input_block_end_index`.
5.  Calculates the starting index for the block in the output grid: `output_block_start_index = anchor_index + distance`.
6.  Calculates the ending index for the block in the output grid: `output_block_end_index = output_block_start_index + block_length - 1`.
7.  Fills the pixels in the output grid from `output_block_start_index` to `output_block_end_index` (inclusive) with the `block_color`, making sure the indices stay within the grid boundaries.
8.  Returns the completed output grid.
