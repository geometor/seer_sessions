task_description: Reflect a horizontal colored block across a fixed maroon pivot pixel.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)
  width: 17 (based on examples)
  height: 1 (based on examples)

objects:
  - id: pivot
    color: 9 (maroon)
    shape: single pixel
    role: stationary reference point for reflection
  - id: block
    color: any non-zero, non-maroon color (e.g., 2, 3, 7)
    shape: horizontal contiguous block
    properties:
      length: 4 pixels (based on examples)
    role: object to be moved

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entities: [pivot, block]
    details: The block is located at some horizontal distance from the pivot in the input grid.

actions:
  - name: identify_pivot
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [pivot_location, pivot_color]
    description: Find the location (column index) and color of the single maroon pixel.
  - name: identify_block
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [block_location, block_color, block_length]
    description: Find the start and end column indices, color, and length of the contiguous non-white, non-maroon block.
  - name: reflect_block
    inputs: [pivot_location, block_location, block_length]
    outputs: [new_block_location]
    description: Calculate the new start and end column indices for the block by reflecting its input position across the pivot's column index. The distance from the pivot to the start/end of the block is mirrored.
  - name: construct_output
    inputs: [grid_properties, pivot_location, pivot_color, new_block_location, block_color]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color. Place the pivot pixel at its original location. Place the colored block at its new, reflected location.

transformation_rule:
  summary: The horizontal colored block is reflected across the vertical axis defined by the stationary maroon pivot pixel.
  steps:
    1. Initialize the output grid with the background color (white).
    2. Locate the maroon (9) pivot pixel in the input grid. Copy it to the same position in the output grid.
    3. Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels in the input grid (identify its color, start column, and end column).
    4. Calculate the reflection point (column index of the pivot pixel).
    5. Determine the new start and end column indices for the block in the output grid by reflecting the original block's position across the pivot column. Specifically, the distance from the pivot to the start of the new block equals the distance from the end of the old block to the pivot, and the distance from the pivot to the end of the new block equals the distance from the start of the old block to the pivot.
    6. Fill the calculated new block location in the output grid with the block's color.
