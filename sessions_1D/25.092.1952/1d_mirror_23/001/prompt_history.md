Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples seem to represent 1-dimensional arrays or single-row grids. Based on the length (17 elements), the grids are likely 1x17.
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background. Each input grid contains two significant elements:
    *   A single maroon pixel (9).
    *   A contiguous horizontal block of four pixels of another color (red (2), green (3), or orange (7) in the examples).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the colored block while keeping the maroon pixel stationary.
    *   The maroon pixel (9) acts as a fixed point or a pivot. Its position remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   The colored block (red, green, or orange) changes its position.
    *   The original location of the colored block becomes white (0) in the output.
    *   The movement appears to be a reflection across the vertical axis defined by the maroon pixel's column. The distance from the pivot to the start/end of the block in the input seems mirrored in the output.

    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color. Place the pivot pixel at its original location. Place the colored block at its new, reflected location.

transformation_rule:
  summary: The horizontal colored block is reflected across the vertical axis defined by the stationary maroon pivot pixel.
  steps:
    1. Initialize the output grid with the background color (white).
    2. Locate the maroon (9) pivot pixel in the input grid. Copy it to the same position in the output grid.
    3. Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels in the input grid (identify its color, start column, and end column).
    4. Calculate the reflection point (column index of the pivot pixel).
    5. Determine the new start and end column indices for the block in the output grid by reflecting the original block's position across the pivot column. Specifically, the distance from the pivot to the start of the new block equals the distance from the end of the old block to the pivot, and the distance from the pivot to the end of the new block equals the distance from the start of the old block to the pivot.
    6. Fill the calculated new block location in the output grid with the block's color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Find the column index of the single maroon pixel (color 9) in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_col`.
3.  Place the maroon pixel (color 9) at `pivot_col` in the output grid.
4.  Find the contiguous horizontal block of pixels in the input grid that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), its starting column index (`start_col`), and its ending column index (`end_col`).
5.  Calculate the starting column index for the block in the output grid: `new_start_col = pivot_col + (pivot_col - end_col)`.
6.  Calculate the ending column index for the block in the output grid: `new_end_col = pivot_col + (pivot_col - start_col)`.
7.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from `new_start_col` to `new_end_col` (inclusive) with `block_color`.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
