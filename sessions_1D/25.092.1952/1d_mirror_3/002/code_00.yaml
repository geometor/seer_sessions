task_description: Rearranges elements in a 1D array relative to a fixed pivot point.
elements:
  - type: pivot
    color: 9 # maroon
    count: 1
    description: A single maroon pixel. Its index remains constant between input and output.
  - type: colored_object
    color: any_except_0_and_9 # e.g., 1 (blue), 7 (orange)
    shape: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    description: A single contiguous block of a uniform color other than white or maroon. Its content and length are preserved.
  - type: separator
    color: 0 # white
    shape: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    description: A block of one or more white pixels located directly between the pivot and the colored_object in the input. Its content (all 0s) and length are preserved.
  - type: background
    color: 0 # white
    description: All other white pixels in the array not part of the separator.
properties:
  - array_length: conserved
  - element_content_and_length:
      - pivot: conserved (value 9, count 1)
      - colored_object: conserved (color, length, contiguity)
      - separator: conserved (value 0, length)
  - element_position:
      - pivot: conserved (index remains the same)
      - separator: changes (moved immediately to the right of the pivot in the output)
      - colored_object: changes (moved immediately to the right of the separator in the output)
relationships:
  - spatial:
      - input: [background?] [object | pivot] [separator] [pivot | object] [background?] # Order of object/pivot varies
      - output: [background_prefix] [pivot] [separator] [colored_object] [background_suffix] # Fixed relative order
actions:
  - identify: Locate the index of the pivot (9).
  - identify: Locate the start and end indices of the contiguous colored_object (non-0, non-9 block). Extract its content.
  - identify: Determine the indices between the pivot and colored_object. Extract the separator block (0s) from these indices.
  - construct: Create a new array of the same length, filled with white (0).
  - place: Put the pivot (9) into the new array at its original index.
  - place: Put the separator block into the new array starting at the index immediately after the pivot index.
  - place: Put the colored_object block into the new array starting at the index immediately after the separator block.
