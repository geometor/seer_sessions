task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array based on a pivot color (maroon 9).
elements:
  - type: pivot
    color: 9 # maroon
    count: 1
    description: A single maroon pixel acting as a reference point.
  - type: colored_object
    color: any_except_0_and_9 # e.g., 1 (blue), 7 (orange)
    shape: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    description: A single contiguous block of a color other than white or maroon.
  - type: separator
    color: 0 # white
    shape: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    description: A block of white pixels located between the pivot and the colored_object in the input. Its length can vary.
  - type: padding
    color: 0 # white
    shape: contiguous_block
    count: variable # Can be zero, one, or two blocks depending on input structure
    description: White pixels filling the space not occupied by the pivot, colored_object, and separator.
properties:
  - array_length: conserved # Input and output arrays have the same total length.
  - element_counts:
      - pivot: conserved (always 1)
      - colored_object: conserved (always 1 block, length conserved)
      - separator: conserved (length conserved)
      - white_pixels: conserved (total number of white pixels remains the same)
relationships:
  - spatial:
      - input: The separator block is always located between the pivot and the colored_object. The colored_object can be to the left or right of the pivot.
      - output: The elements are rearranged into a fixed relative order: [padding_zeros_start] [pivot] [separator] [colored_object] [padding_zeros_end].
actions:
  - identify: Locate the pivot (9), the colored_object (non-0, non-9 block), and the separator (0s between pivot and object).
  - rearrange: Reconstruct the array by placing the pivot, separator, and colored_object in a specific sequence.
  - redistribute_padding: Place the remaining white pixels (padding) around the core sequence (pivot, separator, object) to maintain the original array length.
