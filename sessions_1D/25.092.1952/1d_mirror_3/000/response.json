There is also one contiguous block of another color (blue `1` or orange `7` in the examples).\n3.  **Structure:** Each input array consists of:\n    *   A single maroon (`9`) pixel.\n    *   A single contiguous block of a color other than white (`0`) or maroon (`9`). Let's call this the \"colored object\".\n    *   Blocks of white (`0`) pixels. One specific block of white pixels acts as a separator between the maroon pixel and the colored object. The remaining white pixels act as padding at the beginning and/or end.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation rearranges these elements. The maroon (`9`) pixel seems to act as a pivot point. The colored object moves relative to the maroon pixel. Specifically, in the output, the maroon pixel always appears first (relative to the colored object), followed by the separator block of white pixels, followed by the colored object. The remaining white pixels fill the rest of the array, maintaining the original total length and the total count of white pixels.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Arrange the following elements in sequence within the output array: the maroon (`9`) pixel, the `separator` block, and the `colored_object`.\n7.  Fill the remaining positions in the output array with the calculated number of `padding` zeros, placing them before and/or after the sequence from step 6, such that the relative order of [pivot, separator, object] is maintained and the total length is correct.
