task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array relative to a fixed pivot color (maroon 9), maintaining the pivot's original index.
array_properties:
  - type: 1D_array
  - element_type: integer (0-9) representing colors
  - length: conserved between input and output
components:
  - id: pivot
    color: 9 # maroon
    count: 1
    properties:
      - index: conserved between input and output
  - id: colored_object
    color: any_except_0_and_9
    count: 1
    shape: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - length: conserved between input and output
      - content: conserved between input and output
  - id: separator
    color: 0 # white
    count: 1 (may be empty, length 0)
    shape: contiguous_block
    location_input: spatially located between pivot and colored_object
    properties:
      - length: conserved between input and output
      - content: always 0s
  - id: background
    color: 0 # white
    count: remaining pixels
    properties:
      - fills all space not occupied by pivot, separator, and colored_object in the output.
transformation_rule:
  - action: identify components
    inputs: input_array
    outputs: pivot_index, separator_content, colored_object_content
  - action: construct output array
    size: same as input_array length
    initial_value: 0 (white)
  - step1_placement: place pivot (9) at its original input index in the output array.
  - step2_placement: place separator_content immediately to the right of the pivot index in the output array.
  - step3_placement: place colored_object_content immediately to the right of the separator block in the output array.
  - step4_fill: ensure all other positions in the output array are filled with 0 (background).
constraints:
  - The pivot, separator, and object placement must respect array boundaries. If the sequence extends beyond the array length, it should be truncated.
