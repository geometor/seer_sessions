Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (or grids of height 1) containing integer values from 0 to 9, representing colors.
2.  **Key Colors:** The colors white (`0`) and maroon (`9`) play special roles. There is also one contiguous block of another color (blue `1` or orange `7` in the examples).
3.  **Structure:** Each input array consists of:
    *   A single maroon (`9`) pixel.
    *   A single contiguous block of a color other than white (`0`) or maroon (`9`). Let's call this the "colored object".
    *   Blocks of white (`0`) pixels. One specific block of white pixels acts as a separator between the maroon pixel and the colored object. The remaining white pixels act as padding at the beginning and/or end.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation rearranges these elements. The maroon (`9`) pixel seems to act as a pivot point. The colored object moves relative to the maroon pixel. Specifically, in the output, the maroon pixel always appears first (relative to the colored object), followed by the separator block of white pixels, followed by the colored object. The remaining white pixels fill the rest of the array, maintaining the original total length and the total count of white pixels.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array based on a pivot color (maroon 9).
elements:
  - type: pivot
    color: 9 # maroon
    count: 1
    description: A single maroon pixel acting as a reference point.
  - type: colored_object
    color: any_except_0_and_9 # e.g., 1 (blue), 7 (orange)
    shape: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    description: A single contiguous block of a color other than white or maroon.
  - type: separator
    color: 0 # white
    shape: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    description: A block of white pixels located between the pivot and the colored_object in the input. Its length can vary.
  - type: padding
    color: 0 # white
    shape: contiguous_block
    count: variable # Can be zero, one, or two blocks depending on input structure
    description: White pixels filling the space not occupied by the pivot, colored_object, and separator.
properties:
  - array_length: conserved # Input and output arrays have the same total length.
  - element_counts:
      - pivot: conserved (always 1)
      - colored_object: conserved (always 1 block, length conserved)
      - separator: conserved (length conserved)
      - white_pixels: conserved (total number of white pixels remains the same)
relationships:
  - spatial:
      - input: The separator block is always located between the pivot and the colored_object. The colored_object can be to the left or right of the pivot.
      - output: The elements are rearranged into a fixed relative order: [padding_zeros_start] [pivot] [separator] [colored_object] [padding_zeros_end].
actions:
  - identify: Locate the pivot (9), the colored_object (non-0, non-9 block), and the separator (0s between pivot and object).
  - rearrange: Reconstruct the array by placing the pivot, separator, and colored_object in a specific sequence.
  - redistribute_padding: Place the remaining white pixels (padding) around the core sequence (pivot, separator, object) to maintain the original array length.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single maroon (`9`) pixel in the input array.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels whose color is not white (`0`) and not maroon (`9`). This is the `colored_object`.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of white (`0`) pixels located directly between the maroon (`9`) pixel and the `colored_object`. This is the `separator`.
4.  Determine the total number of white (`0`) pixels in the input array. Subtract the number of white pixels in the `separator` block to find the number of `padding` zeros.
5.  Construct the output array with the same total length as the input array.
6.  Arrange the following elements in sequence within the output array: the maroon (`9`) pixel, the `separator` block, and the `colored_object`.
7.  Fill the remaining positions in the output array with the calculated number of `padding` zeros, placing them before and/or after the sequence from step 6, such that the relative order of [pivot, separator, object] is maintained and the total length is correct. (Based on the examples, the sequence `[pivot] [separator] [colored_object]` is placed within the array, and all padding zeros are distributed around it).
