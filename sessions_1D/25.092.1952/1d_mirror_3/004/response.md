**General Assessment:**

Based on the detailed analysis and metrics gathered via code execution, the initial error report ("Identified colored object indices are not contiguous") appears to have been misleading or resulted from a bug in the previous code attempt. All training examples clearly show a *contiguous* block of non-zero, non-pivot color ("colored object").

The core transformation logic identified initially seems correct: the pivot pixel (9) stays in its original position, and the separator (block of 0s between pivot and object) and the colored object block are moved to be positioned immediately to the right of the pivot, in that order: `[pivot][separator][object]`. The rest of the array is filled with background zeros (0).

The strategy is to refine the implementation of the previously described logic, ensuring the functions correctly identify the contiguous blocks and handle the placement in the output array, including potential boundary checks (though not strictly necessary based on the given examples).

**Metrics:**

The code execution provided the following verified metrics for all training examples:

*   **Array Length:** Conserved between input and output (all examples have length 21).
*   **Pivot (9):**
    *   Count: 1 in both input and output.
    *   Index: Conserved (Input Index == Output Index).
        *   Example 1: Index 12
        *   Example 2: Index 9
        *   Example 3: Index 8
*   **Colored Object (non-0, non-9):**
    *   Color: Conserved (Input Color == Output Color). (1 in Ex1, 7 in Ex2 & Ex3)
    *   Pixel Count: Conserved (Input Count == Output Count). (6 in Ex1, 5 in Ex2, 6 in Ex3)
    *   Contiguity: True in Input, True in Output.
*   **Separator (0s between Pivot and Object):**
    *   Content: Always zeros.
    *   Length: Conserved (Input Length == Output Length). (1 in Ex1, 3 in Ex2, 1 in Ex3)
    *   Position (Output): Always immediately right of the pivot.
*   **Output Structure:** Confirmed `[pivot][separator][colored_object]` sequence relative to the pivot's original index, surrounded by background zeros.

```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array relative to a fixed pivot point (maroon 9), preserving the pivot's index.
elements:
  - type: pivot
    color: 9 # maroon
    count: 1
    properties:
      - index: conserved between input and output
    description: A single maroon pixel acting as a fixed reference point.
  - type: colored_object
    color: any_except_0_and_9 # e.g., 1 (blue), 7 (orange)
    shape: contiguous_block # Verified in all examples
    count: variable # Number of pixels in the block varies
    properties:
      - color: conserved
      - pixel_count: conserved
      - contiguity: present in input, enforced in output starting immediately after the separator
    description: A single contiguous block of a uniform color other than white or maroon.
  - type: separator
    color: 0 # white
    shape: contiguous_block
    count: variable # Number of pixels (zeros) in the block varies
    properties:
      - pixel_count: conserved (length is conserved)
      - position: located between pivot and colored_object in input; immediately right of pivot in output.
    description: A contiguous block of white pixels acting as a separator.
  - type: background
    color: 0 # white
    description: White pixels filling the space not occupied by the pivot, separator, and colored_object in the output.
properties:
  - array_length: conserved
relationships:
  - spatial:
      - input: `[...(pivot)...(separator)...(colored_object)...]` or `[...(colored_object)...(separator)...(pivot)...]`
      - output: `[...(pivot)(separator)(colored_object)...]`, where the pivot retains its original index. The exact placement of background zeros depends on the pivot index and lengths of separator/object.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the pivot (9) and its index (`pivot_idx`).
  - identify: Locate the contiguous colored_object block (non-0, non-9), record its content (`object_content`).
  - identify: Locate the contiguous separator block (0s) between the pivot and the colored_object in the input, record its content (`separator_content`).
  - construct_output: Create a new array (`output_array`) of the same length as the input, filled with zeros.
  - place_pivot: Set `output_array[pivot_idx] = 9`.
  - place_separator: Determine the start index `sep_start = pivot_idx + 1`. Place `separator_content` into `output_array` starting at `sep_start`, respecting array bounds.
  - place_object: Determine the start index `obj_start = sep_start + len(separator_content)`. Place `object_content` into `output_array` starting at `obj_start`, respecting array bounds.
  - return: Return the `output_array`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output array having the same length as the input array and initialize all its elements to white (`0`).
2.  Locate the single maroon (`9`) pixel in the input array; let its index be `pivot_index`.
3.  Identify the contiguous sequence of pixels in the input array that constitutes the `colored_object` (all pixels having the same color, which is not white (`0`) and not maroon (`9`)). Store the content (the list of pixel values) of this block as `object_data`.
4.  Identify the contiguous sequence of white (`0`) pixels in the input array that lies directly between the `pivot_index` and the `colored_object` block. Store the content of this `separator` block as `separator_data`.
5.  Place the maroon (`9`) pixel into the output array at `pivot_index`.
6.  Determine the starting position for the separator in the output array, which is `separator_start_index = pivot_index + 1`.
7.  Copy the pixel values from `separator_data` into the output array, starting at `separator_start_index`. Ensure you do not write past the end of the output array.
8.  Determine the starting position for the colored object in the output array, which is `object_start_index = separator_start_index + length(separator_data)`.
9.  Copy the pixel values from `object_data` into the output array, starting at `object_start_index`. Ensure you do not write past the end of the output array.
10. Return the modified output array.
