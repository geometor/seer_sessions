task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array relative to a fixed pivot point (maroon 9), preserving the pivot's index.
elements:
  - type: pivot
    color: 9 # maroon
    count: 1
    properties:
      - index: conserved between input and output
    description: A single maroon pixel acting as a fixed reference point.
  - type: colored_object
    color: any_except_0_and_9 # e.g., 1 (blue), 7 (orange)
    shape: contiguous_block # Verified in all examples
    count: variable # Number of pixels in the block varies
    properties:
      - color: conserved
      - pixel_count: conserved
      - contiguity: present in input, enforced in output starting immediately after the separator
    description: A single contiguous block of a uniform color other than white or maroon.
  - type: separator
    color: 0 # white
    shape: contiguous_block
    count: variable # Number of pixels (zeros) in the block varies
    properties:
      - pixel_count: conserved (length is conserved)
      - position: located between pivot and colored_object in input; immediately right of pivot in output.
    description: A contiguous block of white pixels acting as a separator.
  - type: background
    color: 0 # white
    description: White pixels filling the space not occupied by the pivot, separator, and colored_object in the output.
properties:
  - array_length: conserved
relationships:
  - spatial:
      - input: `[...(pivot)...(separator)...(colored_object)...]` or `[...(colored_object)...(separator)...(pivot)...]`
      - output: `[...(pivot)(separator)(colored_object)...]`, where the pivot retains its original index. The exact placement of background zeros depends on the pivot index and lengths of separator/object.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the pivot (9) and its index (`pivot_idx`).
  - identify: Locate the contiguous colored_object block (non-0, non-9), record its content (`object_content`).
  - identify: Locate the contiguous separator block (0s) between the pivot and the colored_object in the input, record its content (`separator_content`).
  - construct_output: Create a new array (`output_array`) of the same length as the input, filled with zeros.
  - place_pivot: Set `output_array[pivot_idx] = 9`.
  - place_separator: Determine the start index `sep_start = pivot_idx + 1`. Place `separator_content` into `output_array` starting at `sep_start`, respecting array bounds.
  - place_object: Determine the start index `obj_start = sep_start + len(separator_content)`. Place `object_content` into `output_array` starting at `obj_start`, respecting array bounds.
  - return: Return the `output_array`.
