            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis and metrics gathered via code execution, the initial error report (\"Identified colored object indices are not contiguous\") appears to have been misleading or resulted from a bug in the previous code attempt. All training examples clearly show a *contiguous* block of non-zero, non-pivot color (\"colored object\").\n\nThe core transformation logic identified initially seems correct: the pivot pixel (9) stays in its original position, and the separator (block of 0s between pivot and object) and the colored object block are moved to be positioned immediately to the right of the pivot, in that order: `[pivot][separator][object]`. The rest of the array is filled with background zeros (0).\n\nThe strategy is to refine the implementation of the previously described logic, ensuring the functions correctly identify the contiguous blocks and handle the placement in the output array, including potential boundary checks (though not strictly necessary based on the given examples).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution provided the following verified metrics for all training examples:\n\n*   **Array Length:** Conserved between input and output (all examples have length 21).\n*   **Pivot (9):**\n    *   Count: 1 in both input and output.\n    *   Index: Conserved (Input Index == Output Index).\n        *   Example 1: Index 12\n        *   Example 2: Index 9\n        *   Example 3: Index 8\n*   **Colored Object (non-0, non-9):**\n    *   Color: Conserved (Input Color == Output Color). (1 in Ex1, 7 in Ex2 & Ex3)\n    *   Pixel Count: Conserved (Input Count == Output Count). (6 in Ex1, 5 in Ex2, 6 in Ex3)\n    *   Contiguity: True in Input, True in Output.\n*   **Separator (0s between Pivot and Object):**\n    *   Content: Always zeros.\n    *   Length: Conserved (Input Length == Output Length). (1 in Ex1, 3 in Ex2, 1 in Ex3)\n    *   Position (Output): Always immediately right of the pivot.\n*   **Output Structure:** Confirmed `[pivot][separator][colored_object]` sequence relative to the pivot's original index, surrounded by background zeros.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
