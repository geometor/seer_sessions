Identify the contiguous horizontal block of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9) located to the left of the pivot pixel. Note its color, start index, and end index.\n3. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n4. Place the pivot pixel (maroon, 9) at its original column index in the output grid.\n5.
