Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the pivot pixel (maroon, 9) and its column index in the single input row.
2. Identify the contiguous horizontal block of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9) located entirely to the left of the pivot pixel. Note its color, start index, end index, and length.
3. Create an output row of the same dimensions as the input row, filled with the background color (white, 0).
4. Place the pivot pixel (maroon, 9) at its original column index in the output row.
5. Calculate the distance (gap size) between the right end of the identified block and the pivot pixel in the input row.
6. Calculate the new starting column index for the block in the output row: this is the pivot index plus 1 plus the calculated gap size.
7. Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the new calculated column index, ensuring it stays within grid bounds.
8. Return the modified row as the output grid (formatted as a list containing the single row list).
