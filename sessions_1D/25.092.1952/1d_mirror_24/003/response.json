Identify the contiguous horizontal block of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9) located entirely to the left of the pivot pixel. Note its color, start index, end index, and length.\n3. Create an output row of the same dimensions as the input row, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n4. Place the pivot pixel (maroon, 9) at its original column index in the output row.\n5. Calculate the distance (gap size) between the right end of the identified block and the pivot pixel in the input row.\n6. Calculate the new starting column index for the block in the output row: this is the pivot index plus 1 plus the calculated gap size.\n7. Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the new calculated column index, ensuring it stays within grid bounds.\n8. Return the modified row as the output grid (formatted as a list containing the single row list).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pivot(grid_row: np.ndarray) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Finds the column index of the pivot pixel (9) in a 1D NumPy array.\"\"\"\n    pivot_indices = np.where(grid_row == 9)[0]\n    if len(pivot_indices) > 0:\n        return pivot_indices[0] # Return the first occurrence\n    else:\n        return -1 # Pivot not found\n\ndef find_movable_block(grid_row: np.ndarray, pivot_col: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the contiguous block of non-zero, non-pivot color to the left of the pivot.\n    Returns (block_color, start_col, end_col, block_length) or None if no block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_color = -1\n    start_col = -1\n    end_col = -1\n    \n    # Iterate from right-to-left, starting just left of the pivot\n    for i in range(pivot_col - 1, -1, -1):\n        pixel = grid_row[i]\n        \n        # Skip background (0) and pivot (9)\n        if pixel == 0 or pixel == 9:\n            # If we were tracking a block, it ends here\n            if block_color != -1:\n                break\n            # Otherwise, continue searching leftwards\n            continue\n            \n        # Found a potential block pixel\n        if block_color == -1: # This is the first (rightmost) pixel of the block found\n            block_color = pixel\n            end_col = i\n            start_col = i\n        elif pixel == block_color: # This pixel extends the current block to the left\n            start_col = i\n        else: # Found a pixel of a different color; the block ends at the previous position\n            break\n            \n    # If a block was found (start_col is valid)\n    if start_col != -1:\n        block_length = end_col - start_col + 1\n        return block_color, start_col, end_col, block_length\n    else:\n        return None # No suitable block found\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Moves a colored block from the left of a pivot (9) to the right,\n    maintaining the gap distance relative to the pivot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is treated as a NumPy array and extract the single row\n    input_row = np.array(input_grid[0])\n    grid_len = len(input_row)\n    \n    # Initialize output_row with background color (0)\n    output_row = np.zeros(grid_len, dtype=int)\n\n    # Find the pivot pixel (9)\n    pivot_col = find_pivot(input_row)\n    \n    # If pivot not found, return the empty grid (or handle error as appropriate)\n    if pivot_col == -1:\n        print(\"Warning: Pivot (9) not found in input.\")\n        return [output_row.tolist()] # Return grid filled with background\n\n    # Place the pivot pixel in the output\n    output_row[pivot_col] = 9\n\n    # Find the movable block to the left of the pivot\n    block_info = find_movable_block(input_row, pivot_col)\n\n    # If a block was found, calculate its new position and place it\n    if block_info:\n        block_color, start_col, end_col, block_length = block_info\n\n        # Calculate the gap between the block's right edge and the pivot in the input\n        # Gap is the number of background cells between end_col and pivot_col\n        gap_size = pivot_col - 1 - end_col\n\n        # Calculate the new starting position for the block in the output\n        # New position starts immediately after the pivot + the gap size\n        new_start_col = pivot_col + 1 + gap_size\n\n        # Calculate the new ending position (exclusive for slicing)\n        new_end_col = new_start_col + block_length\n\n        # Place the block in the output grid, ensuring it fits within bounds\n        if new_start_col < grid_len:\n            # Determine the actual length to place (might be truncated by grid edge)\n            placeable_length = min(block_length, grid_len - new_start_col)\n            output_row[new_start_col : new_start_col + placeable_length] = block_color\n            if placeable_length < block_length:\n                 print(f\"Warning: Block placement truncated for row.
