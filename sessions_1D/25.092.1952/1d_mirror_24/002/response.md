**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: locating a pivot (maroon pixel 9), finding a colored block to its left, and repositioning this block to the right of the pivot while preserving the gap size. The error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`) indicates a type mismatch: the input grid was provided as a NumPy array, but the code attempted to use the list-specific `.index()` method. The strategy is to adapt the helper functions (`find_pivot`, `find_movable_block`) to work directly with NumPy arrays or ensure the input row is converted to a list before processing. The fundamental logic of the transformation remains sound.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input Type:** The error confirms the input grids are being passed as NumPy arrays. Specifically, `input_grid` is likely a 2D NumPy array (e.g., `[[...]]`), and accessing `input_grid[0]` yields a 1D NumPy array representing the single row.
*   **Error Location:** The error occurred within the `find_pivot` function due to calling `.index()` on a NumPy array.
*   **Function Compatibility:**
    *   `find_pivot`: Needs modification to use NumPy methods (e.g., `np.where`) to find the pivot index.
    *   `find_movable_block`: This function uses standard iteration and indexing (`grid_row[i]`), which works correctly for both lists and 1D NumPy arrays. No change is strictly necessary here, but ensuring consistent handling (e.g., always working with lists internally) might be cleaner.
    *   `transform`: Correctly handles extracting the first row. It needs to pass the row (as a NumPy array or converted list) to the helper functions appropriately. The output creation (`[0] * grid_len`) and population work correctly.

    The movable block is repositioned from the left side of the pivot
    to the right side. The number of background pixels (gap) between the
    block's right edge and the pivot in the input is preserved as the gap
    between the pivot and the block's left edge in the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (likely a 1xN NumPy array). Extract the single row.
2.  Create an output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Locate the column index (`pivot_col`) of the maroon pixel (9) in the input row.
4.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at `pivot_col` in the output row.
5.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of color (not white 0 and not maroon 9) located entirely to the left of `pivot_col` in the input row. Record its color (`block_color`), starting column index (`start_col`), ending column index (`end_col`), and length (`block_length`).
6.  If no such block is found, the transformation is complete; return the output row (within a list, `[output_row]`).
7.  Calculate the gap size: `gap_size = pivot_col - end_col - 1`.
8.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block in the output row: `new_start_col = pivot_col + 1 + gap_size`.
9.  Place the identified block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) into the output row, starting at `new_start_col`. Ensure the block does not extend beyond the grid boundaries.
10. Return the completed output row, formatted as a list containing the single row (e.g., `[output_row]`).
