Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the pivot pixel (maroon, 9) and its column index.
2. Identify the contiguous horizontal block of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9) located to the left of the pivot pixel. Note its color, start index, and end index.
3. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
4. Place the pivot pixel (maroon, 9) at its original column index in the output grid.
5. Calculate the distance (gap) between the right end of the block and the pivot pixel in the input grid.
6. Calculate the new starting column index for the block in the output grid, which is the pivot index plus 1 plus the calculated gap.
7. Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the new calculated column index.
