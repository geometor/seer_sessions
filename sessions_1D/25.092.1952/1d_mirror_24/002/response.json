            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: locating a pivot (maroon pixel 9), finding a colored block to its left, and repositioning this block to the right of the pivot while preserving the gap size. The error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`) indicates a type mismatch: the input grid was provided as a NumPy array, but the code attempted to use the list-specific `.index()` method. The strategy is to adapt the helper functions (`find_pivot`, `find_movable_block`) to work directly with NumPy arrays or ensure the input row is converted to a list before processing. The fundamental logic of the transformation remains sound.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** The error confirms the input grids are being passed as NumPy arrays. Specifically, `input_grid` is likely a 2D NumPy array (e.g., `[[...]]`), and accessing `input_grid[0]` yields a 1D NumPy array representing the single row.\n*   **Error Location:** The error occurred within the `find_pivot` function due to calling `.index()` on a NumPy array.\n*   **Function Compatibility:**\n    *   `find_pivot`: Needs modification to use NumPy methods (e.g., `np.where`) to find the pivot index.\n    *   `find_movable_block`: This function uses standard iteration and indexing (`grid_row[i]`), which works correctly for both lists and 1D NumPy arrays. No change is strictly necessary here, but ensuring consistent handling (e.g., always working with lists internally) might be cleaner.\n    *   `transform`: Correctly handles extracting the first row. It needs to pass the row (as a NumPy array or converted list) to the helper functions appropriately. The output creation (`[0] * grid_len`) and population work correctly.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
