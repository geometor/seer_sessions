            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples provided are all 1-row grids (vectors) of the same length (26 columns).\n2.  **Key Pixels:**\n    *   Each grid contains a single maroon pixel (value 9). This appears to be a fixed point or a pivot.\n    *   Each grid contains one contiguous horizontal block of a single color (orange 7, magenta 6, or green 3 in the examples). This block is the primary object being manipulated.\n    *   The remaining pixels are white (value 0), acting as the background.\n3.  **Spatial Relationship (Input):** In all input examples, the colored block is located entirely to the left of the maroon pixel. There might be white pixels separating the block and the maroon pixel.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the colored block.\n    *   The maroon pixel's position remains unchanged from input to output.\n    *   The colored block moves from the left side of the maroon pixel to the right side.\n    *   The distance (number of white pixels) between the end of the block and the maroon pixel in the input seems equal to the distance between the maroon pixel and the start of the block in the output. It's like the block is reflected or repositioned symmetrically relative to the maroon pixel.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the same dimensions, the same maroon pixel position, and the same background color. The colored block appears in a new position to the right of the maroon pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Locate the column index (`pivot_col`) of the maroon pixel (9) in the input grid.\n3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at `pivot_col` in the output grid.\n4.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of color (not white 0 and not maroon 9) located to the left of `pivot_col` in the input grid. Record its color (`block_color`), starting column index (`start_col`), and ending column index (`end_col`).\n5.  Calculate the new starting column index (`new_start_col`) for the block in the output grid by reflecting its position relative to the pivot: `new_start_col = pivot_col + (pivot_col - end_col)`.\n6.  Determine the length of the block: `block_length = end_col - start_col + 1`.\n7.  Place the block of `block_color` in the output grid, starting at `new_start_col` and continuing for `block_length` columns."
