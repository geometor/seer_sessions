Identify the contiguous colored block (color C, length L, end index E_block)\n   and the single maroon pixel (index M) in the input row.\n2. Calculate the gap size (G) between them in the input: G = M - E_block - 1.\n3. Create an output row of the same size, initialized to white (0).\n4. Place the maroon pixel (9) in the output row at its original index (M).\n5. Calculate the starting index for the colored block in the output:\n   Output_S_block = M + G + 1.\n6. Place the colored block (color C, length L) into the output row, starting at\n   index Output_S_block and ending at Output_S_block + L - 1.\n7.
