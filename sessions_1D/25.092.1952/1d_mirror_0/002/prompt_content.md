"""
Transforms a 1D grid by rearranging two key elements: a contiguous block of a
single color (not white 0, not maroon 9) and a single maroon pixel (9).

The transformation rule is:
1. Identify the contiguous colored block and the single maroon pixel in the input grid.
2. Note the color and length of the block, the index of the maroon pixel, and the
   number of white pixels (the gap) separating them.
3. Create an output grid of the same size, initialized to white (0).
4. Place the maroon pixel in the output grid at the same index it occupied in the input.
5. Place the gap (white pixels) immediately following the maroon pixel in the output grid,
   preserving the original gap size.
6. Place the colored block (using its original color and length) immediately
   following the gap in the output grid.
