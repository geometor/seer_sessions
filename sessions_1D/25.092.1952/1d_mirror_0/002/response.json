            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly handled the input format. The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" indicates that the code attempted to use a NumPy array in a boolean context, likely during the check `if isinstance(input_grid[0], list):`. ARC grids, even single-row ones, are typically represented as a list containing one list (e.g., `[[0, 0, 9, ...]]`). The original code assumed the input might sometimes be a flat list `[0, 0, 9, ...]`, which caused the error when `input_grid[0]` (an integer) was accessed and later implicitly converted to a NumPy array containing that single integer, which then caused issues in boolean checks or array comparisons later on.\n\nThe core logic of identifying the colored block, the marker pixel, and the gap, and then rearranging them seems correct based on the initial observation. The strategy is to:\n1. Correct the input handling to always expect a list containing one list (representing the single row).\n2. Verify the logic for finding the block, marker, and gap using code execution on the examples.\n3. Confirm that placing the marker at its original index, followed by the gap, followed by the block, consistently produces the correct output.\n4. Update the Facts and Natural Language Program accordingly.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's represent the inputs and outputs correctly as lists of lists and extract the key features.\n\n"
