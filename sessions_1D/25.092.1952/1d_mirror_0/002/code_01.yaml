task_type: object_rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row, represented as a list containing one list)
background_color: 0 (white)

input_elements:
  - object: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not white (0) and not maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: C (integer 1-8)
      - length: L (integer >= 1)
      - start_index: S_block (column index where the block begins)
      - end_index: E_block (column index where the block ends, E_block = S_block + L - 1)
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
      - length: 1
      - index: I_marker (column index of the pixel)
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more white pixels (0) located between the colored_block and the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - length: G (integer >= 1) calculated as G = I_marker - E_block - 1
      - start_index: E_block + 1
      - end_index: I_marker - 1

relationship:
  - type: spatial_order (input)
    description: The colored_block appears first, followed by the gap, followed by the marker_pixel along the row. (S_block < E_block < I_marker)
  - type: spatial_order (output)
    description: The marker_pixel appears first, followed by the gap, followed by the colored_block along the row.

transformation:
  action: rearrange_elements
  details:
    - Identify the colored_block (color C, length L), the marker_pixel (index I_marker), and the gap (length G) in the input row.
    - Create an output row of the same length as the input row, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    - Place the marker_pixel (color 9) in the output row at the same index it had in the input row (index I_marker).
    - Place the gap (G white pixels, color 0) in the output row immediately following the marker_pixel, starting at index I_marker + 1 and ending at index I_marker + G. (This step is implicit if the output is initialized to white).
    - Place the colored_block (color C, length L) in the output row immediately following the gap, starting at index I_marker + G + 1 and ending at index I_marker + G + L.
    - The rest of the output row remains the background color (white, 0).
    - Return the output row enclosed in a list.
