Identify the contiguous colored block (color C, length L, end index E_block)\n   and the single maroon pixel (index I_marker) in the input row.\n2. Calculate the gap size (G) between them in the input: G = I_marker - E_block - 1.\n3. Create an output row of the same size, initialized to white (0).\n4. Place the maroon pixel (9) in the output row at its original index (I_marker).\n5. Calculate the starting index for the colored block in the output:\n   Output_S_block = I_marker + G + 1.\n6.
