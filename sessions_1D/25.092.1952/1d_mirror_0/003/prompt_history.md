**Perception of the Elements:**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains exactly two distinct non-white elements:
1.  A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (e.g., green, magenta, gray).
2.  A single maroon pixel (color 9).
These two elements are separated by one or more white pixels (color 0). The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.

The transformation rearranges the order of the maroon pixel and the colored block. In the input, the colored block always appears before the maroon pixel. In the output, the maroon pixel appears first, followed by the gap, and then the colored block. The size of the gap between the two elements is preserved. The starting position of the maroon pixel in the output grid is the same as its starting position in the input grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)

input_elements:
  - object: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, not white (0) and not maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 3, 6, 5).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The column index where the block begins.
      - end_index: The column index where the block ends.
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
      - length: 1
      - index: The column index of the pixel.
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more white pixels (0) located between the colored_block and the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - length: The number of white pixels in the gap.
      - start_index: The column index where the gap begins (end_index of colored_block + 1).
      - end_index: The column index where the gap ends (index of marker_pixel - 1).

relationship:
  - type: spatial_order (input)
    description: The colored_block appears first, followed by the gap, followed by the marker_pixel along the row.
  - type: spatial_order (output)
    description: The marker_pixel appears first, followed by the gap, followed by the colored_block along the row.

transformation:
  action: rearrange_elements
  details:
    - The relative order of the colored_block and marker_pixel is reversed.
    - The gap between them is preserved in size and placed between the rearranged elements.
    - The starting position of the marker_pixel in the output is identical to its starting position in the input.
    - The overall size of the grid remains unchanged.
    - Pixels outside the rearranged {marker_pixel, gap, colored_block} structure are white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the "colored block"). Record its color, starting index, and length.
3.  Scan the input grid to locate the single maroon pixel (color 9, the "marker pixel"). Record its index.
4.  Determine the gap size: calculate the number of white pixels between the end of the colored block and the start of the marker pixel. (Gap size = marker pixel index - colored block end index - 1).
5.  In the output grid, place the marker pixel (color 9) at its original index found in step 3.
6.  Place a sequence of white pixels (0) representing the gap, with the length determined in step 4, immediately following the marker pixel in the output grid.
7.  Place the colored block (using the color and length recorded in step 2) immediately following the gap in the output grid.

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because it incorrectly handled the input format. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" indicates that the code attempted to use a NumPy array in a boolean context, likely during the check `if isinstance(input_grid[0], list):`. ARC grids, even single-row ones, are typically represented as a list containing one list (e.g., `[[0, 0, 9, ...]]`). The original code assumed the input might sometimes be a flat list `[0, 0, 9, ...]`, which caused the error when `input_grid[0]` (an integer) was accessed and later implicitly converted to a NumPy array containing that single integer, which then caused issues in boolean checks or array comparisons later on.

The core logic of identifying the colored block, the marker pixel, and the gap, and then rearranging them seems correct based on the initial observation. The strategy is to:
1. Correct the input handling to always expect a list containing one list (representing the single row).
2. Verify the logic for finding the block, marker, and gap using code execution on the examples.
3. Confirm that placing the marker at its original index, followed by the gap, followed by the block, consistently produces the correct output.
4. Update the Facts and Natural Language Program accordingly.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's represent the inputs and outputs correctly as lists of lists and extract the key features.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row, represented as a list containing one list)
background_color: 0 (white)

input_elements:
  - object: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not white (0) and not maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: C (integer 1-8)
      - length: L (integer >= 1)
      - start_index: S_block (column index where the block begins)
      - end_index: E_block (column index where the block ends, E_block = S_block + L - 1)
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
      - length: 1
      - index: I_marker (column index of the pixel)
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more white pixels (0) located between the colored_block and the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - length: G (integer >= 1) calculated as G = I_marker - E_block - 1
      - start_index: E_block + 1
      - end_index: I_marker - 1

relationship:
  - type: spatial_order (input)
    description: The colored_block appears first, followed by the gap, followed by the marker_pixel along the row. (S_block < E_block < I_marker)
  - type: spatial_order (output)
    description: The marker_pixel appears first, followed by the gap, followed by the colored_block along the row.

transformation:
  action: rearrange_elements
  details:
    - Identify the colored_block (color C, length L), the marker_pixel (index I_marker), and the gap (length G) in the input row.
    - Create an output row of the same length as the input row, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    - Place the marker_pixel (color 9) in the output row at the same index it had in the input row (index I_marker).
    - Place the gap (G white pixels, color 0) in the output row immediately following the marker_pixel, starting at index I_marker + 1 and ending at index I_marker + G. (This step is implicit if the output is initialized to white).
    - Place the colored_block (color C, length L) in the output row immediately following the gap, starting at index I_marker + G + 1 and ending at index I_marker + G + L.
    - The rest of the output row remains the background color (white, 0).
    - Return the output row enclosed in a list.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row represented as a list within a list. Extract the inner list representing the row data.
2.  Initialize an output row of the same length as the input row, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Scan the input row to find the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the "colored block"). Record its color (`C`), length (`L`), and end index (`E_block`).
4.  Scan the input row to find the single maroon pixel (color 9, the "marker pixel"). Record its index (`I_marker`).
5.  Calculate the size of the gap (`G`) between the colored block and the marker pixel in the input: `G = I_marker - E_block - 1`.
6.  In the output row, place the marker pixel (color 9) at the index `I_marker`.
7.  Determine the starting index for the colored block in the output row: `Output_S_block = I_marker + G + 1`.
8.  Place the colored block (color `C`, length `L`) into the output row, starting at index `Output_S_block`.
9.  Wrap the completed output row in a list to match the required output format.
10. Return the resulting list containing the single transformed output row.
