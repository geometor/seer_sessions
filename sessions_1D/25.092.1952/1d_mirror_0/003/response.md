"""
Transforms a 1D grid (represented as a list containing one list) by rearranging
two key elements: a contiguous block of a single color (not white 0, not maroon 9)
and a single maroon pixel (9).

The transformation rule is:
1. Identify the contiguous colored block (color C, length L, end index E_block)
   and the single maroon pixel (index I_marker) in the input row.
2. Calculate the gap size (G) between them in the input: G = I_marker - E_block - 1.
3. Create an output row of the same size, initialized to white (0).
4. Place the maroon pixel (9) in the output row at its original index (I_marker).
5. Calculate the starting index for the colored block in the output:
   Output_S_block = I_marker + G + 1.
6. Place the colored block (color C, length L) into the output row, starting at
   index Output_S_block.
7. Return the output row enclosed in a list.
