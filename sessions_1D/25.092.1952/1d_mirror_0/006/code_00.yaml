grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
grid_properties:
  - size: constant (input and output have the same dimensions)
  - background_color: white (0)

input_elements:
  - object: colored_block
    description: A single contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not white (0) and not maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: C (e.g., 3, 6, 5)
      - length: L (number of pixels)
      - start_index: S_block
      - end_index: E_block (E_block = S_block + L - 1)
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
      - length: 1
      - index: M
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more white pixels (0) located strictly between the colored_block and the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - length: G (G = M - E_block - 1)
      - start_index: E_block + 1
      - end_index: M - 1

transformation:
  action: construct_output_grid
  details:
    - Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    - Identify the `colored_block` (color C, length L), `marker_pixel` (index M), and `gap` (length G) from the input grid.
    - Place the `marker_pixel` (color 9) into the output grid at its original index M.
    - Calculate the starting index for the `colored_block` in the output grid: Output_S_block = M + G + 1.
    - Place the `colored_block` (color C, length L) into the output grid, starting at index Output_S_block.
    - The `gap` (white pixels) naturally occupies the space between the placed `marker_pixel` and the placed `colored_block` because the output grid was initialized to white and these are the only non-white elements placed in that region.
