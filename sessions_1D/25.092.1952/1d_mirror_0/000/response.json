A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (e.g., green, magenta, gray).\n2.  A single maroon pixel (color 9).\nThese two elements are separated by one or more white pixels (color 0). The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.\n\nThe transformation rearranges the order of the maroon pixel and the colored block. In the input, the colored block always appears before the maroon pixel. In the output, the maroon pixel appears first, followed by the gap, and then the colored block. The size of the gap between the two elements is preserved. The starting position of the maroon pixel in the output grid is the same as its starting position in the input grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
