task_type: object_rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)

input_elements:
  - object: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, not white (0) and not maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 3, 6, 5).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The column index where the block begins.
      - end_index: The column index where the block ends.
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
      - length: 1
      - index: The column index of the pixel.
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more white pixels (0) located between the colored_block and the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - length: The number of white pixels in the gap.
      - start_index: The column index where the gap begins (end_index of colored_block + 1).
      - end_index: The column index where the gap ends (index of marker_pixel - 1).

relationship:
  - type: spatial_order (input)
    description: The colored_block appears first, followed by the gap, followed by the marker_pixel along the row.
  - type: spatial_order (output)
    description: The marker_pixel appears first, followed by the gap, followed by the colored_block along the row.

transformation:
  action: rearrange_elements
  details:
    - The relative order of the colored_block and marker_pixel is reversed.
    - The gap between them is preserved in size and placed between the rearranged elements.
    - The starting position of the marker_pixel in the output is identical to its starting position in the input.
    - The overall size of the grid remains unchanged.
    - Pixels outside the rearranged {marker_pixel, gap, colored_block} structure are white (0).
