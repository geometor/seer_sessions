## General Assessment

The provided code results indicate that the `transform` function failed to modify the input grid according to the observed pattern in all three training examples. The transformed output was identical to the input, resulting in a 0% match score (excluding grid properties like size/palette which were trivially correct as the input wasn't changed).

The core error seems to be that the intended transformation logic, while potentially understood correctly during the initial observation phase, was not implemented effectively in the previous code version that produced these results. The code block presented *in the prompt text itself* appears to contain the correct logic based on the analysis.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the transformation rule by analyzing the input/output pairs and extracting key metrics using code execution.
2.  Verify that the rule holds for all examples.
3.  Refine the factual documentation (YAML) and the natural language program to precisely describe this confirmed rule, ensuring clarity for the coding phase. The previously provided descriptions seem largely accurate, but we will ensure maximum precision.

## Metrics

The following metrics were extracted using code execution to analyze the relationship between input and output structures:


```python
# Input Data Structures
input_1 = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output_1 = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]]
input_2 = [[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output_2 = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
input_3 = [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output_3 = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

**Results:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Block: color=3, start=11, end=18, length=8
    *   Input Marker: index=20
    *   Input Gap Size: 1 (index 19)
    *   Output Marker: index=20
    *   Output Block: start=22, end=29
    *   Output Gap Size: 1 (index 21)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Block: color=6, start=2, end=9, length=8
    *   Input Marker: index=12
    *   Input Gap Size: 2 (indices 10, 11)
    *   Output Marker: index=12
    *   Output Block: start=15, end=22
    *   Output Gap Size: 2 (indices 13, 14)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Block: color=5, start=0, end=7, length=8
    *   Input Marker: index=13
    *   Input Gap Size: 5 (indices 8-12)
    *   Output Marker: index=13
    *   Output Block: start=19, end=26
    *   Output Gap Size: 5 (indices 14-18)

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation rule is consistent across all examples:
1.  Identify the colored block (color C, length L) and the marker pixel (maroon 9, index M).
2.  Identify the gap (white pixels) between the block and the marker in the input. Let the gap size be G.
3.  In the output grid (same size, initialized to white 0):
    *   Place the marker pixel (9) at its original index M.
    *   Place the gap (G white pixels) immediately *after* the marker (indices M+1 to M+G).
    *   Place the colored block (color C, length L) immediately *after* the gap (indices M+G+1 to M+G+L).

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_rearrangement_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: 0 (white)

input_elements:
  - object: colored_block
    description: A single contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color, which is not white (0) and not maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: (C) The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 3, 6, 5).
      - length: (L) The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The column index where the block begins.
      - end_index: (E_block) The column index where the block ends.
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
      - index: (M) The column index of the pixel.
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more white pixels (0) located strictly between the colored_block and the marker_pixel in the input.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - length: (G) The number of white pixels in the gap. G = M - E_block - 1.

input_structure:
  - The colored_block always appears before the gap.
  - The gap always appears before the marker_pixel.
  - Order: [Prefix_White..., Colored_Block, Gap, Marker_Pixel, Suffix_White...]

transformation:
  action: swap_order_around_marker
  invariants:
    - Grid dimensions (always 1 row, length unchanged).
    - Color palette (only colors from input appear in output).
    - Color counts (specifically, one marker pixel, L block pixels).
    - Marker pixel index (M remains the same in input and output).
    - Gap size (G remains the same).
    - Color of the block (C remains the same).
    - Length of the block (L remains the same).
  changes:
    - Relative order of the block and marker is reversed.
    - The block is repositioned relative to the fixed marker and preserved gap.

output_structure:
  - The marker_pixel appears first (at its original index M).
  - The gap appears immediately after the marker_pixel.
  - The colored_block appears immediately after the gap.
  - All other pixels are the background color (white, 0).
  - Order: [Prefix_White..., Marker_Pixel (at index M), Gap (size G), Colored_Block (size L), Suffix_White...]
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row represented as a list within a list).
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  **Identify Elements:**
    a.  Scan the input row to find the contiguous block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels. Record its color (C), length (L), and end index (E_block).
    b.  Scan the input row to find the single maroon (9) pixel. Record its index (M).
4.  **Calculate Gap:** Determine the size (G) of the gap (sequence of white pixels) between the colored block and the marker pixel in the input row: `G = M - E_block - 1`.
5.  **Construct Output:**
    a.  Place the marker pixel (color 9) into the output grid at index `M`.
    b.  Calculate the starting index for the colored block in the output grid: `output_block_start = M + G + 1`.
    c.  Place the colored block (color C, length L) into the output grid, starting at index `output_block_start` and ending at `output_block_start + L - 1`. Ensure writing does not exceed grid bounds.
6.  Return the completed output grid (as a list containing the single row list).
