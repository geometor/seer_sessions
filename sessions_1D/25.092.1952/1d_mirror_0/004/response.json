The transformed output was identical to the input, resulting in a 0% match score (excluding grid properties like size/palette which were trivially correct as the input wasn't changed).\n\nThe core error seems to be that the intended transformation logic, while potentially understood correctly during the initial observation phase, was not implemented effectively in the previous code version that produced these results. The code block presented *in the prompt text itself* appears to contain the correct logic based on the analysis.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the transformation rule by analyzing the input/output pairs and extracting key metrics using code execution.\n2.  Verify that the rule holds for all examples.\n3.  Refine the factual documentation (YAML) and the natural language program to precisely describe this confirmed rule, ensuring clarity for the coding phase. The previously provided descriptions seem largely accurate, but we will ensure maximum precision.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were extracted using code execution to analyze the relationship between input and output structures:\n\n"

Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n3.  **Identify Elements:**\n    a.  Scan the input row to find the contiguous block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels. Record its color (C), length (L), and end index (E_block).\n    b.  Scan the input row to find the single maroon (9) pixel. Record its index (M).\n4.  **Calculate Gap:** Determine the size (G) of the gap (sequence of white pixels) between the colored block and the marker pixel in the input row: `G = M - E_block - 1`.\n5.  **Construct Output:**\n    a.  Place the marker pixel (color 9) into the output grid at index `M`.\n    b.  Calculate the starting index for the colored block in the output grid: `output_block_start = M + G + 1`.\n    c.  Place the colored block (color C, length L) into the output grid, starting at index `output_block_start` and ending at `output_block_start + L - 1`. Ensure writing does not exceed grid bounds.\n6.  Return the completed output grid (as a list containing the single row list)."
