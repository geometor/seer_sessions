task_type: object_rearrangement_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: 0 (white)

input_elements:
  - object: colored_block
    description: A single contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color, which is not white (0) and not maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: (C) The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 3, 6, 5).
      - length: (L) The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The column index where the block begins.
      - end_index: (E_block) The column index where the block ends.
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
      - index: (M) The column index of the pixel.
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more white pixels (0) located strictly between the colored_block and the marker_pixel in the input.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - length: (G) The number of white pixels in the gap. G = M - E_block - 1.

input_structure:
  - The colored_block always appears before the gap.
  - The gap always appears before the marker_pixel.
  - Order: [Prefix_White..., Colored_Block, Gap, Marker_Pixel, Suffix_White...]

transformation:
  action: swap_order_around_marker
  invariants:
    - Grid dimensions (always 1 row, length unchanged).
    - Color palette (only colors from input appear in output).
    - Color counts (specifically, one marker pixel, L block pixels).
    - Marker pixel index (M remains the same in input and output).
    - Gap size (G remains the same).
    - Color of the block (C remains the same).
    - Length of the block (L remains the same).
  changes:
    - Relative order of the block and marker is reversed.
    - The block is repositioned relative to the fixed marker and preserved gap.

output_structure:
  - The marker_pixel appears first (at its original index M).
  - The gap appears immediately after the marker_pixel.
  - The colored_block appears immediately after the gap.
  - All other pixels are the background color (white, 0).
  - Order: [Prefix_White..., Marker_Pixel (at index M), Gap (size G), Colored_Block (size L), Suffix_White...]
