Confirm the dimensionality of the input as processed by NumPy.\n2.  Adjust the code logic and descriptions to explicitly handle the input as a 2D grid, likely operating specifically on the first row since all examples seem to be 1xN.\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this 2D structure and row-based operation.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the input structure and where the comparison fails using the first training example.\n\n```"
