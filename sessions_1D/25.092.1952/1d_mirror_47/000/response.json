The transformation involves rearranging these elements. The maroon pixel seems to act as a pivot or marker. The colored block and the maroon pixel swap their relative order, while maintaining the number of white pixels that originally separated them.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Find the index (`marker_index`) and color (`marker_color`, which is always maroon, 9) of the single marker pixel in the input grid.\n    3.  Find the contiguous block of pixels that are not background (white, 0) and not the marker color (maroon, 9). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), and ending index (`block_end_index`).\n    4.  Determine the sequence of background pixels (the `gap`) located between the end of the colored block and the marker pixel in the input grid. Specifically, identify the pixels from `block_end_index + 1` up to `marker_index - 1`. Record the length of this gap (`gap_length`).\n    5.  Place the marker pixel (`marker_color`) in the output grid at the `marker_index`.\n    6.  Place the `gap` sequence ( `gap_length` background pixels) in the output grid starting at `marker_index + 1`.\n    7.  Place the colored block (using `block_color`) in the output grid starting at the index immediately following the gap, which is `marker_index + 1 + gap_length`. The block will extend for the same length as the original block (`block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`)."
