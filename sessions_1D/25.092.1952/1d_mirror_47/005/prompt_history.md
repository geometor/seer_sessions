*   **Perception:** The input consists of a 1D array (representing a row or flattened grid) containing mostly white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9), and a contiguous block of another color (gray '5' or magenta '6'). The transformation involves rearranging these elements. The maroon pixel seems to act as a pivot or marker. The colored block and the maroon pixel swap their relative order, while maintaining the number of white pixels that originally separated them.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array based on relative positions.
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: marker
        color: maroon (9)
        count: 1
        shape: single pixel
      - type: colored_block
        color: non-white, non-maroon (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6')
        shape: contiguous horizontal block
        count: 1
    relationships:
      - In the input, the colored_block is separated from the marker by a sequence of zero or more background pixels.
      - The order can be [colored_block] [background_gap] [marker] or potentially the reverse (though only the first case is shown).
    actions:
      - Identify the marker pixel and its index.
      - Identify the colored_block, its color, start index, and end index.
      - Identify the sequence of background pixels between the colored_block and the marker (the gap).
      - Reconstruct the array:
        - Start with a background-filled array of the same size.
        - Place the marker at its original index.
        - Place the identified background_gap sequence immediately after the marker.
        - Place the colored_block immediately after the background_gap sequence.
    transformation_result:
      - The relative order of the colored_block and the marker is swapped.
      - The background_gap sequence that was between them in the input is now placed between them in the output, but following the marker instead of preceding it.
      - The absolute position of the marker pixel remains unchanged.
      - The absolute position of the colored_block changes.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Find the index (`marker_index`) and color (`marker_color`, which is always maroon, 9) of the single marker pixel in the input grid.
    3.  Find the contiguous block of pixels that are not background (white, 0) and not the marker color (maroon, 9). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), and ending index (`block_end_index`).
    4.  Determine the sequence of background pixels (the `gap`) located between the end of the colored block and the marker pixel in the input grid. Specifically, identify the pixels from `block_end_index + 1` up to `marker_index - 1`. Record the length of this gap (`gap_length`).
    5.  Place the marker pixel (`marker_color`) in the output grid at the `marker_index`.
    6.  Place the `gap` sequence ( `gap_length` background pixels) in the output grid starting at `marker_index + 1`.
    7.  Place the colored block (using `block_color`) in the output grid starting at the index immediately following the gap, which is `marker_index + 1 + gap_length`. The block will extend for the same length as the original block (`block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).

*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue appears to be a discrepancy between the expected input format (`List[List[int]]` for a 1xN grid) and how the input was potentially processed or passed during testing, leading to the `ValueError`. The core transformation logic (identifying marker, block, gap, and rearranging) seems correct based on the initial visual inspection of the examples, but it couldn't be verified due to the format error. The strategy is to:
    1.  Confirm the input structure is indeed `List[List[int]]`.
    2.  Use code execution to gather precise metrics about the marker, block, and gap in each training example.
    3.  Verify that the reconstruction logic based on these metrics produces the correct output for all examples.
    4.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program with the confirmed details.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1xN grid by moving a colored block relative to a fixed marker.
    grid_properties:
      - dimension: 1xN (single row)
      - background_color: white (0)
    elements:
      - type: marker
        color: maroon (9)
        count: 1
        shape: single pixel
      - type: colored_block
        color: non-white(0), non-maroon(9) (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6')
        shape: contiguous horizontal block (length >= 1)
        count: 1
    relationships:
      - In the input grid, the colored_block always appears *before* the marker pixel.
      - The colored_block and the marker pixel are separated by a sequence of zero or more background pixels (the 'gap').
        - Example 1 gap length: 2
        - Example 2 gap length: 2
        - Example 3 gap length: 1
    actions:
      - Identify the column index (`marker_index`) of the marker pixel (9) in the input row.
      - Identify the start index (`block_start_index`), end index (`block_end_index`), color (`block_color`), and length (`block_length`) of the contiguous colored block in the input row.
      - Calculate the length (`gap_length`) of the sequence of background pixels between the end of the colored block (`block_end_index`) and the marker pixel (`marker_index`). `gap_length = marker_index - (block_end_index + 1)`. If `block_end_index + 1 == marker_index`, `gap_length` is 0.
      - Create a new output row of the same length as the input, filled with the background color (0).
      - Place the marker pixel (9) in the output row at the original `marker_index`.
      - Calculate the starting position for the moved block: `new_block_start_index = marker_index + 1 + gap_length`.
      - Place the colored block (using `block_color`) in the output row, starting at `new_block_start_index` and extending for `block_length` pixels, ensuring placement stays within the row boundaries.
    transformation_result:
      - The marker pixel remains in its original column index.
      - The gap sequence (if any) effectively moves to start immediately after the marker pixel.
      - The colored block moves to start immediately after the relocated gap sequence.
      - The relative order of marker, gap, and block becomes: [marker] [gap] [colored_block].
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Given a 1xN input grid (represented as a list containing one row list).
    2.  Create an output row of the same length, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
    3.  Locate the single marker pixel (maroon, 9) in the input row and note its index (`marker_index`).
    4.  Locate the contiguous block of pixels with a color other than white (0) or maroon (9). Note its color (`block_color`), start index (`block_start_index`), end index (`block_end_index`), and calculate its length (`block_length = block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).
    5.  Determine the number of background pixels (`gap_length`) between the end of the colored block and the marker in the input row. This is calculated as `marker_index - (block_end_index + 1)`. If the block ends immediately before the marker, the gap length is 0.
    6.  Place the marker pixel (maroon, 9) into the output row at `marker_index`.
    7.  Calculate the target start index for the colored block in the output row: `new_block_start_index = marker_index + 1 + gap_length`.
    8.  Place the colored block, using `block_color`, into the output row starting at `new_block_start_index` and continuing for `block_length` pixels. Ensure that writing the block does not go beyond the bounds of the output row; only place the portion of the block that fits.
    9.  Return the completed output row, formatted as a 1xN grid (a list containing the single output row list).
