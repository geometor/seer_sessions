The marker pixel maintains its original column \nindex. The colored block is moved to the position immediately following the \nmarker, preserving the length of any gap of background pixels (color 0) \nthat originally existed between the block and the marker. In the output row, \nthe marker is followed by the gap (if any), which is then followed by the \ncolored block. The background color is white (0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_marker_in_row(row_array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the column index of the marker pixel (9) in a 1D numpy array (row).\n    Returns the index, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find indices where the value is 9\n    marker_indices = np.where(row_array == 9)[0]\n    # Assume only one marker based on examples\n    if len(marker_indices) > 0:\n        return marker_indices[0] \n    return -1 # Marker not found\n\ndef find_colored_block_in_row(row_array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start index, end index, and color of the contiguous \n    non-background (0), non-marker (9) block in a 1D numpy array (row).\n    Returns (start_index, end_index, color), or (-1, -1, -1) if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_start = -1\n    block_end = -1\n    block_color = -1\n    \n    # Iterate through the row to find the block\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(row_array):\n        # Check if the pixel is part of the colored block (not 0 and not 9)\n        if pixel != 0 and pixel != 9:\n            if block_start == -1:\n                # Found the start of a potential block\n                block_start = i\n                block_color = pixel\n            # Check if this is the end of the block\n            # End conditions: end of row OR next pixel is not the block color\n            if (i + 1 == len(row_array) or row_array[i+1] != block_color):\n                 block_end = i\n                 # Found the complete block, return its properties\n                 return block_start, block_end, block_color\n        elif block_start != -1:\n             # This handles cases where a block was started but interrupted\n             # by 0 or 9.
