*   **Perception:** The input consists of a 1D array (representing a row or flattened grid) containing mostly white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9), and a contiguous block of another color (gray '5' or magenta '6'). The transformation involves rearranging these elements. The maroon pixel seems to act as a pivot or marker. The colored block and the maroon pixel swap their relative order, while maintaining the number of white pixels that originally separated them.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array based on relative positions.
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: marker
        color: maroon (9)
        count: 1
        shape: single pixel
      - type: colored_block
        color: non-white, non-maroon (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6')
        shape: contiguous horizontal block
        count: 1
    relationships:
      - In the input, the colored_block is separated from the marker by a sequence of zero or more background pixels.
      - The order can be [colored_block] [background_gap] [marker] or potentially the reverse (though only the first case is shown).
    actions:
      - Identify the marker pixel and its index.
      - Identify the colored_block, its color, start index, and end index.
      - Identify the sequence of background pixels between the colored_block and the marker (the gap).
      - Reconstruct the array:
        - Start with a background-filled array of the same size.
        - Place the marker at its original index.
        - Place the identified background_gap sequence immediately after the marker.
        - Place the colored_block immediately after the background_gap sequence.
    transformation_result:
      - The relative order of the colored_block and the marker is swapped.
      - The background_gap sequence that was between them in the input is now placed between them in the output, but following the marker instead of preceding it.
      - The absolute position of the marker pixel remains unchanged.
      - The absolute position of the colored_block changes.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Find the index (`marker_index`) and color (`marker_color`, which is always maroon, 9) of the single marker pixel in the input grid.
    3.  Find the contiguous block of pixels that are not background (white, 0) and not the marker color (maroon, 9). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), and ending index (`block_end_index`).
    4.  Determine the sequence of background pixels (the `gap`) located between the end of the colored block and the marker pixel in the input grid. Specifically, identify the pixels from `block_end_index + 1` up to `marker_index - 1`. Record the length of this gap (`gap_length`).
    5.  Place the marker pixel (`marker_color`) in the output grid at the `marker_index`.
    6.  Place the `gap` sequence ( `gap_length` background pixels) in the output grid starting at `marker_index + 1`.
    7.  Place the colored block (using `block_color`) in the output grid starting at the index immediately following the gap, which is `marker_index + 1 + gap_length`. The block will extend for the same length as the original block (`block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).
```python
"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by swapping the relative positions of a single marker

**General Assessment:**

The provided execution results indicate that the Python code, intended to implement the observed transformation rule, failed to correctly modify the input grid for all training examples. The transformed output was identical to the input in each case, suggesting either a fundamental flaw in the code's execution flow (e.g., returning the input prematurely, failing to modify the output array) or an issue in the testing environment that reported the results.

However, the initial analysis of the input/output pairs and the derived natural language program seems conceptually correct based on comparing the *expected* outputs with the inputs. The rule appears to be: locate a marker (maroon/9) and a colored block (non-white/0, non-maroon/9); keep the marker's position fixed; move the colored block to the position immediately following the marker, preceded by the same number of white/0 pixels (gap) that originally separated the block and the marker.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Core Logic:** Use code execution to extract key features (marker position, block position/color/length, gap length) from both the input and *expected* output for each training example. This will confirm if the core understanding of the transformation (marker stays, block moves after marker + original gap) holds true.
2.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on the verified logic, ensuring clarity and precision.
3.  **Address Implementation:** The subsequent 'coder' phase must focus on correctly implementing this verified logic, ensuring the output grid is properly initialized and populated according to the rules, avoiding the errors seen in the previous execution.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array (single row grid) based on relative positions of a marker and a colored block.
input_grid_properties:
  - dimension: 1xN (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
elements:
  - type: marker
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    shape: single pixel
    properties:
      - index: location within the row
  - type: colored_block
    color: non-white (0), non-maroon (9) (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6')
    count: 1
    shape: contiguous horizontal block (length >= 1 pixel)
    properties:
      - start_index: index of the first pixel
      - end_index: index of the last pixel
      - color: the specific color of the block
      - length: number of pixels in the block
  - type: gap
    color: white (0)
    count: 1 (can be length 0)
    shape: contiguous horizontal block (potentially zero length)
    location: Between the colored_block and the marker in the input.
    properties:
      - length: number of white pixels between the block and marker.
relationships:
  - In the input row, the elements appear in the order: [optional leading background], [colored_block], [gap], [marker], [optional trailing background].
actions:
  - Identify the index of the marker pixel (`marker_index`).
  - Identify the colored_block: its start index (`block_start`), end index (`block_end`), color (`block_color`), and length (`block_length`).
  - Calculate the length of the gap (`gap_length`) between the `block_end` and `marker_index`.
  - Create a new output row of the same length as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
  - Place the marker pixel (maroon, 9) into the output row at the original `marker_index`.
  - Calculate the target start position for the colored block in the output row: `new_block_start = marker_index + 1 + gap_length`.
  - Place the colored block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) into the output row starting at `new_block_start`, ensuring placement does not exceed the row boundaries.
transformation_preserves:
  - Row length.
  - Background color.
  - Marker color and its index (`marker_index`).
  - Colored block's color and length.
  - Gap length (the number of background pixels separating the block and marker).
transformation_changes:
  - The absolute position (start and end indices) of the colored block.
  - The absolute position of the gap.
  - The relative order: In the output, the order becomes [marker], [gap], [colored_block].
output_grid_properties:
  - Same dimensions and background color as input.
  - Contains the marker at its original index.
  - Contains the gap (as background pixels) immediately following the marker.
  - Contains the colored block immediately following the gap.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Given a 1xN input grid (a single row) containing a background color (white, 0), a single marker pixel (maroon, 9), and one contiguous block of another color (non-white, non-maroon).
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Locate the index (`marker_index`) of the marker pixel (maroon, 9) in the input row.
4.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels in the input row. Record its color (`block_color`), its start index (`block_start_index`), and its end index (`block_end_index`). Calculate its length: `block_length = block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`.
5.  Calculate the length of the sequence of background pixels (the gap) between the end of the colored block and the marker pixel in the input row: `gap_length = marker_index - (block_end_index + 1)`. If `marker_index <= block_end_index + 1`, the `gap_length` is 0.
6.  Place the marker pixel (maroon, 9) into the output row at the `marker_index`.
7.  Calculate the starting index for placing the colored block in the output row: `new_block_start_index = marker_index + 1 + gap_length`.
8.  Place the colored block into the output row: starting at `new_block_start_index`, fill the next `block_length` pixels with `block_color`, ensuring not to write past the end of the output row.
9.  Return the modified output row, formatted as a 1xN grid.
