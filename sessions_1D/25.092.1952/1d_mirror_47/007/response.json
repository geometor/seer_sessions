The marker pixel maintains its original column \nindex. The colored block is moved to the position immediately following the \nmarker, preserving the length of any gap of background pixels (color 0) \nthat originally existed between the block and the marker. In the output row, \nthe marker is followed by the gap (represented by background pixels), which \nis then followed by the colored block.
