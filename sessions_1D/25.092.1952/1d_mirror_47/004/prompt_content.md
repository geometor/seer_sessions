"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by rearranging elements within the single row. 
It identifies a single marker pixel (color 9) and a contiguous block of 
another color (non-0, non-9). The marker pixel maintains its original column 
index. The colored block is moved to the position immediately following the 
marker, preserving the length of any gap of background pixels (color 0) 
that originally existed between the block and the marker. In the output row, 
the marker is followed by the gap (if any), which is then followed by the 
colored block.
