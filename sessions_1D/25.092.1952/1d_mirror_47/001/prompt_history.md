*   **Perception:** The input consists of a 1D array (representing a row or flattened grid) containing mostly white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9), and a contiguous block of another color (gray '5' or magenta '6'). The transformation involves rearranging these elements. The maroon pixel seems to act as a pivot or marker. The colored block and the maroon pixel swap their relative order, while maintaining the number of white pixels that originally separated them.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array based on relative positions.
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: marker
        color: maroon (9)
        count: 1
        shape: single pixel
      - type: colored_block
        color: non-white, non-maroon (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6')
        shape: contiguous horizontal block
        count: 1
    relationships:
      - In the input, the colored_block is separated from the marker by a sequence of zero or more background pixels.
      - The order can be [colored_block] [background_gap] [marker] or potentially the reverse (though only the first case is shown).
    actions:
      - Identify the marker pixel and its index.
      - Identify the colored_block, its color, start index, and end index.
      - Identify the sequence of background pixels between the colored_block and the marker (the gap).
      - Reconstruct the array:
        - Start with a background-filled array of the same size.
        - Place the marker at its original index.
        - Place the identified background_gap sequence immediately after the marker.
        - Place the colored_block immediately after the background_gap sequence.
    transformation_result:
      - The relative order of the colored_block and the marker is swapped.
      - The background_gap sequence that was between them in the input is now placed between them in the output, but following the marker instead of preceding it.
      - The absolute position of the marker pixel remains unchanged.
      - The absolute position of the colored_block changes.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Find the index (`marker_index`) and color (`marker_color`, which is always maroon, 9) of the single marker pixel in the input grid.
    3.  Find the contiguous block of pixels that are not background (white, 0) and not the marker color (maroon, 9). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), and ending index (`block_end_index`).
    4.  Determine the sequence of background pixels (the `gap`) located between the end of the colored block and the marker pixel in the input grid. Specifically, identify the pixels from `block_end_index + 1` up to `marker_index - 1`. Record the length of this gap (`gap_length`).
    5.  Place the marker pixel (`marker_color`) in the output grid at the `marker_index`.
    6.  Place the `gap` sequence ( `gap_length` background pixels) in the output grid starting at `marker_index + 1`.
    7.  Place the colored block (using `block_color`) in the output grid starting at the index immediately following the gap, which is `marker_index + 1 + gap_length`. The block will extend for the same length as the original block (`block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).
