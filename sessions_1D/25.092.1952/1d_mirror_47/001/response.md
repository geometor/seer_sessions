```python
"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by swapping the relative positions of a single marker 
pixel (color 9) and a contiguous block of another color (non-0, non-9). 
The marker pixel maintains its original absolute position. The block of color 
is moved to the position immediately following the marker, preserving any 
gap of background pixels (color 0) that originally existed between the block 
and the marker. The gap is placed immediately after the marker, followed by 
the block.
