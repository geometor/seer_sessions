task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array (single row grid) based on relative positions of a marker and a colored block.
input_grid_properties:
  - dimension: 1xN (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
elements:
  - type: marker
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    shape: single pixel
    properties:
      - index: location within the row
  - type: colored_block
    color: non-white (0), non-maroon (9) (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6')
    count: 1
    shape: contiguous horizontal block (length >= 1 pixel)
    properties:
      - start_index: index of the first pixel
      - end_index: index of the last pixel
      - color: the specific color of the block
      - length: number of pixels in the block
  - type: gap
    color: white (0)
    count: 1 (can be length 0)
    shape: contiguous horizontal block (potentially zero length)
    location: Between the colored_block and the marker in the input.
    properties:
      - length: number of white pixels between the block and marker.
relationships:
  - In the input row, the elements appear in the order: [optional leading background], [colored_block], [gap], [marker], [optional trailing background].
actions:
  - Identify the index of the marker pixel (`marker_index`).
  - Identify the colored_block: its start index (`block_start`), end index (`block_end`), color (`block_color`), and length (`block_length`).
  - Calculate the length of the gap (`gap_length`) between the `block_end` and `marker_index`.
  - Create a new output row of the same length as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
  - Place the marker pixel (maroon, 9) into the output row at the original `marker_index`.
  - Calculate the target start position for the colored block in the output row: `new_block_start = marker_index + 1 + gap_length`.
  - Place the colored block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) into the output row starting at `new_block_start`, ensuring placement does not exceed the row boundaries.
transformation_preserves:
  - Row length.
  - Background color.
  - Marker color and its index (`marker_index`).
  - Colored block's color and length.
  - Gap length (the number of background pixels separating the block and marker).
transformation_changes:
  - The absolute position (start and end indices) of the colored block.
  - The absolute position of the gap.
  - The relative order: In the output, the order becomes [marker], [gap], [colored_block].
output_grid_properties:
  - Same dimensions and background color as input.
  - Contains the marker at its original index.
  - Contains the gap (as background pixels) immediately following the marker.
  - Contains the colored block immediately following the gap.
