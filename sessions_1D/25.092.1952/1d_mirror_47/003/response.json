The marker pixel maintains its original column \nindex. The colored block is moved to the position immediately following the \nmarker, preserving the length of any gap of background pixels (color 0) \nthat originally existed between the block and the marker. In the output row, \nthe marker is followed by the gap (if any), which is then followed by the \ncolored block.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_marker_in_row(row_array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the column index of the marker pixel (9) in a 1D numpy array (row).\n    Returns the index, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    marker_indices = np.where(row_array == 9)[0]\n    if len(marker_indices) > 0:\n        return marker_indices[0] # Assume only one marker as per examples\n    return -1\n\ndef find_colored_block_in_row(row_array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start index, end index, and color of the contiguous \n    non-background (0), non-marker (9) block in a 1D numpy array (row).\n    Returns (start_index, end_index, color), or (-1, -1, -1) if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_start = -1\n    block_end = -1\n    block_color = -1\n    \n    for i, pixel in enumerate(row_array):\n        # Check if the pixel is part of the colored block\n        if pixel != 0 and pixel != 9:\n            if block_start == -1:\n                # Found the start of a potential block\n                block_start = i\n                block_color = pixel\n            # Continue checking if the current pixel matches the block color\n            # This handles the case where the block is just one pixel long\n            # The end condition checks if we are at the end of the row OR\n            # if the next pixel is NOT the same color as the current block\n            if (i + 1 == len(row_array) or row_array[i+1] != block_color):\n                 block_end = i\n                 # Found the end of the block, return its properties\n                 return block_start, block_end, block_color\n        elif block_start != -1:\n             # This case should not be reached if the block is contiguous and \n             # the previous end condition works correctly, but serves as a safeguard.\n             # If we started a block and now encounter 0 or 9, the block ended previously.\n             # The return inside the 'if' block should have triggered.\n             pass # Should be handled by the end condition check\n\n    # If no block was found after iterating through the whole row\n    return block_start, block_end, block_color\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid (assumed 1xN).\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): A 1xN grid represented as a list containing one list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed 1xN grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Ensure input is treated as a 2D grid and extract the first row\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or not input_grid or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be a non-empty list of lists.\")\n        \n    input_row = input_grid[0]\n    input_row_array = np.array(input_row, dtype=int)\n    row_size = len(input_row_array)\n    \n    # Initialize output_row with background color (0)\n    output_row_array = np.zeros_like(input_row_array)\n\n    # 1.
