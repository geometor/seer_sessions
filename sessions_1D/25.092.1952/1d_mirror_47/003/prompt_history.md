*   **Perception:** The input consists of a 1D array (representing a row or flattened grid) containing mostly white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9), and a contiguous block of another color (gray '5' or magenta '6'). The transformation involves rearranging these elements. The maroon pixel seems to act as a pivot or marker. The colored block and the maroon pixel swap their relative order, while maintaining the number of white pixels that originally separated them.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D array based on relative positions.
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: marker
        color: maroon (9)
        count: 1
        shape: single pixel
      - type: colored_block
        color: non-white, non-maroon (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6')
        shape: contiguous horizontal block
        count: 1
    relationships:
      - In the input, the colored_block is separated from the marker by a sequence of zero or more background pixels.
      - The order can be [colored_block] [background_gap] [marker] or potentially the reverse (though only the first case is shown).
    actions:
      - Identify the marker pixel and its index.
      - Identify the colored_block, its color, start index, and end index.
      - Identify the sequence of background pixels between the colored_block and the marker (the gap).
      - Reconstruct the array:
        - Start with a background-filled array of the same size.
        - Place the marker at its original index.
        - Place the identified background_gap sequence immediately after the marker.
        - Place the colored_block immediately after the background_gap sequence.
    transformation_result:
      - The relative order of the colored_block and the marker is swapped.
      - The background_gap sequence that was between them in the input is now placed between them in the output, but following the marker instead of preceding it.
      - The absolute position of the marker pixel remains unchanged.
      - The absolute position of the colored_block changes.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Find the index (`marker_index`) and color (`marker_color`, which is always maroon, 9) of the single marker pixel in the input grid.
    3.  Find the contiguous block of pixels that are not background (white, 0) and not the marker color (maroon, 9). Record its color (`block_color`), starting index (`block_start_index`), and ending index (`block_end_index`).
    4.  Determine the sequence of background pixels (the `gap`) located between the end of the colored block and the marker pixel in the input grid. Specifically, identify the pixels from `block_end_index + 1` up to `marker_index - 1`. Record the length of this gap (`gap_length`).
    5.  Place the marker pixel (`marker_color`) in the output grid at the `marker_index`.
    6.  Place the `gap` sequence ( `gap_length` background pixels) in the output grid starting at `marker_index + 1`.
    7.  Place the colored block (using `block_color`) in the output grid starting at the index immediately following the gap, which is `marker_index + 1 + gap_length`. The block will extend for the same length as the original block (`block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The provided code failed on all training examples with the same NumPy error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous." This strongly suggests that an operation intended for a single scalar value (like `if pixel == 9:`) is instead being performed on an array, likely because the input grid is being treated as a 2D array (even if it only has one row), and iteration or comparison is happening row-wise instead of element-wise within the row.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the dimensionality of the input as processed by NumPy.
2.  Adjust the code logic and descriptions to explicitly handle the input as a 2D grid, likely operating specifically on the first row since all examples seem to be 1xN.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this 2D structure and row-based operation.

## Metrics and Verification

```

**Findings:**
1.  The input `input_grid_1` when converted via `np.array()` results in a 2D array with shape (1, 26).
2.  Iterating directly over this 2D array (`for i, element in enumerate(grid_to_search):`) yields the entire first row as the first `element`.
3.  Comparing this row `element` to the scalar `9` (`if element == 9:`) correctly raises the `ValueError: The truth value of an array... is ambiguous.`
4.  Explicitly accessing the first row (`input_array[0]`) and iterating over its pixels allows the logic in `find_marker` and `find_colored_block` to proceed correctly.

## Updated YAML Facts

```
yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements within a single row of a 2D grid based on relative positions.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  size: 1 row, variable number of columns (N)
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: marker
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1 per row
    shape: single pixel
    location: within the single row
  - type: colored_block
    color: non-white, non-maroon (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6')
    shape: contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1 per row
    location: within the single row
relationships:
  - In the input row, the colored_block is separated from the marker by a sequence of zero or more background pixels (the gap).
  - The block always appears before the marker in the input examples.
actions:
  - Target the first (and only) row of the input grid.
  - Identify the marker pixel's column index (`marker_col`) within the row.
  - Identify the colored_block: its color (`block_color`), start column index (`block_start_col`), and end column index (`block_end_col`) within the row.
  - Calculate the length of the gap (`gap_length`) between the block and the marker: `gap_length = marker_col - (block_end_col + 1)`. If `marker_col <= block_end_col + 1`, the gap length is 0.
  - Reconstruct the output row:
    - Initialize an output row of the same length, filled with the background color (0).
    - Place the marker pixel (color 9) at `marker_col` in the output row.
    - Calculate the new start column for the block: `new_block_start_col = marker_col + 1 + gap_length`.
    - Place the colored_block (using `block_color`) in the output row, starting at `new_block_start_col` and extending for its original length (`block_end_col - block_start_col + 1`). Ensure placement does not exceed row bounds.
transformation_result:
  - Creates an output grid of the same dimensions (1xN).
  - The single row contains the rearranged elements.
  - The marker pixel maintains its original column index within the row.
  - The relative order of the colored_block and the marker is swapped within the row.
  - The background_gap sequence is preserved and placed between the marker and the block in their new order.
