task_description: Move a colored horizontal line relative to a fixed separator pixel.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
input_objects:
  - object: colored_line
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    color: Any color except white (0) or maroon (9).
    properties:
      - length: (variable)
      - start_column: (variable)
      - end_column: (variable)
      - color: (variable, e.g., blue, green)
    position: Always to the left of the separator_pixel.
  - object: separator_pixel
    description: A single pixel marking a reference point.
    color: maroon (9)
    properties:
      - column_index: (variable)
  - object: background
    description: Remaining pixels.
    color: white (0)
transformation:
  action: Relocate the 'colored_line'.
  reference_object: 'separator_pixel'.
  invariant_objects:
    - 'separator_pixel' (position remains unchanged).
    - 'background' (white pixels remain white).
  rule:
    - Identify the 'colored_line' (color, length, start_column).
    - Identify the 'separator_pixel' (column_index).
    - Calculate the new start column for the 'colored_line': `separator_pixel.column_index + 2`.
    - Construct the output grid:
      - Initialize with the background color (white).
      - Place the 'separator_pixel' at its original column_index.
      - Place the 'colored_line' (with original color and length) starting at the calculated new start column.
output_grid:
  structure: Same dimensions as input.
  content:
    - Contains the background color (white).
    - Contains the 'separator_pixel' at its original position.
    - Contains the 'colored_line', moved to the right of the 'separator_pixel', starting 2 columns away from it.
