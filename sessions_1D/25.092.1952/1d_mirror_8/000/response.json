Each input grid contains three types of elements:\n1.  A background color, which is white (0).\n2.  A single \"separator\" pixel, which is maroon (9).\n3.  A contiguous horizontal line of a single color (e.g., blue (1) or green (3)). This line is always located to the left of the maroon pixel.\n\nThe transformation involves relocating the colored line. The maroon pixel and the white background pixels remain fixed in their positions. The colored line is moved from its original position to a new position to the right of the maroon pixel. Specifically, the starting position of the moved line is two columns to the right of the maroon pixel's position. The color and length of the line are preserved during the move.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"

Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but replace all pixels that are not the maroon separator pixel (9) with the white background color (0). This ensures the maroon pixel stays in place and the rest is cleared for the moved line.\n2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal line of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) color in the input grid. Determine its color and length.\n3.  Find the column index of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid.\n4.  Calculate the starting column index for the moved line in the output grid by adding 2 to the column index of the maroon pixel.\n5.  Place the identified colored line (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new column index."
