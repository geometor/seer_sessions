Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception of Task Elements

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains three types of elements:
1.  A background color, which is white (0).
2.  A single "separator" pixel, which is maroon (9).
3.  A contiguous horizontal line of a single color (e.g., blue (1) or green (3)). This line is always located to the left of the maroon pixel.

The transformation involves relocating the colored line. The maroon pixel and the white background pixels remain fixed in their positions. The colored line is moved from its original position to a new position to the right of the maroon pixel. Specifically, the starting position of the moved line is two columns to the right of the maroon pixel's position. The color and length of the line are preserved during the move.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored horizontal line relative to a fixed separator pixel.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
input_objects:
  - object: colored_line
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    color: Any color except white (0) or maroon (9).
    properties:
      - length: (variable)
      - start_column: (variable)
      - end_column: (variable)
      - color: (variable, e.g., blue, green)
    position: Always to the left of the separator_pixel.
  - object: separator_pixel
    description: A single pixel marking a reference point.
    color: maroon (9)
    properties:
      - column_index: (variable)
  - object: background
    description: Remaining pixels.
    color: white (0)
transformation:
  action: Relocate the 'colored_line'.
  reference_object: 'separator_pixel'.
  invariant_objects:
    - 'separator_pixel' (position remains unchanged).
    - 'background' (white pixels remain white).
  rule:
    - Identify the 'colored_line' (color, length, start_column).
    - Identify the 'separator_pixel' (column_index).
    - Calculate the new start column for the 'colored_line': `separator_pixel.column_index + 2`.
    - Construct the output grid:
      - Initialize with the background color (white).
      - Place the 'separator_pixel' at its original column_index.
      - Place the 'colored_line' (with original color and length) starting at the calculated new start column.
output_grid:
  structure: Same dimensions as input.
  content:
    - Contains the background color (white).
    - Contains the 'separator_pixel' at its original position.
    - Contains the 'colored_line', moved to the right of the 'separator_pixel', starting 2 columns away from it.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but replace all pixels that are not the maroon separator pixel (9) with the white background color (0). This ensures the maroon pixel stays in place and the rest is cleared for the moved line.
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal line of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) color in the input grid. Determine its color and length.
3.  Find the column index of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid.
4.  Calculate the starting column index for the moved line in the output grid by adding 2 to the column index of the maroon pixel.
5.  Place the identified colored line (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new column index.
