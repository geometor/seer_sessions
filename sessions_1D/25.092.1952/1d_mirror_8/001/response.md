Move a colored horizontal line relative to a fixed separator pixel (maroon, 9).

1. Initialize the output grid with the background color (white, 0).
2. Find the position (index) of the maroon separator pixel (9) in the input grid.
3. Place the maroon separator pixel at the same position in the output grid.
4. Identify the contiguous horizontal line of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9) in the input grid. Determine its color and length.
5. Calculate the new starting position for this colored line in the output grid: it should be 2 positions to the right of the maroon separator pixel's position.
6. Draw the colored line (with its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated new position.
