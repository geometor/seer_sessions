            "text": "*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating a 1-dimensional sequence of pixels. Each example consists of an input sequence and a corresponding output sequence of the same length (22 pixels). The sequences contain three types of elements: a background of white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9) acting as a fixed marker, and a contiguous line of pixels of another single color (gray-5, magenta-6, or orange-7). The transformation involves moving the colored line relative to the fixed maroon marker. The line's original position is filled with white pixels. The line's new position is determined by the location of the maroon marker and the number of white pixels immediately preceding the marker.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the `colored_line`). Record its color (`line_color`), length (`line_length`), start index (`line_start_index`), and end index (`line_end_index`).\n    3.  Calculate the length of the sequence of white pixels (0) located strictly between the end of the `colored_line` and the `marker_index`. This is `gap_before_length = marker_index - (line_end_index + 1)`.\n    4.  Find the index of the first white pixel (0) that occurs immediately after the `marker_index`. This is `first_white_after_marker_index`.\n    5.  Calculate the new starting index for the `colored_line`: `new_line_start_index = first_white_after_marker_index + gap_before_length`.\n    6.  Create the output array by first making a copy of the input array.\n    7.  In the output array, replace the pixels from `line_start_index` to `line_end_index` (the original position of the `colored_line`) with white pixels (0).\n    8.  In the output array, place the `colored_line` (using `line_color` and `line_length`) starting at the calculated `new_line_start_index`.\n    9.  Return the modified array."
