Identify the single maroon pixel (9) marker and its index.\n3.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels (the colored line), recording its color, length, start index, and end index.\n4.  Calculate the gap length: the number of white pixels (0) strictly between the end of the colored line and the marker index.\n5.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored line: the index immediately after the marker plus the calculated gap length.\n6.  Create the output row by copying the input row.\n7.  In the output row, erase the original colored line by setting its pixels to white (0).\n8.  In the output row, draw the colored line (same color and length) starting at the calculated new position, ensuring it stays within the row bounds.\n9.
