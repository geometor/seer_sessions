            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern: moving a colored block from before a maroon pivot pixel (9) to after it, preserving the separation distance (number of white pixels). The Python code implements this logic using NumPy.\n\nThe error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` indicates that an `if` statement (or another context requiring a single boolean) received a NumPy array of booleans instead. However, simulating the code logic with the provided examples using `tool_code` did not reproduce this error; all conditional checks evaluated to single boolean values (`numpy.bool_`).\n\nThis suggests the error likely stems from:\n1.  **Input Discrepancy:** The actual input passed to the `transform` function by the testing harness might not be a simple 1D list/array as assumed, or might have unexpected properties not present in the examples.\n2.  **Environment/Execution Issue:** An issue in how the code is executed or interacts with the specific NumPy version or testing framework.\n3.  **Subtle Code Bug:** A minor error in the original code (potentially different from the simulation) or an edge case not covered by the provided examples.\n\nGiven the successful simulation, the core logic described in the natural language program and YAML appears sound for the observed examples. The strategy is to refine the documentation for clarity and assume the underlying logic is correct, pending further information if the error persists with corrected execution.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by simulating the process for each training example:\n\n"
