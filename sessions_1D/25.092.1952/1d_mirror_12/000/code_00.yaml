task_description: Move a colored block relative to a fixed pivot pixel in a 1D grid.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 1D sequence of pixels.
    properties:
      length: 22 (consistent across examples)
      background_color: 0 (white)

  - type: object
    name: pivot_pixel
    description: A single pixel that acts as a reference point for the transformation.
    properties:
      color: 9 (maroon)
      position: Fixed within the grid (index 9 in train_1, index 11 in train_2, index 13 in train_3). The exact index varies, but its position within a given example is constant between input and output.
      count: 1

  - type: object
    name: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color (not background or pivot color).
    properties:
      color: Variable (3-green, 2-red, 4-yellow in examples)
      shape: 1D contiguous block
      size: Variable (length 5, 6, 6 in examples)
      count: 1

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: movable_block
    object2: pivot_pixel
    input_state: movable_block is located before the pivot_pixel.
    output_state: movable_block is located after the pivot_pixel.

  - type: distance
    object1: movable_block
    object2: pivot_pixel
    measure: Number of background pixels (white) separating the two objects.
    property: This distance is conserved between the input and output state. If distance `d` separates the end of the block from the pivot in the input, then distance `d` separates the pivot from the start of the block in the output.

actions:
  - name: identify_elements
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color, pivot_pixel, movable_block
    description: Find the background color, the pivot pixel (maroon), and the contiguous block of another color.

  - name: calculate_parameters
    inputs: input_grid, pivot_pixel, movable_block
    outputs: block_color, block_size, block_start_index, pivot_index, separation_distance
    description: Determine the color, size, and start index of the movable block, the index of the pivot pixel, and the number of background pixels between the block and the pivot in the input.

  - name: construct_output
    inputs: grid_length, background_color, pivot_pixel, pivot_index, movable_block_color, movable_block_size, separation_distance
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by placing the pivot pixel at its original position, placing the movable block after the pivot pixel maintaining the calculated separation distance, and filling the rest with the background color.
