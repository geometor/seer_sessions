            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output are presented as sequences of numbers. Given the length (22) and the nature of ARC tasks, this likely represents a 1D grid or possibly a flattened 2D grid (e.g., 2x11 or 11x2). However, the transformation appears consistent with a 1D interpretation.\n2.  **Colors**: The examples use white (0), green (3), red (2), yellow (4), and maroon (9). White seems to be the background color. Maroon (9) appears to be a special, fixed element. The other colors (green, red, yellow) form contiguous blocks that are manipulated.\n3.  **Objects**:\n    *   There is a background of white pixels (0).\n    *   There is a single, stationary pivot pixel: maroon (9).\n    *   There is a single contiguous block of another color (e.g., `3 3 3 3 3`, `2 2 2 2 2 2`, `4 4 4 4 4 4`). This block acts as the primary object being transformed.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves changing the position of the colored block relative to the maroon pivot pixel.\n    *   In all examples, the colored block starts *before* (to the left of) the maroon pixel in the input.\n    *   In the output, the colored block is moved to be *after* (to the right of) the maroon pixel.\n    *   The maroon pixel itself does not move.\n    *   The distance (measured in the number of white pixels) between the colored block and the maroon pixel is preserved during the move. For example, if there were 3 white pixels between the end of the block and the maroon pixel in the input, there will be 3 white pixels between the maroon pixel and the start of the block in the output.\n5.  **Consistency**: The length of the grid, the position of the maroon pixel, and the size/color of the movable block remain unchanged. Only the position of the movable block changes.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify the single pivot pixel (maroon, 9) in the input grid and note its index (`pivot_index`). Place this pivot pixel at the same `pivot_index` in the output grid.\n3.  Identify the contiguous block of a single color (that is not white or maroon) in the input grid. Note its color (`block_color`), its length (`block_size`), and the index where it starts (`input_block_start_index`).\n4.  Calculate the separation distance (`separation_distance`) in the input grid. This is the number of white pixels between the end of the colored block and the pivot pixel. The end index of the block is `input_block_start_index + block_size - 1`. The distance is `pivot_index - (input_block_start_index + block_size)`.\n5.  Determine the starting index for the colored block in the output grid (`output_block_start_index`). This index is calculated by starting after the pivot pixel and skipping the `separation_distance`: `output_block_start_index = pivot_index + 1 + separation_distance`.\n6.  Place the colored block (using `block_color` and `block_size`) into the output grid starting at `output_block_start_index`.\n7.  Ensure all other positions in the output grid (not occupied by the pivot pixel or the moved block) are filled with the background color (white, 0).\n8.  Return the constructed output grid."
