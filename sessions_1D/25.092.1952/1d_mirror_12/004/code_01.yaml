task_description: Relocate a colored block in a 1D grid based on its position relative to a fixed pivot pixel (maroon, 9), conserving the separation distance.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 1D sequence of pixels.
    properties:
      length: Variable (22 in all examples)
      background_color: 0 (white)

  - type: object
    name: pivot_pixel
    description: A single, fixed reference pixel.
    properties:
      color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1 (Assumed based on examples)
      position: Its index remains constant between input and output grid for a given example.

  - type: object
    name: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, distinct from background and pivot colors.
    properties:
      color: Variable (e.g., 3-green, 2-red, 4-yellow)
      shape: 1D contiguous block
      size: Variable (e.g., 5, 6)
      count: 1 (Assumed based on examples)
      input_position: Located entirely before the pivot_pixel.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    object1: movable_block
    object2: pivot_pixel
    property: separation_distance
    measure: Number of background pixels (white) between the end index of movable_block and the index of pivot_pixel in the input grid.
    conservation: This separation_distance is maintained in the output grid, measured between the pivot_pixel index and the start index of the relocated movable_block.

actions:
  - name: identify_components
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color, pivot_pixel_index, block_properties(color, size, start_index)
    description: Scan the input grid to find the background color (0), the index of the pivot pixel (9), and the color, size, and start index of the single contiguous movable block. Validate that exactly one pivot and one block exist, and the block is entirely before the pivot.

  - name: calculate_parameters
    inputs: input_grid, pivot_pixel_index, block_properties
    outputs: separation_distance, output_block_start_index
    description: Calculate the number of background pixels between the block's end and the pivot in the input (`separation_distance`). Calculate the target start index for the block in the output grid using `pivot_pixel_index + 1 + separation_distance`.

  - name: construct_output_grid
    inputs: grid_size, background_color, pivot_pixel_index, pivot_color, block_color, block_size, output_block_start_index
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create a new grid of the original size filled with the background color. Place the pivot pixel at its original index. Place the movable block (with its color and size) starting at the calculated `output_block_start_index`, ensuring it fits within the grid boundaries.
