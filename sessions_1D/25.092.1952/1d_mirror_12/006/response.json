            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: moving a colored block relative to a fixed pivot point (maroon pixel '9') while preserving the separation distance. However, the provided Python code failed execution with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This specific error usually occurs in NumPy when a boolean array (resulting from element-wise comparisons like `array == value`) is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if array == value:` instead of `if (array == value).any():` or `if (array == value).all():`).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-examine the input data structure. Although presented as a flat list, ARC grids are fundamentally 2D. The code treats it as 1D. This might be the source of the error if iterating over a 2D array yields rows/columns instead of scalars.\n2.  Use `tool_code` to verify the input structure and dimensions for the provided examples.\n3.  Pinpoint the exact line in the code causing the ambiguous boolean array error.\n4.  Adjust the data handling (potentially reshaping the input) and the logic within the `find_pivot` and `find_movable_block` functions, and the main `transform` function to correctly operate on the 2D grid structure.\n5.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the 2D nature and refined logic.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the input structure and simulate the initial steps of the failing code for the first example."

They are single-row grids.\n2.  **Error Cause:** The `ValueError` is confirmed to occur because the code attempts element-wise comparisons (`!=`) between a NumPy array (a row of the grid, treated as `pixel` or `element` during iteration) and a scalar integer (`background_color` or `pivot_color`). These comparisons produce boolean arrays, which cannot be evaluated as single truth values in standard Python `if` statements. The `find_pivot` function's check `len(pivot_indices) == 1` also fails because `np.where` on a 2D array returns a tuple of length 2 (one array for each dimension's indices).\n3.  **Pivot Location:** The pivot pixel (9) is consistently found in the single row (row 0), at varying column indices (9, 11, 13).\n4.  **Block Location:** The movable block also resides entirely within the single row (row 0).\n5.  **Transformation Context:** The task remains moving a contiguous block within that single row, relative to the pivot in the same row, preserving the column separation.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Reshape the input list into a 2D NumPy array with shape `(1, N)`, where N is the list length. Define the background color as 0 and the pivot color as 9.\n2.  Initialize an output grid (2D NumPy array) of the same shape `(1, N)`, filled with the background color (0).\n3.  Locate the pivot pixel (color 9) within the input grid's single row (row 0). Find its column index, `pivot_col`. If exactly one pivot pixel is not found, return the original input grid.\n4.  Place the pivot pixel (color 9) into the output grid at position `(0, pivot_col)`.\n5.  Scan the input grid's single row (row 0) to find the first contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither the background color (0) nor the pivot color (9). Record its color (`block_color`), starting column index (`input_block_start_col`), and length (`block_size`). If no such block is found, return the output grid containing only the placed pivot pixel.\n6.  Verify that the identified block in the input grid lies entirely to the left of the pivot pixel (i.e., `input_block_start_col + block_size - 1 < pivot_col`). If not, return the original input grid as the transformation rule doesn't apply.\n7.  Calculate the horizontal separation distance (`separation_distance`) in the input grid. This is the number of columns between the end of the block and the pivot: `separation_distance = pivot_col - (input_block_start_col + block_size)`.\n8.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the output grid: `output_block_start_col = pivot_col + 1 + separation_distance`.\n9.  Determine the ending column index for the block in the output grid (exclusive): `output_block_end_col = output_block_start_col + block_size`.\n10. Place the movable block into the output grid's row 0. The block should start at `output_block_start_col` and have color `block_color`. Ensure the block does not write past the grid boundary: use columns from `output_block_start_col` up to, but not including, `min(output_block_end_col, N)`. If `output_block_start_col` is already outside the grid (i.e., `>= N`), the block cannot be placed.\n11. Convert the final 2D output NumPy array back into a flat list and return it."
