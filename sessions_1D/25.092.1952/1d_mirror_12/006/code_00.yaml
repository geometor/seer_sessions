task_description: >
  Move a contiguous colored block horizontally within a single-row grid,
  relative to a fixed pivot pixel (maroon, 9). The horizontal separation
  between the block and the pivot is preserved.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D grid, specifically observed as having 1 row and N columns.
    properties:
      shape: (1, N) where N=22 in examples.
      background_color: 0 (white)

  - type: object
    name: pivot_pixel
    description: A single pixel that acts as a reference point for the transformation.
    properties:
      color: 9 (maroon)
      position: Fixed row index 0; column index varies but is constant between input/output for a given example (col 9, 11, 13 in examples).
      count: 1

  - type: object
    name: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color within the single row (not background or pivot color).
    properties:
      color: Variable (3-green, 2-red, 4-yellow in examples)
      shape: Horizontal contiguous block within row 0.
      size: Variable (length 5, 6, 6 in examples)
      location: Resides entirely within row 0.
      count: 1

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: movable_block
    object2: pivot_pixel
    dimension: Horizontal (columns within row 0)
    input_state: movable_block is located entirely to the left of the pivot_pixel's column.
    output_state: movable_block is located entirely to the right of the pivot_pixel's column.

  - type: distance
    object1: movable_block
    object2: pivot_pixel
    measure: Number of background pixels (white) separating the two objects horizontally within row 0.
    property: >
      This horizontal separation distance is conserved between the input and output state.
      If distance `d` columns separate the end of the block from the pivot column in the input,
      then distance `d` columns separate the pivot column from the start of the block column in the output.

actions:
  - name: identify_elements
    inputs: input_grid (2D numpy array, shape (1, N))
    outputs: background_color, pivot_index (column), movable_block (color, start_col, size)
    description: >
      Find the background color (0). In row 0, find the column index of the pivot pixel (9).
      Also in row 0, find the contiguous block of another color, its color, starting column index, and length (size).

  - name: calculate_parameters
    inputs: input_grid (row 0), pivot_col, block_start_col, block_size
    outputs: separation_distance
    description: >
      Calculate the horizontal separation distance in the input row 0.
      This is the number of background pixels between the block's last column
      (`block_start_col + block_size - 1`) and the `pivot_col`.
      Distance = `pivot_col - (block_start_col + block_size)`.

  - name: construct_output
    inputs: grid_shape (1, N), background_color, pivot_col, pivot_color, block_color, block_size, separation_distance
    outputs: output_grid (2D numpy array, shape (1, N))
    description: >
      Create an output grid of the same shape, filled with the background color.
      Place the pivot pixel (color 9) at `(0, pivot_col)`.
      Calculate the output block's starting column: `output_block_start_col = pivot_col + 1 + separation_distance`.
      Place the movable block (using `block_color` and `block_size`) into row 0
      starting at `output_block_start_col`, ensuring it doesn't exceed grid boundaries.
