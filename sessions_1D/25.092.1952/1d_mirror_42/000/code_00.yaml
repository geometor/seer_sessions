Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (1xN)
  Background: White (0)
Elements:
  - Pivot:
      Color: Maroon (9)
      Quantity: 1
      Position: Fixed (remains unchanged between input and output)
  - Object:
      Type: Contiguous block of pixels
      Color: Non-white (0) and Non-maroon (9) (e.g., Red(2), Yellow(4), Blue(1))
      Quantity: 1
      Property: Moves relative to the Pivot
Relationship:
  - Object and Pivot are separated by a gap of one or more White (0) pixels.
Transformation:
  - Action: Move Object
  - Reference: Pivot (Maroon pixel)
  - Rule:
      1. The Object is relocated to the opposite side of the Pivot.
      2. The distance (number of White pixels) between the Object and the Pivot is maintained during the relocation.
      3. The Pivot's position remains constant.
      4. The rest of the grid becomes the Background color (White).
