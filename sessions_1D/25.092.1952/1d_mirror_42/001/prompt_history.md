**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 1D grids (or 1xN arrays) of the same size.
2.  **Key Colors/Pixels:**
    *   White (0) acts as the background.
    *   Maroon (9) appears exactly once in each grid and seems to serve as a fixed pivot or reference point.
    *   A single contiguous block of another color (red (2), yellow (4), or blue (1)) exists in each input grid. This block constitutes the primary "object".
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   The maroon pixel (9) remains in the exact same position in the output as it was in the input.
    *   The contiguous block of the other color (the object) moves from one side of the maroon pixel to the other.
    *   The number of white pixels (0) separating the object block from the maroon pixel in the input is preserved in the output on the opposite side.
    *   All other pixels in the grid become white (0).

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (1xN)
  Background: White (0)
Elements:
  - Pivot:
      Color: Maroon (9)
      Quantity: 1
      Position: Fixed (remains unchanged between input and output)
  - Object:
      Type: Contiguous block of pixels
      Color: Non-white (0) and Non-maroon (9) (e.g., Red(2), Yellow(4), Blue(1))
      Quantity: 1
      Property: Moves relative to the Pivot
Relationship:
  - Object and Pivot are separated by a gap of one or more White (0) pixels.
Transformation:
  - Action: Move Object
  - Reference: Pivot (Maroon pixel)
  - Rule:
      1. The Object is relocated to the opposite side of the Pivot.
      2. The distance (number of White pixels) between the Object and the Pivot is maintained during the relocation.
      3. The Pivot's position remains constant.
      4. The rest of the grid becomes the Background color (White).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, then fill it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid and note its index. Place this maroon pixel at the same index in the output grid.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the "object") in the input grid. Note its color, starting index, and ending index.
4.  Determine whether the object is located to the left or the right of the maroon pixel in the input grid.
5.  Count the number of white pixels (0) situated strictly between the object block and the maroon pixel in the input grid. This is the "gap size".
6.  Calculate the new starting and ending indices for the object in the output grid:
    *   If the object was to the left of the maroon pixel in the input, its new starting index in the output will be `maroon_index + 1 + gap_size`.
    *   If the object was to the right of the maroon pixel in the input, its new ending index in the output will be `maroon_index - 1 - gap_size`.
    *   The length of the object remains unchanged, so the corresponding new ending (or starting) index can be calculated based on the object's length and the calculated new starting (or ending) index.
7.  Place the object (using its original color and length) at the newly calculated indices in the output grid.
