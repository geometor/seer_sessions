Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays).
*   Each grid contains primarily `white` (0) pixels.
*   There are two significant features within the `white` background:
    1.  A contiguous horizontal segment of a single color (e.g., `green`, `red`, `gray` in the examples), which is not `white` or `maroon`.
    2.  A single `maroon` (9) pixel.
*   In the input grid, the colored segment always appears to the left of the `maroon` pixel.
*   In the output grid, the `maroon` pixel appears to the left of the colored segment.
*   The `maroon` pixel maintains its exact column position from the input to the output.
*   The colored segment (its color and length) remains unchanged, but its position shifts.
*   The number of `white` pixels separating the colored segment and the `maroon` pixel appears to be preserved, but their order is reversed relative to each other.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Type: 1D (single row)
Objects:
  - id: colored_segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of a single color C, where C is not white (0) and not maroon (9).
    properties:
      color: C
      length: L
      input_start_index: S_in
      output_start_index: S_out
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with color maroon (9).
    properties:
      color: 9
      index: M
  - id: background
    description: All other pixels.
    properties:
      color: 0 (white)
Relationships:
  - type: spatial_input
    description: The colored_segment appears before the marker_pixel along the row.
    gap_size_input: M - (S_in + L) # Number of white pixels between segment end and marker
  - type: spatial_output
    description: The marker_pixel appears before the colored_segment along the row.
    gap_size_output: S_out - (M + 1) # Number of white pixels between marker and segment start
Transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: colored_segment
    details: Record color C, length L, start index S_in.
  - action: identify
    target: marker_pixel
    details: Record index M.
  - action: preserve_position
    target: marker_pixel
    details: The marker_pixel remains at index M in the output.
  - action: preserve_gap
    target: [colored_segment, marker_pixel]
    details: The number of white pixels between the marker_pixel and the colored_segment is the same in the output as in the input (gap_size_output == gap_size_input).
  - action: reposition
    target: colored_segment
    details: Move the colored_segment so it appears after the marker_pixel, preserving the gap size. Calculate S_out = M + gap_size_input + 1.
  - action: construct_output
    details: Create a new white grid of the same dimensions, place the marker_pixel at M, and place the colored_segment starting at S_out.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input row to find the contiguous horizontal segment of pixels whose color is neither `white` (0) nor `maroon` (9). Record its color `C`, its length `L`, and its starting column index `S_in`.
2.  Scan the input row to find the column index `M` of the single `maroon` (9) pixel.
3.  Calculate the number of `white` pixels between the end of the colored segment and the `maroon` pixel in the input: `Gap = M - (S_in + L)`.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with `white` (0) pixels.
5.  Place the `maroon` (9) pixel at column index `M` in the output row.
6.  Calculate the starting column index for the colored segment in the output row: `S_out = M + Gap + 1`.
7.  Place the colored segment (color `C`, length `L`) into the output row, starting at column index `S_out`.
8.  Return the newly constructed output row.
