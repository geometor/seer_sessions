Grid_Type: 1D (single row)
Objects:
  - id: colored_segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of a single color C, where C is not white (0) and not maroon (9).
    properties:
      color: C
      length: L
      input_start_index: S_in
      output_start_index: S_out
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with color maroon (9).
    properties:
      color: 9
      index: M
  - id: background
    description: All other pixels.
    properties:
      color: 0 (white)
Relationships:
  - type: spatial_input
    description: The colored_segment appears before the marker_pixel along the row.
    gap_size_input: M - (S_in + L) # Number of white pixels between segment end and marker
  - type: spatial_output
    description: The marker_pixel appears before the colored_segment along the row.
    gap_size_output: S_out - (M + 1) # Number of white pixels between marker and segment start
Transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: colored_segment
    details: Record color C, length L, start index S_in.
  - action: identify
    target: marker_pixel
    details: Record index M.
  - action: preserve_position
    target: marker_pixel
    details: The marker_pixel remains at index M in the output.
  - action: preserve_gap
    target: [colored_segment, marker_pixel]
    details: The number of white pixels between the marker_pixel and the colored_segment is the same in the output as in the input (gap_size_output == gap_size_input).
  - action: reposition
    target: colored_segment
    details: Move the colored_segment so it appears after the marker_pixel, preserving the gap size. Calculate S_out = M + gap_size_input + 1.
  - action: construct_output
    details: Create a new white grid of the same dimensions, place the marker_pixel at M, and place the colored_segment starting at S_out.
