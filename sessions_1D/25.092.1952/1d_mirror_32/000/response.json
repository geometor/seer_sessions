A contiguous horizontal segment of a single color (e.g., `green`, `red`, `gray` in the examples), which is not `white` or `maroon`.\n    2.  A single `maroon` (9) pixel.\n*   In the input grid, the colored segment always appears to the left of the `maroon` pixel.\n*   In the output grid, the `maroon` pixel appears to the left of the colored segment.\n*   The `maroon` pixel maintains its exact column position from the input to the output.\n*   The colored segment (its color and length) remains unchanged, but its position shifts.\n*   The number of `white` pixels separating the colored segment and the `maroon` pixel appears to be preserved, but their order is reversed relative to each other.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
