```python
"""
Identifies a contiguous horizontal segment of a single color (not white or maroon) and a single maroon marker pixel in a 1D input grid.
Calculates the gap (number of white pixels) between the segment and the marker in the input.
Creates an output grid of the same size, filled with white.
Places the maroon marker pixel at its original position in the output grid.
Places the colored segment in the output grid such that it appears after the marker, preserving the original gap size between them.
