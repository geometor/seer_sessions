Grid:
  Type: 1D array (represented as 1xN)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x14)
  Background: white (0)
Objects:
  - Name: Pivot
    Color: maroon (9)
    Count: 1
    Properties:
      - Its column index remains fixed between input and output.
  - Name: Block
    Color: Variable (gray-5, orange-7, blue-1 observed), but not white (0) or maroon (9)
    Count: 1
    Properties:
      - A contiguous sequence of identical pixels.
      - Length: 3 pixels in observed examples.
      - Position relative to Pivot changes.
  - Name: Separator
    Color: white (0)
    Count: 1 (specific instance relevant to the transformation)
    Properties:
      - Always located between the Block and the Pivot.
Relationships:
  - Input: `[..., Block, Separator, Pivot, ...]` where Separator is a single white pixel adjacent to both Block and Pivot.
  - Output: `[..., Pivot, Separator, Block, ...]` where Separator is a single white pixel adjacent to both Pivot and Block.
Action:
  - Type: Repositioning / Transposition
  - ObjectMoved: The unit composed of [Block, Separator]. (Alternatively, view it as moving the Block across the Pivot, carrying the Separator relationship).
  - Rule: The Block, which is initially to the left of the Pivot (separated by one white Separator pixel), is moved to the right of the Pivot. The single white Separator pixel is repositioned to be between the Pivot and the Block in the output.
  - Invariant: The column index of the Pivot pixel.
  - Invariant: The color and length of the Block.
  - Constraint: The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid. Remaining positions are filled with the background color (white, 0).
