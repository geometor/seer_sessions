**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" strongly suggests that a NumPy array is being used in a boolean context where a single True/False value is expected. This commonly occurs with conditional statements (`if array: ...`) or boolean operations on arrays that don't result in a single boolean value.

Given the code structure and the error, the most likely cause is the initial check `if not input_grid` within the `transform` function when `input_grid` is passed as a NumPy array by the testing environment. An empty NumPy array evaluates differently than an empty list in a boolean context, and a non-empty array doesn't evaluate to a simple True/False.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Modify Input Handling:** Adjust the `transform` function to robustly handle potential NumPy array inputs. Specifically, change the initial check to verify the dimensions/shape appropriately for arrays (e.g., check `input_grid.shape`).
2.  **Ensure List Operations:** Explicitly convert the first row of the input grid (which contains the data for this 1D task) into a standard Python list before passing it to helper functions or iterating over it. This ensures that all subsequent logic operates on predictable list elements and avoids NumPy-specific boolean evaluation issues. `input_list = list(input_grid[0])` should achieve this.
3.  **Verify Logic:** The core logic (find pivot, find block, rearrange) appears correct based on the examples. The focus is on fixing the data type handling.

**Metrics Gathering (Simulated):**

We can infer the properties from the examples without code execution, as the core logic was understandable, and the error points to type handling rather than logical flaws.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x14)
    *   Pivot (9) index: 4
    *   Block (5): color=5, start=0, length=3
    *   Input configuration: Block[0:3], Separator[3], Pivot[4]
    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Output configuration: Pivot[4], Separator[5], Block[6:9]
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x14)
    *   Pivot (9) index: 5
    *   Block (7): color=7, start=1, length=3
    *   Input configuration: Block[1:4], Separator[4], Pivot[5]
    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Output configuration: Pivot[5], Separator[6], Block[7:10]
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x14)
    *   Pivot (9) index: 5
    *   Block (1): color=1, start=1, length=3
    *   Input configuration: Block[1:4], Separator[4], Pivot[5]
    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Output configuration: Pivot[5], Separator[6], Block[7:10]

The pattern holds consistently: the block of 3 identical colored pixels moves from being left of the maroon pixel (separated by one white pixel) to being right of the maroon pixel (separated by one white pixel). The maroon pixel's index remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (represented as 1xN)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x14)
  Background: white (0)
Objects:
  - Name: Pivot
    Color: maroon (9)
    Count: 1
    Properties:
      - Its column index remains fixed between input and output.
  - Name: Block
    Color: Variable (gray-5, orange-7, blue-1 observed), but not white (0) or maroon (9)
    Count: 1
    Properties:
      - A contiguous sequence of identical pixels.
      - Length: 3 pixels in observed examples.
      - Position relative to Pivot changes.
  - Name: Separator
    Color: white (0)
    Count: 1 (specific instance relevant to the transformation)
    Properties:
      - Always located between the Block and the Pivot.
Relationships:
  - Input: `[..., Block, Separator, Pivot, ...]` where Separator is a single white pixel adjacent to both Block and Pivot.
  - Output: `[..., Pivot, Separator, Block, ...]` where Separator is a single white pixel adjacent to both Pivot and Block.
Action:
  - Type: Repositioning / Transposition
  - ObjectMoved: The unit composed of [Block, Separator]. (Alternatively, view it as moving the Block across the Pivot, carrying the Separator relationship).
  - Rule: The Block, which is initially to the left of the Pivot (separated by one white Separator pixel), is moved to the right of the Pivot. The single white Separator pixel is repositioned to be between the Pivot and the Block in the output.
  - Invariant: The column index of the Pivot pixel.
  - Invariant: The color and length of the Block.
  - Constraint: The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid. Remaining positions are filled with the background color (white, 0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Ensure the input is a single row (1xN grid). If not, handle appropriately (e.g., return an empty grid or raise an error). Extract the single row of pixel data.
2.  Initialize an output row of the same length as the input row, filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Locate the index of the single pivot pixel (maroon, 9) in the input row.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of identical pixels in the input row that are neither the background color (white, 0) nor the pivot color (maroon, 9). Record its color, starting index, and length.
5.  Place the pivot pixel (maroon, 9) into the output row at the same index it occupied in the input row.
6.  Place a single separator pixel (white, 0) into the output row at the index immediately following the pivot pixel's index.
7.  Place the identified block (using its recorded color and length) into the output row, starting at the index immediately following the separator pixel's index.
8.  Format the completed output row as a 1xN grid (e.g., a list containing the single output row list).
