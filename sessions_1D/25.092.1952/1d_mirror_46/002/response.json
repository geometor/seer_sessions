            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" strongly suggests that a NumPy array is being used in a boolean context where a single True/False value is expected. This commonly occurs with conditional statements (`if array: ...`) or boolean operations on arrays that don't result in a single boolean value.\n\nGiven the code structure and the error, the most likely cause is the initial check `if not input_grid` within the `transform` function when `input_grid` is passed as a NumPy array by the testing environment. An empty NumPy array evaluates differently than an empty list in a boolean context, and a non-empty array doesn't evaluate to a simple True/False.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Modify Input Handling:** Adjust the `transform` function to robustly handle potential NumPy array inputs. Specifically, change the initial check to verify the dimensions/shape appropriately for arrays (e.g., check `input_grid.shape`).\n2.  **Ensure List Operations:** Explicitly convert the first row of the input grid (which contains the data for this 1D task) into a standard Python list before passing it to helper functions or iterating over it. This ensures that all subsequent logic operates on predictable list elements and avoids NumPy-specific boolean evaluation issues. `input_list = list(input_grid[0])` should achieve this.\n3.  **Verify Logic:** The core logic (find pivot, find block, rearrange) appears correct based on the examples. The focus is on fixing the data type handling.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Simulated):**\n\nWe can infer the properties from the examples without code execution, as the core logic was understandable, and the error points to type handling rather than logical flaws.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x14)\n    *   Pivot (9) index: 4\n    *   Block (5): color=5, start=0, length=3\n    *   Input configuration: Block[0:3], Separator[3], Pivot[4]\n    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Output configuration: Pivot[4], Separator[5], Block[6:9]\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x14)\n    *   Pivot (9) index: 5\n    *   Block (7): color=7, start=1, length=3\n    *   Input configuration: Block[1:4], Separator[4], Pivot[5]\n    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Output configuration: Pivot[5], Separator[6], Block[7:10]\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x14)\n    *   Pivot (9) index: 5\n    *   Block (1): color=1, start=1, length=3\n    *   Input configuration: Block[1:4], Separator[4], Pivot[5]\n    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Output configuration: Pivot[5], Separator[6], Block[7:10]\n\nThe pattern holds consistently: the block of 3 identical colored pixels moves from being left of the maroon pixel (separated by one white pixel) to being right of the maroon pixel (separated by one white pixel). The maroon pixel's index remains constant.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
