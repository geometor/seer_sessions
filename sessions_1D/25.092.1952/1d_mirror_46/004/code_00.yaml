Grid:
  Type: 1D array (likely represented as a 1xN NumPy array)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (1x14 in examples)
  Background: white (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Pivot
    Color: maroon (9)
    Count: 1
    Properties: Fixed position (column index) across transformation
  - Type: Block
    Color: Variable (non-white, non-maroon)
    Count: 1
    Properties:
      - Contiguous sequence of identical pixels
      - Length: 3 pixels in examples (may vary in general case)
      - Position: Left of Pivot in input, Right of Pivot in output
  - Type: Separator
    Color: white (0)
    Count: 1 (implicit in input, explicit in output)
    Properties:
      - Input: Located between Block and Pivot (at index `pivot_index - 1`)
      - Output: Located immediately to the right of Pivot (at index `pivot_index + 1`)
Relationships:
  - Input Adjacency: `[..., Block, Separator(white), Pivot, ...]`
  - Output Adjacency: `[..., Pivot, Separator(white), Block, ...]`
Action:
  - Type: Transposition/Movement
    Object: Block
    Rule: Move the Block from its original position to start at the index `pivot_index + 2`.
    Constraint:
      - The Pivot pixel remains at its original index.
      - The pixel at index `pivot_index + 1` in the output is set to the background color (white).
      - All other pixels default to the background color (white).
