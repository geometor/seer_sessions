Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (represented as 1xN arrays). The size seems consistent between input and output for each example (1x14).
2.  **Colors**: The significant colors are white (0), maroon (9), and one other color per example (gray-5, orange-7, blue-1).
3.  **Key Objects**:
    *   A single maroon (9) pixel. Its position varies slightly but it seems central to the transformation.
    *   A contiguous block of three identical pixels (gray, orange, or blue).
    *   White (0) pixels act as background/filler and also as a separator.
4.  **Transformation**: The primary change involves the position of the colored block relative to the maroon pixel.
    *   In all examples, the input has the colored block to the left of the maroon pixel, separated by one white pixel.
    *   In all outputs, the colored block is moved to the right of the maroon pixel, again separated by one white pixel.
    *   The maroon pixel itself remains in the *same column index* in the output as it was in the input.
    *   The relative order within the colored block is preserved.
    *   The single white pixel that was between the block and the maroon pixel in the input appears to move *with* the block, maintaining its position relative to the maroon pixel (now on the other side).
    *   Other white pixels fill the remaining spaces.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (represented as 1xN)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (1x14 in examples)
  Background: white (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Pivot
    Color: maroon (9)
    Count: 1
    Properties: Fixed position (column index) across transformation
  - Type: Block
    Color: Variable (gray-5, orange-7, blue-1 in examples)
    Count: 1
    Properties:
      - Contiguous sequence of identical pixels
      - Length: 3 pixels in examples
      - Position: Left of Pivot in input, Right of Pivot in output
  - Type: Separator
    Color: white (0)
    Count: 1
    Properties: Located between Block and Pivot
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Block is adjacent to Separator, Separator is adjacent to Pivot.
    Input: [..., Block, Separator, Pivot, ...]
    Output: [..., Pivot, Separator, Block, ...]
Action:
  - Type: Transposition/Movement
    Object: Block and Separator unit
    Rule: Move the unit (Block + Separator) from the left side of the Pivot to the right side of the Pivot.
    Constraint: Maintain the relative order [Separator, Block] on the right side. Pivot position remains fixed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid. Note its column index.
3.  Place the maroon (9) pixel in the output grid at the same column index.
4.  Locate the contiguous block of identical non-white, non-maroon pixels in the input grid. Note its color, length, and starting index.
5.  Identify the single white (0) pixel immediately to the right of this block (which is also immediately to the left of the maroon pixel).
6.  In the output grid, place this single white (0) pixel immediately to the right of the maroon pixel's position.
7.  Place the identified colored block immediately to the right of this white separator pixel in the output grid, preserving the block's internal order.
8.  All other positions in the output grid remain the background color (white, 0).
