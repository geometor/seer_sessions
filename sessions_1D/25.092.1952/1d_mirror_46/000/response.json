The size seems consistent between input and output for each example (1x14).\n2.  **Colors**: The significant colors are white (0), maroon (9), and one other color per example (gray-5, orange-7, blue-1).\n3.  **Key Objects**:\n    *   A single maroon (9) pixel. Its position varies slightly but it seems central to the transformation.\n    *   A contiguous block of three identical pixels (gray, orange, or blue).\n    *   White (0) pixels act as background/filler and also as a separator.\n4.  **Transformation**: The primary change involves the position of the colored block relative to the maroon pixel.\n    *   In all examples, the input has the colored block to the left of the maroon pixel, separated by one white pixel.\n    *   In all outputs, the colored block is moved to the right of the maroon pixel, again separated by one white pixel.\n    *   The maroon pixel itself remains in the *same column index* in the output as it was in the input.\n    *   The relative order within the colored block is preserved.\n    *   The single white pixel that was between the block and the maroon pixel in the input appears to move *with* the block, maintaining its position relative to the maroon pixel (now on the other side).\n    *   Other white pixels fill the remaining spaces.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
