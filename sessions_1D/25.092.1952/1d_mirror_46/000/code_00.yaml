Grid:
  Type: 1D array (represented as 1xN)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output (1x14 in examples)
  Background: white (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Pivot
    Color: maroon (9)
    Count: 1
    Properties: Fixed position (column index) across transformation
  - Type: Block
    Color: Variable (gray-5, orange-7, blue-1 in examples)
    Count: 1
    Properties:
      - Contiguous sequence of identical pixels
      - Length: 3 pixels in examples
      - Position: Left of Pivot in input, Right of Pivot in output
  - Type: Separator
    Color: white (0)
    Count: 1
    Properties: Located between Block and Pivot
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Block is adjacent to Separator, Separator is adjacent to Pivot.
    Input: [..., Block, Separator, Pivot, ...]
    Output: [..., Pivot, Separator, Block, ...]
Action:
  - Type: Transposition/Movement
    Object: Block and Separator unit
    Rule: Move the unit (Block + Separator) from the left side of the Pivot to the right side of the Pivot.
    Constraint: Maintain the relative order [Separator, Block] on the right side. Pivot position remains fixed.
