Find the connected object of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9). Determine its color and the coordinates of all its pixels, specifically noting the minimum row index (min_row_obj).\n4. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions (14x2) filled with white (0).\n5. Place the maroon pixel in the output grid at coordinates (R, 1).\n6. Determine the target starting row for the object based on the maroon pixel's initial column:\n   - If the initial column C was 0, the target minimum row (target_min_row) is R + 1.\n   - If the initial column C was 1, the target minimum row (target_min_row) is R + 2.\n7. Calculate the vertical shift required for the object: shift = target_min_row - min_row_obj.\n8. Transfer the object pixels to the output grid, applying the calculated vertical shift: For each original object pixel at (r, c), place it at (r + shift, c) in the output grid using the object's color.\n9.
