*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating elements within a grid. The input and output are presented as 1D arrays, but analyzing them as 14x2 grids reveals the underlying structure and transformation. Each example contains three main components: a white background (0), a single maroon pixel (9), and a connected object of another color (blue, red, or gray). The transformation involves moving both the maroon pixel and the colored object based on the initial position of the maroon pixel.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_dimensions:
      rows: 14
      columns: 2
    background_color: 0 # white
    elements:
      - type: marker
        color: 9 # maroon
        count: 1
        properties:
          - initial_position: (row, column)
          - movement_rule: Moves one column to the right if initially in column 0, otherwise stays put.
      - type: object
        color: [1, 2, 5] # blue, red, or gray in examples
        count: 1
        properties:
          - shape: Connected component of a single color
          - initial_position: Defined by the set of pixel coordinates
          - movement_rule: Shifts vertically downwards.
    relationships:
      - The vertical shift distance of the 'object' depends on the initial column of the 'marker'.
      - The target vertical position of the 'object' is relative to the row of the 'marker'.
    transformation_logic:
      - The marker's final column is always 1.
      - The object is moved so its top-most row is positioned relative to the marker's row.
      - If the marker started in column 0, the object's top row moves to the row immediately below the marker's row.
      - If the marker started in column 1, the object's top row moves to the second row below the marker's row.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Interpret the input array as a 14x2 grid of pixels.
    2.  Identify the coordinates (row `R`, column `C`) of the single maroon pixel (9).
    3.  Identify all pixels belonging to the connected object of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9). Determine the minimum row index (`min_row_obj`) occupied by this object.
    4.  Initialize the output grid as a 14x2 grid filled with white pixels (0).
    5.  Determine the final position of the maroon pixel in the output grid: Place it at coordinates (`R`, 1).
    6.  Determine the target minimum row (`target_min_row`) for the colored object in the output grid:
        *   If the initial column `C` of the maroon pixel was 0, set `target_min_row = R + 1`.
        *   If the initial column `C` of the maroon pixel was 1, set `target_min_row = R + 2`.
    7.  Calculate the required vertical shift for the object: `shift = target_min_row - min_row_obj`.
    8.  For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to the original colored object, place a pixel of the same color at coordinates `(r + shift, c)` in the output grid.
```python
"""
1. Interpret the input array as a 14x2 grid.
2. Find the single maroon pixel (9) and its coordinates (R, C).
3. Find the connected object of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9). Determine its color and the coordinates of all its pixels, specifically noting the minimum row index (min_row_obj).
4. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions (14x2) filled with white (0).
5. Place the maroon pixel in the output grid at coordinates (R, 1).
6. Determine the target starting row for the object based on the maroon pixel's initial column:
   - If the initial column C was 0, the target minimum row (target_min_row) is R + 1.
   - If the initial column C was 1, the target minimum row (target_min_row) is R + 2.
7. Calculate the vertical shift required for the object: shift = target_min_row - min_row_obj.
8. Transfer the object pixels to the output grid, applying the calculated vertical shift: For each original object pixel at (r, c), place it at (r + shift, c) in the output grid using the object's color.
9. Flatten the output grid back into a 1D array.
