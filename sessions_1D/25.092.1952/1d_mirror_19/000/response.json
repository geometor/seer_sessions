The input and output are presented as 1D arrays, but analyzing them as 14x2 grids reveals the underlying structure and transformation. Each example contains three main components: a white background (0), a single maroon pixel (9), and a connected object of another color (blue, red, or gray). The transformation involves moving both the maroon pixel and the colored object based on the initial position of the maroon pixel.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Identify the coordinates (row `R`, column `C`) of the single maroon pixel (9).\n    3.  Identify all pixels belonging to the connected object of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9). Determine the minimum row index (`min_row_obj`) occupied by this object.\n    4.  Initialize the output grid as a 14x2 grid filled with white pixels (0).\n    5.  Determine the final position of the maroon pixel in the output grid: Place it at coordinates (`R`, 1).\n    6.  Determine the target minimum row (`target_min_row`) for the colored object in the output grid:\n        *   If the initial column `C` of the maroon pixel was 0, set `target_min_row = R + 1`.\n        *   If the initial column `C` of the maroon pixel was 1, set `target_min_row = R + 2`.\n    7.  Calculate the required vertical shift for the object: `shift = target_min_row - min_row_obj`.\n    8.  For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to the original colored object, place a pixel of the same color at coordinates `(r + shift, c)` in the output grid."
