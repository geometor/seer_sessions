Transformation Rule:
Identify a single maroon (9) pixel which acts as a pivot within a single-row grid (1xN).
Identify a contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or maroon 9) within that same row.
Move this colored block from one side of the pivot to the other along the row, maintaining the same number of white (0) pixels (the gap) between the block and the pivot. The original column positions occupied by the block become white (0) in the output grid.
