Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or single-row grids).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain three types of pixels:
    *   Background: white (0) pixels.
    *   Pivot/Marker: A single maroon (9) pixel.
    *   Colored Block: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color (magenta 6, orange 7, or gray 5), which is neither white nor maroon.
3.  **Arrangement:** In the input, the colored block appears first, followed by some background pixels (possibly zero), then the maroon pixel, followed by more background pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The primary change between input and output is the position of the colored block. The maroon pixel's position remains constant. The colored block moves from one side of the maroon pixel to the other.
5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The distance (number of background pixels) between the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input appears to be preserved when the block moves to the other side of the maroon pixel in the output. The original location of the colored block becomes background (white).

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Place the maroon (9) pixel at `pivot_index` in the output grid.
4.  Find the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), its starting index (`block_start_index`), its ending index (`block_end_index`), and its length (`block_length`).
5.  Calculate the number of background (0) pixels between the end of the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input grid: `gap = pivot_index - block_end_index - 1`.
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block in the output grid: `new_start_index = pivot_index + 1 + gap`.
7.  Fill the output grid from `new_start_index` for `block_length` positions with the `block_color`.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input grids were 1-dimensional lists or arrays. ARC grids are always 2D, even if they have only one row or one column. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" arose from NumPy functions like `np.where` returning results based on the 2D structure, which were then used in contexts expecting a single value (like a 1D index).

The strategy is to consistently treat the grids as 2D NumPy arrays. Helper functions need modification:
1.  `find_pivot_np`: Extract the row and column index correctly from `np.where`.
2.  `find_colored_block_np`: Iterate through the columns of the relevant row (which is row 0 in these examples) to find the block.
3.  `transform`: Use 2D indexing (`output_grid[row, col]`) when placing the pivot and the moved block.

The fundamental logic of identifying a pivot, a colored block, calculating the gap, and moving the block across the pivot while preserving the gap remains valid. The implementation just needs to respect the 2D data structure.

**Metrics and Verification:**

Let's verify the structure and locations for the first example.

The metrics confirm the initial analysis and calculations are correct when applied to the 2D structure (specifically, the single row). The grid shape is indeed 1xN. The pivot and block locations, gap size, and new block position calculations align with the transformation rule. The error was purely in the previous code's handling of the NumPy array dimensions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a contiguous colored block within a single-row grid across a fixed maroon pivot pixel, preserving the gap size between the block and the pivot.
grid_dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN)

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills empty space within the row.
  - type: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True (within the row)
    role: Acts as a reference point for movement along the row.
  - type: colored_block
    color: Any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True (along the row)
      - single_row_extent: True (confined to the first row)
      - variable_color: True
      - variable_length: True
      - variable_position: True (relative to pivot within the row)
    role: The object that is moved along the row.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_gap
    object1: colored_block
    object2: pivot
    dimension: horizontal (within the single row)
    property: size (number of background pixels between them along the row)
    rule: The horizontal gap size is preserved during the transformation.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot
    result: pivot_row (always 0), pivot_col
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block (within the pivot's row)
    result: block_color, block_start_col, block_end_col, block_length
  - action: calculate_gap
    inputs: block_end_col, pivot_col
    condition: block occurs before pivot (block_end_col < pivot_col)
    output: gap_size
    formula: gap_size = pivot_col - block_end_col - 1
  - action: calculate_new_position
    inputs: pivot_col, gap_size
    condition: block originally before pivot
    output: new_block_start_col
    formula: new_block_start_col = pivot_col + 1 + gap_size
  - action: move_block
    target: colored_block
    details: Remove block from original columns in row 0, place it starting at new_block_start_col in row 0.
  - action: fill_background
    target: original columns occupied by colored_block in row 0
    color: white (0)

output_construction:
  - Initialize output grid (same 1xN shape) with background color (white).
  - Place the pivot (maroon) at its original (row 0, pivot_col).
  - Place the colored_block in row 0, starting at the calculated new_block_start_col for block_length columns.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Given a 2D input grid which consists of a single row (1xN).
2.  Create a new output grid of the same 1xN dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Locate the column index (`pivot_col`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid's first (and only) row (row 0).
4.  Place the maroon (9) pixel at position (0, `pivot_col`) in the output grid.
5.  In the input grid's first row, find the contiguous sequence (block) of pixels whose color is not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), its starting column index (`block_start_col`), its ending column index (`block_end_col`), and its length (`block_length`).
6.  Assuming the block appears before the pivot (`block_end_col < pivot_col`), calculate the number of background (0) pixels between the end of the block and the pivot: `gap = pivot_col - block_end_col - 1`.
7.  Calculate the new starting column index for the colored block in the output grid's first row: `new_start_col = pivot_col + 1 + gap`.
8.  Fill the output grid's first row from column `new_start_col` to `new_start_col + block_length - 1` with the `block_color`.
