Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or single-row grids).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain three types of pixels:
    *   Background: white (0) pixels.
    *   Pivot/Marker: A single maroon (9) pixel.
    *   Colored Block: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color (magenta 6, orange 7, or gray 5), which is neither white nor maroon.
3.  **Arrangement:** In the input, the colored block appears first, followed by some background pixels (possibly zero), then the maroon pixel, followed by more background pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The primary change between input and output is the position of the colored block. The maroon pixel's position remains constant. The colored block moves from one side of the maroon pixel to the other.
5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The distance (number of background pixels) between the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input appears to be preserved when the block moves to the other side of the maroon pixel in the output. The original location of the colored block becomes background (white).

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Place the maroon (9) pixel at `pivot_index` in the output grid.
4.  Find the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), its starting index (`block_start_index`), its ending index (`block_end_index`), and its length (`block_length`).
5.  Calculate the number of background (0) pixels between the end of the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input grid: `gap = pivot_index - block_end_index - 1`.
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block in the output grid: `new_start_index = pivot_index + 1 + gap`.
7.  Fill the output grid from `new_start_index` for `block_length` positions with the `block_color`.

## Example 1:

## Example 3:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'
**General Assessment:**

The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'` indicates that the `transform` function was called with a NumPy array as input, but the code within the function, specifically `find_pivot`, attempts to use the `.index()` method, which is native to Python lists, not NumPy arrays.

The strategy is to modify the helper functions (`find_pivot`, `find_colored_block`) and potentially the main `transform` function to correctly handle NumPy arrays. This primarily involves replacing list-specific methods like `.index()` with their NumPy equivalents (e.g., `np.where()`) and ensuring iteration and indexing are compatible. The underlying logic of identifying the pivot, the colored block, calculating the gap, and repositioning the block appears correct based on the initial analysis and should be preserved.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a contiguous colored block across a fixed maroon pivot pixel in a 1D grid, preserving the gap size between the block and the pivot.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_data_type: numpy.ndarray

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills empty space.
  - type: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True (its index remains constant in the output)
    role: Acts as a reference point for movement.
  - type: colored_block
    color: Any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
      - variable_color: True
      - variable_length: True
      - variable_position: True (relative to pivot)
    role: The object that is moved.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_gap
    object1: colored_block
    object2: pivot
    property: size (number of background pixels between them)
    rule: The gap size is preserved during the transformation.

actions:
  - action: locate_pivot
    input: input_grid
    method: Find the index where pixel value is maroon (9). (e.g., using np.where)
    output: pivot_index
  - action: locate_colored_block
    input: input_grid
    method: Iterate through the grid to find the first sequence of contiguous pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9).
    output: block_color, block_start_index, block_end_index, block_length
  - action: calculate_gap_and_new_position
    inputs: block_start_index, block_end_index, pivot_index
    condition: block is before pivot (block_end_index < pivot_index)
    calculations:
      - gap_size = pivot_index - block_end_index - 1
      - new_block_start_index = pivot_index + 1 + gap_size
    outputs: new_block_start_index
  - action: construct_output
    inputs: grid_size, pivot_index, block_color, block_length, new_block_start_index
    steps:
      - Create an output grid of the same size, filled with background color (white, 0).
      - Place the pivot (maroon, 9) at pivot_index.
      - Place the colored_block (block_color) starting at new_block_start_index for block_length pixels.
    output: output_grid

implicit_assumptions:
  - The input grid will always contain exactly one maroon (9) pivot pixel.
  - The input grid will always contain exactly one contiguous block of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9).
  - In all observed examples, the colored block appears *before* the pivot pixel in the input. The transformation moves it to appear *after* the pivot.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (as a NumPy array).
2.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid using a method compatible with NumPy arrays (like `np.where`). Let this be `pivot_index`.
4.  Place the maroon (9) pixel at `pivot_index` in the output grid.
5.  Iterate through the input grid to find the contiguous block of pixels whose color is not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), its starting index (`block_start_index`), its ending index (`block_end_index`), and calculate its length (`block_length = block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).
6.  Assuming the block is positioned before the pivot (`block_end_index < pivot_index`), calculate the number of background (0) pixels between the end of the colored block and the pivot: `gap = pivot_index - block_end_index - 1`.
7.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block in the output grid, placing it after the pivot with the same gap: `new_start_index = pivot_index + 1 + gap`.
8.  Fill the output grid from `new_start_index` for `block_length` positions with the `block_color`. Ensure the indices stay within the grid bounds.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
