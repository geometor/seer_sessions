The maroon pixel's position remains constant. The colored block moves from one side of the maroon pixel to the other.\n5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The distance (number of background pixels) between the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input appears to be preserved when the block moves to the other side of the maroon pixel in the output. The original location of the colored block becomes background (white).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
