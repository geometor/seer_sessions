task_description: Move a contiguous colored block across a fixed maroon pivot pixel, preserving the gap size.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills empty space.
  - type: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True
    role: Acts as a reference point for movement.
  - type: colored_block
    color: Any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
      - variable_color: True
      - variable_length: True
      - variable_position: True (relative to pivot)
    role: The object that is moved.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_gap
    object1: colored_block
    object2: pivot
    property: size (number of background pixels between them)
    rule: The gap size is preserved during the transformation.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot
    result: pivot_index
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block
    result: block_color, block_start_index, block_end_index, block_length
  - action: calculate_gap
    inputs: block_end_index, pivot_index
    output: gap_size
    formula: gap_size = pivot_index - block_end_index - 1
  - action: calculate_new_position
    inputs: pivot_index, gap_size
    output: new_block_start_index
    formula: new_block_start_index = pivot_index + 1 + gap_size
  - action: move_block
    target: colored_block
    details: Remove block from original position, place it at new_block_start_index.
  - action: fill_background
    target: original position of colored_block
    color: white (0)

output_construction:
  - Initialize output grid with background color (white).
  - Place the pivot (maroon) at its original index.
  - Place the colored_block at its calculated new_block_start_index.
