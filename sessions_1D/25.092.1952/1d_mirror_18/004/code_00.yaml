task_description: Move a contiguous colored block within a single-row grid across a fixed maroon pivot pixel, preserving the gap size between the block and the pivot.
grid_dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN)

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills empty space within the row.
  - type: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True (within the row)
    role: Acts as a reference point for movement along the row.
  - type: colored_block
    color: Any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True (along the row)
      - single_row_extent: True (confined to the first row)
      - variable_color: True
      - variable_length: True
      - variable_position: True (relative to pivot within the row)
    role: The object that is moved along the row.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_gap
    object1: colored_block
    object2: pivot
    dimension: horizontal (within the single row)
    property: size (number of background pixels between them along the row)
    rule: The horizontal gap size is preserved during the transformation.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot
    result: pivot_row (always 0), pivot_col
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block (within the pivot's row)
    result: block_color, block_start_col, block_end_col, block_length
  - action: calculate_gap
    inputs: block_end_col, pivot_col
    condition: block occurs before pivot (block_end_col < pivot_col)
    output: gap_size
    formula: gap_size = pivot_col - block_end_col - 1
  - action: calculate_new_position
    inputs: pivot_col, gap_size
    condition: block originally before pivot
    output: new_block_start_col
    formula: new_block_start_col = pivot_col + 1 + gap_size
  - action: move_block
    target: colored_block
    details: Remove block from original columns in row 0, place it starting at new_block_start_col in row 0.
  - action: fill_background
    target: original columns occupied by colored_block in row 0
    color: white (0)

output_construction:
  - Initialize output grid (same 1xN shape) with background color (white).
  - Place the pivot (maroon) at its original (row 0, pivot_col).
  - Place the colored_block in row 0, starting at the calculated new_block_start_col for block_length columns.
