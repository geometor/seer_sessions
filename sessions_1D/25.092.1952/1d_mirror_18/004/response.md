**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input grids were 1-dimensional lists or arrays. ARC grids are always 2D, even if they have only one row or one column. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" arose from NumPy functions like `np.where` returning results based on the 2D structure, which were then used in contexts expecting a single value (like a 1D index).

The strategy is to consistently treat the grids as 2D NumPy arrays. Helper functions need modification:
1.  `find_pivot_np`: Extract the row and column index correctly from `np.where`.
2.  `find_colored_block_np`: Iterate through the columns of the relevant row (which is row 0 in these examples) to find the block.
3.  `transform`: Use 2D indexing (`output_grid[row, col]`) when placing the pivot and the moved block.

The fundamental logic of identifying a pivot, a colored block, calculating the gap, and moving the block across the pivot while preserving the gap remains valid. The implementation just needs to respect the 2D data structure.

**Metrics and Verification:**

Let's verify the structure and locations for the first example.

``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 1 Data
input_list_1 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output_list_1 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

# --- Convert to 2D numpy arrays (assuming 1 row) ---
input_grid_1 = np.array([input_list_1])
output_grid_1 = np.array([output_list_1])

# --- Metrics for Example 1 Input ---
grid_shape = input_grid_1.shape
print(f"Input Grid 1 Shape: {grid_shape}")

# Find Pivot (Maroon, 9)
pivot_loc = np.where(input_grid_1 == 9)
pivot_row, pivot_col = pivot_loc[0][0], pivot_loc[1][0]
print(f"Input 1 Pivot Location (Row, Col): ({pivot_row}, {pivot_col})")

# Find Colored Block (Magenta, 6)
block_color = 6
block_indices = np.where(input_grid_1 == block_color)
block_cols = block_indices[1]
block_start_col = np.min(block_cols)
block_end_col = np.max(block_cols)
block_length = len(block_cols)
print(f"Input 1 Block Color: {block_color}")
print(f"Input 1 Block Cols: {block_cols.tolist()}")
print(f"Input 1 Block Start Col: {block_start_col}")
print(f"Input 1 Block End Col: {block_end_col}")
print(f"Input 1 Block Length: {block_length}")

# Calculate Gap
gap = pivot_col - block_end_col - 1
print(f"Input 1 Gap Size: {gap}")

# --- Metrics for Example 1 Output ---
print(f"\nOutput Grid 1 Shape: {output_grid_1.shape}")

# Verify Pivot Location
output_pivot_loc = np.where(output_grid_1 == 9)
output_pivot_row, output_pivot_col = output_pivot_loc[0][0], output_pivot_loc[1][0]
print(f"Output 1 Pivot Location (Row, Col): ({output_pivot_row}, {output_pivot_col})")
assert pivot_row == output_pivot_row and pivot_col == output_pivot_col

# Verify Block Location and Gap
output_block_indices = np.where(output_grid_1 == block_color)
output_block_cols = output_block_indices[1]
output_block_start_col = np.min(output_block_cols)
output_block_end_col = np.max(output_block_cols)
output_block_length = len(output_block_cols)
print(f"Output 1 Block Color: {block_color}")
print(f"Output 1 Block Cols: {output_block_cols.tolist()}")
print(f"Output 1 Block Start Col: {output_block_start_col}")
print(f"Output 1 Block End Col: {output_block_end_col}")
print(f"Output 1 Block Length: {output_block_length}")
assert block_length == output_block_length

# Verify Output Gap
output_gap = output_block_start_col - output_pivot_col - 1
print(f"Output 1 Gap Size: {output_gap}")
assert gap == output_gap

# Verify Calculated New Start Position
calculated_new_start_col = pivot_col + 1 + gap
print(f"Calculated New Start Col: {calculated_new_start_col}")
assert calculated_new_start_col == output_block_start_col
```
```

```
The metrics confirm the initial analysis and calculations are correct when applied to the 2D structure (specifically, the single row). The grid shape is indeed 1xN. The pivot and block locations, gap size, and new block position calculations align with the transformation rule. The error was purely in the previous code's handling of the NumPy array dimensions.

**YAML Facts:**

    condition: block originally before pivot
    output: new_block_start_col
    formula: new_block_start_col = pivot_col + 1 + gap_size

output_construction:
  - Initialize output grid (same 1xN shape) with background color (white).
  - Place the pivot (maroon) at its original (row 0, pivot_col).
  - Place the colored_block in row 0, starting at the calculated new_block_start_col for block_length columns.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Given a 2D input grid which consists of a single row (1xN).
2.  Create a new output grid of the same 1xN dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Locate the column index (`pivot_col`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid's first (and only) row (row 0).
4.  Place the maroon (9) pixel at position (0, `pivot_col`) in the output grid.
5.  In the input grid's first row, find the contiguous sequence (block) of pixels whose color is not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), its starting column index (`block_start_col`), its ending column index (`block_end_col`), and its length (`block_length`).
6.  Assuming the block appears before the pivot (`block_end_col < pivot_col`), calculate the number of background (0) pixels between the end of the block and the pivot: `gap = pivot_col - block_end_col - 1`.
7.  Calculate the new starting column index for the colored block in the output grid's first row: `new_start_col = pivot_col + 1 + gap`.
8.  Fill the output grid's first row from column `new_start_col` to `new_start_col + block_length - 1` with the `block_color`.
