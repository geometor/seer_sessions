            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input grids were 1-dimensional lists or arrays. ARC grids are always 2D, even if they have only one row or one column. The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" arose from NumPy functions like `np.where` returning results based on the 2D structure, which were then used in contexts expecting a single value (like a 1D index).\n\nThe strategy is to consistently treat the grids as 2D NumPy arrays. Helper functions need modification:\n1.  `find_pivot_np`: Extract the row and column index correctly from `np.where`.\n2.  `find_colored_block_np`: Iterate through the columns of the relevant row (which is row 0 in these examples) to find the block.\n3.  `transform`: Use 2D indexing (`output_grid[row, col]`) when placing the pivot and the moved block.\n\nThe fundamental logic of identifying a pivot, a colored block, calculating the gap, and moving the block across the pivot while preserving the gap remains valid. The implementation just needs to respect the 2D data structure.\n\n**Metrics and Verification:**\n\nLet's verify the structure and locations for the first example.\n"
