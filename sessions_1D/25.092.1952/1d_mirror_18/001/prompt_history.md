Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or single-row grids).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain three types of pixels:
    *   Background: white (0) pixels.
    *   Pivot/Marker: A single maroon (9) pixel.
    *   Colored Block: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color (magenta 6, orange 7, or gray 5), which is neither white nor maroon.
3.  **Arrangement:** In the input, the colored block appears first, followed by some background pixels (possibly zero), then the maroon pixel, followed by more background pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The primary change between input and output is the position of the colored block. The maroon pixel's position remains constant. The colored block moves from one side of the maroon pixel to the other.
5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The distance (number of background pixels) between the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input appears to be preserved when the block moves to the other side of the maroon pixel in the output. The original location of the colored block becomes background (white).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a contiguous colored block across a fixed maroon pivot pixel, preserving the gap size.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills empty space.
  - type: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - fixed_position: True
    role: Acts as a reference point for movement.
  - type: colored_block
    color: Any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
      - variable_color: True
      - variable_length: True
      - variable_position: True (relative to pivot)
    role: The object that is moved.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_gap
    object1: colored_block
    object2: pivot
    property: size (number of background pixels between them)
    rule: The gap size is preserved during the transformation.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot
    result: pivot_index
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block
    result: block_color, block_start_index, block_end_index, block_length
  - action: calculate_gap
    inputs: block_end_index, pivot_index
    output: gap_size
    formula: gap_size = pivot_index - block_end_index - 1
  - action: calculate_new_position
    inputs: pivot_index, gap_size
    output: new_block_start_index
    formula: new_block_start_index = pivot_index + 1 + gap_size
  - action: move_block
    target: colored_block
    details: Remove block from original position, place it at new_block_start_index.
  - action: fill_background
    target: original position of colored_block
    color: white (0)

output_construction:
  - Initialize output grid with background color (white).
  - Place the pivot (maroon) at its original index.
  - Place the colored_block at its calculated new_block_start_index.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Place the maroon (9) pixel at `pivot_index` in the output grid.
4.  Find the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), its starting index (`block_start_index`), its ending index (`block_end_index`), and its length (`block_length`).
5.  Calculate the number of background (0) pixels between the end of the colored block and the maroon pixel in the input grid: `gap = pivot_index - block_end_index - 1`.
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block in the output grid: `new_start_index = pivot_index + 1 + gap`.
7.  Fill the output grid from `new_start_index` for `block_length` positions with the `block_color`.
