task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 2D (input/output format), effectively 1D (logical transformation)
input_format: Assumed to be numpy.ndarray or List[List[int]] representing a 1xN grid.
output_format: Must match the input format, containing the transformed 1xN grid.
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills empty space
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: reference point for rearrangement
  - id: colored_block
    color: any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous sequence of identical pixels
    role: the object being moved
components_in_row:
  - id: prefix
    description: Sequence of pixels (usually background) before the colored_block.
    role: preserved segment
  - id: colored_block
    description: The block being moved.
  - id: gap
    description: Sequence of pixels (usually background) between the colored_block and the pivot.
    role: preserved segment, maintains distance relation
  - id: pivot
    description: The single pivot pixel.
  - id: suffix
    description: Sequence of pixels (usually background) after the pivot.
    role: preserved segment
relationship:
  - type: spatial order (input)
    description: The components appear in the order: prefix, colored_block, gap, pivot, suffix.
  - type: spatial order (output)
    description: The components appear in the order: prefix, pivot, gap, colored_block, suffix.
action:
  - type: rearrange
    details: Deconstruct the input row into its five components (prefix, block, gap, pivot, suffix) and reconstruct it in the specified output order.
constraints:
  - Input grid contains exactly one row.
  - Exactly one pivot pixel (maroon 9) exists in the row.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or maroon 9) exists in the row.
  - The colored block initially precedes the pivot pixel.
