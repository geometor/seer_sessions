**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input data structure passed to the `transform` function. The error `Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN)` occurred consistently across all examples, indicating that the input format provided by the testing harness is likely a `numpy.ndarray` or a list structure that doesn't match `List[List[int]]` with a single inner list, even though the conceptual data represents a single row.

The core transformation logic (identifying prefix, block, gap, pivot, suffix and rearranging them) appears consistent with the visual examples. The strategy is to:

1.  Adjust the `transform` function to correctly handle the input data type, likely by assuming it's a `numpy.ndarray` or a more general list structure representing the grid.
2.  Extract the first (and only relevant) row from the input grid.
3.  Apply the previously developed 1D rearrangement logic to this extracted row.
4.  Format the result back into the expected output grid structure (a `numpy.ndarray` or list of lists matching the input structure, containing the single transformed row).

**Metrics**

No code execution is needed to gather metrics, as the error prevents processing. The core observation is that the input format assumption was incorrect. The visual structure remains consistent:

*   All inputs/outputs are 1xN grids.
*   Each contains a single maroon (9) pivot.
*   Each contains a single contiguous block of another color (non-white, non-maroon).
*   The block starts before the pivot in the input.
*   The block is moved to after the pivot in the output, preserving the relative order of all other elements.

objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills empty space
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)

    color: any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous sequence of identical pixels
    role: the object being moved
components_in_row:

  - id: colored_block
    description: The block being moved.
  - id: gap
    description: Sequence of pixels (usually background) between the colored_block and the pivot.

relationship:
  - type: spatial order (input)
    description: The components appear in the order: prefix, colored_block, gap, pivot, suffix.
  - type: spatial order (output)
    description: The components appear in the order: prefix, pivot, gap, colored_block, suffix.
action:
  - type: rearrange
    details: Deconstruct the input row into its five components (prefix, block, gap, pivot, suffix) and reconstruct it in the specified output order.
constraints:
  - Input grid contains exactly one row.
  - Exactly one pivot pixel (maroon 9) exists in the row.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or maroon 9) exists in the row.
  - The colored block initially precedes the pivot pixel.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (likely a `numpy.ndarray` or `List[List[int]]` representing a 1xN grid).
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid into a 1D list or array.
3.  Identify the index (`pivot_index`) and value (`pivot_value`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the row.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record the sequence of pixels forming this block (`colored_block`) and their start (`block_start`) and end (`block_end`) indices. Ensure `block_end` is less than `pivot_index`.
5.  Extract the sequence of pixels before the `colored_block` (`prefix = row[0 : block_start]`).
6.  Extract the sequence of pixels between the `colored_block` and the `pivot` (`gap = row[block_end + 1 : pivot_index]`).
7.  Extract the sequence of pixels after the `pivot` (`suffix = row[pivot_index + 1 : ]`).
8.  Construct the output row by concatenating the identified components in the new order: `prefix + [pivot_value] + gap + colored_block + suffix`.
9.  Format the resulting row back into the original grid structure (e.g., `numpy.array([output_row])` or `[output_row]`).
10. Return the transformed grid.
