            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input data structure passed to the `transform` function. The error `Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN)` occurred consistently across all examples, indicating that the input format provided by the testing harness is likely a `numpy.ndarray` or a list structure that doesn't match `List[List[int]]` with a single inner list, even though the conceptual data represents a single row.\n\nThe core transformation logic (identifying prefix, block, gap, pivot, suffix and rearranging them) appears consistent with the visual examples. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  Adjust the `transform` function to correctly handle the input data type, likely by assuming it's a `numpy.ndarray` or a more general list structure representing the grid.\n2.  Extract the first (and only relevant) row from the input grid.\n3.  Apply the previously developed 1D rearrangement logic to this extracted row.\n4.  Format the result back into the expected output grid structure (a `numpy.ndarray` or list of lists matching the input structure, containing the single transformed row).\n\n**Metrics**\n\nNo code execution is needed to gather metrics, as the error prevents processing. The core observation is that the input format assumption was incorrect. The visual structure remains consistent:\n\n*   All inputs/outputs are 1xN grids.\n*   Each contains a single maroon (9) pivot.\n*   Each contains a single contiguous block of another color (non-white, non-maroon).\n*   The block starts before the pivot in the input.\n*   The block is moved to after the pivot in the output, preserving the relative order of all other elements.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
