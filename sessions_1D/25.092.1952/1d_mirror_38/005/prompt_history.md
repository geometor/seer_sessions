**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are single rows (1xN grids) of pixels.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each grid contains:
    *   Background pixels (white, 0).
    *   A single unique 'pivot' pixel (maroon, 9).
    *   A single contiguous block of identical colored pixels (yellow, gray, or blue in the examples), which are neither white nor maroon.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the contiguous colored block. In the input, this block always appears *before* the maroon pixel. In the output, this block is moved to the position immediately *after* the maroon pixel.
4.  **Structure Preservation:** The relative order of all other pixels (white background pixels and the maroon pivot pixel) is preserved. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input data structure passed to the `transform` function. The error `Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN)` occurred consistently across all examples, indicating that the input format provided by the testing harness is likely a `numpy.ndarray` or a list structure that doesn't match `List[List[int]]` with a single inner list, even though the conceptual data represents a single row.

The core transformation logic (identifying prefix, block, gap, pivot, suffix and rearranging them) appears consistent with the visual examples. The strategy is to:

1.  Adjust the `transform` function to correctly handle the input data type, likely by assuming it's a `numpy.ndarray` or a more general list structure representing the grid.
2.  Extract the first (and only relevant) row from the input grid.
3.  Apply the previously developed 1D rearrangement logic to this extracted row.
4.  Format the result back into the expected output grid structure (a `numpy.ndarray` or list of lists matching the input structure, containing the single transformed row).

**Metrics**

No code execution is needed to gather metrics, as the error prevents processing. The core observation is that the input format assumption was incorrect. The visual structure remains consistent:

*   All inputs/outputs are 1xN grids.
*   Each contains a single maroon (9) pivot.
*   Each contains a single contiguous block of another color (non-white, non-maroon).
*   The block starts before the pivot in the input.
*   The block is moved to after the pivot in the output, preserving the relative order of all other elements.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (likely a `numpy.ndarray` or `List[List[int]]` representing a 1xN grid).
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid into a 1D list or array.
3.  Identify the index (`pivot_index`) and value (`pivot_value`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the row.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record the sequence of pixels forming this block (`colored_block`) and their start (`block_start`) and end (`block_end`) indices. Ensure `block_end` is less than `pivot_index`.
5.  Extract the sequence of pixels before the `colored_block` (`prefix = row[0 : block_start]`).
6.  Extract the sequence of pixels between the `colored_block` and the `pivot` (`gap = row[block_end + 1 : pivot_index]`).
7.  Extract the sequence of pixels after the `pivot` (`suffix = row[pivot_index + 1 : ]`).
8.  Construct the output row by concatenating the identified components in the new order: `prefix + [pivot_value] + gap + colored_block + suffix`.
9.  Format the resulting row back into the original grid structure (e.g., `numpy.array([output_row])` or `[output_row]`).
10. Return the transformed grid.
