**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are single rows (1xN grids) of pixels.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each grid contains:
    *   Background pixels (white, 0).
    *   A single unique 'pivot' pixel (maroon, 9).
    *   A single contiguous block of identical colored pixels (yellow, gray, or blue in the examples), which are neither white nor maroon.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the contiguous colored block. In the input, this block always appears *before* the maroon pixel. In the output, this block is moved to the position immediately *after* the maroon pixel.
4.  **Structure Preservation:** The relative order of all other pixels (white background pixels and the maroon pivot pixel) is preserved. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills empty space
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: defines the target location for rearrangement
  - id: colored_block
    color: any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous sequence of identical pixels
    role: the object being moved
relationship:
  - type: spatial order (input)
    description: The 'colored_block' appears somewhere before the 'pivot' pixel in the linear sequence.
  - type: spatial order (output)
    description: The 'colored_block' appears immediately after the 'pivot' pixel in the linear sequence.
action:
  - type: move
    target: colored_block
    details: The block is extracted from its original position and reinserted immediately after the pivot pixel. All other pixels maintain their relative order.
constraints:
  - Exactly one pivot pixel exists.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of a single color (not white or maroon) exists.
  - The colored block initially precedes the pivot pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the index (position) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input row.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record the sequence of pixels forming this block and their start and end indices in the input row.
3.  Create a new sequence (list) of pixels by removing the identified colored block from the input row.
4.  Find the index of the maroon (9) pixel within this new, shorter sequence.
5.  Insert the recorded colored block sequence immediately after the maroon pixel's position in the new sequence.
6.  The resulting sequence is the final output row.

**General Assessment**

The previous transformation code failed because it incorrectly implemented the rearrangement logic. While it successfully identified the key components (prefix, colored block, gap, pivot, suffix), it reassembled them in the wrong order: `prefix + pivot + gap + colored_block + suffix`. This resulted in placing the pivot *before* the gap and the block *after* the gap, effectively swapping the block and pivot's positions relative to the gap, but not achieving the desired outcome of moving the block *immediately* after the pivot while preserving the relative order of all other elements.

The correct strategy is to:
1.  Identify the colored block and its boundaries.
2.  Identify the pivot pixel's position.
3.  Create a new list by removing the colored block from the original input list.
4.  Find the position of the pivot pixel in this *new*, shorter list.
5.  Insert the removed colored block *immediately after* the pivot pixel's position in the new list.

This approach ensures that the block is moved to the correct location, and the relative order of all background pixels and the pivot pixel is maintained.

**Metrics**

Let's re-examine the components identified by the previous `find_components_1d` function and how they should be assembled for the correct output.

```
**Revised Assessment:**

My `reconstruct_correctly` function based on the removal/insertion logic *also* failed to produce the expected output. This indicates a flaw in my understanding or in the implementation of the removal/insertion logic itself.

Let's re-examine Example 1:
Input:          `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Block: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` (indices 6-12)
Pivot: `9` (index 16)

1.  **Remove block:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length reduced by 7)
2.  **Find pivot `9` in temp list:** It's at index 9.
3.  **Insert block after pivot:** `temp_row[:9+1] + block + temp_row[9+1:]`
    *   `temp_row[:10]`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]`
    *   `block`: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`
    *   `temp_row[10:]`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Result: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   This is what my `reconstruct_correctly` produced.

**Why is it different from the expected output?**
Expected Output:  `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]`

Comparing my correct reconstruction with the expected output:
My Result: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Expected:  `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]`

The difference lies in the elements *between* the original block position and the original pivot position (the "gap").
Original Input: `prefix [0..5] | block [6..12] | gap [13..15] | pivot [16] | suffix [17..29]`
Expected Output: `prefix [0..5] | gap [13..15] | pivot [16] | block [6..12] | suffix [17..29]` (with indices adjusted for the new structure).

It seems the block is moved *after* the pivot, but the *original* gap pixels (`[0, 0, 0]` in Ex1, `[0]` in Ex2, `[0, 0, 0]` in Ex3) move along with the pivot, staying *between* the prefix and the pivot.

**Revised Understanding:**

The transformation doesn't just move the block after the pivot in the sequence *after* removing the block. Instead, it rearranges the *original* sequence segments:
1.  Keep the part *before* the block (`prefix`).
2.  Append the part *between* the block and the pivot (`gap`).
3.  Append the `pivot`.
4.  Append the `block`.
5.  Append the part *after* the pivot (`suffix`).

Let's test this hypothesis:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Prefix: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Gap: `[0, 0, 0]`
    *   Pivot: `[9]`
    *   Block: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`
    *   Suffix: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Reassembled: `prefix + gap + pivot + block + suffix`
    *   `[0,0,0,0,0,0] + [0,0,0] + [9] + [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] + [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`
    *   Result: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -- Still not matching expected.

There must be something wrong with my component identification or the rearrangement logic derived. Let's re-examine the input/output pairs directly.

**Input 1:** `[0,0,0,0,0,0, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4, 0,0,0, 9, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`
**Output 1:** `[0,0,0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 0,0,0, 9, 0,0,0, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4, 0,0,0]`

Observation: The block `[4,4,4,4,4,4,4]` moves from starting at index 6 to starting at index 20. The pivot `9` stays at index 16. The gap `[0,0,0]` between the block and pivot in the input (indices 13-15) seems to disappear, or rather, the space is filled with background `0`s that were originally *before* the block.

Let's try the initial Natural Language Program again, implementing it carefully:

1.  **Identify Pivot Index:** Input 1: Pivot `9` is at index 16.
2.  **Identify Colored Block & Indices:** Block `[4,4,4,4,4,4,4]`, indices 6 to 12.
3.  **Create New Sequence (Remove Block):**
    `[0,0,0,0,0,0, <removed>, 0,0,0, 9, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`
    `[0,0,0,0,0,0, 0,0,0, 9, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` (Length 23)
4.  **Find Pivot Index in New Sequence:** The pivot `9` is now at index 9.
5.  **Insert Block After Pivot:** Insert `[4,4,4,4,4,4,4]` after index 9.
    `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 9] + [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] + [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`
    Result: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 9, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` (Length 30)

This matches the result from my `reconstruct_correctly` function and *still* doesn't match the expected output.

**Final Re-evaluation:**

What if the block moves to be *after* the pivot's *original* position, padded by zeros?

Input 1: `... 4,4,4 ... 0,0,0, 9, 0,0,0 ...`
Output 1: `... 0,0,0 ... 0,0,0, 9, 0,0,0, 4,4,4 ...`

It looks like the block is *cut* from its position and *pasted* starting 3 positions *after* the pivot (position `pivot_index + 1 + gap_length`). Let's check if the gap length is constant.

*   Ex 1: Gap `[0,0,0]`, length 3. Block `[4..4]` starts at `16 + 1 + 3 = 20` in output. Matches.
*   Ex 2: Gap `[0]`, length 1. Block `[5..5]` starts at `11 + 1 + 1 = 13` in output. Matches `[... 9, 0, 5,5,5...]`.
*   Ex 3: Gap `[0,0,0]`, length 3. Block `[1..1]` starts at `13 + 1 + 3 = 17` in output. Matches `[... 9, 0,0,0, 1,1,1...]`.

This seems to be the rule. The block is removed, leaving background `0`s in its place, and then inserted starting at index `original_pivot_index + 1 + gap_length`.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_type: 1D rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN list)
background_color: white (0)
pivot_color: maroon (9)
objects:
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: Anchor point for rearrangement. Its position remains fixed.
  - id: colored_block
    color: any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous sequence of identical pixels
      - located strictly before the pivot pixel in the input
    role: The object being moved.
  - id: gap
    color: assumed to be background_color (white 0) based on examples
    properties:
      - contiguous sequence of pixels located strictly between the colored_block and the pivot.
      - Can have zero length if block and pivot are adjacent.
    role: Defines the offset for the moved block's new position.
relationship:
  - type: spatial order (input)
    description: prefix + colored_block + gap + pivot + suffix
  - type: spatial order (output)
    description: prefix + background_fill + gap + pivot + background_fill_gap + colored_block + suffix
    clarification: The original location of the colored_block is replaced by background pixels. The block is inserted after the pivot, offset by the original gap length.
action:
  - type: cut and paste
    target: colored_block
    steps:
      1. Identify the pivot pixel and its index (`pivot_index`).
      2. Identify the colored block, its content (`block_data`), start index (`block_start`), and end index (`block_end`).
      3. Calculate the gap length: `gap_length = pivot_index - block_end - 1`.
      4. Create the output row initialized as a copy of the input row.
      5. Replace the original block location (from `block_start` to `block_end`) in the output row with background pixels (0).
      6. Define the insertion point for the block: `insert_index = pivot_index + 1`.
      7. Insert the `block_data` into the output row starting at `insert_index`. Note: This description needs refinement as simple insertion might shift subsequent elements incorrectly. A better way is to construct the output piece by piece or use slicing carefully.
action_revised:
  - type: rearrangement
    target: colored_block
    steps:
      1. Identify the `pivot` pixel and its index (`pivot_index`).
      2. Identify the `colored_block` (pixels `block_data`, start index `block_start`, end index `block_end`).
      3. Identify the `gap` pixels between the block and pivot (indices `block_end + 1` to `pivot_index - 1`). Calculate `gap_length`.
      4. Determine the target start index for the block in the output: `target_block_start = pivot_index + 1 + gap_length`.
      5. Create the output row, initially filled with background color (0) and having the same length as the input.
      6. Place the `pivot` pixel at `pivot_index` in the output row.
      7. Place the `colored_block` (data) starting at `target_block_start` in the output row.
      8. Fill the rest of the output row based on the *non-block*, *non-pivot* pixels from the input, preserving their original positions relative to the grid boundaries and the pivot. (Essentially, copy the input, overwrite the block's original position with 0s, then overwrite the target position with the block data).
action_final:
  - type: relocate block
    target: colored_block
    steps:
      1. Identify the `pivot` pixel and its index (`pivot_index`).
      2. Identify the `colored_block` (pixels `block_data`, start index `block_start`, end index `block_end`).
      3. Calculate the length of the gap between the block and the pivot: `gap_length = pivot_index - block_end - 1`.
      4. Create the output row as a copy of the input row.
      5. Overwrite the pixels in the output row from `block_start` to `block_end` with the background color (0).
      6. Calculate the target start index for the block in the output: `target_block_start = pivot_index + 1 + gap_length`.
      7. Overwrite the pixels in the output row starting from `target_block_start` for the length of the block, using the `block_data`.
constraints:
  - Exactly one pivot pixel exists.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or maroon 9) exists.
  - The colored block initially precedes the pivot pixel.
  - The length of the input and output rows are identical.
  - The pivot pixel does not move.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the `output_row` as a direct copy of the `input_row`.
2.  Find the index (`pivot_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the `input_row`.
3.  Find the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record the block's pixel values (`block_data`), its start index (`block_start`), and its end index (`block_end`).
4.  Calculate the length of the gap between the end of the block and the pivot: `gap_length = pivot_index - block_end - 1`. (Ensure `gap_length` is non-negative).
5.  Replace the segment of the `output_row` from `block_start` up to and including `block_end` with white (0) pixels.
6.  Calculate the target starting index for placing the block in the `output_row`: `target_block_start = pivot_index + 1 + gap_length`.
7.  Replace the segment of the `output_row` starting at `target_block_start` with the `block_data`. Ensure the correct number of pixels are replaced (equal to the length of `block_data`).
8.  Return the modified `output_row`.
