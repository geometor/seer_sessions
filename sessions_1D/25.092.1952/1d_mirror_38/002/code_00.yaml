task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills empty space, forms gap
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: serves as a fixed reference point for rearrangement
  - id: colored_block
    color: any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous sequence of identical pixels
    role: the object being repositioned
  - id: gap
    color: white (0) (exclusively, based on examples)
    count: 1 (sequence of 0 or more pixels)
    role: separates block and pivot, preserves its length and content during transformation
    location_input: between colored_block and pivot
    location_output: between pivot and colored_block
relationship:
  - type: spatial order (input)
    description: Sequence is [prefix] + [colored_block] + [gap] + [pivot] + [suffix]
  - type: spatial order (output)
    description: Sequence is [prefix] + [pivot] + [gap] + [colored_block] + [suffix]
action:
  - type: swap_relative_position
    target_1: colored_block
    target_2: pivot
    context: The block and pivot effectively swap places relative to each other, keeping the separating gap sequence between them.
    details: The sequence segments defined by the block, gap, and pivot are rearranged. The prefix (elements before the block) and suffix (elements after the pivot) remain in their original positions relative to the start and end of the row.
constraints:
  - Exactly one pivot pixel (maroon, 9) exists.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or maroon 9) exists.
  - The colored block initially precedes the pivot pixel.
  - The space between the colored block and the pivot (the gap) consists only of background pixels (white, 0).
