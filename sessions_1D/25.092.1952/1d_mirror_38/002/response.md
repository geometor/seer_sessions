**General Assessment**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code correctly identified the core components: a background, a pivot pixel (maroon), and a colored block. It also correctly identified the overall action as moving the colored block relative to the pivot. However, the precise placement rule was wrong. The code failed because it determined the pivot's index *after* removing the colored block from the list, causing the insertion point to be incorrect relative to the original structure. The analysis of the failed examples reveals a consistent pattern: the colored block and the pivot pixel swap positions, while the sequence of background pixels originally separating them (the "gap") is preserved and placed *between* the pivot and the block in the output.

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  Modify the logic to identify the colored block, the pivot pixel, and the sequence of pixels *between* them in the original input row.
2.  Reconstruct the output row by placing elements in the new order: elements before the block, the pivot pixel, the gap sequence, the colored block, and elements originally after the pivot.
3.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect this refined understanding.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills empty space, forms gap
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: serves as a fixed reference point for rearrangement
  - id: colored_block
    color: any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous sequence of identical pixels
    role: the object being repositioned
  - id: gap
    color: white (0) (exclusively, based on examples)
    count: 1 (sequence of 0 or more pixels)
    role: separates block and pivot, preserves its length and content during transformation
    location_input: between colored_block and pivot
    location_output: between pivot and colored_block
relationship:
  - type: spatial order (input)
    description: Sequence is [prefix] + [colored_block] + [gap] + [pivot] + [suffix]
  - type: spatial order (output)
    description: Sequence is [prefix] + [pivot] + [gap] + [colored_block] + [suffix]
action:
  - type: swap_relative_position
    target_1: colored_block
    target_2: pivot
    context: The block and pivot effectively swap places relative to each other, keeping the separating gap sequence between them.
    details: The sequence segments defined by the block, gap, and pivot are rearranged. The prefix (elements before the block) and suffix (elements after the pivot) remain in their original positions relative to the start and end of the row.
constraints:
  - Exactly one pivot pixel (maroon, 9) exists.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or maroon 9) exists.
  - The colored block initially precedes the pivot pixel.
  - The space between the colored block and the pivot (the gap) consists only of background pixels (white, 0).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Parse the input row to identify four key components:
    a.  The contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9) (`colored_block`). Record its sequence and start/end indices.
    b.  The single maroon (9) pixel (`pivot`). Record its index.
    c.  The sequence of pixels located strictly between the end index of the `colored_block` and the index of the `pivot` (`gap`). Record this sequence.
    d.  The sequence of pixels before the start index of the `colored_block` (`prefix`).
    e.  The sequence of pixels after the index of the `pivot` (`suffix`).
2.  Construct the output row by concatenating the identified components in the following order: `prefix` + `pivot` + `gap` + `colored_block` + `suffix`.
3.  Return the newly constructed row as the output grid.
