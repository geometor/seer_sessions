task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills empty space
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: defines the target location for rearrangement
  - id: colored_block
    color: any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - contiguous sequence of identical pixels
    role: the object being moved
relationship:
  - type: spatial order (input)
    description: The 'colored_block' appears somewhere before the 'pivot' pixel in the linear sequence.
  - type: spatial order (output)
    description: The 'colored_block' appears immediately after the 'pivot' pixel in the linear sequence.
action:
  - type: move
    target: colored_block
    details: The block is extracted from its original position and reinserted immediately after the pivot pixel. All other pixels maintain their relative order.
constraints:
  - Exactly one pivot pixel exists.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of a single color (not white or maroon) exists.
  - The colored block initially precedes the pivot pixel.
