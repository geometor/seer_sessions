In the input, this block always appears *before* the maroon pixel. In the output, this block is moved to the position immediately *after* the maroon pixel.\n4.  **Structure Preservation:** The relative order of all other pixels (white background pixels and the maroon pivot pixel) is preserved. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
