**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are single rows (1xN grids) of pixels.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each grid contains:
    *   Background pixels (white, 0).
    *   A single unique 'pivot' pixel (maroon, 9).
    *   A single contiguous block of identical colored pixels (yellow, gray, or blue in the examples), which are neither white nor maroon.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the contiguous colored block. In the input, this block always appears *before* the maroon pixel. In the output, this block is moved to the position immediately *after* the maroon pixel.
4.  **Structure Preservation:** The relative order of all other pixels (white background pixels and the maroon pivot pixel) is preserved. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.

**General Assessment**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code correctly identified the core components: a background, a pivot pixel (maroon), and a colored block. It also correctly identified the overall action as moving the colored block relative to the pivot. However, the precise placement rule was wrong. The code failed because it determined the pivot's index *after* removing the colored block from the list, causing the insertion point to be incorrect relative to the original structure. The analysis of the failed examples reveals a consistent pattern: the colored block and the pivot pixel swap positions, while the sequence of background pixels originally separating them (the "gap") is preserved and placed *between* the pivot and the block in the output.

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  Modify the logic to identify the colored block, the pivot pixel, and the sequence of pixels *between* them in the original input row.
2.  Reconstruct the output row by placing elements in the new order: elements before the block, the pivot pixel, the gap sequence, the colored block, and elements originally after the pivot.
3.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect this refined understanding.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Parse the input row to identify four key components:
    a.  The contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9) (`colored_block`). Record its sequence and start/end indices.
    b.  The single maroon (9) pixel (`pivot`). Record its index.
    c.  The sequence of pixels located strictly between the end index of the `colored_block` and the index of the `pivot` (`gap`). Record this sequence.
    d.  The sequence of pixels before the start index of the `colored_block` (`prefix`).
    e.  The sequence of pixels after the index of the `pivot` (`suffix`).
2.  Construct the output row by concatenating the identified components in the following order: `prefix` + `pivot` + `gap` + `colored_block` + `suffix`.
3.  Return the newly constructed row as the output grid.
