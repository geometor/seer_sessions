            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Data Format:** The input and output are 1D arrays (or sequences) of integers representing colors.\n2.  **Key Colors:** The colors white (0), maroon (9), and one other color (red 2, gray 5, or magenta 6) are present in each example.\n3.  **Structure:** Each input contains a single maroon pixel (9) and a contiguous block of another single color (the \"movable block\"). The rest of the pixels are white (0).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core change involves the position of the movable block relative to the maroon pixel. The maroon pixel itself remains in the same position. The movable block shifts from one side of the maroon pixel to the other.\n5.  **Spacing:** In the input, the movable block is separated from the maroon pixel by one or more white pixels. In the output, the movable block is placed on the opposite side of the maroon pixel, separated by exactly one white pixel.\n6.  **Conservation:** The length of the array, the maroon pixel's position, the color of the movable block, and the length of the movable block all remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
