task_description: Move a colored block across a stationary pivot pixel.

elements:
  - object: movable_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of pixels
      - color: single color, not white (0) and not maroon (9)
      - constraints: only one such block exists per input
  - object: pivot_pixel
    properties:
      - type: single pixel
      - color: maroon (9)
      - state: stationary (position does not change)
      - constraints: exactly one such pixel exists per input
  - object: background
    properties:
      - type: pixels
      - color: white (0)
      - role: fills the space not occupied by the movable block or pivot pixel

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [movable_block, pivot_pixel]
    input_state: The movable_block is located either to the left or right of the pivot_pixel, separated by one or more background pixels.
    output_state: The movable_block is located on the opposite side of the pivot_pixel compared to the input, separated by exactly one background pixel.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot_pixel
    result: store its index (position)
  - action: identify
    target: movable_block
    result: store its color, length, and starting index
  - action: determine_relative_position
    operands: [movable_block, pivot_pixel]
    result: boolean (is block left of pivot?)
  - action: create_output_array
    properties:
      - size: same as input array
      - initial_fill: background color (0)
  - action: place_pivot
    target: output_array
    details: place the pivot_pixel at its original index
  - action: calculate_new_block_position
    based_on: [pivot_pixel index, relative_position, movable_block length]
    details:
      - if block was left, new start index is pivot_index + 2
      - if block was right, new start index is pivot_index - 1 - block_length
  - action: place_block
    target: output_array
    details: place the movable_block (using its color and length) at the calculated new position

constraints:
  - The array size remains constant.
  - The color and length of the movable block remain constant.
  - The position of the pivot pixel remains constant.
  - The output always has exactly one background pixel between the pivot and the moved block.
