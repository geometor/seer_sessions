Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Data Format:** The input and output are 1D arrays (or sequences) of integers representing colors.
2.  **Key Colors:** The colors white (0), maroon (9), and one other color (red 2, gray 5, or magenta 6) are present in each example.
3.  **Structure:** Each input contains a single maroon pixel (9) and a contiguous block of another single color (the "movable block"). The rest of the pixels are white (0).
4.  **Transformation:** The core change involves the position of the movable block relative to the maroon pixel. The maroon pixel itself remains in the same position. The movable block shifts from one side of the maroon pixel to the other.
5.  **Spacing:** In the input, the movable block is separated from the maroon pixel by one or more white pixels. In the output, the movable block is placed on the opposite side of the maroon pixel, separated by exactly one white pixel.
6.  **Conservation:** The length of the array, the maroon pixel's position, the color of the movable block, and the length of the movable block all remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored block across a stationary pivot pixel.

elements:
  - object: movable_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of pixels
      - color: single color, not white (0) and not maroon (9)
      - constraints: only one such block exists per input
  - object: pivot_pixel
    properties:
      - type: single pixel
      - color: maroon (9)
      - state: stationary (position does not change)
      - constraints: exactly one such pixel exists per input
  - object: background
    properties:
      - type: pixels
      - color: white (0)
      - role: fills the space not occupied by the movable block or pivot pixel

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [movable_block, pivot_pixel]
    input_state: The movable_block is located either to the left or right of the pivot_pixel, separated by one or more background pixels.
    output_state: The movable_block is located on the opposite side of the pivot_pixel compared to the input, separated by exactly one background pixel.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot_pixel
    result: store its index (position)
  - action: identify
    target: movable_block
    result: store its color, length, and starting index
  - action: determine_relative_position
    operands: [movable_block, pivot_pixel]
    result: boolean (is block left of pivot?)
  - action: create_output_array
    properties:
      - size: same as input array
      - initial_fill: background color (0)
  - action: place_pivot
    target: output_array
    details: place the pivot_pixel at its original index
  - action: calculate_new_block_position
    based_on: [pivot_pixel index, relative_position, movable_block length]
    details:
      - if block was left, new start index is pivot_index + 2
      - if block was right, new start index is pivot_index - 1 - block_length
  - action: place_block
    target: output_array
    details: place the movable_block (using its color and length) at the calculated new position

constraints:
  - The array size remains constant.
  - The color and length of the movable block remain constant.
  - The position of the pivot pixel remains constant.
  - The output always has exactly one background pixel between the pivot and the moved block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output array of the same size as the input array, filling it entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the index (position) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array.
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) at this same index in the output array.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input array that are all the same color and are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record the color and length of this block.
5.  Determine if this block is located to the left or right of the maroon pixel in the input array.
6.  If the block was to the left of the maroon pixel in the input:
    *   Calculate the starting index for the block in the output array as `maroon_pixel_index + 2`.
    *   Fill the output array segment starting at this calculated index with the identified block (using its recorded color and length).
7.  If the block was to the right of the maroon pixel in the input:
    *   Calculate the starting index for the block in the output array as `maroon_pixel_index - 1 - block_length`.
    *   Fill the output array segment starting at this calculated index with the identified block (using its recorded color and length).
8.  Return the completed output array.
