"""
Reflect a colored horizontal segment across a fixed pivot pixel (maroon, 9) in a grid that is effectively 1D (represented either as a 1D list or a 1xN 2D list of lists).

The transformation identifies a single pivot pixel (color 9) and a contiguous horizontal 
segment of a different color (not white 0 and not maroon 9) within the single row. 
It then reflects the position of this segment across the pivot pixel's column index. 
The original segment is removed (set to white 0), and the segment is redrawn in its 
reflected position with the same color and length.
