Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The examples provided (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) all show input and output grids that are 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Colors**: The grids primarily use white (0) as the background color.
3.  **Key Pixels/Objects**:
    *   **Pivot Pixel**: In each example, there is a single maroon pixel (9). Its position remains unchanged between the input and output grids. This suggests it acts as a fixed point or pivot.
    *   **Colored Segment**: Each input grid contains a contiguous horizontal segment of a single color (blue (1) in `train_1`, magenta (6) in `train_2`, green (3) in `train_3`). This segment is the only element, apart from the background, that changes position.
4.  **Transformation**: The colored segment appears to move from one side of the maroon pivot pixel to the other. The distance and length relationships suggest a reflection across the pivot pixel. The segment in the output is the same color and length as in the input, but its position is mirrored relative to the maroon pixel.

**Facts YAML:**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect a colored horizontal segment across a fixed pivot pixel in a 1D grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN or list)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    shape: point (single pixel)
    properties:
      - position: fixed across input and output
  - id: segment
    color: variable (any color except white (0) or maroon (9))
    shape: horizontal_line (contiguous block of same-colored pixels)
    properties:
      - length: conserved between input and output
      - position: changes between input and output

relationships:
  - type: reflection
    subject: segment
    reference: pivot
    description: The segment's position in the output is a reflection of its input position across the pivot pixel's column index.

actions:
  - identify: Locate the pivot pixel (color 9) and record its column index.
  - identify: Locate the colored segment (contiguous non-0, non-9 pixels), record its color, start column index, and end column index.
  - calculate: Determine the new start and end column indices for the segment by reflecting the original start and end indices across the pivot index. The reflection formula for a column `c` across pivot `p` is `c' = 2*p - c`.
  - create_output: Start with a copy of the input grid.
  - modify: Erase the original segment by setting its pixels to the background color (0).
  - modify: Draw the segment with its original color at the newly calculated reflected position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the column index (`pivot_col`) of the single maroon pixel (color 9).
3.  Identify the contiguous horizontal segment of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`segment_color`), its starting column index (`start_col`), and its ending column index (`end_col`).
4.  Iterate through the columns from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) in the output grid and set the pixel color at these columns to white (0) to erase the original segment.
5.  Calculate the reflected starting column index (`new_start_col`) using the formula: `new_start_col = 2 * pivot_col - end_col`.
6.  Calculate the reflected ending column index (`new_end_col`) using the formula: `new_end_col = 2 * pivot_col - start_col`.
7.  Iterate through the columns from `new_start_col` to `new_end_col` (inclusive) in the output grid and set the pixel color at these columns to `segment_color`.
8.  Return the modified output grid.

"""
Reflect a colored horizontal segment across a fixed pivot pixel (maroon, 9) in a 1D grid.

The transformation identifies a single pivot pixel (color 9) and a contiguous horizontal 
segment of a different color (not white 0 and not maroon 9). It then reflects the position 
of this segment across the pivot pixel. The original segment is removed (set to white 0), 
and the segment is redrawn in its reflected position with the same color and length.
