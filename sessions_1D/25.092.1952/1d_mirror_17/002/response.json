            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was strictly a 1D list or array, while the ARC testing framework likely provides it as a 2D array (list of lists), even if it only has one row (e.g., `[[0, 0, 9, ...]]`). Comparisons and indexing operations on a 2D NumPy array behave differently than on a 1D array. Specifically, comparing a 2D array (or a row extracted from it) with a scalar results in a boolean array, which cannot be implicitly evaluated as a single True/False value in conditions like `if pixel_color == 0:`, leading to the \"ambiguous truth value\" error.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the code to explicitly handle the 1xN input format:\n1.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid at the beginning of the `transform` function.\n2.  Perform all subsequent operations (finding pivot, finding segment, modifying the grid) on this extracted 1D row.\n3.  Return the modified row, potentially wrapped back into a list of lists format if required by the framework.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nSince the previous code failed execution, metrics are derived from manual analysis of the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Length 30)\n    *   Pivot (9) index: 16\n    *   Segment: Color 1, Start 4, End 10\n    *   Expected Reflected Segment: Color 1, Start 22 (2*16-10), End 28 (2*16-4)\n    *   Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0]` (Matches expectation)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Length 30)\n    *   Pivot (9) index: 16\n    *   Segment: Color 6, Start 6, End 14\n    *   Expected Reflected Segment: Color 6, Start 18 (2*16-14), End 26 (2*16-6)\n    *   Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0]` (Matches expectation)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Length 30)\n    *   Pivot (9) index: 16\n    *   Segment: Color 3, Start 4, End 12\n    *   Expected Reflected Segment: Color 3, Start 20 (2*16-12), End 28 (2*16-4)\n    *   Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0]` (Matches expectation)\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
