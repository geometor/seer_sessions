task_description: Reflect a colored horizontal segment across a fixed pivot pixel in a 1D grid, potentially represented as a 1xN 2D array.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: Primarily 1D logic, but input format may be 1xN 2D.
  background_color: white (0)
  width: Variable (e.g., 30 in examples)
  height: 1

objects:
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    shape: point (single pixel)
    properties:
      - position: fixed column index within the row.
      - count: exactly one per grid.
  - id: segment
    color: variable (any color except white (0) or maroon (9))
    shape: horizontal_line (contiguous block of same-colored pixels within the row)
    properties:
      - length: conserved between input and output.
      - position: changes between input and output.
      - count: exactly one per grid.
      - contiguity: pixels are adjacent horizontally.
      - separation: Does not overlap the pivot pixel.

relationships:
  - type: reflection
    subject: segment
    reference: pivot
    description: The segment's position in the output row is a reflection of its input position across the pivot pixel's column index. The segment maintains its color and length.

actions:
  - input_preprocess: If the input grid is 2D (1xN), extract the first row as a 1D array/list.
  - identify_pivot: Locate the pivot pixel (color 9) in the row and record its column index (`pivot_col`).
  - identify_segment: Locate the contiguous colored segment (not 0 or 9) in the row, record its color (`segment_color`), start column index (`start_col`), and end column index (`end_col`).
  - initialize_output: Create a 1D array/list copy of the input row.
  - erase_original: In the output row copy, set the pixels from `start_col` to `end_col` to the background color (0).
  - calculate_reflection: Determine the new start (`new_start_col = 2*pivot_col - end_col`) and end (`new_end_col = 2*pivot_col - start_col`) column indices for the reflected segment.
  - draw_reflected: In the output row copy, set the pixels from `new_start_col` to `new_end_col` to `segment_color`.
  - output_postprocess: Return the modified 1D row, potentially wrapped in a list (e.g., `[modified_row]`) to match the expected output format if it was originally 1xN.
