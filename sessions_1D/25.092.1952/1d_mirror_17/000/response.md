Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The examples provided (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) all show input and output grids that are 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Colors**: The grids primarily use white (0) as the background color.
3.  **Key Pixels/Objects**:
    *   **Pivot Pixel**: In each example, there is a single maroon pixel (9). Its position remains unchanged between the input and output grids. This suggests it acts as a fixed point or pivot.
    *   **Colored Segment**: Each input grid contains a contiguous horizontal segment of a single color (blue (1) in `train_1`, magenta (6) in `train_2`, green (3) in `train_3`). This segment is the only element, apart from the background, that changes position.
4.  **Transformation**: The colored segment appears to move from one side of the maroon pivot pixel to the other. The distance and length relationships suggest a reflection across the pivot pixel. The segment in the output is the same color and length as in the input, but its position is mirrored relative to the maroon pixel.

**Facts YAML:**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect a colored horizontal segment across a fixed pivot pixel in a 1D grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN or list)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    shape: point (single pixel)
    properties:
      - position: fixed across input and output
  - id: segment
    color: variable (any color except white (0) or maroon (9))
    shape: horizontal_line (contiguous block of same-colored pixels)
    properties:
      - length: conserved between input and output
      - position: changes between input and output

relationships:
  - type: reflection
    subject: segment
    reference: pivot
    description: The segment's position in the output is a reflection of its input position across the pivot pixel's column index.

actions:
  - identify: Locate the pivot pixel (color 9) and record its column index.
  - identify: Locate the colored segment (contiguous non-0, non-9 pixels), record its color, start column index, and end column index.
  - calculate: Determine the new start and end column indices for the segment by reflecting the original start and end indices across the pivot index. The reflection formula for a column `c` across pivot `p` is `c' = 2*p - c`.
  - create_output: Start with a copy of the input grid.
  - modify: Erase the original segment by setting its pixels to the background color (0).
  - modify: Draw the segment with its original color at the newly calculated reflected position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the column index (`pivot_col`) of the single maroon pixel (color 9).
3.  Identify the contiguous horizontal segment of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record its color (`segment_color`), its starting column index (`start_col`), and its ending column index (`end_col`).
4.  Iterate through the columns from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) in the output grid and set the pixel color at these columns to white (0) to erase the original segment.
5.  Calculate the reflected starting column index (`new_start_col`) using the formula: `new_start_col = 2 * pivot_col - end_col`.
6.  Calculate the reflected ending column index (`new_end_col`) using the formula: `new_end_col = 2 * pivot_col - start_col`.
7.  Iterate through the columns from `new_start_col` to `new_end_col` (inclusive) in the output grid and set the pixel color at these columns to `segment_color`.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
