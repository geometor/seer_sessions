task_description: Reflect a colored horizontal segment across a fixed pivot pixel in a 1D grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN or list)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    shape: point (single pixel)
    properties:
      - position: fixed across input and output
  - id: segment
    color: variable (any color except white (0) or maroon (9))
    shape: horizontal_line (contiguous block of same-colored pixels)
    properties:
      - length: conserved between input and output
      - position: changes between input and output

relationships:
  - type: reflection
    subject: segment
    reference: pivot
    description: The segment's position in the output is a reflection of its input position across the pivot pixel's column index.

actions:
  - identify: Locate the pivot pixel (color 9) and record its column index.
  - identify: Locate the colored segment (contiguous non-0, non-9 pixels), record its color, start column index, and end column index.
  - calculate: Determine the new start and end column indices for the segment by reflecting the original start and end indices across the pivot index. The reflection formula for a column `c` across pivot `p` is `c' = 2*p - c`.
  - create_output: Start with a copy of the input grid.
  - modify: Erase the original segment by setting its pixels to the background color (0).
  - modify: Draw the segment with its original color at the newly calculated reflected position.
