Its position remains unchanged between the input and output grids. This suggests it acts as a fixed point or pivot.\n    *   **Colored Segment**: Each input grid contains a contiguous horizontal segment of a single color (blue (1) in `train_1`, magenta (6) in `train_2`, green (3) in `train_3`). This segment is the only element, apart from the background, that changes position.\n4.  **Transformation**: The colored segment appears to move from one side of the maroon pivot pixel to the other. The distance and length relationships suggest a reflection across the pivot pixel. The segment in the output is the same color and length as in the input, but its position is mirrored relative to the maroon pixel.\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
