Finds a single maroon pixel (9) which acts as a separator.
Identifies a contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or maroon 9).
Moves this colored block to the opposite side of the maroon separator, placing it adjacent to the separator.
Fills the original location of the colored block with white pixels (0).
The maroon separator remains in its original position.
