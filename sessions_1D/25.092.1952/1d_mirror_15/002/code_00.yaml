task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - item: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: fills empty space
  - item: separator
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    role: stationary reference point
  - item: colored_block
    color: any color except 0 (white) and 9 (maroon)
    structure: contiguous block of identical pixels
    count: 1
    role: mobile element
properties:
  - property: grid_size
    value: length of the 1D array (consistent between input and output)
  - property: separator_position
    value: index of the maroon pixel (constant)
  - property: block_location
    value: side relative to the separator (left or right)
  - property: block_size
    value: length of the colored block (constant)
  - property: block_color
    value: color of the colored block (constant)
  - property: distance_to_separator
    value: number of background pixels between the separator and the nearest edge of the block + 1 (e.g., distance=1 means adjacent, distance=2 means one pixel between)
    role: key spatial relationship preserved during transformation
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: separator (maroon pixel)
    result: separator_position (index)
  - action: identify
    target: colored_block
    result: block_color, block_size, block_start_index, block_end_index
  - action: determine_relative_position
    target: colored_block
    reference: separator
    result: block_location (left or right)
  - action: calculate_distance
    target: colored_block
    reference: separator
    method: >
      If block is left, distance = separator_position - block_end_index.
      If block is right, distance = block_start_index - separator_position.
    result: distance_to_separator
  - action: move
    target: colored_block
    from: original side of the separator
    to: opposite side of the separator
    placement_rule: >
      Place the block such that the distance from the separator to the block's new nearest edge equals the original distance_to_separator.
  - action: fill
    target: original position of the colored_block
    with: background color (white)
output_construction:
  - Initialize an output array of grid_size, filled with background color (white).
  - Place the separator at separator_position in the output array.
  - Calculate the new start index for the colored_block based on the original block_location and the calculated distance_to_separator:
    - If original block was left: new_start = separator_position + distance_to_separator
    - If original block was right: new_end = separator_position - distance_to_separator, new_start = new_end - block_size + 1
  - Place the colored_block (using block_color and block_size) into the output array starting at the calculated new_start index.
