"""
Transforms a 2D input grid (typically 1xN or Nx1) representing a 1D sequence.
The transformation involves:
1. Identifying a single maroon pixel (9) acting as a stationary separator.
2. Identifying a contiguous block of a single color (neither white 0 nor maroon 9).
3. Calculating the distance (number of cells) between the separator and the nearest edge of the colored block in the flattened grid representation.
4. Creating an output grid of the same shape as the input, initially filled with white (0).
5. Placing the maroon separator (9) at its original position in the output grid (based on flattened index).
6. Placing the colored block on the opposite side of the separator in the output grid, maintaining the calculated distance from the separator to the block's new nearest edge.
7. The logic operates on a flattened 1D view, and the result is reshaped back to the original 2D shape.
