task_type: array_manipulation_1d_logic_on_2d_grid
input_format: 2D grid (typically 1xN or Nx1) representing a 1D sequence.
output_format: 2D grid with the same shape as the input.
components:
  - item: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: fills empty space
  - item: separator
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    structure: single pixel
    role: fixed pivot point, position remains unchanged
  - item: colored_block
    color: any color except 0 (white) and 9 (maroon)
    structure: contiguous block of identical pixels along the main axis (flattened view)
    count: 1
    role: mobile element
properties_measured:
  - property: separator_index
    on: separator
    description: index of the separator in the flattened grid
  - property: block_details
    on: colored_block
    description: includes color, length, start_index, end_index in the flattened grid
  - property: block_side
    on: colored_block
    description: which side of the separator the block resides on ('left' or 'right')
  - property: distance
    on: colored_block relative to separator
    description: number of pixels between the separator and the nearest edge of the block (abs(separator_index - nearest_block_edge_index))
transformation_rule:
  - action: preserve_separator
    target: separator
    details: its position in the output grid is identical to its input grid position
  - action: preserve_block_properties
    target: colored_block
    details: color and length remain unchanged
  - action: flip_side
    target: colored_block
    details: if the block was left of the separator, move it to the right; if right, move left.
  - action: preserve_distance
    target: colored_block
    details: the calculated distance between the separator and the block's nearest edge must be the same in the output as in the input.
  - action: fill_background
    details: all positions not occupied by the separator or the moved block are filled with the background color (white, 0)
output_construction:
  - Initialize an output grid of the same shape as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - Flatten input and output grids for 1D logic.
  - Find separator index, block color, length, start/end indices in the flattened input.
  - Calculate the initial side and distance.
  - Place the separator at its index in the flattened output.
  - Calculate the new start index for the block on the opposite side, maintaining the distance.
  - Place the block (with original color and length) at the new start index in the flattened output.
  - Reshape the flattened output array back to the original 2D input shape.
