*   **Perception:** The input is a 1D array of pixels (represented as integers). It contains a background of white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9) acting as a separator, and a contiguous block of pixels of another single color (blue, green, or red in the examples). The transformation involves moving the colored block from one side of the maroon separator to the other, filling the original location with white pixels. The maroon pixel remains in its original position.

*   **Facts YAML:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_manipulation
    components:
      - item: background
        color: 0 (white)
        role: fills empty space
      - item: separator
        color: 9 (maroon)
        count: 1
        role: pivot point, remains stationary
      - item: colored_block
        color: any color except 0 (white) and 9 (maroon)
        structure: contiguous block of identical pixels
        count: 1
        role: mobile element
    actions:
      - action: identify
        target: separator (maroon pixel)
        result: position (index) of the separator
      - action: identify
        target: colored_block
        result: color, length, and original position (relative to the separator)
      - action: move
        target: colored_block
        from: original side of the separator
        to: opposite side of the separator
        details: place the block adjacent to the separator on the new side
      - action: fill
        target: original position of the colored_block
        with: background color (white)
    constraints:
      - The input array always contains exactly one separator (maroon pixel).
      - The input array always contains exactly one contiguous colored_block (non-white, non-maroon).
      - The separator's position does not change.
    output_construction:
      - Initialize an output array of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white).
      - Place the separator at its original position in the output array.
      - Place the colored_block in the output array on the side of the separator opposite to its original position, immediately adjacent to the separator.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Find the index of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its color and length.
    3.  Determine whether this colored block is positioned entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the maroon pixel.
    4.  Create a new array of the same size as the input, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
    5.  Place the maroon pixel (9) into the new array at the same index it occupied in the input array.
    6.  If the colored block was originally to the left of the maroon pixel, place the block into the new array immediately to the right of the maroon pixel, using its recorded color and length.
    7.  If the colored block was originally to the right of the maroon pixel, place the block into the new array immediately to the left of the maroon pixel, ensuring it ends just before the maroon pixel's index, using its recorded color and length.
    8.  The resulting array is the output.

**General Assessment**

The primary issue appears to be a mismatch between the code execution environment and the code presented. The reported `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...` strongly suggests that an earlier version of the code (specifically, the *first* code block presented in the previous turn containing `if grid == 9:`) was executed. The code block provided under the "Previous Code" heading uses element-wise iteration and comparisons within its helper functions (`find_pixel`, `find_colored_block`), which should not trigger this specific `ValueError` when operating on 1D lists or NumPy arrays derived from them.

The transformation logic implemented in the "Previous Code" block—identifying a separator, a colored block, calculating the index difference (distance) between them, and repositioning the block on the opposite side while maintaining this distance—appears to correctly model the transformations shown in the training examples based on manual analysis.

The strategy is to:
1.  Formally verify the properties (indices, lengths, distances) for each training example using code execution.
2.  Confirm that the logic in the "Previous Code" correctly handles these properties.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for clarity, ensuring the concept of "distance" (as index difference) is precise.
4.  Conclude that the "Previous Code" block is likely the correct implementation, assuming the reported error was due to executing the incorrect initial code version.

task_type: 1D_array_manipulation
description: Move a colored block across a separator, preserving the distance.
components:
  - item: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: fills empty space
  - item: separator
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1
    role: stationary pivot point
    property: index (position in the array)
  - item: colored_block
    color: any color except 0 (white) and 9 (maroon)
    structure: single contiguous block of identical pixels
    count: 1
    role: mobile element
    properties:
      - color
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - length
      - side_relative_to_separator (left or right)
      - distance_from_separator (index difference to nearest edge)
actions:
  - action: identify_separator
    target: input_array
    output: separator_index
  - action: identify_block
    target: input_array
    output: block_color, block_start_index, block_end_index, block_length
  - action: determine_side
    inputs: block_end_index, separator_index
    output: side ('left' or 'right')
  - action: calculate_distance
    inputs: block_start_index, block_end_index, separator_index, side
    output: distance (absolute difference between separator_index and nearest block edge index)
  - action: calculate_new_position
    inputs: separator_index, distance, block_length, side
    output: new_block_start_index
  - action: construct_output
    inputs: input_array_size, separator_index, block_color, block_length, new_block_start_index
    process:
      - Create an array of input_array_size filled with background color (0).
      - Place the separator (9) at separator_index.
      - Place the colored_block (using block_color, block_length) starting at new_block_start_index.
    output: transformed_array
constraints:
  - Input is a 1D array.
  - Exactly one separator (9) exists.
  - Exactly one contiguous block of a single color (not 0 or 9) exists.
  - The block does not initially overlap the separator.
  - The separator's position remains unchanged in the output.
  - The block's color and length remain unchanged.
  - The distance (index difference) between the separator and the block's nearest edge is preserved on the opposite side.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output array of the same size as the input array, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Find the index (`separator_index`) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array.
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) into the output array at `separator_index`.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input array that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), start index (`block_start_index`), end index (`block_end_index`), and length (`block_length`).
5.  Determine if the block is to the left (`block_end_index < separator_index`) or right (`block_start_index > separator_index`) of the separator.
6.  Calculate the distance, defined as the absolute difference between the `separator_index` and the index of the block's edge closest to the separator.
    *   If the block is on the left, `distance = separator_index - block_end_index`.
    *   If the block is on the right, `distance = block_start_index - separator_index`.
7.  Calculate the starting index (`new_block_start_index`) for the block in the output array, placing it on the opposite side of the separator while maintaining the calculated `distance`.
    *   If the block was originally on the left, `new_block_start_index = separator_index + distance`.
    *   If the block was originally on the right, the new block's end index will be `separator_index - distance`, so `new_block_start_index = (separator_index - distance) - block_length + 1`.
8.  Place the identified block (using `block_color` and `block_length`) into the output array, starting at `new_block_start_index`. Ensure the placement respects array bounds (although examples suggest fits are guaranteed).
9.  Return the output array.
