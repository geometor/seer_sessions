*   **Perception:** The input is a 1D array of pixels (represented as integers). It contains a background of white pixels (0), a single maroon pixel (9) acting as a separator, and a contiguous block of pixels of another single color (blue, green, or red in the examples). The transformation involves moving the colored block from one side of the maroon separator to the other, filling the original location with white pixels. The maroon pixel remains in its original position.

## Example 1:

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous code failed because the logic for placing the colored block in the output array was incorrect. It assumed the block should be placed immediately adjacent (`+1` or `-block_length`) to the maroon separator. However, analyzing the examples reveals a different pattern: the distance between the maroon separator and the *nearest edge* of the colored block is calculated, and the block is placed on the opposite side maintaining this same distance to the separator. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" was likely a symptom of incorrect state or potentially an issue in how the test harness interacted with NumPy arrays, rather than a fundamental flaw in the initial parsing or basic type handling within the provided code snippet, assuming the input is correctly transformed into a list of integers before being passed to the function. The core issue was the misinterpretation of the spatial transformation rule.

The strategy is to:
1.  Accurately determine the properties (color, start index, length, end index) of the colored block.
2.  Determine the position of the maroon separator.
3.  Calculate the minimum distance (number of intervening white pixels + 1) between the separator and the block in the input.
4.  Construct the output array by placing the separator at its original position and placing the colored block on the opposite side of the separator, preserving the calculated minimum distance.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a new output array of the same size as the input array, filling it with white pixels (0).
2.  Find the index (`separator_position`) of the single maroon pixel (9) in the input array.
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) into the output array at `separator_position`.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input array that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its color (`block_color`), start index (`block_start_index`), and length (`block_size`).
5.  Calculate the end index of the block: `block_end_index = block_start_index + block_size - 1`.
6.  Determine if the block is to the left (`block_end_index < separator_position`) or right (`block_start_index > separator_position`) of the separator.
7.  Calculate the distance between the separator and the nearest edge of the block:
    *   If the block is to the left, `distance = separator_position - block_end_index`.
    *   If the block is to the right, `distance = block_start_index - separator_position`.
8.  Calculate the starting position (`new_start_index`) for the block in the output array:
    *   If the block was originally to the left, `new_start_index = separator_position + distance`.
    *   If the block was originally to the right, calculate the new end position `new_end_index = separator_position - distance`, and then `new_start_index = new_end_index - block_size + 1`.
9.  Fill the segment of the output array from `new_start_index` to `new_start_index + block_size - 1` with the `block_color`.
10. Return the output array.
