"""
Transforms a 1D input array based on the following rules:
1. Identifies a single maroon pixel (9) which acts as a stationary separator.
2. Identifies a contiguous block of a single color (neither white 0 nor maroon 9).
3. Calculates the distance (number of background pixels + 1) between the separator and the nearest edge of the colored block.
4. Creates an output array of the same size, initially filled with white (0).
5. Places the maroon separator (9) at its original position in the output array.
6. Places the colored block on the opposite side of the separator in the output array, maintaining the calculated distance from the separator to the block's new nearest edge.
