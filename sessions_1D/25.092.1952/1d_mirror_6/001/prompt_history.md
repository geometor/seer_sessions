Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature two distinct non-white elements:
    *   A single maroon (9) pixel.
    *   A horizontal line segment composed of pixels of another single color (red '2' or green '3' in the examples).
    *   The rest of the grid is white (0).
2.  **Object Identification:**
    *   **Anchor Object:** The single maroon pixel acts as a fixed reference point or an anchor. Its position seems crucial.
    *   **Payload Object:** The horizontal line segment is the object that undergoes transformation. Its color and length are preserved.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:**
    *   The anchor (maroon pixel) remains unchanged in position from input to output.
    *   The payload (horizontal line) changes its position significantly.
    *   **Vertical Movement:** The payload line moves from its original row (row 0 in all examples) to the row containing the anchor pixel (row 1 in all examples).
    *   **Horizontal Movement:** The payload line shifts horizontally to the right. The amount of this shift appears to be directly determined by the column index of the anchor pixel.
4.  **Rule Inference:** The transformation rule seems to involve using the anchor pixel's coordinates to determine the final position of the payload line. The anchor's row dictates the payload's final row, and the anchor's column dictates the magnitude of the payload's horizontal shift.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Reposition a horizontal line based on an anchor pixel.

Input_Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Color: Maroon (9)
    Identifier: Anchor
    Quantity: 1
  - Type: Line
    Orientation: Horizontal
    Color: Any (non-Maroon, non-White)
    Identifier: Payload
    Quantity: 1
  - Type: Background
    Color: White (0)

Anchor_Properties:
  - Position: (row, column) - denoted as (R_anchor, C_anchor)

Payload_Properties:
  - Color: C_payload (constant)
  - Length: L_payload (constant)
  - Input_Position:
      Row: R_payload_in
      Column_Start: C_payload_start_in
      Column_End: C_payload_end_in

Relationships:
  - The Anchor pixel is unique (only one maroon pixel).
  - The Payload line is unique (only one horizontal line of a specific non-maroon color).
  - In the input examples, R_payload_in is different from R_anchor.

Actions:
  - Identify the Anchor pixel and its position (R_anchor, C_anchor).
  - Identify the Payload line, its color (C_payload), length (L_payload), and its input starting column (C_payload_start_in).
  - The Anchor pixel's position in the output remains (R_anchor, C_anchor).
  - Calculate the Payload line's output starting column: C_payload_start_out = C_payload_start_in + C_anchor
  - The Payload line's output position is:
      Row: R_anchor
      Column_Start: C_payload_start_out
      Column_End: C_payload_start_out + L_payload - 1
  - Reconstruct the output grid with the Anchor and the repositioned Payload line on a white background.

Output_Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Identifier: Anchor
    Position: (R_anchor, C_anchor) # Unchanged from input
    Color: Maroon (9)
  - Type: Line
    Identifier: Payload
    Orientation: Horizontal
    Color: C_payload # Unchanged from input
    Length: L_payload # Unchanged from input
    Position:
      Row: R_anchor
      Column_Start: C_payload_start_out
      Column_End: C_payload_start_out + L_payload - 1
  - Type: Background
    Color: White (0)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, or as an empty grid of the same dimensions filled with white pixels.
2.  Find the single maroon pixel (the anchor) in the input grid and record its row (`R_anchor`) and column (`C_anchor`). Keep this pixel at (`R_anchor`, `C_anchor`) in the output grid.
3.  Find the contiguous horizontal line of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the payload) in the input grid. Record its color (`C_payload`), its starting column (`C_payload_start_in`), and its length (`L_payload`).
4.  Remove the payload line from its original position in the (initially copied or empty) output grid (if necessary, ensure these locations are white).
5.  Calculate the new starting column for the payload line in the output grid: `C_payload_start_out = C_payload_start_in + C_anchor`.
6.  Draw the payload line in the output grid using its original color (`C_payload`) and length (`L_payload`), starting at row `R_anchor` and column `C_payload_start_out`, extending `L_payload` pixels to the right.
