```python
"""
Transforms an input grid (represented as a single flat list, conceptually 1xN) 
into a 2xN output grid. It identifies a maroon (9) anchor pixel and a 
contiguous horizontal payload line (any other non-white color) in the input. 
The anchor and the payload are then placed into the second row (index 1) of 
the output grid. The anchor retains its original column index. The payload 
line's starting column in the output is determined by a relative distance rule: 
the distance from the anchor's column to the payload's end column in the input 
dictates the distance from the anchor's column to the payload's start column 
in the output (output_start = anchor + (anchor - input_end)). The first row 
(index 0) of the output grid remains white (0).
