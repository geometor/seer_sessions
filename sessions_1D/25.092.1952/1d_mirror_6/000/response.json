            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature two distinct non-white elements:\n    *   A single maroon (9) pixel.\n    *   A horizontal line segment composed of pixels of another single color (red '2' or green '3' in the examples).\n    *   The rest of the grid is white (0).\n2.  **Object Identification:**\n    *   **Anchor Object:** The single maroon pixel acts as a fixed reference point or an anchor. Its position seems crucial.\n    *   **Payload Object:** The horizontal line segment is the object that undergoes transformation. Its color and length are preserved.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The anchor (maroon pixel) remains unchanged in position from input to output.\n    *   The payload (horizontal line) changes its position significantly.\n    *   **Vertical Movement:** The payload line moves from its original row (row 0 in all examples) to the row containing the anchor pixel (row 1 in all examples).\n    *   **Horizontal Movement:** The payload line shifts horizontally to the right. The amount of this shift appears to be directly determined by the column index of the anchor pixel.\n4.  **Rule Inference:** The transformation rule seems to involve using the anchor pixel's coordinates to determine the final position of the payload line. The anchor's row dictates the payload's final row, and the anchor's column dictates the magnitude of the payload's horizontal shift.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
