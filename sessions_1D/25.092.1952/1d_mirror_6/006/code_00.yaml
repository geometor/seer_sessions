Task: Reposition a horizontal line relative to an anchor, transforming a 1xN grid to a 2xN grid.

Input_Grid:
  Format: Single list of integers representing a 1xN grid.
  Row_Index: 0 (Implicit)
  Width: N

Output_Grid:
  Format: List of two lists representing a 2xN grid.
  Height: 2
  Width: N
  Row_0: All background color (White, 0).
  Row_1: Contains transformed objects.

Input_Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Identifier: Anchor
    Color: Maroon (9)
    Location: Row 0, Column C_anchor
    Quantity: 1
  - Type: Line
    Identifier: Payload
    Orientation: Horizontal
    Color: Any (non-White '0', non-Maroon '9') - denoted C_payload
    Location: Row 0
    Start_Column: C_payload_start_in
    End_Column: C_payload_end_in
    Length: L_payload (constant)
    Quantity: 1
  - Type: Background
    Color: White (0)
    Location: All other cells in Row 0.

Relationships:
  - Anchor and Payload are distinct and unique within the input row.
  - Relative distance `dist = C_anchor - C_payload_end_in` is key for transformation.

Actions:
  - Read the input list and determine its length (N).
  - Create an output grid of size 2xN, initialized with White (0).
  - Locate the Anchor pixel in the input row to find its column `C_anchor`.
  - Locate the Payload line in the input row to find its color `C_payload`, start column `C_payload_start_in`, and length `L_payload`. Calculate its end column `C_payload_end_in = C_payload_start_in + L_payload - 1`.
  - Calculate the relative distance: `dist = C_anchor - C_payload_end_in`.
  - Calculate the Payload line's output starting column: `C_payload_start_out = C_anchor + dist`.
  - Place the Anchor pixel in the output grid at position (Row=1, Column=C_anchor).
  - Draw the Payload line in the output grid using `C_payload` and `L_payload`, starting at position (Row=1, Column=C_payload_start_out).

Output_Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Identifier: Anchor
    Color: Maroon (9)
    Location: (Row=1, Column=C_anchor)
  - Type: Line
    Identifier: Payload
    Orientation: Horizontal
    Color: C_payload
    Length: L_payload
    Location: Row=1
    Start_Column: C_payload_start_out
    End_Column: C_payload_start_out + L_payload - 1
  - Type: Background
    Color: White (0)
    Location: All cells in Row 0, and remaining cells in Row 1.
