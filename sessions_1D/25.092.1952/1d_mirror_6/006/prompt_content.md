```python
"""
Transforms an input grid (represented as a single row) into a 2-row output grid.
It finds an anchor pixel (maroon, 9) and a horizontal payload line (any other 
non-white color) in the input row. 
The transformation places both the anchor and the payload into the second row 
(index 1) of the output grid. The anchor maintains its original column index.
The payload line's horizontal starting position in the output is determined by 
a relative distance rule: the distance from the anchor's column to the payload's
*end* column in the input dictates the distance from the anchor's column to the 
payload's *start* column in the output. The first row (index 0) of the output 
grid is filled with the background color (white, 0).
