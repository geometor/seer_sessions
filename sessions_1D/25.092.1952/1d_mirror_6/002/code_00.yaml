Task: Reposition a horizontal line relative to an anchor pixel, adjusting both row and column.

Input_Grid_Interpretation:
  - The provided input list(s) may represent only the relevant object rows.
  - The output grid dimensions define the final canvas size.
  - Assume input objects (anchor, payload) are found within the first provided list/row.

Input_Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Identifier: Anchor
    Color: Maroon (9)
    Quantity: 1
    Source: Found within the first input list.
  - Type: Line
    Identifier: Payload
    Orientation: Horizontal
    Color: Any (non-Maroon, non-White)
    Quantity: 1
    Source: Found within the first input list.
  - Type: Background
    Color: White (0)

Anchor_Properties:
  - Input_Column: C_anchor (column index within the first input list)
  - Output_Position: (R_anchor, C_anchor) - Determined by finding the anchor in the *output* example grid. Note: R_anchor might be > 0 even if the anchor is in the first input list.

Payload_Properties:
  - Color: C_payload (constant)
  - Length: L_payload (constant)
  - Input_Position:
      Row: 0 (relative to input list interpretation)
      Column_Start: C_payload_start_in
      Column_End: C_payload_end_in = C_payload_start_in + L_payload - 1

Relationships_and_Calculations:
  - The anchor pixel's position in the final output grid (R_anchor, C_anchor) is constant (same as input relative to the full grid structure implied by output).
  - Calculate the horizontal distance between the anchor and the end of the payload line in the input: `Dist = C_anchor - C_payload_end_in`
  - The payload line's output row is the anchor's output row: `R_payload_out = R_anchor`
  - The payload line's output starting column is determined by placing it relative to the anchor using the calculated distance: `C_payload_start_out = C_anchor + Dist`
  - Substitute Dist: `C_payload_start_out = C_anchor + (C_anchor - C_payload_end_in)`
  - Simplified: `C_payload_start_out = 2 * C_anchor - C_payload_end_in`
  - Or: `C_payload_start_out = 2 * C_anchor - (C_payload_start_in + L_payload - 1)`

Output_Grid:
  - Dimensions: Same as the example output grids.
  - Content:
    - White background.
    - Anchor pixel at (R_anchor, C_anchor).
    - Payload line of color C_payload and length L_payload starting at (R_payload_out, C_payload_start_out).
