```python
"""
Transforms the input grid by repositioning a horizontal line based on the 
position of a single anchor pixel (maroon, 9).

1. Find the single maroon (9) pixel (the anchor) and record its row and 
   column (R_anchor, C_anchor).
2. Find the contiguous horizontal line of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) 
   pixels (the payload). Record its color (C_payload), starting column 
   (C_payload_start_in), and length (L_payload).
3. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled 
   with white (0).
4. Place the anchor pixel at its original position (R_anchor, C_anchor) in 
   the output grid.
5. Calculate the new starting column for the payload line: 
   C_payload_start_out = C_payload_start_in + C_anchor.
6. Draw the payload line in the output grid using its color (C_payload) and 
   length (L_payload), starting at row R_anchor and column C_payload_start_out.
