            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: an anchor pixel (maroon) and a payload line (other color). It also correctly deduced that the payload line moves to the anchor's row. However, the calculation for the horizontal shift (`C_payload_start_out = C_payload_start_in + C_anchor`) was incorrect, leading to the observed discrepancies (`Pixels Off`) in all training examples.\n\nThe errors indicate that the horizontal position of the output payload line is not simply the input starting column shifted by the anchor's column index. By comparing the input positions, anchor position, and expected output positions, a new relationship was identified: the horizontal distance from the *end* of the payload line to the anchor in the *input* grid is equal to the horizontal distance from the anchor to the *start* of the payload line in the *output* grid.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the properties (positions, lengths) of the anchor and payload in each input example using code execution.\n2.  Calculate the required horizontal shift based on the newly derived rule: `C_payload_start_out = C_anchor + (C_anchor - C_payload_end_in)`, where `C_payload_end_in = C_payload_start_in + L_payload - 1`.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this corrected transformation logic.\n\n**Metrics and Calculations**\n"

Initialize an output grid of size `H x W` with white (0) pixels.\n2.  Parse the *first* list provided in the input data to find the properties of the input objects:\n    *   Find the column index (`C_anchor_in`) of the single maroon (9) pixel (Anchor).\n    *   Find the horizontal line of non-white, non-maroon pixels (Payload). Record its color (`C_payload`), its starting column (`C_payload_start_in`), and its length (`L_payload`).\n3.  Determine the anchor's final row (`R_anchor`) and column (`C_anchor`) in the output grid (this might require inspecting the example outputs or assuming a consistent structure, e.g., if the anchor is always in row 1 of the output). Place the anchor pixel (color 9) at (`R_anchor`, `C_anchor`) in the output grid. *(Correction: Use the C_anchor found in the input for calculations, its final absolute position defines R_anchor and C_anchor)*.\n4.  Calculate the column index of the *last* pixel of the payload line in the input: `C_payload_end_in = C_payload_start_in + L_payload - 1`.\n5.  Calculate the horizontal distance between the anchor's input column and the end of the input payload line: `Dist = C_anchor - C_payload_end_in`.\n6.  Calculate the starting column for the payload line in the output grid: `C_payload_start_out = C_anchor + Dist`.\n7.  The row for the payload line in the output grid is the anchor's row: `R_payload_out = R_anchor`.\n8.  Draw the payload line in the output grid using its color (`C_payload`) and length (`L_payload`), starting at row `R_payload_out` and column `C_payload_start_out`, extending `L_payload` pixels to the right. Ensure drawing stays within the grid boundaries."
