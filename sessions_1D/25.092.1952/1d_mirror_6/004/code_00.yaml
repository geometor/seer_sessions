Task: Reposition a horizontal line relative to an anchor, placing both in the second row of a new 2-row grid.

Input_Grid:
  Structure: Single row (List containing one List of integers)
  Height: 1
  Width: N (variable, e.g., 32 in examples)
  Background_Color: White (0)

Input_Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Identifier: Anchor
    Color: Maroon (9)
    Quantity: 1
    Location: Found within the single input row.
    Properties:
      Column_Index: C_anchor
  - Type: Line
    Identifier: Payload
    Orientation: Horizontal
    Color: Any (non-Maroon, non-White, e.g., Red(2), Green(3))
    Quantity: 1
    Location: Found within the single input row.
    Properties:
      Color: C_payload (constant)
      Length: L_payload (constant)
      Start_Column_Index: C_payload_start_in
      End_Column_Index: C_payload_end_in = C_payload_start_in + L_payload - 1

Output_Grid:
  Structure: Two rows (List containing two Lists of integers)
  Height: 2
  Width: N (same as input width)
  Background_Color: White (0)
  Row_0_Content: All White (0)
  Row_1_Content: Contains the repositioned Anchor and Payload.

Relationships_And_Calculations:
  - Output grid width matches input grid width.
  - Output grid height is fixed at 2.
  - Anchor's output position is fixed at Row 1, Column C_anchor.
  - Payload's output position is fixed at Row 1.
  - Payload's output starting column (C_payload_start_out) depends on the relative horizontal distance between the Anchor and the Payload's *end* position in the input.
  - Calculation_Rule:
      1. Calculate distance: dist = C_anchor - C_payload_end_in
      2. Calculate output start column: C_payload_start_out = C_anchor + dist

Actions:
  - Identify the Anchor pixel in the input row and record its column (C_anchor).
  - Identify the Payload line in the input row, record its color (C_payload), start column (C_payload_start_in), and length (L_payload).
  - Calculate the Payload's end column in the input (C_payload_end_in).
  - Calculate the relative distance (dist).
  - Calculate the Payload's target start column in the output (C_payload_start_out).
  - Create an output grid of size 2xN, filled with White (0).
  - Place the Anchor pixel (Maroon 9) at position (row=1, column=C_anchor) in the output grid.
  - Draw the Payload line (using C_payload, L_payload) starting at position (row=1, column=C_payload_start_out) in the output grid.
