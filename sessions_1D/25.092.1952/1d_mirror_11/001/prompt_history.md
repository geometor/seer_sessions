Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples operate on single-row grids (1D arrays). The size seems consistent across inputs and outputs within each example pair.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each input grid features exactly two distinct non-white (0) elements:
    *   A single maroon pixel (9).
    *   A contiguous block (one or more pixels) of another single color (red, gray, or blue in the examples).
3.  **Background:** The rest of the grid is composed of white pixels (0).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the position of the colored block relative to the maroon pixel.
5.  **Invariance:**
    *   The position of the maroon pixel (9) remains unchanged.
    *   The color and size (length) of the colored block remain unchanged.
    *   The number of white pixels (0) separating the colored block and the maroon pixel remains unchanged.
6.  **Movement:** The colored block effectively "jumps" over the maroon pixel to the other side, maintaining the original separation distance (measured in white pixels). In all training examples, the block starts to the left of the maroon pixel and moves to its right.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
objects:
  - object_type: marker
    color: maroon
    value: 9
    quantity: 1
    shape: point # Single pixel
    properties:
      - static_position: true # Its position does not change between input and output
  - object_type: block
    color: variable # Red (2), Gray (5), Blue (1) in examples
    quantity: 1
    shape: contiguous_segment # A horizontal line segment
    properties:
      - variable_color: true # Color differs between examples but is consistent within an example pair
      - variable_length: true # Length differs between examples but is consistent within an example pair
      - dynamic_position: true # Its position changes between input and output
  - object_type: background
    color: white
    value: 0
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: true
relationships:
  - type: spatial_separation
    object1: marker (maroon pixel)
    object2: block (colored segment)
    property: distance_in_white_pixels # The number of white pixels between them
    constraint: constant # This distance is preserved during transformation
actions:
  - action_type: move
    target: block (colored segment)
    reference_point: marker (maroon pixel)
    rule: Relocate the block to the opposite side of the marker, preserving the separation distance (measured in white pixels).
transformation_rule:
  - Identify the maroon pixel (9) and its index.
  - Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon color, noting its color, length, and start/end indices.
  - Calculate the number of white pixels (0) between the block and the maroon pixel.
  - Create an output grid of the same size, initialized to white (0).
  - Place the maroon pixel (9) in the output grid at its original index.
  - If the block was originally to the left of the maroon pixel, place it in the output grid starting at `maroon_index + separation_pixels + 1`.
  - If the block was originally to the right of the maroon pixel, place it in the output grid ending at `maroon_index - separation_pixels - 1`.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid and note its index (position).
3.  Place the maroon pixel (9) into the output grid at the same index.
4.  Locate the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9) in the input grid. Note its color, its length, and its starting and ending indices.
5.  Determine the spatial relationship between the block and the maroon pixel in the input grid:
    *   Identify if the block is to the left or right of the maroon pixel.
    *   Count the number of white pixels (0) located strictly between the end of the block and the maroon pixel (if the block is left) or between the maroon pixel and the start of the block (if the block is right). Let this count be `separation`.
6.  Determine the new starting position for the block in the output grid:
    *   If the block was to the left of the maroon pixel in the input, the new starting index in the output is `maroon_index + separation + 1`.
    *   If the block was to the right of the maroon pixel in the input, the new starting index in the output is `maroon_index - separation - block_length`.
7.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated new starting position.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
