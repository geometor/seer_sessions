Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n2. Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid and note its index. Place this maroon pixel in the output grid at the same index.\n3. Locate the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Note its color, length, and start/end indices.\n4. Determine if the block is to the left or right of the maroon pixel in the input.\n5. Count the number of white pixels (0) strictly between the block and the maroon pixel.\n6. Calculate the new starting position for the block in the output grid:\n   - If the block was left of the maroon pixel: new_start = maroon_index + separation_count + 1\n   - If the block was right of the maroon pixel: new_start = maroon_index - separation_count - block_length\n7.
