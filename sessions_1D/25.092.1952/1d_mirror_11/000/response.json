The size seems consistent across inputs and outputs within each example pair.\n2.  **Key Elements:** Each input grid features exactly two distinct non-white (0) elements:\n    *   A single maroon pixel (9).\n    *   A contiguous block (one or more pixels) of another single color (red, gray, or blue in the examples).\n3.  **Background:** The rest of the grid is composed of white pixels (0).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the position of the colored block relative to the maroon pixel.\n5.  **Invariance:**\n    *   The position of the maroon pixel (9) remains unchanged.\n    *   The color and size (length) of the colored block remain unchanged.\n    *   The number of white pixels (0) separating the colored block and the maroon pixel remains unchanged.\n6.  **Movement:** The colored block effectively \"jumps\" over the maroon pixel to the other side, maintaining the original separation distance (measured in white pixels). In all training examples, the block starts to the left of the maroon pixel and moves to its right.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
