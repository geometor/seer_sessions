task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
objects:
  - object_type: marker
    color: maroon
    value: 9
    quantity: 1
    shape: point # Single pixel
    properties:
      - static_position: true # Its position does not change between input and output
  - object_type: block
    color: variable # Red (2), Gray (5), Blue (1) in examples
    quantity: 1
    shape: contiguous_segment # A horizontal line segment
    properties:
      - variable_color: true # Color differs between examples but is consistent within an example pair
      - variable_length: true # Length differs between examples but is consistent within an example pair
      - dynamic_position: true # Its position changes between input and output
  - object_type: background
    color: white
    value: 0
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: true
relationships:
  - type: spatial_separation
    object1: marker (maroon pixel)
    object2: block (colored segment)
    property: distance_in_white_pixels # The number of white pixels between them
    constraint: constant # This distance is preserved during transformation
actions:
  - action_type: move
    target: block (colored segment)
    reference_point: marker (maroon pixel)
    rule: Relocate the block to the opposite side of the marker, preserving the separation distance (measured in white pixels).
transformation_rule:
  - Identify the maroon pixel (9) and its index.
  - Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon color, noting its color, length, and start/end indices.
  - Calculate the number of white pixels (0) between the block and the maroon pixel.
  - Create an output grid of the same size, initialized to white (0).
  - Place the maroon pixel (9) in the output grid at its original index.
  - If the block was originally to the left of the maroon pixel, place it in the output grid starting at `maroon_index + separation_pixels + 1`.
  - If the block was originally to the right of the maroon pixel, place it in the output grid ending at `maroon_index - separation_pixels - 1`.
