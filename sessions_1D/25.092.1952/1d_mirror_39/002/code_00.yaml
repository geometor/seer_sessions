Grid:
  - Type: Input
    Properties:
      - Dimensions: HxW (e.g., 5x6 based on examples)
      - Contains:
          - Background: White pixels (0)
          - Anchor_Pixel: One pixel with color Maroon (9)
          - Movable_Shape: One contiguous object of a single color (C != 0 and C != 9)
  - Type: Output
    Properties:
      - Dimensions: Same as Input HxW
      - Contains:
          - Background: White pixels (0)
          - Anchor_Pixel: Same color (9) and position as in Input
          - Movable_Shape: Same color and internal structure as in Input, different position

Objects:
  - Name: Anchor_Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Maroon (9)
      - Count: 1
      - Role: Reference point for vertical positioning
      - Position_Change: None (Input position == Output position)
      - Location: (maroon_row, maroon_col)
  - Name: Movable_Shape
    Properties:
      - Color: (C != 0 and C != 9)
      - Count: 1 (contiguous block)
      - Structure: Set of relative pixel coordinates from the shape's top-left corner.
      - Initial_Location: All pixels (r, c) have r < maroon_row.
      - Transformation: Vertical translation downwards.
      - Structure_Change: None (Shape, color, and relative pixel positions preserved).
      - Final_Location: Relocated such that the topmost row of the shape in the input (shape_top_row) is mapped to row (maroon_row + 1) in the output. Horizontal position (column) of each pixel is preserved.

Relationships:
  - The Anchor_Pixel defines a horizontal boundary row (`maroon_row`).
  - The Movable_Shape exists entirely above this boundary in the input.
  - The transformation moves the Movable_Shape to exist entirely below this boundary, starting exactly one row below it.
  - The vertical shift amount is determined by the difference between the target start row (`maroon_row + 1`) and the original top row (`shape_top_row`).

Action:
  - Identify the Anchor_Pixel's row (`maroon_row`) and its exact coordinates (`maroon_row`, `maroon_col`).
  - Identify all pixels belonging to the Movable_Shape, their color (`shape_color`), and their original coordinates `(r, c)`.
  - Determine the topmost row of the Movable_Shape in the input (`shape_top_row`).
  - Create a new grid filled with White (0), with the same dimensions as the input.
  - Copy the Anchor_Pixel (Maroon 9) to its original position (`maroon_row`, `maroon_col`) in the new grid.
  - For each pixel `(r, c)` of the Movable_Shape in the input:
    - Calculate its row position relative to the top of the shape: `relative_r = r - shape_top_row`.
    - Calculate its new row position in the output grid: `new_r = (maroon_row + 1) + relative_r`.
    - Copy the pixel's `shape_color` to position `(new_r, c)` in the output grid.
