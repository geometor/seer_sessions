Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (0).\n2. Find the coordinates (`marker_row`, `marker_col`) of the single maroon pixel (9) (the marker) in the input grid.\n3. Place a maroon pixel (9) at the same coordinates (`marker_row`, `marker_col`) in the output grid.\n4. Identify the unique color (`shape_color`) present in the input grid that is neither white (0) nor maroon (9).\n5. Collect the set of all coordinates `(r, c)` in the input grid where the pixel value is equal to `shape_color`. These coordinates constitute the \"movable shape\".\n6. If no movable shape pixels are found (i.e., the set of coordinates is empty), return the output grid containing only the white background and the single maroon pixel.\n7. Determine the minimum row index (`shape_top_row`) among all coordinates collected in step 5.\n8. For each coordinate `(r, c)` belonging to the movable shape (from the set collected in step 5):\n    a. Calculate the pixel's vertical offset relative to the top of its shape: `relative_r = r - shape_top_row`.\n    b. Calculate the pixel's target row in the output grid: `new_r = (marker_row + 1) + relative_r`.\n    c. Check if the target coordinate (`new_r`, `c`) is within the output grid boundaries.\n    d. If it is within bounds, set the pixel at (`new_r`, `c`) in the output grid to `shape_color`.\n9.
