Grid:
  - Type: Input
    Properties:
      - Dimensions: Variable HxW (Observed: 5x6)
      - Contains:
          - Background: White pixels (0)
          - Marker_Pixel: Exactly one pixel with color Maroon (9)
          - Movable_Shape: One contiguous object composed of a single color C, where C is not White (0) and not Maroon (9).
          - Location_Constraint: The Movable_Shape is located entirely in rows above the Marker_Pixel's row.
  - Type: Output
    Properties:
      - Dimensions: Same as Input HxW
      - Contains:
          - Background: White pixels (0)
          - Marker_Pixel: Same pixel (color 9), same position as in Input
          - Movable_Shape: Same shape (color C, same internal structure) as in Input, but relocated.

Objects:
  - Name: Marker_Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Maroon (9)
      - Count: 1
      - Role: Static reference point for vertical positioning.
      - Position_Change: None.
  - Name: Movable_Shape
    Properties:
      - Color: A single color C, where C != 0 and C != 9.
      - Count: 1 (contiguous block)
      - Structure: Preserved during transformation.
      - Initial_Location: Rows strictly less than the Marker_Pixel's row.
      - Transformation: Vertical translation downwards.
      - Final_Location: Relocated such that the row corresponding to the shape's topmost row in the input is positioned at `Marker_Pixel.row + 1`. The horizontal position (column indices) of all shape pixels relative to each other is maintained.

Relationships:
  - The Marker_Pixel defines a horizontal reference line.
  - The transformation moves the Movable_Shape from above this line to below it.
  - The vertical distance of the move is determined by the initial top row of the shape and the row of the marker pixel.

Action:
  - Identify the Marker_Pixel's row (`marker_row`).
  - Identify all pixels belonging to the Movable_Shape and its color (`shape_color`).
  - Determine the topmost row of the Movable_Shape (`shape_top_row`).
  - Create a new grid filled with White (0).
  - Copy the Marker_Pixel to its original position (`marker_row`, `marker_col`) in the new grid.
  - For each pixel `(r, c)` of the Movable_Shape in the input grid:
    - Calculate its relative row within the shape: `relative_r = r - shape_top_row`.
    - Calculate its new row in the output grid: `new_r = (marker_row + 1) + relative_r`.
    - Copy the `shape_color` to position `(new_r, c)` in the output grid.
