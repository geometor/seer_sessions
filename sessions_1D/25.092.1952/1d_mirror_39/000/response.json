            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.    **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels represented by numbers 0-9. The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output (5x6 in all examples).\n2.    **Key Colors:**\n    *   White (0) acts as the background.\n    *   Maroon (9) appears as a single, isolated pixel in each input. Its position is crucial.\n    *   Another color (Green(3), Blue(1), or Orange(7) in the examples) forms a contiguous shape (object).\n3.    **Object Identification:**\n    *   There is always exactly one maroon pixel.\n    *   There is always exactly one connected shape made of a single color other than white or maroon.\n4.    **Spatial Relationship (Input):** The colored shape (non-maroon, non-white) is always located entirely in rows *above* the row containing the maroon pixel.\n5.    **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves moving the colored shape.\n    *   The maroon pixel remains fixed in its original position in the output grid.\n    *   The colored shape is moved vertically downwards.\n    *   The background of the output grid is white, except for the maroon pixel and the relocated colored shape.\n6.    **Movement Rule:** The colored shape is translated vertically such that its topmost row in the input grid is repositioned to start in the row immediately *below* the row containing the maroon pixel. The shape's internal structure and horizontal position are preserved during this translation.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
