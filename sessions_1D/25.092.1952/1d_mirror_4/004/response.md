**General Assessment:**

The core logic identified previously – reflecting a colored line segment across a stationary pivot pixel (maroon, 9) – appears correct and holds true for all training examples. The Python code generated based on this logic failed due to a type mismatch error (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`). This indicates the code was likely trying to use a NumPy array in a boolean context where a single `True` or `False` value was expected, probably during element comparison or conditional checks. The underlying transformation rule (reflection) seems sound, but the implementation needs to correctly handle the data types, potentially by explicitly converting the input NumPy arrays to Python lists or using NumPy-specific functions for comparisons. The strategy is to refine the code implementation details while keeping the core reflection logic intact.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's re-verify the indices and calculations for each example.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (len=31)
    *   Pivot (9): Index 16
    *   Segment (3): Index 5 to 13 (Length 9)
    *   Calculations:
        *   `pivot - start_in = 16 - 5 = 11`
        *   `pivot - end_in = 16 - 13 = 3`
        *   `new_start = pivot + (pivot - end_in) = 16 + 3 = 19`
        *   `new_end = pivot + (pivot - start_in) = 16 + 11 = 27`
    *   Output: Pivot at 16, Segment (3) from 19 to 27. Matches expected output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0]`.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (len=32)
    *   Pivot (9): Index 12
    *   Segment (5): Index 1 to 8 (Length 8)
    *   Calculations:
        *   `pivot - start_in = 12 - 1 = 11`
        *   `pivot - end_in = 12 - 8 = 4`
        *   `new_start = pivot + (pivot - end_in) = 12 + 4 = 16`
        *   `new_end = pivot + (pivot - start_in) = 12 + 11 = 23`
    *   Output: Pivot at 12, Segment (5) from 16 to 23. Matches expected output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (len=32)
    *   Pivot (9): Index 14
    *   Segment (2): Index 1 to 8 (Length 8)
    *   Calculations:
        *   `pivot - start_in = 14 - 1 = 13`
        *   `pivot - end_in = 14 - 8 = 6`
        *   `new_start = pivot + (pivot - end_in) = 14 + 6 = 20`
        *   `new_end = pivot + (pivot - start_in) = 14 + 13 = 27`
    *   Output: Pivot at 14, Segment (2) from 20 to 27. Matches expected output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0]`.

The reflection logic consistently explains the transformation across all examples.

  - name: find_segment_details
    input: input_grid
    output: color, start_index, end_index of the contiguous non-white, non-maroon line.

    inputs:

    logic: |
      The distance from the pivot to the start of the input segment becomes the distance from the pivot to the end of the output segment.
      The distance from the pivot to the end of the input segment becomes the distance from the pivot to the start of the output segment.
      Mathematically:
      dist_start_in = pivot_index - segment_start_index_in
      dist_end_in = pivot_index - segment_end_index_in
      new_segment_start_index = pivot_index + dist_end_in
      new_segment_end_index = pivot_index + dist_start_in
  - name: construct_output_grid
    inputs:
      - input_grid_size
      - pivot_index
      - pivot_color (9)
      - new_segment_start_index
      - new_segment_end_index
      - segment_color
    output: output_grid
    logic: |
      Create a new grid of the input size, filled with the background color (white, 0).
      Place the pivot pixel (9) at its original index.
      Fill the cells from the minimum of (new_segment_start_index, new_segment_end_index) to the maximum of (new_segment_start_index, new_segment_end_index) inclusive with the segment_color, taking care not to overwrite the pivot pixel if the range overlaps.

relationships:
  - The output position of the segment is a reflection of its input position across the pivot pixel's index. The segment "jumps" over the pivot, maintaining its distance symmetry relative to the pivot.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the size (length) of the input grid. Create a new output grid of the same size, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find the index of the unique pivot pixel (maroon, 9). Record this `pivot_index`. Place the pivot pixel (9) at the `pivot_index` in the output grid.
3.  Scan the input grid to find the contiguous sequence of identical pixels that are not the background color (0) or the pivot color (9). Record its color (`segment_color`), the starting index (`start_in`), and the ending index (`end_in`).
4.  Calculate the distance from the `pivot_index` to the start of the input segment: `dist_start = pivot_index - start_in`.
5.  Calculate the distance from the `pivot_index` to the end of the input segment: `dist_end = pivot_index - end_in`.
6.  Calculate the start index for the segment in the output grid: `start_out = pivot_index + dist_end`.
7.  Calculate the end index for the segment in the output grid: `end_out = pivot_index + dist_start`.
8.  Determine the range of indices for the output segment: find the minimum (`min_out`) and maximum (`max_out`) of `start_out` and `end_out`.
9.  Iterate from `min_out` to `max_out` (inclusive). For each index `i` in this range, if `i` is not equal to the `pivot_index`, set the pixel at index `i` in the output grid to `segment_color`.
10. Return the completed output grid.
