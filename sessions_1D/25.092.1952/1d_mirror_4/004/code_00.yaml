task_description: Reflect a contiguous colored line segment across a fixed maroon pivot pixel within a 1D grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a list or flat array)
  size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: Stationary reference point for reflection.
    properties:
      - location: Unchanged between input and output.
  - id: segment
    color: Any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    count: 1
    shape: Contiguous horizontal line (sequence of identical pixel values).
    role: The object being transformed.
    properties:
      - length: Preserved between input and output.
      - color: Preserved between input and output.
      - location: Changed via reflection across the pivot.

actions:
  - name: find_pivot_index
    input: input_grid
    output: index of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - name: find_segment_details
    input: input_grid
    output: color, start_index, end_index of the contiguous non-white, non-maroon line.
  - name: calculate_reflected_indices
    inputs:
      - pivot_index
      - segment_start_index_in
      - segment_end_index_in
    output: new_segment_start_index, new_segment_end_index
    logic: |
      The distance from the pivot to the start of the input segment becomes the distance from the pivot to the end of the output segment.
      The distance from the pivot to the end of the input segment becomes the distance from the pivot to the start of the output segment.
      Mathematically:
      dist_start_in = pivot_index - segment_start_index_in
      dist_end_in = pivot_index - segment_end_index_in
      new_segment_start_index = pivot_index + dist_end_in
      new_segment_end_index = pivot_index + dist_start_in
  - name: construct_output_grid
    inputs:
      - input_grid_size
      - pivot_index
      - pivot_color (9)
      - new_segment_start_index
      - new_segment_end_index
      - segment_color
    output: output_grid
    logic: |
      Create a new grid of the input size, filled with the background color (white, 0).
      Place the pivot pixel (9) at its original index.
      Fill the cells from the minimum of (new_segment_start_index, new_segment_end_index) to the maximum of (new_segment_start_index, new_segment_end_index) inclusive with the segment_color, taking care not to overwrite the pivot pixel if the range overlaps.

relationships:
  - The output position of the segment is a reflection of its input position across the pivot pixel's index. The segment "jumps" over the pivot, maintaining its distance symmetry relative to the pivot.
