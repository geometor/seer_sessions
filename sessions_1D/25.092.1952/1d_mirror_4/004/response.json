            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe core logic identified previously \u2013 reflecting a colored line segment across a stationary pivot pixel (maroon, 9) \u2013 appears correct and holds true for all training examples. The Python code generated based on this logic failed due to a type mismatch error (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`). This indicates the code was likely trying to use a NumPy array in a boolean context where a single `True` or `False` value was expected, probably during element comparison or conditional checks. The underlying transformation rule (reflection) seems sound, but the implementation needs to correctly handle the data types, potentially by explicitly converting the input NumPy arrays to Python lists or using NumPy-specific functions for comparisons. The strategy is to refine the code implementation details while keeping the core reflection logic intact.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's re-verify the indices and calculations for each example.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (len=31)\n    *   Pivot (9): Index 16\n    *   Segment (3): Index 5 to 13 (Length 9)\n    *   Calculations:\n        *   `pivot - start_in = 16 - 5 = 11`\n        *   `pivot - end_in = 16 - 13 = 3`\n        *   `new_start = pivot + (pivot - end_in) = 16 + 3 = 19`\n        *   `new_end = pivot + (pivot - start_in) = 16 + 11 = 27`\n    *   Output: Pivot at 16, Segment (3) from 19 to 27. Matches expected output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0]`.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (len=32)\n    *   Pivot (9): Index 12\n    *   Segment (5): Index 1 to 8 (Length 8)\n    *   Calculations:\n        *   `pivot - start_in = 12 - 1 = 11`\n        *   `pivot - end_in = 12 - 8 = 4`\n        *   `new_start = pivot + (pivot - end_in) = 12 + 4 = 16`\n        *   `new_end = pivot + (pivot - start_in) = 12 + 11 = 23`\n    *   Output: Pivot at 12, Segment (5) from 16 to 23.
