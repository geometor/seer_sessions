task_description: Reflect a colored line segment across a fixed maroon pivot pixel.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a flat array)
  size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.

objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Static background filler.
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: Acts as a fixed point, the center of reflection.
    location: Remains unchanged between input and output.
  - id: line_segment
    color: Any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    count: 1
    shape: Contiguous horizontal line.
    role: The object being transformed.
    properties:
      - length: Preserved between input and output.
      - color: Preserved between input and output.

actions:
  - name: identify_pivot
    input: input_grid
    output: index of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - name: identify_line_segment
    input: input_grid
    output: color, start_index, end_index of the contiguous non-white, non-maroon line.
  - name: reflect_segment
    inputs:
      - pivot_index
      - segment_start_index
      - segment_end_index
      - segment_color
      - segment_length
    output: new_segment_start_index, new_segment_end_index
    logic: The new start index is calculated such that its distance from the pivot equals the distance from the pivot to the old end index. The new end index is calculated similarly using the old start index. Specifically: new_start = pivot_index + (pivot_index - old_end_index); new_end = pivot_index + (pivot_index - old_start_index).
  - name: construct_output
    inputs:
      - input_grid_dimensions
      - pivot_index
      - pivot_color
      - new_segment_start_index
      - new_segment_end_index
      - segment_color
    output: output_grid
    logic: Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color. Place the pivot pixel at its original index. Place the reflected line segment at its new calculated start and end indices.

relationships:
  - The line segment's position in the output is determined by its position relative to the pivot pixel in the input, specifically through a reflection transformation centered on the pivot pixel.
