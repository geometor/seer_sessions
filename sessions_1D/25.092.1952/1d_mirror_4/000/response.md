Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional grids (represented as arrays). They seem to maintain the same dimensions across the transformation.
2.  **Key Colors/Pixels:**
    *   **White (0):** Acts as the background.
    *   **Maroon (9):** Appears as a single, stationary pixel in all examples. It seems to function as a pivot or reference point.
    *   **Other Colors (Green - 3, Gray - 5, Red - 2):** These form contiguous horizontal lines or segments. There is only one such line segment per example.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The primary action appears to be the relocation of the colored line segment (green, gray, or red). The position of the maroon pixel remains unchanged. The line segment seems to "jump" over the maroon pixel. Comparing the distances, it looks like the line segment is reflected across the maroon pixel. The distance from the start of the line to the maroon pixel in the input becomes the distance from the maroon pixel to the end of the line in the output, and vice versa. The length and color of the line segment remain the same.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect a colored line segment across a fixed maroon pivot pixel.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a flat array)
  size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.

objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Static background filler.
  - id: pivot
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    role: Acts as a fixed point, the center of reflection.
    location: Remains unchanged between input and output.
  - id: line_segment
    color: Any color except white (0) or maroon (9)
    count: 1
    shape: Contiguous horizontal line.
    role: The object being transformed.
    properties:
      - length: Preserved between input and output.
      - color: Preserved between input and output.

actions:
  - name: identify_pivot
    input: input_grid
    output: index of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - name: identify_line_segment
    input: input_grid
    output: color, start_index, end_index of the contiguous non-white, non-maroon line.
  - name: reflect_segment
    inputs:
      - pivot_index
      - segment_start_index
      - segment_end_index
      - segment_color
      - segment_length
    output: new_segment_start_index, new_segment_end_index
    logic: The new start index is calculated such that its distance from the pivot equals the distance from the pivot to the old end index. The new end index is calculated similarly using the old start index. Specifically: new_start = pivot_index + (pivot_index - old_end_index); new_end = pivot_index + (pivot_index - old_start_index).
  - name: construct_output
    inputs:
      - input_grid_dimensions
      - pivot_index
      - pivot_color
      - new_segment_start_index
      - new_segment_end_index
      - segment_color
    output: output_grid
    logic: Create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color. Place the pivot pixel at its original index. Place the reflected line segment at its new calculated start and end indices.

relationships:
  - The line segment's position in the output is determined by its position relative to the pivot pixel in the input, specifically through a reflection transformation centered on the pivot pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white).
2.  Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Record its index (`pivot_index`) and place it at the same index in the output grid.
3.  Locate the contiguous horizontal line segment of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9) in the input grid. Record its color (`segment_color`), start index (`start_in`), and end index (`end_in`).
4.  Calculate the distance from the pivot pixel to the start of the segment in the input: `dist_start = pivot_index - start_in`.
5.  Calculate the distance from the pivot pixel to the end of the segment in the input: `dist_end = pivot_index - end_in`. Note: `dist_end` will be smaller than `dist_start` if the segment is to the left of the pivot.
6.  Calculate the new start index for the segment in the output grid: `start_out = pivot_index + dist_end`.
7.  Calculate the new end index for the segment in the output grid: `end_out = pivot_index + dist_start`.
8.  Fill the cells in the output grid from `start_out` to `end_out` (inclusive) with the `segment_color`.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
