            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional grids (represented as arrays). They seem to maintain the same dimensions across the transformation.\n2.  **Key Colors/Pixels:**\n    *   **White (0):** Acts as the background.\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Appears as a single, stationary pixel in all examples. It seems to function as a pivot or reference point.\n    *   **Other Colors (Green - 3, Gray - 5, Red - 2):** These form contiguous horizontal lines or segments. There is only one such line segment per example.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The primary action appears to be the relocation of the colored line segment (green, gray, or red). The position of the maroon pixel remains unchanged. The line segment seems to \"jump\" over the maroon pixel. Comparing the distances, it looks like the line segment is reflected across the maroon pixel. The distance from the start of the line to the maroon pixel in the input becomes the distance from the maroon pixel to the end of the line in the output, and vice versa. The length and color of the line segment remain the same.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Locate the single maroon pixel (9) in the input grid. Record its index (`pivot_index`) and place it at the same index in the output grid.\n3.

Calculate the distance from the pivot pixel to the end of the segment in the input: `dist_end = pivot_index - end_in`. Note: `dist_end` will be smaller than `dist_start` if the segment is to the left of the pivot.\n6.
