            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` across all examples strongly indicates an issue with data types during comparison within the `transform` function or its helpers. Specifically, it suggests that a NumPy array (likely the input grid or a slice of it) was used in a boolean context (e.g., `if array == value:`), where a single boolean `True` or `False` is expected. This typically happens if the input grid, assumed by the ARC framework to often be a 2D NumPy array, is not correctly processed as a sequence of individual pixel values. The previous code attempted conversion using `list(input_grid)`, but for a 2D NumPy array, this creates a list of *rows* (each row being an array), not a flat list of pixels.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the input handling by explicitly flattening the input 2D NumPy array into a 1D list before applying the core transformation logic. The underlying 1D logic (identifying pivot, block, gap, and flipping the block's position relative to the pivot while maintaining the gap) appears sound, as confirmed by manually tracing the examples with flattened data.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nCode execution simulation using flattened data confirms the 1D transformation logic works correctly for all training examples.\n\n*   **Common Pattern:** In all three examples, the input grid (when flattened to 1D) contains:\n    *   A single pivot pixel (maroon, 9).\n    *   A contiguous block of another color (magenta 6, or gray 5).\n    *   A gap of exactly one white pixel (0) between the end of the block and the pivot pixel.\n    *   The block always appears *before* the pivot pixel in the 1D sequence.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The transformation consistently moves the block to the position immediately *after* the pivot pixel, preserving the one-pixel white gap between the pivot and the start of the block. The pivot's position, block's color, and block's length remain unchanged. All other positions are filled with white (0).\n\n*   **Example 1:** Pivot=5, Block=0-3(6), Gap=1. Output: Pivot=5, Block=7-10(6), Gap=1. Matches.\n*   **Example 2:** Pivot=7, Block=2-5(5), Gap=1. Output: Pivot=7, Block=9-12(5), Gap=1. Matches.\n*   **Example 3:** Pivot=6, Block=1-4(6), Gap=1. Output: Pivot=6, Block=8-11(6), Gap=1. Matches.\n\nThe initial code failed due to incorrect handling of the assumed 2D NumPy input, not flawed transformation logic for the 1D case.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find the index (`pivot_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel in this 1D list.\n4.  Find the contiguous block of pixels in the 1D list that have the same color, which is *not* white (0) and *not* maroon (9).

Count the number of white (0) pixels that are strictly between the block and the pivot. This is the `gap_size`. (If `block_end == pivot_index - 1` or `block_start == pivot_index + 1`, the `gap_size` is 0).\n7.  Create a new 1D list, `output_list`, of the same size as the flattened input, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.\n8.  Place the maroon (9) pixel into the `output_list` at the `pivot_index`.\n9.
