Identify a single 'pivot' pixel (maroon, 9) and a contiguous block of another 
non-white color. Determine the position of the block relative to the pivot 
(before or after) and the size of the gap (number of white pixels) between them. 
In the output, maintain the pivot's position, but place the block on the

Fill the rest of the grid with white pixels (0).
