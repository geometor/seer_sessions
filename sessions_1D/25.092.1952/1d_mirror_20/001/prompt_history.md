Okay, analyzing the provided training example:

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output appear to be 1D sequences of 16 pixels. Although potentially representable as a 4x4 grid, the transformation logic seems clearer in 1D.
2.  **Key Pixels:**
    *   A single maroon pixel (9) is present in both input and output.
    *   A contiguous block of magenta pixels (6) is present in both input and output.
    *   The remaining pixels are white (0).
3.  **Transformation Observation:**
    *   The maroon pixel (9) remains in the exact same position (index 5) in the output as in the input.
    *   The block of magenta pixels (6 6 6 6) changes its position relative to the maroon pixel.
    *   In the input, the magenta block is located *before* the maroon pixel (`6 6 6 6 0 9`). There is one white pixel (0) separating the block from the maroon pixel.
    *   In the output, the magenta block is located *after* the maroon pixel (`9 0 6 6 6 6`). There is still one white pixel (0) separating the maroon pixel from the block.
    *   It seems the maroon pixel acts as a pivot or separator. The contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels "flips" its position relative to the maroon pixel, while maintaining the same size gap (filled with white pixels) between itself and the maroon pixel. All other positions are filled with white pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move a colored block relative to a fixed pivot pixel.

elements:
  - element: pivot_pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    properties:
      - fixed_position: The index of the maroon pixel remains constant between input and output.
      - acts_as_separator: Divides the sequence conceptually.
  - element: colored_block
    color: any color except white (0) or maroon (9) (magenta (6) in the example)
    properties:
      - contiguous: Forms an unbroken sequence of identical pixels.
      - mobile: Its position changes from input to output.
      - preserves_shape: The block's length and color remain unchanged.
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: Occupies all positions not taken by the pivot or the block.
      - forms_gap: White pixels constitute the space between the pivot and the block.

relationships:
  - type: relative_position_swap
    element1: colored_block
    element2: pivot_pixel
    description: The colored block moves from one side (before/after) of the pivot pixel to the other side in the output.
  - type: constant_gap
    element1: colored_block
    element2: pivot_pixel
    description: The number of white pixels between the colored block and the pivot pixel remains the same in the output as in the input.

input_configuration:
  - pivot_pixel: index 5
  - colored_block: color 6, indices 0-3
  - gap: 1 white pixel at index 4 (between block end index 3 and pivot index 5)

output_configuration:
  - pivot_pixel: index 5 (unchanged)
  - colored_block: color 6, indices 7-10
  - gap: 1 white pixel at index 6 (between pivot index 5 and block start index 7)
  - background: white pixels fill remaining indices (0-4, 11-15)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single maroon pixel (9) in the input sequence and note its index (pivot index).
2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Note its color, start index, and end index.
3.  Calculate the gap size (number of white pixels) between the block and the maroon pixel in the input.
4.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
5.  Place the maroon pixel (9) into the new sequence at the same pivot index it had in the input.
6.  Determine if the block was before or after the maroon pixel in the input.
7.  Place the identified block (using its original color and length) into the new sequence on the *opposite* side of the maroon pixel compared to its input position, maintaining the calculated gap size (number of white pixels) between the block and the maroon pixel.
8.  The resulting sequence is the output.
