Ensure the input grid is treated as a standard Python list (1D sequence).\n2. Identify the index of the single maroon pixel (9), known as the `pivot_index`.\n3. Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its start index (`block_start`), end index (`block_end`), color (`block_color`), and calculate its length (`block_length`).\n4. Determine if the block is positioned *before* (`block_end < pivot_index`) or *after* (`block_start > pivot_index`) the pivot pixel in the input sequence.\n5. Calculate the `gap_size`, which is the number of white pixels (0) located strictly between the block and the pivot pixel in the input sequence.\n6. Create a new list of the same size as the input, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).\n7. Place the maroon pixel (9) into the new list at the original `pivot_index`.\n8. Calculate the new starting position (`new_block_start`) for the block in the output list:\n    *   If the block was *before* the pivot in the input, the `new_block_start` is `pivot_index + 1 + gap_size`.\n    *   If the block was *after* the pivot in the input, the `new_block_start` is `pivot_index - gap_size - block_length`.\n9. Place the block (with its original `block_color` and `block_length`) into the new list, starting at the calculated `new_block_start`.\n10. The resulting list is the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\n# Define constants for colors\nBACKGROUND_COLOR = 0\nPIVOT_COLOR = 9\n\ndef find_pivot(grid: List[int], pivot_color: int) -> Optional[int]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the first occurrence of the pivot color.\"\"\"\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        if pixel == pivot_color:\n            return i\n    return None # Pivot not found\n\ndef find_colored_block(grid: List[int], pivot_index: Optional[int], background_color: int, pivot_color: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the contiguous block of non-background, non-pivot color.\n    Returns (start_index, end_index, color) or None if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_start = -1\n    block_color = -1\n    n = len(grid)\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        # Check if the current pixel is background or pivot\n        is_bg_or_pivot = (pixel == background_color or pixel == pivot_color)\n\n        if block_start == -1: # We are looking for the start of a block\n            if not is_bg_or_pivot:\n                block_start = i\n                block_color = pixel\n        else: # We are inside a potential block, looking for its end\n            # Block ends if pixel is background, pivot, a different color, or end of grid\n            is_different_color = (pixel != block_color)\n            if is_bg_or_pivot or is_different_color:\n                # The block ended at the previous index\n                return block_start, i - 1, block_color\n\n    # If the loop finished and we were tracking a block, it means the block goes to the end\n    if block_start != -1:\n        return block_start, n - 1, block_color\n\n    return None # Block not found\n\ndef calculate_gap(grid: List[int], block_start: int, block_end: int, pivot_index: int, background_color: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of background pixels strictly between the block and the pivot.\"\"\"\n    gap = 0\n    if block_end < pivot_index: # Block is before pivot\n        # Count background pixels from block_end + 1 up to pivot_index - 1\n        start = block_end + 1\n        end = pivot_index\n        for i in range(start, end):\n             if grid[i] == background_color:\n                 gap += 1\n    elif block_start > pivot_index: # Block is after pivot\n        # Count background pixels from pivot_index + 1 up to block_start - 1\n        start = pivot_index + 1\n        end = block_start\n        for i in range(start, end):\n             if grid[i] == background_color:\n                 gap += 1\n    # If block is adjacent, start >= end, range is empty, gap remains 0.\n    return gap\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid (1D list).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
