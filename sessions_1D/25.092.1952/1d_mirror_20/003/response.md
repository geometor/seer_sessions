```python
"""
Transforms a 1D sequence by repositioning a colored block relative to a fixed pivot pixel.

1. Ensure the input grid is treated as a standard Python list (1D sequence).
2. Identify the index of the single maroon pixel (9), known as the `pivot_index`.
3. Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its start index (`block_start`), end index (`block_end`), color (`block_color`), and calculate its length (`block_length`).
4. Determine if the block is positioned *before* (`block_end < pivot_index`) or *after* (`block_start > pivot_index`) the pivot pixel in the input sequence.
5. Calculate the `gap_size`, which is the number of white pixels (0) located strictly between the block and the pivot pixel in the input sequence.
6. Create a new list of the same size as the input, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
7. Place the maroon pixel (9) into the new list at the original `pivot_index`.
8. Calculate the new starting position (`new_block_start`) for the block in the output list:
    *   If the block was *before* the pivot in the input, the `new_block_start` is `pivot_index + 1 + gap_size`.
    *   If the block was *after* the pivot in the input, the `new_block_start` is `pivot_index - gap_size - block_length`.
9. Place the block (with its original `block_color` and `block_length`) into the new list, starting at the calculated `new_block_start`.
10. The resulting list is the output.
