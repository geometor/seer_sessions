"""
Transforms a 2D grid by repositioning a contiguous colored block relative to a
fixed pivot pixel (maroon, 9) based on a flattened 1D representation.

The transformation involves these steps:
1. Flatten the input 2D grid into a 1D sequence.
2. Identify the index of the single pivot pixel (maroon, 9) in the 1D sequence.
3. Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record its color, start/end indices, and length in the 1D sequence.
4. Determine if the block is before or after the pivot in the 1D sequence.
5. Calculate the gap size (number of white pixels) strictly between the block and the pivot in the 1D sequence.
6. Create a new 1D sequence of the same size, filled with the background color (white, 0).
7. Place the pivot pixel at its original index in the new sequence.
8. Calculate the new starting index for the block in the new sequence by placing it on the opposite side of the pivot, separated by the same gap size.
9. Place the colored block into the new sequence at its calculated position.
10. Reshape the resulting 1D sequence back into the original 2D grid dimensions.
