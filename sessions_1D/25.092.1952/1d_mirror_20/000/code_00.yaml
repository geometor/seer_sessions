task_description: Move a colored block relative to a fixed pivot pixel.

elements:
  - element: pivot_pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    properties:
      - fixed_position: The index of the maroon pixel remains constant between input and output.
      - acts_as_separator: Divides the sequence conceptually.
  - element: colored_block
    color: any color except white (0) or maroon (9) (magenta (6) in the example)
    properties:
      - contiguous: Forms an unbroken sequence of identical pixels.
      - mobile: Its position changes from input to output.
      - preserves_shape: The block's length and color remain unchanged.
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - fills_remaining_space: Occupies all positions not taken by the pivot or the block.
      - forms_gap: White pixels constitute the space between the pivot and the block.

relationships:
  - type: relative_position_swap
    element1: colored_block
    element2: pivot_pixel
    description: The colored block moves from one side (before/after) of the pivot pixel to the other side in the output.
  - type: constant_gap
    element1: colored_block
    element2: pivot_pixel
    description: The number of white pixels between the colored block and the pivot pixel remains the same in the output as in the input.

input_configuration:
  - pivot_pixel: index 5
  - colored_block: color 6, indices 0-3
  - gap: 1 white pixel at index 4 (between block end index 3 and pivot index 5)

output_configuration:
  - pivot_pixel: index 5 (unchanged)
  - colored_block: color 6, indices 7-10
  - gap: 1 white pixel at index 6 (between pivot index 5 and block start index 7)
  - background: white pixels fill remaining indices (0-4, 11-15)
