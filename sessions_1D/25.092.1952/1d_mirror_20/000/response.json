            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided training example:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output appear to be 1D sequences of 16 pixels. Although potentially representable as a 4x4 grid, the transformation logic seems clearer in 1D.\n2.  **Key Pixels:**\n    *   A single maroon pixel (9) is present in both input and output.\n    *   A contiguous block of magenta pixels (6) is present in both input and output.\n    *   The remaining pixels are white (0).\n3.  **Transformation Observation:**\n    *   The maroon pixel (9) remains in the exact same position (index 5) in the output as in the input.\n    *   The block of magenta pixels (6 6 6 6) changes its position relative to the maroon pixel.\n    *   In the input, the magenta block is located *before* the maroon pixel (`6 6 6 6 0 9`). There is one white pixel (0) separating the block from the maroon pixel.\n    *   In the output, the magenta block is located *after* the maroon pixel (`9 0 6 6 6 6`). There is still one white pixel (0) separating the maroon pixel from the block.\n    *   It seems the maroon pixel acts as a pivot or separator. The contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels \"flips\" its position relative to the maroon pixel, while maintaining the same size gap (filled with white pixels) between itself and the maroon pixel. All other positions are filled with white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
