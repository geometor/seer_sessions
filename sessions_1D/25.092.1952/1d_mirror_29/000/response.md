Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both single rows (1D grids).
*   Each grid contains mostly white pixels (0).
*   There is a single, stationary maroon pixel (9) in each example.
*   There is a single contiguous block of a non-white, non-maroon color (blue (1) or orange (7)).
*   In the output, the colored block has moved its position relative to the maroon pixel.
*   The size and color of the block remain unchanged.
*   The maroon pixel acts as a point of symmetry or reflection. The distance of the block from the maroon pixel is reversed in the output. Specifically, the distance from the start of the block to the maroon pixel in the input becomes the distance from the maroon pixel to the *end* of the block in the output, and vice versa.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
  key_elements:
    - type: stationary_pivot
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
    - type: movable_object
      shape: contiguous_block
      color: non-white (0), non-maroon (9) # Examples use blue (1), orange (7)
      count: 1
      properties:
        - size: constant
        - color: constant
transformation:
  type: reflection
  pivot: maroon (9) pixel
  object_to_transform: the contiguous non-white/non-maroon block
  details:
    - The maroon pixel's position remains unchanged.
    - The colored block is moved to the other side of the maroon pixel.
    - The new position mirrors the original position relative to the maroon pixel. If the block started `d_start` pixels before the pivot and ended `d_end` pixels before the pivot, its new position will start `d_end` pixels after the pivot and end `d_start` pixels after the pivot.
    - The original location of the colored block becomes white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, replacing all pixels except the maroon (9) pixel with white (0).
2.  Identify the location (index) of the single maroon (9) pixel in the input grid. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9).
4.  Determine the color (`block_color`), starting index (`start_index`), and ending index (`end_index`) of this block.
5.  Calculate the distance from the start of the block to the pivot: `dist_start = pivot_index - start_index`.
6.  Calculate the distance from the end of the block to the pivot: `dist_end = pivot_index - end_index`.
7.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output grid: `new_start_index = pivot_index + dist_end`.
8.  Calculate the new ending index for the block in the output grid: `new_end_index = pivot_index + dist_start`.
9.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from `new_start_index` to `new_end_index` (inclusive) with the `block_color`.
