task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
  key_elements:
    - type: stationary_pivot
      color: maroon (9)
      count: 1
    - type: movable_object
      shape: contiguous_block
      color: non-white (0), non-maroon (9) # Examples use blue (1), orange (7)
      count: 1
      properties:
        - size: constant
        - color: constant
transformation:
  type: reflection
  pivot: maroon (9) pixel
  object_to_transform: the contiguous non-white/non-maroon block
  details:
    - The maroon pixel's position remains unchanged.
    - The colored block is moved to the other side of the maroon pixel.
    - The new position mirrors the original position relative to the maroon pixel. If the block started `d_start` pixels before the pivot and ended `d_end` pixels before the pivot, its new position will start `d_end` pixels after the pivot and end `d_start` pixels after the pivot.
    - The original location of the colored block becomes white (0).
