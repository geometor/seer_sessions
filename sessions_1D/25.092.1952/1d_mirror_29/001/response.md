    Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
    1. Identify a stationary maroon (9) pixel which acts as a pivot.
    2. Identify a contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or maroon 9).
    3. Reflect the position of this block across the maroon pivot pixel.
    4. The distance from the start of the block to the pivot in the input becomes the distance from the pivot to the end of the block in the output.
    5. The distance from the end of the block to the pivot in the input becomes the distance from the pivot to the start of the block in the output.
    6. The original position of the block becomes white (0).
    7. All other white pixels remain white. The maroon pixel remains in place.
