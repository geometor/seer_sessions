*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output grids are single rows.
    *   Each input row contains a contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels flanked by white (zero) pixels.
    *   Within the non-white segment, there is predominantly one color, but one or more pixels might have different non-white colors.
    *   In the output, these "different" pixels within the segment are changed to match the predominant color of that segment.
    *   The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
    *   The predominant color appears to be the most frequent non-white color within the segment.

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: row_transformation
    elements:
      - type: segment
        description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels within the row.
        properties:
          - surrounded_by_white_pixels
          - contains_multiple_colors (potentially)
      - type: pixel
        description: Individual cells within the grid/row.
        properties:
          - color_value (0-9)
    relationships:
      - type: containment
        description: Pixels belong to segments.
      - type: frequency
        description: Within each segment, one non-white color appears more frequently than others.
    actions:
      - identify_segments: Locate the contiguous non-white segments.
      - determine_dominant_color: For each segment, find the most frequent non-white color.
      - replace_pixels: Within each segment, change all pixels that are not the dominant color to the dominant color.
      - maintain_structure: Keep the positions of segments and surrounding white pixels the same.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input row.
    2.  Count the occurrences of each non-white color within this segment.
    3.  Determine the color that occurs most frequently (the "dominant color").
    4.  Create the output row by replacing all pixels *within the identified segment* with the dominant color.
    5.  Keep all white (zero) pixels outside the segment in their original positions.
