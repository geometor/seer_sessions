task_description: Replace minority non-white colors within contiguous non-white segments with the segment's majority color.

definitions:
  - object: Sequence
    description: A 1D array of color values (pixels).
  - object: Segment
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence containing only non-white (non-zero) pixels, bounded by white (zero) pixels or the sequence ends.
  - object: Pixel
    description: An individual element in the sequence representing a color.
    properties:
      - color_value: Integer from 0-9.
      - index: Position within the sequence.
  - object: BorderPixel
    description: A pixel with color value 0 (white). Acts as a delimiter.
  - object: ContentPixel
    description: A pixel with a non-zero color value. Part of a Segment.
  - object: DominantColor
    description: The most frequent color value among ContentPixels within a specific Segment.
  - object: IntruderPixel
    description: A ContentPixel within a Segment whose color is not the DominantColor of that Segment.

actions:
  - action: IdentifySegments
    description: Scan the input Sequence to find all contiguous Segments of ContentPixels.
  - action: DetermineDominantColor
    description: For each Segment, count the frequency of each color value and identify the one with the highest count as the DominantColor.
  - action: ReplaceIntruders
    description: Iterate through each Segment. Change the color_value of every IntruderPixel to the Segment's DominantColor.

relationships:
  - relationship: Delimitation
    subject: BorderPixel
    verb: delimits
    object: Segment
  - relationship: Composition
    subject: Segment
    verb: is composed of
    object: ContentPixel
  - relationship: Modification
    subject: IntruderPixel
    verb: is replaced by
    object: DominantColor

input_output_relationship:
  - description: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by applying the ReplaceIntruders action to all identified Segments, leaving BorderPixels unchanged.
