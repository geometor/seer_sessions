            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Data Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional sequences (arrays) of integers representing colors. Although ARC tasks often use 2D grids, the examples here are presented linearly, and a consistent transformation rule works when treating them as 1D sequences. Example lengths differ slightly (32 for 1 & 2, 31 for 3), which is unusual but doesn't break the observed pattern.\n2.  **Color Roles:**\n    *   White (0) seems to act as a border or background color, delimiting segments of other colors. It remains unchanged in all examples.\n    *   Within the non-white segments, there's usually one color that appears most frequently (e.g., blue (1) in train_1, maroon (9) in train_2, red (2) in train_3).\n    *   Other non-white colors appear sparsely within these segments (yellow (4), azure (8), magenta (6) in train_1; gray (5) in train_2; orange (7), gray (5) in train_3).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens within the non-white segments. The sparse, non-dominant colors (\"intruders\") are replaced by the segment's dominant color. The dominant color itself and the white borders are preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
