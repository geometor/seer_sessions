"""
Transforms an input grid (typically a 1D sequence represented as a 1xN or Nx1 NumPy array, or a 1D list) 
by identifying contiguous segments of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Within each segment, it finds the 
most frequent color (dominant color). If there's a tie for the most frequent color, the numerically 
smallest color value is chosen as dominant. All other non-white pixels within that segment are then 
replaced with the dominant color. White (zero) pixels remain unchanged. The output format mirrors 
the input format where possible (e.g., if input is 1xN array, output is 1xN array).
