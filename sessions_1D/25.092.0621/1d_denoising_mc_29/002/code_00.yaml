task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D (represented as a list or 1xN grid)
input_characteristics:
  - type: 1D array (list) of integers (colors 0-9)
  - contains a contiguous span encompassing all non-white pixels (colors 1-9)
  - this span is identified by the minimum and maximum indices of non-white pixels
  - the span may contain pixels of multiple different non-white colors
  - the span may be surrounded by white (0) pixels
output_characteristics:
  - type: 1D array (list) of integers (colors 0-9)
  - same length as the input array
  - pixels outside the identified non-white span are preserved
  - pixels inside the identified non-white span are modified
transformation_rule:
  - identify the span containing all non-white pixels (from the index of the first non-white pixel to the index of the last non-white pixel)
  - within this span, determine the most frequent non-white color (mode)
  - replace all pixels within this span in the output array with the determined mode color
  - preserve all pixels outside this span from the input array
objects:
  - type: pixel_array
    properties:
      - elements: color values (0-9)
      - length: number of elements
  - type: non_white_span
    properties:
      - start_index: index of the first non-white pixel
      - end_index: index of the last non-white pixel
      - contained_pixels: list of pixel values within the span [start_index, end_index]
      - dominant_color: the most frequent non-white color within the span
actions:
  - find_span: locate the start and end indices of the non_white_span
  - extract_slice: get the sub-array corresponding to the non_white_span
  - calculate_mode: determine the most frequent non-white color in the extracted_slice
  - create_copy: duplicate the input array
  - replace_span: modify the copied array by setting all elements within the non_white_span to the dominant_color
relationships:
  - input_output_mapping: the output array is derived from the input array by homogenizing the color of the identified non_white_span based on its most frequent non-white color, while preserving pixels outside the span.
