task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
input_characteristics:
  - type: 1D array (list) of integers (colors 0-9)
  - may contain white (0) pixels, typically at the ends
  - contains one or more non-white (1-9) pixels
output_characteristics:
  - type: 1D array (list) of integers (colors 0-9)
  - same length as the input array
  - pixels outside the 'non-white span' are identical to the input
  - pixels inside the 'non-white span' are all set to the dominant color
objects:
  - type: pixel_array
    properties:
      - elements: list of integers (colors)
      - length: number of elements
  - type: non_white_span
    properties:
      - start_index: index of the first non-white pixel in the array
      - end_index: index of the last non-white pixel in the array
      - content: sub-array from start_index to end_index (inclusive)
      - dominant_color: the most frequent non-white color within the content
actions:
  - find_span: locate the start and end indices of the non_white_span
  - extract_slice: get the sub-array corresponding to the non_white_span
  - count_frequency: count occurrences of each non-white color within the extracted slice
  - determine_mode: identify the most frequent non-white color (dominant_color)
  - replace_span: create a copy of the input array and replace all pixels from start_index to end_index with the dominant_color
relationships:
  - span_definition: The span is defined by the minimum and maximum indices of non-white pixels.
  - color_homogenization: All pixels *within* the identified span in the output array adopt the dominant_color calculated from the non-white pixels of the input span.
  - boundary_preservation: Pixels *outside* the identified span (before start_index and after end_index) retain their original color from the input array.
edge_cases:
  - all_white_input: If the input contains no non-white pixels, the output is identical to the input.
  - single_non_white_pixel: The span contains one pixel, which is trivially the dominant color. The output is identical to the input.
