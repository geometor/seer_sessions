task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
input_characteristics:
  - type: 1D array of integers (colors)
  - often contains leading/trailing white (0) pixels
  - contains a central segment (span) defined by the indices of the first and last non-white (1-9) pixels
  - this span may contain pixels of multiple different non-white colors, and potentially some white (0) pixels as well
output_characteristics:
  - type: 1D array of integers (colors)
  - same length as the input array
  - pixels outside the identified non-white span are identical to the input array
  - pixels inside the identified non-white span are modified
transformation_rule:
  - find the index of the first non-white pixel (start_index) and the last non-white pixel (end_index) in the input array
  - define the 'span' as the segment of the array from start_index to end_index (inclusive)
  - analyze only the non-white pixels within this span to find the most frequent non-white color (dominant_color)
  - create the output array by copying the input array
  - replace all pixels in the output array from start_index to end_index (inclusive) with the dominant_color
  - if no non-white pixels exist in the input, the output is identical to the input
objects:
  - type: pixel_array
    properties:
      - values: integers 0-9 representing colors
      - length: number of pixels
  - type: non_white_span
    properties:
      - start_index: index of the first non-white pixel
      - end_index: index of the last non-white pixel
      - contents: the sub-array defined by start_index and end_index
      - dominant_color: the most frequent non-white color within the contents
  - type: padding_pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: outside the non_white_span (before start_index or after end_index)
actions:
  - find_span: locate start_index and end_index of non-white pixels
  - extract_slice: get the sub-array corresponding to the span
  - filter_non_white: isolate non-white pixels within the slice
  - count_frequency: count occurrences of each non-white color
  - find_mode: identify the most frequent non-white color (dominant_color)
  - copy_array: duplicate the input array to create the initial output array
  - replace_span: overwrite the segment from start_index to end_index in the output array with the dominant_color
  - preserve_padding: ensure pixels outside the span remain unchanged during the transformation
relationships:
  - span_definition: The span is determined by the minimum and maximum indices of non-white pixels.
  - output_composition: The output array is composed of the original padding pixels and a homogenized span.
