Each example shows an input array containing a central sequence of non-white pixels, potentially interspersed with other non-white \"intruder\" pixels, and often flanked by white (0) pixels. The output array modifies the central sequence by replacing the intruder pixels with the most frequent non-white color within that sequence, effectively making the sequence monochromatic in that dominant color. The flanking white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Find the starting index and ending index of the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (values 1 through 9). If no non-white pixels exist, return the input array unchanged.\n3.  Extract the sub-array corresponding to this non-white sequence.\n4.  Count the occurrences of each color (1 through 9) within this sub-array.\n5.  Determine the color that appears most frequently (the mode). This is the dominant color. If there's a tie for the most frequent color, the examples don't explicitly cover this, but a reasonable assumption might be to pick the one that appears first or has the lowest numerical value, though the provided examples suggest ties might not occur or the dominant color is clear. For now, assume a unique mode exists based on the examples.\n6.  Create a new array identical to the input array.\n7.  Iterate through the indices corresponding to the non-white sequence (from the start index to the end index found in step 2). For each position within this range in the new array, set the pixel value to the dominant color found in step 5.\n8.  Return the modified array."
