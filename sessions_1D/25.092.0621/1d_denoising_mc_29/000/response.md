**Perception:**

The task involves processing 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of colored pixels. Each example shows an input array containing a central sequence of non-white pixels, potentially interspersed with other non-white "intruder" pixels, and often flanked by white (0) pixels. The output array modifies the central sequence by replacing the intruder pixels with the most frequent non-white color within that sequence, effectively making the sequence monochromatic in that dominant color. The flanking white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
input_characteristics:
  - type: 1D array of integers (colors)
  - contains a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (colors 1-9)
  - this sequence may contain pixels of multiple different non-white colors
  - the non-white sequence may be surrounded by white (0) pixels
output_characteristics:
  - type: 1D array of integers (colors)
  - same length as the input array
  - the central non-white sequence is modified
  - surrounding white pixels are preserved
transformation_rule:
  - identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input array
  - determine the most frequent color (mode) within this non-white block
  - replace all pixels within this block that are *not* the mode color with the mode color
  - pixels outside this block (i.e., the surrounding white pixels) remain unchanged
objects:
  - type: pixel_sequence
    properties:
      - color: represents the value (0-9)
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: defined by non-white (1-9) pixels
      - dominant_color: the most frequent color within the block
      - intruder_pixels: pixels within the block whose color is not the dominant color
actions:
  - find: locate the start and end indices of the contiguous non-white block
  - count: determine the frequency of each non-white color within the block
  - identify: select the most frequent (mode) color as the dominant color
  - replace: change the color of intruder pixels to the dominant color
relationships:
  - input_output_mapping: the output array is derived from the input array by homogenizing the color of the central non-white block based on its most frequent color.
  - boundary_preservation: white pixels outside the central block are preserved in their original positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input 1D array.
2.  Find the starting index and ending index of the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (values 1 through 9). If no non-white pixels exist, return the input array unchanged.
3.  Extract the sub-array corresponding to this non-white sequence.
4.  Count the occurrences of each color (1 through 9) within this sub-array.
5.  Determine the color that appears most frequently (the mode). This is the dominant color. If there's a tie for the most frequent color, the examples don't explicitly cover this, but a reasonable assumption might be to pick the one that appears first or has the lowest numerical value, though the provided examples suggest ties might not occur or the dominant color is clear. For now, assume a unique mode exists based on the examples.
6.  Create a new array identical to the input array.
7.  Iterate through the indices corresponding to the non-white sequence (from the start index to the end index found in step 2). For each position within this range in the new array, set the pixel value to the dominant color found in step 5.
8.  Return the modified array.
