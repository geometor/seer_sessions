task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
input_characteristics:
  - type: 1D array of integers (colors)
  - contains a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (colors 1-9)
  - this sequence may contain pixels of multiple different non-white colors
  - the non-white sequence may be surrounded by white (0) pixels
output_characteristics:
  - type: 1D array of integers (colors)
  - same length as the input array
  - the central non-white sequence is modified
  - surrounding white pixels are preserved
transformation_rule:
  - identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input array
  - determine the most frequent color (mode) within this non-white block
  - replace all pixels within this block that are *not* the mode color with the mode color
  - pixels outside this block (i.e., the surrounding white pixels) remain unchanged
objects:
  - type: pixel_sequence
    properties:
      - color: represents the value (0-9)
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: defined by non-white (1-9) pixels
      - dominant_color: the most frequent color within the block
      - intruder_pixels: pixels within the block whose color is not the dominant color
actions:
  - find: locate the start and end indices of the contiguous non-white block
  - count: determine the frequency of each non-white color within the block
  - identify: select the most frequent (mode) color as the dominant color
  - replace: change the color of intruder pixels to the dominant color
relationships:
  - input_output_mapping: the output array is derived from the input array by homogenizing the color of the central non-white block based on its most frequent color.
  - boundary_preservation: white pixels outside the central block are preserved in their original positions.
