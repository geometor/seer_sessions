task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    location: typically surrounds a central block, but can be just on one side.
  - type: object_block
    description: A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the input row.
    properties:
      - contains_multiple_colors: boolean (can be true or false)
      - location: defined by the start and end indices of the non-white sequence.
transformation:
  - action: identify_block
    input: input_row
    output: start_index, end_index of the non-white block
  - action: analyze_block_colors
    input: pixels within the identified block
    processing: count the frequency of each non-white color
    output: most_frequent_color
  - action: reconstruct_output
    input: input_row, block_indices, most_frequent_color
    processing: create a new row identical to the input, then replace pixels from start_index to end_index with the most_frequent_color
    output: output_row
relationship:
  - The output row preserves the background pixels (white) from the input.
  - The segment of the output row corresponding to the input's non-white block is filled entirely with the single color that was most frequent within that input block.
constraints:
  - Operates on 1D arrays (single rows).
  - Assumes a single contiguous block of non-white pixels to modify.
