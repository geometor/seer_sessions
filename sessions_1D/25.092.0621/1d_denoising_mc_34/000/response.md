**Perception of Task Elements**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). The input rows typically consist of a central contiguous block of non-white pixels, potentially containing multiple different colors, surrounded by white (0) pixels on either side or just on one side (as seen in example 2). The transformation identifies the single contiguous block of non-white pixels. Within this block, it determines which non-white color appears most frequently. The output row is generated by replacing all pixels within that original block's position with this single most frequent color. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    location: typically surrounds a central block, but can be just on one side.
  - type: object_block
    description: A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the input row.
    properties:
      - contains_multiple_colors: boolean (can be true or false)
      - location: defined by the start and end indices of the non-white sequence.
transformation:
  - action: identify_block
    input: input_row
    output: start_index, end_index of the non-white block
  - action: analyze_block_colors
    input: pixels within the identified block
    processing: count the frequency of each non-white color
    output: most_frequent_color
  - action: reconstruct_output
    input: input_row, block_indices, most_frequent_color
    processing: create a new row identical to the input, then replace pixels from start_index to end_index with the most_frequent_color
    output: output_row
relationship:
  - The output row preserves the background pixels (white) from the input.
  - The segment of the output row corresponding to the input's non-white block is filled entirely with the single color that was most frequent within that input block.
constraints:
  - Operates on 1D arrays (single rows).
  - Assumes a single contiguous block of non-white pixels to modify.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input row (a 1D array of pixel values).
2.  Identify the start and end indices of the single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the input row.
3.  Extract the pixel values within this identified block.
4.  Count the occurrences (frequency) of each distinct non-white color within the extracted block.
5.  Determine the color with the highest frequency. If there's a tie, the examples don't explicitly cover this, but implicitly suggest any of the tied most frequent colors could be chosen (though the examples provided have clear winners). Assume we pick one deterministically if needed (e.g., the lowest numerical value among the tied colors).
6.  Create the output row, initially as a copy of the input row.
7.  Replace all pixel values in the output row from the identified start index to the end index (inclusive) with the most frequent color found in step 5.
8.  Return the modified output row.
