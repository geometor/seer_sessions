The input rows typically consist of a central contiguous block of non-white pixels, potentially containing multiple different colors, surrounded by white (0) pixels on either side or just on one side (as seen in example 2). The transformation identifies the single contiguous block of non-white pixels. Within this block, it determines which non-white color appears most frequently. The output row is generated by replacing all pixels within that original block's position with this single most frequent color. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Count the occurrences (frequency) of each distinct non-white color within the extracted block.\n5.  Determine the color with the highest frequency. If there's a tie, the examples don't explicitly cover this, but implicitly suggest any of the tied most frequent colors could be chosen (though the examples provided have clear winners). Assume we pick one deterministically if needed (e.g., the lowest numerical value among the tied colors).\n6.  Create the output row, initially as a copy of the input row.\n7.
