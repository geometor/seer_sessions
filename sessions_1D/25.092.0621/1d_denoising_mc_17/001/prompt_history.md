Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both single rows (1D arrays) of colored pixels. Each input row contains a central contiguous block of predominantly one color, flanked by white (0) pixels on both sides. Within this central block, there are a few "impurity" or "noise" pixels of different colors. The output row retains the white flanking pixels but modifies the central block. Specifically, the "impurity" pixels within the central block are replaced by the main, dominant color of that block, resulting in a solid-colored central block.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # Data is presented as single rows
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: flanking the central block on both sides
  - type: central_block
    description: A contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input.
    properties:
      - dominant_color: The most frequent color within the block (red=2 in ex1, green=3 in ex2, yellow=4 in ex3).
      - impurity_pixels: Pixels within the block whose color is not the dominant_color.
actions:
  - name: identify_dominant_color
    inputs: non_white pixels of the input array
    outputs: the most frequent color value
  - name: replace_impurities
    inputs: 
      - input array
      - dominant_color
    outputs: output array
    description: Iterate through the input array. If a pixel is non-white, replace its color with the dominant_color. If a pixel is white (0), keep it as white (0).
relationships:
  - The output array has the same dimensions as the input array.
  - The white pixels in the input maintain their position and color in the output.
  - All non-white pixels in the output have the same color, which is the dominant non-white color from the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input row.
2.  Determine the color that appears most frequently among these non-white pixels (this is the "dominant color").
3.  Create the output row by iterating through each pixel of the input row:
    *   If the input pixel is white (0), the corresponding output pixel is also white (0).
    *   If the input pixel is non-white (any color other than 0), the corresponding output pixel is set to the dominant color identified in step 2.
