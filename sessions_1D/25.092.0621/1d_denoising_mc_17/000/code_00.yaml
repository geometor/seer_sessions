task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # Data is presented as single rows
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: flanking the central block on both sides
  - type: central_block
    description: A contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input.
    properties:
      - dominant_color: The most frequent color within the block (red=2 in ex1, green=3 in ex2, yellow=4 in ex3).
      - impurity_pixels: Pixels within the block whose color is not the dominant_color.
actions:
  - name: identify_dominant_color
    inputs: non_white pixels of the input array
    outputs: the most frequent color value
  - name: replace_impurities
    inputs: 
      - input array
      - dominant_color
    outputs: output array
    description: Iterate through the input array. If a pixel is non-white, replace its color with the dominant_color. If a pixel is white (0), keep it as white (0).
relationships:
  - The output array has the same dimensions as the input array.
  - The white pixels in the input maintain their position and color in the output.
  - All non-white pixels in the output have the same color, which is the dominant non-white color from the input.
