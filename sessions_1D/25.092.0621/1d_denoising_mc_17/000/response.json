Each input row contains a central contiguous block of predominantly one color, flanked by white (0) pixels on both sides. Within this central block, there are a few \"impurity\" or \"noise\" pixels of different colors. The output row retains the white flanking pixels but modifies the central block. Specifically, the \"impurity\" pixels within the central block are replaced by the main, dominant color of that block, resulting in a solid-colored central block.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
