*   **Perception:**
    *   The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays).
    *   Each grid contains leading and/or trailing background pixels (white/0).
    *   Between the background pixels, there is a contiguous segment of non-background pixels.
    *   Within this non-background segment, multiple colors can exist.
    *   The transformation involves identifying the most frequent color within the non-background segment and replacing all other non-background colors in that segment with the most frequent one.
    *   The background pixels remain unchanged.

*   **Facts YAML:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively single-row grids
    background_color: 0 # white
    objects:
      - type: segment
        description: A contiguous sequence of non-background pixels.
        properties:
          - pixels: A list of colors within the segment.
          - dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently within the segment.
          - minority_colors: Colors within the segment that are not the dominant color.
    actions:
      - name: identify_active_segment
        description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous non-background pixel segment.
      - name: find_dominant_color
        description: Count frequencies of non-background colors within the active segment and identify the most frequent one.
      - name: replace_minority_colors
        description: Iterate through the active segment and change any pixel whose color is not the dominant color to the dominant color.
    relationships:
      - The transformation applies only to the pixels within the identified active segment.
      - Background pixels (outside the active segment) are preserved.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the background color (white, value 0).
    2.  Scan the input row to find the start index and end index of the contiguous segment containing non-background pixels (the "active segment").
    3.  Extract the pixels within this active segment.
    4.  Count the occurrences of each color within the active segment.
    5.  Determine the "dominant color," which is the color with the highest count in the active segment.
    6.  Create a copy of the input row for the output.
    7.  Iterate through the output row from the start index to the end index of the active segment.
    8.  For each pixel within this range, if its color is not the background color and not the dominant color, change its color to the dominant color.
    9.  Leave all background pixels (value 0) unchanged.
