Examine the input sequence of pixels (represented as a 1D list of color integers).\n2. Identify all pixels that are not white (color 0).\n3. Count the occurrences of each non-white color present in the sequence.\n4. Determine the non-white color that appears most frequently; this is the \"target color\". If there are no non-white colors, the input is returned unchanged.\n5. Create a new output sequence, initially identical to the input sequence.\n6. Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence:\n    *   If the pixel's color is not white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output sequence to the determined \"target color\".\n    *   If the pixel's color is white (0), leave the color of the corresponding pixel in the output sequence unchanged (it remains white).\n7.
