Data:
  - type: 1D sequence of colors (integers 0-9)
  - structure: Contains segments of non-white colors, potentially surrounded by white (0) pixels.

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (index in the sequence)
  - type: Color Segment
    properties:
      - comprises contiguous non-white pixels
      - may contain multiple distinct non-white colors
      - dominant_color: The most frequent non-white color within the entire sequence.
      - impurity_colors: Non-white colors within the segment that are not the dominant_color.

Relationships:
  - Pixels are ordered sequentially.
  - White pixels (color 0) act as delimiters or background.
  - Non-white pixels form segments.

Transformation:
  - Identification: Identify all non-white pixels in the input sequence.
  - Analysis: Determine the frequency of each non-white color. Identify the color with the highest frequency (the dominant_color).
  - Action: Iterate through the input sequence. If a pixel is non-white, replace its color with the identified dominant_color in the output sequence. If a pixel is white (0), keep it white in the output sequence.
  - Result: The output sequence contains the original white pixels, and all original non-white pixels are replaced by the single dominant_color.

Examples_Summary:
  - train_1: Dominant color is orange (7). Gray (5) and red (2) impurities are replaced by orange (7).
  - train_2: Dominant color is yellow (4). Magenta (6) and maroon (9) impurities are replaced by yellow (4).
  - train_3: Dominant color is yellow (4). Red (2), azure (8), and orange (7) impurities are replaced by yellow (4).
