Each sequence seems to represent a single row or a flattened grid.\nThe core pattern involves identifying a dominant non-white color within a contiguous segment of the sequence. This segment is often flanked by white (0) pixels.\nWithin this non-white segment, there may be isolated pixels of different non-white colors (\"impurities\").\nThe transformation homogenizes the non-white segment by replacing all pixels within it (including the original dominant color and the impurities) with the single dominant color identified.\nThe white pixels remain unchanged.\nThe dominant color is determined by finding the most frequent non-white color in the entire input sequence.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the color with the highest frequency (the dominant_color).\n  - Action: Iterate through the input sequence. If a pixel is non-white, replace its color with the identified dominant_color in the output sequence. If a pixel is white (0), keep it white in the output sequence.\n  - Result: The output sequence contains the original white pixels, and all original non-white pixels are replaced by the single dominant_color.\n\nExamples_Summary:\n  - train_1: Dominant color is orange (7). Gray (5) and red (2) impurities are replaced by orange (7).\n  - train_2: Dominant color is yellow (4). Magenta (6) and maroon (9) impurities are replaced by yellow (4).\n  - train_3: Dominant color is yellow (4). Red (2), azure (8), and orange (7) impurities are replaced by yellow (4).\n```"
