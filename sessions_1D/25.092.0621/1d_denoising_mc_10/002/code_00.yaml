Data:
  - type: 2D grid of colors (NumPy array of integers 0-9)
  - structure: Appears as single-row grids (1xN) in the examples, but the logic should apply to any NxM grid.

Objects:
  - type: Grid (NumPy array)
    properties:
      - shape (height, width)
      - pixels (elements of the array)
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - location (row, column index)
  - type: Color Category
    properties:
      - white (color 0)
      - non-white (colors 1-9)
  - type: Dominant Color
    properties:
      - The non-white color (1-9) that occurs most frequently across all pixels in the grid.
      - Calculated globally across the entire grid.

Relationships:
  - Pixels belong to the Grid.
  - Pixels are either white or non-white.
  - Non-white pixels have frequencies relative to each other.

Transformation:
  - Identification: Identify all non-white pixels (value != 0) in the input grid.
  - Analysis:
      - Count the frequency of each non-white color across the entire grid.
      - Determine the single non-white color with the highest frequency (the Dominant Color). If no non-white pixels exist, the grid is unchanged.
  - Action:
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - In the copied grid, replace the color of *every* pixel that was originally non-white with the identified Dominant Color.
      - Leave all pixels that were originally white (color 0) unchanged.
  - Result: An output grid of the same dimensions as the input, where all originally non-white areas are now filled uniformly with the Dominant Color, and white areas remain white.

Examples_Summary:
  - train_1: Input (1x32), Dominant=7 (Orange, count=23). Replaced 5 (Gray, count=1), 2 (Red, count=1) with 7. 2 pixels changed.
  - train_2: Input (1x32), Dominant=4 (Yellow, count=18). Replaced 6 (Magenta, count=1), 9 (Maroon, count=1) with 4. 2 pixels changed.
  - train_3: Input (1x32), Dominant=4 (Yellow, count=18). Replaced 2 (Red, count=1), 8 (Azure, count=1), 7 (Orange, count=1) with 4. 3 pixels changed.
