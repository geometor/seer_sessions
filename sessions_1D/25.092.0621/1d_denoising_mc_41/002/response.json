Given the initial code assumed a 1D input based on the visual format of the examples, but ARC typically uses 2D grids (even if they are 1xN), the most likely cause is that the `input_grid` is passed to the `transform` function as a 2D array (e.g., `[[...]]`), while the code expects a 1D array (`[...]`).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle potential 2D input (specifically shape (1, N)) by flattening it into a 1D array at the beginning.\n2.  Verify that all subsequent operations (color counting, finding indices, iteration, modification) are compatible with this 1D representation.\n3.  Refine the natural language program and documentation to reflect this handling of input shape.\n\n**Metrics**\nThe following metrics were gathered using code execution:\n"
