task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - role: background
        color: white (0)
        location: typically at the ends, can be absent
      - role: dominant_color_sequence
        color: variable (maroon/9, orange/7)
        property: most frequent non-background color
        location: forms a contiguous or near-contiguous block
      - role: impurity_pixels
        color: variable (orange/7, yellow/4, azure/8, magenta/6)
        location: embedded within the dominant_color_sequence
        count: typically one or few
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Impurity pixels are located spatially within the range defined by the first and last occurrence of the dominant color pixels.
  - type: frequency
    description: The dominant color is the most frequent color excluding the background color.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: background_color
    criteria: value is 0 (white)
  - action: identify
    target: dominant_color
    criteria: most frequent non-background color
  - action: define
    target: modification_span
    criteria: range from the index of the first occurrence to the index of the last occurrence of the dominant_color
  - action: replace
    target: impurity_pixels
    condition: pixel is within the modification_span AND pixel color is NOT dominant_color AND pixel color is NOT background_color
    result: pixel color becomes dominant_color
  - action: keep
    target: all other pixels
    condition: pixel is outside the modification_span OR pixel is background_color OR pixel is dominant_color within the span
    result: pixel color remains unchanged
