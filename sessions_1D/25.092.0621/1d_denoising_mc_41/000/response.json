A dominant color forms a long sequence (maroon/9 in example 1, orange/7 in examples 2 and 3). Other single pixels of different colors (orange/7, yellow/4 in example 1; azure/8 in example 2; magenta/6 in example 3) appear *within* the sequence of the dominant color.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the dominant non-background color sequence. Within the span covered by this dominant color (from its first to last appearance), any pixel that is *not* the dominant color and *not* the background color (0) is replaced by the dominant color. Pixels outside this span, including the background pixels, remain unchanged.\n4.  **Dominant Color Identification:** The dominant color appears to be the most frequent non-background color in the input grid.\n5.  **Region of Interest:** The modification only happens between the first and last occurrence of the dominant color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel within the modification span (from the first index to the last index, inclusive).\n7.  For each pixel within the span, check if its color is *neither* the dominant color *nor* the background color.\n8.  If a pixel meets this condition (i.e., it's an 'impurity' within the dominant color sequence), change its color in the output grid to the dominant color.\n9.
