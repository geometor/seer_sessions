Task: Replace minority colors with the majority color within a central segment.

Input:
  - Structure: 1D array (or 1xN grid).
  - Segments:
    - LeadingBorder: Sequence of zero pixels (white) at the beginning. Can be empty.
    - CentralSegment: Contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels following the LeadingBorder.
    - TrailingBorder: Sequence of zero pixels (white) at the end, following the CentralSegment. Can be empty.
  - Objects within CentralSegment:
    - Pixels: Each element in the sequence.
    - Properties:
      - Color: An integer from 1 to 9.
      - Frequency: Count of occurrences within the CentralSegment.
    - Categories:
      - DominantColorPixel: Pixel whose color is the most frequent non-zero color in the CentralSegment.
      - ImpurityColorPixel: Pixel whose color is non-zero but not the DominantColor.

Output:
  - Structure: Same dimensions and segment structure as the input.
  - Transformation:
    - Action: Replace color.
    - Target: ImpurityColorPixels within the CentralSegment.
    - Source: DominantColor.
    - Result: All pixels within the CentralSegment now have the DominantColor.
    - Invariance: LeadingBorder and TrailingBorder pixels remain unchanged.

Relationships:
  - The transformation is localized to the CentralSegment.
  - The replacement color (DominantColor) is determined by the most frequent color *within* the CentralSegment of the input.
