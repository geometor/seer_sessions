A leading sequence of zero pixels (white).\n2.  A central sequence of non-zero pixels.\n3.  A trailing sequence of zero pixels (white).\n\nWithin the central sequence of non-zero pixels, one color appears most frequently (the \"dominant\" color), while one or more other colors appear less frequently (the \"impurity\" colors).\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying the dominant color within the central non-zero sequence and replacing all impurity colors within that same sequence with the dominant color.
