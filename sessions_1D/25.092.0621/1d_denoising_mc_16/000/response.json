            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be grids. Based on the number of elements (32) and typical ARC structures, they are likely 4x8 or 8x4 grids. The transformation logic seems consistent regardless of the specific orientation, relying on local neighborhoods.\n2.  **Colors:** Multiple colors are used (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray). White (0) seems to function as a static background color.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of certain non-background pixels.\n4.  **Mechanism:** The change seems dependent on the colors of the neighboring pixels. Specifically, pixels that are different from the dominant color in their immediate neighborhood (excluding the background color) adopt that dominant color.\n5.  **Scope:** The changes are local; each pixel's transformation is determined only by its immediate surroundings in the input state. The background pixels (color 0) are never changed and are ignored when determining the dominant neighbor color.\n6.  **Simultaneity:** All pixels are evaluated based on the *input* grid's state, and the changes are applied simultaneously to produce the output grid. A pixel changing color doesn't affect the evaluation of its neighbors within the same transformation step.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through each cell (pixel) at position (row, column) in the input grid.\n3.  Let the current pixel's color be `P_color`.\n4.  If `P_color` is 0 (white/background), continue to the next pixel; its value in the output grid remains 0.\n5.  Identify the 8 neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent) of the current cell.\n6.  Create a list of valid, non-background neighbor colors:\n    *   Filter out neighbors that fall outside the grid boundaries.\n    *   From the remaining neighbors, filter out those whose color in the *input* grid is 0 (white/background).\n7.  If the list of non-background neighbor colors is empty, continue to the next pixel; the current pixel's color in the output grid remains `P_color`.\n8.  Count the occurrences of each unique color in the list of non-background neighbors.\n9.  Find the color(s) with the highest count (the majority color(s)).\n10. If there is exactly one majority color (`M_color`) and `M_color` is different from `P_color`, update the cell at (row, column) in the *output* grid to `M_color`.\n11. Otherwise (if there is a tie for the majority color, or if `P_color` already matches the `M_color`), the cell at (row, column) in the output grid retains its original `P_color`.\n12. After iterating through all cells, return the final output grid."
