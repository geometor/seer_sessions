Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Properties:
    Static_Size: true # Dimensions remain constant between input and output
    Static_Background: true # Color 0 (white) pixels are unchanged and act as background
Pixel_Transformation:
  Condition: Applies only to non-background (non-zero color) pixels.
  Rule:
    Neighborhood: Consider the 8 adjacent pixels (Moore neighborhood).
    Neighbor_Filtering: Exclude neighbors outside grid bounds and background (color 0) neighbors.
    Majority_Color_Calculation:
      Input: Filtered non-background neighbors.
      Process: Count the frequency of each color among these neighbors.
      Output: Determine the color with the highest frequency (Majority Color).
      Tie_Handling: Not explicitly defined by examples; assume change only occurs if a single majority color exists.
    Color_Change:
      Trigger: If the pixel's current color is different from the calculated Majority Color of its neighbors.
      Action: Change the pixel's color to the Majority Color.
      No_Change_Conditions:
        - Pixel color is 0 (background).
        - Pixel color already matches the Majority Color.
        - No non-background neighbors exist.
        - No single majority color exists among neighbors (tie).
  Concurrency: All pixel changes are determined based on the original input grid state before any modifications are applied.
