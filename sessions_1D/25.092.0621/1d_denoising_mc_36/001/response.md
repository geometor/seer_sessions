```python
import numpy as np

"""
Processes a 1xN grid (representing a 1D sequence) row by row.
For each row:
1. Iterates through the pixels from left to right.
2. Identifies contiguous segments of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
3. For each segment, determines the "host color", which is the color of the first non-white pixel encountered when entering the segment.
4. Replaces all non-white pixels within that segment with the host color.
5. White (zero) pixels remain unchanged and act as delimiters between segments.
"""

    """
    Transforms the input grid by homogenizing the color within contiguous 
    non-white segments based on the segment's starting color.
