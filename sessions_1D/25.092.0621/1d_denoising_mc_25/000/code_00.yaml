task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D)
  background_color: white (0)
  background_location: Typically at the start and end of the sequence.
objects:
  - type: sequence
    description: A contiguous or near-contiguous block of non-background pixels.
    properties:
      - dominant_color: The most frequent color within the sequence (excluding background).
        example_values: [orange (7), orange (7), blue (1)]
      - constituent_colors: All colors present within the sequence area.
  - type: interrupting_pixel
    description: Pixels within the sequence whose color is not the dominant_color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the interrupting pixel.
        example_values: [azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4), maroon (9), blue (1), green (3)]
      - location: Within the bounds of the non-background sequence.
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Interrupting pixels are located within the sequence of the dominant color.
  - type: frequency
    description: The dominant_color is the most frequent non-background color.
actions:
  - name: identify_dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent non-background color in the input grid.
  - name: identify_interrupting_pixels
    description: Find pixels that are not the background color and not the dominant color.
  - name: replace_pixels
    description: Change the color of the interrupting pixels to the dominant color.
  - name: preserve_background
    description: Ensure background (white) pixels remain unchanged.
transformation_goal: To homogenize the main color sequence by replacing interrupting pixels with the sequence's dominant color.
