Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples seem to involve grids of the same size (3x11 based on the 33 elements per row).
2.  **Color Palette:** Multiple colors are used, including white (0). White pixels appear consistently in the bottom right portion of the grid and seem unaffected by the transformation.
3.  **Dominant Color:** In each input grid (excluding white), there appears to be one color that is significantly more frequent than others.
    *   Example 1: Red (2) is dominant.
    *   Example 2: Azure (8) is dominant.
    *   Example 3: Magenta (6) is dominant.
4.  **Minority Colors:** Besides the dominant color and white, there are a small number of pixels with other colors ("minority" colors).
    *   Example 1: Magenta (6) and Green (3).
    *   Example 2: Gray (5) and Blue (1).
    *   Example 3: Azure (8) and Yellow (4).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be replacing these minority, non-white colors with the dominant non-white color. The dominant color pixels and the white pixels remain unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Replace minority non-background colors with the dominant non-background color.
definitions:
  - name: background_color
    value: white (0)
  - name: dominant_color
    value: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the background_color.
  - name: minority_colors
    value: All colors present in the input grid that are neither the background_color nor the dominant_color.
grid_properties:
  - size: Fixed (appears to be 3x11 for the examples)
  - background_region: Pixels with the background_color (white) appear unaffected.
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: background_color
    details: Recognize white (0) as the background.
  - action: identify
    target: dominant_color
    details: Find the most frequent color among all non-background pixels.
  - action: identify
    target: minority_colors
    details: Find all pixels whose color is not the background_color and not the dominant_color.
  - action: replace
    target: pixels with minority_colors
    details: Change the color of these pixels to the dominant_color.
  - action: preserve
    target: pixels with background_color
    details: Keep their color unchanged.
  - action: preserve
    target: pixels with dominant_color
    details: Keep their color unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels that are not white (0).
3.  Count the frequency of each color among these non-white pixels.
4.  Determine the color with the highest frequency; this is the "dominant color".
5.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid.
6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
7.  If a pixel's color is not white (0) and is not the dominant color, change the corresponding pixel in the new grid to the dominant color.
8.  Leave all white pixels and all pixels that already have the dominant color unchanged in the new grid.
9.  The resulting new grid is the output.
