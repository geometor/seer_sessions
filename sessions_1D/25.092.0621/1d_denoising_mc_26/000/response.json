White pixels appear consistently in the bottom right portion of the grid and seem unaffected by the transformation.\n3.  **Dominant Color:** In each input grid (excluding white), there appears to be one color that is significantly more frequent than others.\n    *   Example 1: Red (2) is dominant.\n    *   Example 2: Azure (8) is dominant.\n    *   Example 3: Magenta (6) is dominant.\n4.  **Minority Colors:** Besides the dominant color and white, there are a small number of pixels with other colors (\"minority\" colors).\n    *   Example 1: Magenta (6) and Green (3).\n    *   Example 2: Gray (5) and Blue (1).\n    *   Example 3: Azure (8) and Yellow (4).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be replacing these minority, non-white colors with the dominant non-white color. The dominant color pixels and the white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
