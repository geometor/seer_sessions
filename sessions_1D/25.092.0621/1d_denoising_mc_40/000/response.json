Each input array contains a central segment of non-white pixels, potentially framed by white (0) padding pixels at the beginning and/or end. Within the non-white segment, one color appears most frequently (the \"main color\"), while other colors appear sporadically (\"noise colors\"). The transformation involves identifying the main color within the non-white segment and replacing all noise colors within that segment with the main color.
