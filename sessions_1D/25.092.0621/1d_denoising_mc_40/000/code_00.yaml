task_type: noise_reduction_1d
input_description: A 1D array of pixels, potentially with white (0) padding at the ends. Contains a primary non-white segment with a dominant color and some 'noise' pixels of other non-white colors.
output_description: A 1D array of pixels where the 'noise' pixels within the non-white segment have been replaced by the dominant color of that segment. Padding remains unchanged.
elements:
  - type: segment
    name: padding
    color: white (0)
    location: Contiguous blocks at the start and/or end of the array.
    role: Background/Frame, remains unchanged.
  - type: segment
    name: main_segment
    location: The contiguous block of non-white pixels between padding segments (or the entire array if no padding).
    properties: Contains multiple colors.
  - type: color
    name: main_color
    source: Identified within the main_segment.
    property: The most frequent non-white color within the main_segment.
  - type: pixel
    name: noise_pixel
    location: Within the main_segment.
    color: Any non-white color that is not the main_color.
    role: Pixels to be modified.
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: padding segments
    based_on: color (white) and location (start/end).
  - action: identify
    target: main_segment
    based_on: location (between padding segments or all non-white pixels).
  - action: identify
    target: main_color
    based_on: frequency count of non-white colors within the main_segment.
  - action: replace
    target: noise_pixels within the main_segment
    replace_with: main_color
relationships:
  - The main_segment is bordered by padding (if present).
  - Noise_pixels are interspersed within the main_segment among pixels of the main_color.
