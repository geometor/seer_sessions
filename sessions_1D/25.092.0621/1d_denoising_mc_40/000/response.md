**Perception:**

The input and output are both 1-dimensional arrays (or single rows) of colored pixels. Each input array contains a central segment of non-white pixels, potentially framed by white (0) padding pixels at the beginning and/or end. Within the non-white segment, one color appears most frequently (the "main color"), while other colors appear sporadically ("noise colors"). The transformation involves identifying the main color within the non-white segment and replacing all noise colors within that segment with the main color. The white padding pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: noise_reduction_1d
input_description: A 1D array of pixels, potentially with white (0) padding at the ends. Contains a primary non-white segment with a dominant color and some 'noise' pixels of other non-white colors.
output_description: A 1D array of pixels where the 'noise' pixels within the non-white segment have been replaced by the dominant color of that segment. Padding remains unchanged.
elements:
  - type: segment
    name: padding
    color: white (0)
    location: Contiguous blocks at the start and/or end of the array.
    role: Background/Frame, remains unchanged.
  - type: segment
    name: main_segment
    location: The contiguous block of non-white pixels between padding segments (or the entire array if no padding).
    properties: Contains multiple colors.
  - type: color
    name: main_color
    source: Identified within the main_segment.
    property: The most frequent non-white color within the main_segment.
  - type: pixel
    name: noise_pixel
    location: Within the main_segment.
    color: Any non-white color that is not the main_color.
    role: Pixels to be modified.
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: padding segments
    based_on: color (white) and location (start/end).
  - action: identify
    target: main_segment
    based_on: location (between padding segments or all non-white pixels).
  - action: identify
    target: main_color
    based_on: frequency count of non-white colors within the main_segment.
  - action: replace
    target: noise_pixels within the main_segment
    replace_with: main_color
relationships:
  - The main_segment is bordered by padding (if present).
  - Noise_pixels are interspersed within the main_segment among pixels of the main_color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output array.
2.  Identify the start and end indices of the non-white pixel segment in the input array. Ignore any leading or trailing white (0) pixels (padding).
3.  Analyze the segment of non-white pixels identified in step 2. Count the frequency of each non-white color within this segment.
4.  Determine the "main color," which is the non-white color with the highest frequency in the segment.
5.  Iterate through the identified non-white segment (from the start index to the end index found in step 2) in the output array.
6.  For each pixel within this segment, if its color is not white (0) and not the main color, change its color to the main color.
7.  Leave all white (0) pixels (padding and any potential white pixels within the main segment, though none appear in examples) and pixels already matching the main color unchanged.
8.  Return the modified output array.
