"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by identifying the central contiguous segment of non-white pixels. 
Within this segment, it finds the most frequent non-white color (the 'main color'). 
It then replaces all other non-white pixels ('noise pixels') within that segment with the main color. 
White pixels (padding at the ends or potentially within the segment) remain unchanged.
