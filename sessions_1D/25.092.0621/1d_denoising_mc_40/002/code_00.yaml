task_type: noise_reduction_1d_row
input_description: A 1xN grid (single row) containing pixels. The row typically has leading and/or trailing white (0) pixels (padding). Between the padding, there is a contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
output_description: A 1xN grid where, within the central non-white segment of the input row, all 'noise' pixels (non-white pixels that are not the most frequent color in that segment) have been replaced by the most frequent non-white color ('main color'). Padding pixels remain unchanged.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 2D
  - shape: 1 row, N columns (1xN)
elements:
  - type: pixel
    name: padding_pixel
    color: white (0)
    location: Contiguous blocks at the start and/or end of the row.
    role: Background/Frame, remains unchanged.
  - type: segment
    name: main_segment
    location: The contiguous block of pixels in the row between the first and last non-white pixel (inclusive).
    properties: Contains multiple colors, including at least one non-white color.
  - type: color
    name: main_color
    source: Identified within the main_segment.
    property: The most frequent non-white color within the main_segment. (If ties, one is chosen, e.g., the first encountered or lowest value, though examples don't show ties).
  - type: pixel
    name: noise_pixel
    location: Within the main_segment.
    color: Any non-white color that is not the main_color.
    role: Pixels to be modified.
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: main_segment boundaries
    based_on: Finding the column indices of the first and last non-white pixels in the row.
  - action: extract
    target: main_segment pixels
    based_on: Slicing the row using the identified start and end column indices.
  - action: analyze
    target: main_segment pixels
    operation: Count frequency of each non-white color.
  - action: identify
    target: main_color
    based_on: Highest frequency count among non-white colors in the main_segment.
  - action: modify
    target: input grid (copy)
    operation: Iterate through the columns corresponding to the main_segment. For each pixel in this range: if it's a noise_pixel (non-white and not main_color), change its color to main_color.
  - action: preserve
    target: padding_pixels and pixels within the main_segment that are already the main_color or are white (0).
relationships:
  - The main_segment is defined by the extent of non-white pixels in the single row.
  - Noise_pixels exist only within the main_segment.
