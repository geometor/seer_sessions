"""
Identifies the contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels in a 1D input array.
Within this segment, determines the most frequent non-white color (the 'main color').
Replaces all other non-white pixels (noise) within that segment with the main color.
Leaves white (zero) pixels (padding at ends or potentially within the segment) unchanged.
