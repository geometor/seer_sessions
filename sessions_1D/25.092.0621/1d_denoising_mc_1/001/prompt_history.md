Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** The examples are all 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids).
*   **Pixel Values:** The grids contain white pixels (0) and various other colored pixels (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9).
*   **Input Pattern:** Each input grid consists of a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels bordered on both sides by white pixels.
*   **Dominant Color:** Within the non-white sequence, one color appears much more frequently than others. Let's call this the "dominant color".
*   **Noise Pixels:** Other non-white colors appear sporadically within the sequence dominated by the main color. Let's call these "noise pixels".
*   **Output Pattern:** In the output grid, the "noise pixels" within the non-white sequence are replaced by the "dominant color". The bordering white pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Replace minority non-white colors within a contiguous non-white sequence with the majority non-white color.
elements:
  - type: Grid
    description: A 1-dimensional array of pixels.
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Represented by integers 0-9.
      - value: 0 represents white, other values represent various colors.
  - type: Sequence
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels within the grid.
    properties:
      - dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently within the sequence.
      - noise_pixels: Pixels within the sequence whose color is not the dominant color.
      - border_pixels: White pixels (0) located outside the non-white sequence (at the beginning and/or end).
actions:
  - name: Identify Sequence
    description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous non-white pixel sequence.
  - name: Determine Dominant Color
    description: Count the frequency of each non-white color within the identified sequence and find the color with the highest frequency.
  - name: Replace Noise Pixels
    description: Iterate through the pixels within the identified sequence. If a pixel's color is not the dominant color, change its color to the dominant color.
relationships:
  - The transformation specifically targets the contiguous non-white sequence.
  - Bordering white pixels are unaffected by the transformation.
  - The replacement color is determined by the most frequent color within the original non-white sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the input grid. Note the starting and ending positions of this sequence.
2.  Analyze the colors of the pixels *only within this non-white sequence*.
3.  Count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color present in this sequence.
4.  Determine the color that occurs most frequently (the dominant color).
5.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
6.  Iterate through the pixels in the output grid *only within the positions* corresponding to the identified non-white sequence.
7.  For each pixel within this sequence, check if its color is different from the dominant color determined in step 4.
8.  If a pixel's color is different from the dominant color, change its color in the output grid to the dominant color.
9.  Leave all pixels outside the identified non-white sequence (the leading and trailing white pixels) unchanged.
10. The resulting grid is the final output.
