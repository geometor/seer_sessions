Let's call this the \"dominant color\".\n*   **Noise Pixels:** Other non-white colors appear sporadically within the sequence dominated by the main color. Let's call these \"noise pixels\".\n*   **Output Pattern:** In the output grid, the \"noise pixels\" within the non-white sequence are replaced by the \"dominant color\". The bordering white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
