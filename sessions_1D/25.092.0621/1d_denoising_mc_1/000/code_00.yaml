task_description: Replace minority non-white colors within a contiguous non-white sequence with the majority non-white color.
elements:
  - type: Grid
    description: A 1-dimensional array of pixels.
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Represented by integers 0-9.
      - value: 0 represents white, other values represent various colors.
  - type: Sequence
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels within the grid.
    properties:
      - dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently within the sequence.
      - noise_pixels: Pixels within the sequence whose color is not the dominant color.
      - border_pixels: White pixels (0) located outside the non-white sequence (at the beginning and/or end).
actions:
  - name: Identify Sequence
    description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous non-white pixel sequence.
  - name: Determine Dominant Color
    description: Count the frequency of each non-white color within the identified sequence and find the color with the highest frequency.
  - name: Replace Noise Pixels
    description: Iterate through the pixels within the identified sequence. If a pixel's color is not the dominant color, change its color to the dominant color.
relationships:
  - The transformation specifically targets the contiguous non-white sequence.
  - Bordering white pixels are unaffected by the transformation.
  - The replacement color is determined by the most frequent color within the original non-white sequence.
