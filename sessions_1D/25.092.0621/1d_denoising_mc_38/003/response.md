Transformation Rule:

1. Iterate through each row of the input 2D grid.
2. For each row, identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels (value > 0).
3. If no non-white segment exists in a row, leave that row unchanged.
4. Within the identified non-white segment for a row, determine the most frequent non-white color (the "dominant color").
5. Create an output grid initially identical to the input grid.
6. In the output grid, iterate through the non-white segment of the current row and replace all pixels that are non-white *and* not the dominant color with the dominant color.
7. Leave white pixels (value 0) and pixels already matching the dominant color unchanged.
8. Return the modified output grid.
