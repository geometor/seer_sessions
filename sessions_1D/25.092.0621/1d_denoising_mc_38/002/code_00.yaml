task_type: grid_transformation_2d
input_output_relation: one_to_one
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  dimensions_input: (1, 32) for all examples
  dimensions_output: (1, 32) for all examples (dimensions are preserved)
  value_range: 0-9 (colors)
components:
  - type: background_pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: often flanking the main sequence within the row
      role: boundary marker, unchanged by transformation
  - type: main_sequence
    properties:
      composition: contiguous block of non-white pixels within the row
      location: typically central part of the row
      contains:
        - dominant_color: the most frequent non-white color within this sequence in the row
        - impurity_colors: any other non-white colors within this sequence in the row
relationship:
  - impurity_colors are interspersed within the main_sequence, which is predominantly composed of the dominant_color.
action:
  - name: homogenize_row_sequence
    target: main_sequence within each row
    effect: replace all impurity_colors with the dominant_color for that row's sequence
    scope: applies independently to the main_sequence found within each row of the grid
invariance:
  - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - Background pixels (white) remain unchanged.
  - Pixels within the main_sequence that already have the dominant_color remain unchanged.
processing_flow:
  - iterate through each row of the input grid (in these examples, there is only one row).
  - for the current row, identify the main_sequence.
  - if a main_sequence exists, find its dominant_color.
  - update the corresponding row in the output grid by replacing impurity_colors in the sequence with the dominant_color.
