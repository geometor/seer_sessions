Each example shows a transformation applied to a single row.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The inputs consist of a central segment of non-white pixels, often flanked by white (0) pixels on one or both ends. The outputs maintain this overall structure and the same length as the inputs.\n2.  **Content:** The central non-white segment contains multiple colors. In each example, one non-white color appears significantly more frequently than others within this segment. Let's call this the \"dominant color\". Other non-white colors appear less frequently, acting as \"impurities\" within the dominant sequence.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core change occurs within the central non-white segment. The \"impurity\" colors are replaced by the \"dominant\" color of that segment. The dominant color itself remains unchanged, and the flanking white pixels also remain unchanged.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (train_1):**\n*   Input Row: `0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 3 4 9 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 9 4 4 4 4 0 0 0`\n*   Non-white segment: `4 4 4 3 4 9 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 9 4 4 4 4`\n*   Colors in segment: Yellow (4) is most frequent (dominant). Green (3) and Maroon (9) are impurities.\n*   Transformation: Replace Green (3) and Maroon (9) with Yellow (4).\n*   Output Row: `0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0`\n\nThis pattern holds consistently across `train_2` (dominant: Maroon (9), impurities: Blue (1), Azure (8)) and `train_3` (dominant: Green (3), impurities: Orange (7), Azure (8)).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
