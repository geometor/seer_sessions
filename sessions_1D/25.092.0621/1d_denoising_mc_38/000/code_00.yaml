task_type: array_transformation_1d # Assuming 1D input based on examples
components:
  - type: background_segment
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: typically at the start and/or end of the array
      role: unchanged boundary marker
  - type: main_sequence
    properties:
      composition: contiguous block of non-white pixels
      location: between background segments or filling the array if no background
      contains:
        - dominant_color: the most frequent non-white color within this sequence
        - impurity_colors: any other non-white colors within this sequence
relationship:
  - impurity_colors are embedded within the sequence primarily composed of the dominant_color
action:
  - name: homogenize_sequence
    target: main_sequence
    effect: replace all impurity_colors with the dominant_color
    scope: applies only to pixels within the main_sequence
invariance:
  - background_segment pixels remain unchanged.
  - pixels already having the dominant_color remain unchanged.
  - array dimensions remain unchanged.
