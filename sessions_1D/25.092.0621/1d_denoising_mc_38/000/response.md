Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output are presented as 1D arrays of numbers, which represent rows of colored pixels. Each example shows a transformation applied to a single row.

1.  **Structure:** The inputs consist of a central segment of non-white pixels, often flanked by white (0) pixels on one or both ends. The outputs maintain this overall structure and the same length as the inputs.
2.  **Content:** The central non-white segment contains multiple colors. In each example, one non-white color appears significantly more frequently than others within this segment. Let's call this the "dominant color". Other non-white colors appear less frequently, acting as "impurities" within the dominant sequence.
3.  **Transformation:** The core change occurs within the central non-white segment. The "impurity" colors are replaced by the "dominant" color of that segment. The dominant color itself remains unchanged, and the flanking white pixels also remain unchanged.

**Example Walkthrough (train_1):**
*   Input Row: `0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 3 4 9 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 9 4 4 4 4 0 0 0`
*   Non-white segment: `4 4 4 3 4 9 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 9 4 4 4 4`
*   Colors in segment: Yellow (4) is most frequent (dominant). Green (3) and Maroon (9) are impurities.
*   Transformation: Replace Green (3) and Maroon (9) with Yellow (4).
*   Output Row: `0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0`

This pattern holds consistently across `train_2` (dominant: Maroon (9), impurities: Blue (1), Azure (8)) and `train_3` (dominant: Green (3), impurities: Orange (7), Azure (8)).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d # Assuming 1D input based on examples
components:
  - type: background_segment
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: typically at the start and/or end of the array
      role: unchanged boundary marker
  - type: main_sequence
    properties:
      composition: contiguous block of non-white pixels
      location: between background segments or filling the array if no background
      contains:
        - dominant_color: the most frequent non-white color within this sequence
        - impurity_colors: any other non-white colors within this sequence
relationship:
  - impurity_colors are embedded within the sequence primarily composed of the dominant_color
action:
  - name: homogenize_sequence
    target: main_sequence
    effect: replace all impurity_colors with the dominant_color
    scope: applies only to pixels within the main_sequence
invariance:
  - background_segment pixels remain unchanged.
  - pixels already having the dominant_color remain unchanged.
  - array dimensions remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input row. If the entire row is non-white, treat the whole row as the segment. If the entire row is white, make no changes.
2.  Within this non-white segment, count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color.
3.  Determine the color that occurs most frequently; this is the "dominant color".
4.  Create the output row by copying the input row.
5.  Iterate through the identified non-white segment in the output row.
6.  For each pixel in this segment, if its color is not the dominant color, change its color to the dominant color.
7.  Leave all pixels outside this segment (the white background pixels) and pixels already matching the dominant color unchanged.
