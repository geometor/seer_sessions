*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of the same length.
    *   Each input row contains sequences of white pixels (0) at the beginning and/or end.
    *   Between the white pixels, there is a main sequence of colored pixels.
    *   Within this main sequence, one color appears significantly more often than others. This is the "dominant" color for that row.
    *   Other non-white colors appear sporadically within the sequence of the dominant color. These are "impurity" pixels.
    *   The transformation replaces all "impurity" pixels with the dominant color of that row.
    *   The white pixels (0) remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Examples:
      - Input: A single row grid.
        Output: A single row grid of the same dimensions.
        Properties:
          - The grid contains sequences of white pixels (0) and a central block of non-white pixels.
          - Within the non-white block, one color (the dominant color) is most frequent.
          - Other non-white colors (impurities) exist within this block.
        Transformation:
          - Identify the dominant non-white color in the input row.
          - Replace all non-white pixels that are *not* the dominant color with the dominant color.
          - Keep white pixels (0) unchanged.
        Relationship: The output is derived by "cleaning" the non-white section of the input row, making it uniformly the dominant color.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input grid (a single row).
    2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    3.  Consider only the non-white pixels (values 1-9) in the input grid.
    4.  Determine the color that appears most frequently among these non-white pixels (the "dominant color").
    5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    6.  If the current pixel is not white (value is not 0) and its color is different from the dominant color, change its value in the output grid to the dominant color.
    7.  If the current pixel is white (0) or its color is already the dominant color, leave its value unchanged in the output grid.
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
