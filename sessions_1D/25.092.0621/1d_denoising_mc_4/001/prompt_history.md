Okay, let's break down the transformation in these examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The examples consist of single-row grids (1D arrays).
2.  **Structure:** Each row has blocks of white (0) pixels at the beginning and end, acting as padding or boundaries. Between these white blocks, there is a sequence of non-white pixels.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The change occurs within the central sequence of non-white pixels. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Pattern:** Within the non-white sequence, there's usually one dominant color. Other colors appear sporadically within this sequence. In the output, these sporadic colors are replaced by the dominant color, resulting in a uniform sequence of the dominant color.
5.  **Dominant Color:** The dominant color appears to be the one that occurs most frequently within the initial non-white sequence.
6.  **Outliers:** The pixels that get changed are those whose color is *not* the dominant color of the sequence.

**Facts:**

objects:
  - type: sequence
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels bounded by white pixels (or grid edges).
    properties:
      - dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently within the sequence.
      - outlier_pixels: Pixels within the sequence whose color is not the dominant_color.
actions:
  - action: identify_sequence
    description: Locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels.

  - action: find_dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent color within the identified sequence.
    inputs: sequence_pixels
    outputs: dominant_color
  - action: replace_outliers
    description: Change the color of all outlier_pixels within the sequence to the dominant_color.
    inputs: sequence_pixels, dominant_color
    outputs: modified_sequence_pixels
relationships:
  - type: boundary
    description: White pixels define the start and end of the sequence to be processed.
  - type: replacement
    description: Outlier pixels are replaced by the dominant color of their sequence.
invariance:
  - The white padding pixels remain unchanged.
  - The position and length of the non-white sequence remain unchanged.
  - Pixels already matching the dominant color remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input row. Note the starting and ending indices of this segment.
2.  Count the occurrences of each non-white color within this segment.
3.  Determine the color that occurs most frequently (the dominant color).
4.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the original non-white segment.
5.  Fill this new sequence entirely with the dominant color.
6.  Construct the output row by combining the original leading white pixels, the newly created sequence of the dominant color, and the original trailing white pixels.
