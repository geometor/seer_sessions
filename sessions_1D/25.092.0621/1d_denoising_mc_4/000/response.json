Between these white blocks, there is a sequence of non-white pixels.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The change occurs within the central sequence of non-white pixels. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Pattern:** Within the non-white sequence, there's usually one dominant color. Other colors appear sporadically within this sequence. In the output, these sporadic colors are replaced by the dominant color, resulting in a uniform sequence of the dominant color.\n5.  **Dominant Color:** The dominant color appears to be the one that occurs most frequently within the initial non-white sequence.\n6.  **Outliers:** The pixels that get changed are those whose color is *not* the dominant color of the sequence.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
