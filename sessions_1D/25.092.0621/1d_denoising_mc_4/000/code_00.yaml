task_type: grid_modification
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: sequence
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels bounded by white pixels (or grid edges).
    properties:
      - dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently within the sequence.
      - outlier_pixels: Pixels within the sequence whose color is not the dominant_color.
actions:
  - action: identify_sequence
    description: Locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: sequence_boundaries, sequence_pixels
  - action: find_dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent color within the identified sequence.
    inputs: sequence_pixels
    outputs: dominant_color
  - action: replace_outliers
    description: Change the color of all outlier_pixels within the sequence to the dominant_color.
    inputs: sequence_pixels, dominant_color
    outputs: modified_sequence_pixels
relationships:
  - type: boundary
    description: White pixels define the start and end of the sequence to be processed.
  - type: replacement
    description: Outlier pixels are replaced by the dominant color of their sequence.
invariance:
  - The white padding pixels remain unchanged.
  - The position and length of the non-white sequence remain unchanged.
  - Pixels already matching the dominant color remain unchanged.
