Task: Homogenize a central color segment within a single-row grid based on the dominant color.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D NumPy array with shape (1, Width).
  - Pixels: Each pixel has an integer color value (0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Background: Contiguous segments of white (0) pixels, typically at the start and end of the row.
    - Central_Segment_Indices: The column indices corresponding to the contiguous block of non-white pixels located between the background segments within the single row.
    - Central_Segment_Values: The sequence of non-white pixel values found at the Central_Segment_Indices.
    - Dominant_Pixel_Color: The color value that appears most frequently within the Central_Segment_Values.
    - Impurity_Pixel: Any pixel within the Central_Segment_Values whose color is not the Dominant_Pixel_Color.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D NumPy array with the same shape as the input Grid.
  - Pixels: Integer color values (0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Background: Identical to the input Background segments.
    - Homogenized_Segment: The segment corresponding to the input's Central_Segment_Indices, where all pixels now have the Dominant_Pixel_Color.

Relationships:
  - The Central_Segment is defined by its non-white color and contiguity along the single row.
  - The color of the Homogenized_Segment in the output is determined by the Dominant_Pixel_Color from the input's Central_Segment_Values.
  - Background pixels (value 0) remain unchanged between input and output.
  - Input and Output grids have identical shapes.

Actions:
  - Input: A 2D NumPy array `input_grid` of shape (1, Width).
  - Extract the single row from the input grid.
  - Identify the start and end column indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the row. If no non-white pixels exist, return the original `input_grid`.
  - Extract the pixel values within this identified segment from the row.
  - Count the frequency of each distinct color value within the extracted segment.
  - Determine the color value with the highest frequency (Dominant_Pixel_Color).
  - Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
  - Modify the single row of the output grid: For all column indices within the identified segment's range (inclusive), set the pixel value to the determined Dominant_Pixel_Color.
  - Return the modified output grid (as a 2D NumPy array).
