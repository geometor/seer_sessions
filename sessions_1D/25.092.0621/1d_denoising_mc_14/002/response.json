            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" indicates that a boolean condition was evaluated on a NumPy array containing multiple elements, which is disallowed. This typically occurs in `if` statements. Reviewing the previous code, the likely cause is the initial check `if not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):`. If `input_grid` is passed as a NumPy array (common in ARC), `input_grid[0]` will also be a NumPy array, not a list. The code needs to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, specifically assuming the input is a 2D NumPy array with a single row, as suggested by the examples.\n\nThe strategy is:\n1.  Verify the input data type and structure using `tool_code`.\n2.  Modify the code to explicitly handle 2D NumPy arrays with one row.\n3.  Ensure all operations (slicing, finding dominant color, modification, returning) are compatible with NumPy arrays or convert appropriately to lists where necessary (like for `collections.Counter`) and back to NumPy arrays for the final output.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's inspect the input data structure for the first training example.\n"
