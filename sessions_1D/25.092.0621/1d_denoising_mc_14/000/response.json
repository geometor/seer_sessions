A central segment contains non-white colors.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The central, non-white segment in the input grid contains a mixture of colors, but one color is clearly predominant. The output grid shows this central segment transformed so that *all* pixels within that segment now have the predominant color. The white padding pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Identifying the Segment:** The transformation focuses exclusively on the contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n5.  **Identifying the Dominant Color:** The color used for filling the segment in the output is the one that appeared most frequently within that segment in the input.\n6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three examples:\n    *   Example 1: A green (3) pixel within a mostly maroon (9) segment is changed to maroon.\n    *   Example 2: An azure (8) and a red (2) pixel within a mostly green (3) segment are changed to green.\n    *   Example 3: A yellow (4) pixel within a mostly orange (7) segment is changed to orange.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
