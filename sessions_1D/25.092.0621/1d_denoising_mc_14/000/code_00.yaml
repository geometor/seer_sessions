Task: Homogenize a central color segment based on the dominant color.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 1D array (or single row) of pixels.
  - Pixels: Each pixel has a color value (0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Background: Contiguous segments of white (0) pixels, typically at the start and end.
    - Central_Segment: A contiguous segment of non-white pixels located between the background segments.
    - Dominant_Pixel: The color that appears most frequently within the Central_Segment.
    - Impurity_Pixel: Any pixel within the Central_Segment whose color is not the Dominant_Pixel color.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 1D array of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Pixels: Color values (0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Background: Identical to the input Background segments.
    - Homogenized_Segment: A contiguous segment corresponding to the input Central_Segment, where all pixels now have the color of the input's Dominant_Pixel.

Relationships:
  - The Central_Segment is defined by its non-white color and contiguity.
  - The color of the Homogenized_Segment in the output is determined by the Dominant_Pixel color from the input's Central_Segment.
  - Background pixels remain unchanged between input and output.

Actions:
  - Identify the boundaries of the Central_Segment (first and last non-white pixel).
  - Analyze the colors within the identified Central_Segment.
  - Count the frequency of each color within the Central_Segment.
  - Determine the Dominant_Pixel color (highest frequency).
  - Create the output grid by copying the input.
  - Modify the output grid by replacing the color of *all* pixels within the boundaries of the original Central_Segment with the determined Dominant_Pixel color.
