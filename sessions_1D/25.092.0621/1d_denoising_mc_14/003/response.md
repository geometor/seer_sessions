"""
Transforms a single-row input grid by identifying the contiguous segment of 
non-white (non-zero) pixels. Within this segment, it finds the most frequent 
color (the dominant color). It then creates an output grid where this entire 
segment is filled with the dominant color, leaving the original white (zero) 
pixels unchanged. The input and output grids are expected to be 2D NumPy arrays 
with shape (1, Width).
