**Perception of Task Elements**

The task operates on 1D sequences (rows) of colored pixels. Each input sequence consists of three main parts:
1.  Optional leading blocks of White (0) pixels.
2.  A central block containing predominantly one non-White color (the "main color"), interspersed with a few pixels of other non-White colors ("noise colors").
3.  Optional trailing blocks of White (0) pixels.

The transformation aims to "clean" the central non-White block. It identifies the most frequent non-White color within the input sequence and uses this color to replace *all* non-White pixels in the output. The White padding pixels remain unchanged in their positions. The length of the sequence is preserved.

**Facts**


```yaml
Data Representation:
  - Input: 1D array (sequence) of integers (colors).
  - Output: 1D array (sequence) of integers (colors) with the same length as the input.

Input Structure:
  - Contains segments of White pixels (value 0), typically at the beginning and/or end.
  - Contains a central segment of non-White pixels (values 1-9).

Central Segment Properties:
  - Composed mainly of one dominant non-White color.
  - May contain other non-White "noise" colors occurring less frequently.

Transformation:
  - Identify all non-White pixels in the input sequence.
  - Determine the color that appears most frequently among these non-White pixels (the "main color").
  - Create the output sequence by iterating through the input:
    - If an input pixel is White (0), the corresponding output pixel is White (0).
    - If an input pixel is non-White (1-9), the corresponding output pixel is the identified "main color".

Relationships:
  - The positions of White pixels are preserved between input and output.
  - All non-White pixels in the input are mapped to a single color (the main color) in the output.
  - The length of the sequence remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the input sequence and identify all pixels that are not White (value 0).
2.  Count the occurrences of each distinct non-White color found in step 1.
3.  Determine the non-White color that has the highest count (the "main color").
4.  Construct the output sequence, which will have the same length as the input sequence.
5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input sequence:
    a.  If the input pixel is White (0), place a White (0) pixel at the corresponding position in the output sequence.
    b.  If the input pixel is any non-White color (1-9), place the "main color" (determined in step 3) at the corresponding position in the output sequence.
6.  Return the constructed output sequence.
