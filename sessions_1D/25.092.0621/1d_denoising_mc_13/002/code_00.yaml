Data Representation:
  - Input: 2D numpy array representing a grid (observed shapes are (1, N)).
  - Output: 2D numpy array with the same shape as the input.

Objects:
  - Pixels: Cells in the grid with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
    - White Pixels: Value 0.
    - Non-White Pixels: Values 1-9.
  - Grid: The entire 2D array.

Properties:
  - Input Grid: Contains White pixels and potentially multiple different Non-White pixels.
  - Main Color: The specific Non-White color that appears most frequently across the entire input grid. If no Non-White pixels exist, this concept doesn't apply. If there's a tie for the most frequent color, the behavior isn't defined by these examples (though `Counter.most_common(1)` provides deterministic tie-breaking).
  - Output Grid: Contains White pixels in the same positions as the input. All positions that were Non-White in the input are filled with the Main Color in the output.

Actions/Transformation:
  - Identification: Locate all Non-White pixels within the input grid.
  - Counting: Count the frequency of each distinct Non-White color value identified.
  - Determination: Find the Non-White color with the maximum frequency (Main Color).
  - Preservation: Maintain the locations and values of all White pixels from the input to the output.
  - Replacement: In the output grid, replace the value of every pixel that was Non-White in the input grid with the determined Main Color.
  - Handling Empty Case: If the input grid contains only White pixels, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.
