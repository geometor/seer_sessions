Optional leading blocks of White (0) pixels.\n2.  A central block containing predominantly one non-White color (the \"main color\"), interspersed with a few pixels of other non-White colors (\"noise colors\").\n3.  Optional trailing blocks of White (0) pixels.\n\nThe transformation aims to \"clean\" the central non-White block. It identifies the most frequent non-White color within the input sequence and uses this color to replace *all* non-White pixels in the output. The White padding pixels remain unchanged in their positions. The length of the sequence is preserved.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
