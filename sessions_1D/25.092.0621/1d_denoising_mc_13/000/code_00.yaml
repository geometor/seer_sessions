Data Representation:
  - Input: 1D array (sequence) of integers (colors).
  - Output: 1D array (sequence) of integers (colors) with the same length as the input.

Input Structure:
  - Contains segments of White pixels (value 0), typically at the beginning and/or end.
  - Contains a central segment of non-White pixels (values 1-9).

Central Segment Properties:
  - Composed mainly of one dominant non-White color.
  - May contain other non-White "noise" colors occurring less frequently.

Transformation:
  - Identify all non-White pixels in the input sequence.
  - Determine the color that appears most frequently among these non-White pixels (the "main color").
  - Create the output sequence by iterating through the input:
    - If an input pixel is White (0), the corresponding output pixel is White (0).
    - If an input pixel is non-White (1-9), the corresponding output pixel is the identified "main color".

Relationships:
  - The positions of White pixels are preserved between input and output.
  - All non-White pixels in the input are mapped to a single color (the main color) in the output.
  - The length of the sequence remains constant.
