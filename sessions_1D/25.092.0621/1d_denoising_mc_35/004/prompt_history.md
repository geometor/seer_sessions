Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples present grids, although displayed linearly. Based on the context of ARC, these are likely 1D grids or very narrow 2D grids. The lengths vary between examples (33, 33, 30).
2.  **Color Palette:** Colors used include white (0), blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6), orange (7), and azure (8).
3.  **Input Composition:** Each input grid consists primarily of two parts:
    *   A background color, which is white (0) in all examples, appearing at the start and/or end.
    *   A central contiguous block of non-background colors.
4.  **Central Block:** This block has one color that appears most frequently (the "dominant" color). Within this block, there can be one or more pixels of different non-background colors ("intruder" pixels).
    *   Example 1: Dominant = azure (8), Intruders = blue (1), orange (7).
    *   Example 2: Dominant = yellow (4), Intruders = orange (7), magenta (6).
    *   Example 3: Dominant = orange (7), Intruders = green (3), yellow (4).
5.  **Output Composition:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. The background pixels remain unchanged. The central block is modified.
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens within the central block. All pixels within this block, including the original "intruder" pixels, are set to the dominant color of that block identified in the input. The block becomes uniformly colored with its dominant color.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Homogenize Central Block

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 1D array of pixels.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Central_Block:
      - Definition: A contiguous sequence of non-background pixels.
      - Properties:
          - Contains multiple colors.
          - Has a dominant color (most frequent color within the block).
  - Intruder_Pixels:
      - Definition: Pixels within the Central_Block whose color is not the dominant color.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Background_Pixels: Unchanged from input.
  - Central_Block:
      - Definition: Occupies the same position/indices as the input Central_Block.
      - Properties:
          - Uniformly colored.
          - Color is the dominant color identified in the input Central_Block.

Transformation_Steps:
  1. Identify the background color (white, 0).
  2. Locate the start and end indices of the Central_Block (the contiguous non-background segment).
  3. Analyze the colors within the input Central_Block to find the dominant (most frequent) color.
  4. Create the output grid.
  5. Copy the background pixels from the input to the output.
  6. Fill the pixels in the output grid corresponding to the Central_Block's indices entirely with the determined dominant color.

Relationships:
  - The Central_Block is defined by non-background pixels.
  - Intruder_Pixels exist only within the Central_Block.
  - The output Central_Block's color is determined by the frequency analysis of the input Central_Block.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the background color (which is white, color 0).
3.  Find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-background pixels (the "central block").
4.  Extract the sequence of colors corresponding to this central block from the input grid.
5.  Determine the most frequent color within this extracted sequence (the "dominant color").
6.  Iterate through the indices from the start to the end of the central block (inclusive).
7.  For each index within this range, set the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to the dominant color found in step 5.
8.  Leave all pixels outside this range (the background pixels) unchanged from the initial copy.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
