            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous execution failed with a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'`, likely because the `collections.Counter` received elements that were NumPy arrays instead of integers. This typically happens if the input structure processed by `numpy.array()` results in a 2D array (e.g., shape `(1, N)` or `(N, 1)`) and subsequent slicing or iteration yields array objects. The `tool_code` simulation, however, confirmed the core logic is correct when the input is treated strictly as a 1D list of integers.\n\nThe most probable cause is that the test environment provides the input as a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[0, 0, 8, ...]]`), which `np.array()` interprets as a 2D array of shape `(1, N)`.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the code to handle this potential 2D representation of effectively 1D data:\n1.  Convert input to NumPy array.\n2.  Record the original shape.\n3.  Flatten the array for processing.\n4.  Apply the original logic (find block, find dominant color, replace block).\n5.  Reshape the result back to the original shape before returning it as a list/list of lists.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe `tool_code` simulation, assuming 1D list inputs, yielded the following:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input/Output Length: 33\n    *   Non-Background Block: Indices 4-29 (inclusive)\n    *   Dominant Color in Block: 8 (Counts: {8: 23, 1: 2, 7: 1})\n    *   Simulated Output Correct: True\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input/Output Length: 33\n    *   Non-Background Block: Indices 4-25 (inclusive)\n    *   Dominant Color in Block: 4 (Counts: {4: 20, 7: 1, 6: 1})\n    *   Simulated Output Correct: True\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input/Output Length: 33\n    *   Non-Background Block: Indices 7-27 (inclusive)\n    *   Dominant Color in Block: 7 (Counts: {7: 19, 3: 1, 4: 1})\n    *   Simulated Output Correct: True\n\nThese metrics confirm the underlying transformation logic is sound for 1D data.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Convert the input grid (list or list of lists) to a NumPy array.\n  2. Store the original shape of the NumPy array.\n  3. Flatten the NumPy array into a 1D array for analysis.\n  4. Identify the background color (0).\n  5. Find the indices of all non-background pixels in the flattened array.\n  6. If no non-background pixels exist, convert the original NumPy array back to the required list format and return it.\n  7. Determine the start index (minimum non-background index) and end index (maximum non-background index) defining the span of the Target_Object in the flattened array.\n  8. Extract the values from the flattened array within this start-to-end index range (inclusive).\n  9. Calculate the frequency of each color in the extracted values and identify the dominant (most frequent) color.\n  10. Create a copy of the flattened array.\n  11. Modify the copied array by replacing all values from the start index to the end index (inclusive) with the dominant color.\n  12. Reshape the modified flattened array back to the original shape stored in step 2.\n  13. Convert the reshaped NumPy array back to the standard list/list of lists format required by ARC and return it.\n\nRelationships:\n  - The transformation preserves the grid's shape and background pixels.\n  - The transformation modifies only the pixels within the identified contiguous non-background block.\n  - The modification replaces all colors within that block with the single most frequent color from the original block.\n```"
