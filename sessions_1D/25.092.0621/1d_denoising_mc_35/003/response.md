"""
Identify the contiguous block of non-background (non-zero) pixels in a 1D list. 
Determine the most frequent color value (dominant color) within this block. 
Create an output list of the same dimensions where the elements corresponding 
to this block are all set to the identified dominant color, while the 
background (zero) pixels outside the block remain unchanged.
