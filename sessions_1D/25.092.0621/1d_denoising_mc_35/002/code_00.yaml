Task: Homogenize 1D Block

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 1D list of pixel color values (integers 0-9).
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Target_Block:
      - Definition: The single contiguous sequence of non-background (non-zero) pixels within the list.
      - Location: Identified by the start and end indices of the non-zero sequence.
      - Content: A list of pixel colors, potentially containing multiple different non-zero values.
  - Dominant_Color:
      - Definition: The color value that appears most frequently within the Target_Block.
  - Intruder_Pixels:
      - Definition: Pixels within the Target_Block whose color is not the Dominant_Color.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 1D list of the same length as the input grid.
  - Background_Pixels: Pixels outside the Target_Block's index range; remain unchanged from the input.
  - Target_Block:
      - Definition: Occupies the same index range (start to end) as the input Target_Block.
      - Content: All pixels within this range are set to the Dominant_Color identified from the input Target_Block.

Transformation_Steps:
  1. Receive the input 1D list (Grid).
  2. Identify the indices of all non-background (non-zero) pixels.
  3. If no non-background pixels exist, return the original Grid.
  4. Determine the start index (minimum index of non-background pixels) and end index (maximum index of non-background pixels). This defines the Target_Block range.
  5. Extract the sublist corresponding to the Target_Block range from the input Grid.
  6. Calculate the frequency of each color value within this extracted sublist.
  7. Identify the Dominant_Color (the color with the highest frequency). Handle ties if necessary (though not observed in examples, usually implies taking the smallest index color or similar rule, but most_common handles it implicitly by order).
  8. Create the output Grid, initially as a copy of the input Grid.
  9. Iterate through the indices from the start index to the end index (inclusive).
 10. For each index in this range, update the value in the output Grid to the Dominant_Color.
 11. Return the modified output Grid.

Relationships:
  - The Target_Block is defined by its start and end indices relative to the full Grid.
  - The Dominant_Color is derived solely from the pixel values within the input Target_Block.
  - The output Grid differs from the input Grid only within the Target_Block's index range.
