Based on the context of ARC, these are likely 1D grids or very narrow 2D grids. The lengths vary between examples (33, 33, 30).\n2.  **Color Palette:** Colors used include white (0), blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6), orange (7), and azure (8).\n3.  **Input Composition:** Each input grid consists primarily of two parts:\n    *   A background color, which is white (0) in all examples, appearing at the start and/or end.\n    *   A central contiguous block of non-background colors.\n4.  **Central Block:** This block has one color that appears most frequently (the \"dominant\" color). Within this block, there can be one or more pixels of different non-background colors (\"intruder\" pixels).\n    *   Example 1: Dominant = azure (8), Intruders = blue (1), orange (7).\n    *   Example 2: Dominant = yellow (4), Intruders = orange (7), magenta (6).\n    *   Example 3: Dominant = orange (7), Intruders = green (3), yellow (4).\n5.  **Output Composition:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. The background pixels remain unchanged. The central block is modified.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens within the central block. All pixels within this block, including the original \"intruder\" pixels, are set to the dominant color of that block identified in the input. The block becomes uniformly colored with its dominant color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
