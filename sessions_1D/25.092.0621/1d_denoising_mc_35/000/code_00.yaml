Task: Homogenize Central Block

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 1D array of pixels.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Central_Block:
      - Definition: A contiguous sequence of non-background pixels.
      - Properties:
          - Contains multiple colors.
          - Has a dominant color (most frequent color within the block).
  - Intruder_Pixels:
      - Definition: Pixels within the Central_Block whose color is not the dominant color.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Background_Pixels: Unchanged from input.
  - Central_Block:
      - Definition: Occupies the same position/indices as the input Central_Block.
      - Properties:
          - Uniformly colored.
          - Color is the dominant color identified in the input Central_Block.

Transformation_Steps:
  1. Identify the background color (white, 0).
  2. Locate the start and end indices of the Central_Block (the contiguous non-background segment).
  3. Analyze the colors within the input Central_Block to find the dominant (most frequent) color.
  4. Create the output grid.
  5. Copy the background pixels from the input to the output.
  6. Fill the pixels in the output grid corresponding to the Central_Block's indices entirely with the determined dominant color.

Relationships:
  - The Central_Block is defined by non-background pixels.
  - Intruder_Pixels exist only within the Central_Block.
  - The output Central_Block's color is determined by the frequency analysis of the input Central_Block.
