objects:
  - type: segment
    name: frame
    description: Contiguous sequences of white pixels (0) at the start and/or end of the grid row.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: beginning_and_or_end
  - type: segment
    name: central_content
    description: The single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels located between the start and end frames (if frames exist), or encompassing the entire row if no white pixels exist.
    properties:
      contains_multiple_colors: true (in input, potentially)
      contains_single_color: true (in output)
      dominant_color: The most frequent color pixel value within this segment in the input.
  - type: pixel
    name: non_dominant_pixel
    description: A pixel within the central_content segment whose color is not the dominant_color.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The central_content segment is bounded by frame segments (if present).
actions:
  - name: identify_frames_and_content
    description: Find the start and end indices of the single contiguous non-white pixel segment (central_content) in the grid row. The pixels outside this range form the frame(s).
  - name: determine_dominant_color
    description: Count the occurrences of each color within the identified central_content segment and find the color with the highest count.
  - name: homogenize_segment
    description: Replace the color of every pixel within the central_content segment with the determined dominant_color.
invariants:
  - The frame pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged.
  - The dimensions (shape) of the grid remain unchanged.
  - The start and end positions of the central_content segment remain unchanged.
variants:
  - The colors within the central_content segment change in the output (unless already homogeneous).
  - The specific dominant color varies between examples.
  - The specific non-dominant colors vary between examples.
  - The length and position of the central_content segment vary.
