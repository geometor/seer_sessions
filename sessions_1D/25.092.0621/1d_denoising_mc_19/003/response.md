Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (central content) in the input grid (assumed 1xN NumPy array), ignoring leading/trailing white pixels (frame). 
Determine the most frequent color (dominant color) within this central content. 
Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Then, replace all pixels within the central content segment of the output grid with the dominant color. Leave the frame pixels unchanged.
