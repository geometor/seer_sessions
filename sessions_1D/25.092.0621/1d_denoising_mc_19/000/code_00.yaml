task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
objects:
  - type: segment
    name: frame
    description: Sequences of white pixels (0) at the start and end of the grid.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: beginning and end
  - type: segment
    name: central_content
    description: The sequence of non-white pixels located between the start and end frames.
    properties:
      contains_multiple_colors: true (in input)
      contains_single_color: true (in output)
      dominant_color: The most frequent color within this segment in the input.
  - type: pixel
    name: intruder_pixel
    description: A pixel within the central_content segment whose color is not the dominant_color.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The central_content segment is located between the start and end frame segments.
actions:
  - name: identify_frame
    description: Locate the initial and final sequences of white pixels.
  - name: identify_central_content
    description: Isolate the segment of non-white pixels between the frames.
  - name: determine_dominant_color
    description: Find the most frequent color within the central_content segment.
  - name: replace_intruders
    description: Change the color of all intruder_pixels within the central_content segment to the dominant_color.
invariants:
  - The frame pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged.
  - The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.
  - The location of the central_content segment relative to the frames remains unchanged.
variants:
  - The colors within the central_content segment change.
  - The specific dominant color varies between examples (green, gray).
  - The specific intruder colors vary between examples.
