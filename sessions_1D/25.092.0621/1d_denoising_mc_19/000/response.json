            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example pair consists of a single input grid and a single output grid. Both input and output grids appear to be 1-dimensional arrays (or single rows).\n2.  **Framing:** The grids start and end with sequences of white pixels (0). These white pixels seem to act as a frame or padding and remain unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Central Segment:** Between the leading and trailing white pixels, there is a segment containing various colors.\n4.  **Dominant Color:** Within this central segment in the input, one color appears significantly more often than others. Let's call this the \"dominant color\".\n    *   Example 1: Dominant color is green (3).\n    *   Example 2: Dominant color is gray (5).\n    *   Example 3: Dominant color is green (3).\n5.  **Intruder Pixels:** Other colors appear sporadically within this central segment.\n    *   Example 1: Intruders are gray (5) and magenta (6).\n    *   Example 2: Intruder is yellow (4).\n    *   Example 3: Intruders are magenta (6) and blue (1).\n6.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the dominant non-white color within the central segment of the input grid. It then replaces all other non-white pixels within that segment with the dominant color. The surrounding white pixels are untouched.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
