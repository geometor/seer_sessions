            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input `input_grid` was a 1D list of pixel values. The error message, \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous,\" indicates that the code was trying to perform a comparison (like `pixel != 0`) on an entire list or array (likely a row of the grid) instead of an individual integer pixel value. This happens when iterating over a 2D structure (list of lists or numpy array) and treating each element (which is a row) as a single pixel value.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously \u2013 finding the most frequent non-white (non-zero) color across the entire grid and replacing all non-white pixels with this dominant color, while leaving white (zero) pixels unchanged \u2013 appears to be correct based on the input/output pairs.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the error is to modify the implementation to correctly handle 2D grid structures (lists of lists or numpy arrays). This involves iterating through both rows and columns to access individual pixel values for analysis and transformation.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nTo confirm the transformation logic, we analyze the pixel data provided (treating them as collections of pixels from potentially 2D grids):\n"
