task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D (assumed based on ARC standard and error message)
  pixels: integers 0-9 representing colors
components:
  - type: background_pixel
    value: 0 (white)
    role: static, remains unchanged in position and value.
  - type: foreground_pixel
    value: 1-9 (any non-white color)
    role: dynamic, subject to color replacement.
transformation:
  scope: applies to the entire grid globally
  steps:
    - action: collection
      target: all pixels in the input grid
      filter: keep only non-white pixels (value 1-9)
    - action: frequency_analysis
      target: collected non-white pixels
      details: count occurrences of each color value.
    - action: identification
      target: frequency counts
      details: determine the color value with the highest count (dominant color). If no non-white pixels exist, this step is skipped.
    - action: grid_construction (output grid)
      based_on: input grid dimensions and dominant color
      details:
        - iterate through each cell (row, column) of the input grid.
        - if input pixel at (row, column) is white (0), place white (0) in the output grid at (row, column).
        - if input pixel at (row, column) is non-white (1-9), place the determined dominant color in the output grid at (row, column).
        - if no dominant color was determined (no non-white input pixels), the output grid is identical to the input grid.
relationships:
  - the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - the position of white pixels is preserved.
  - the position of non-white areas is preserved, but their color is homogenized to the single dominant color from the input.
  - the transformation depends on the global frequency of colors, not local patterns.
