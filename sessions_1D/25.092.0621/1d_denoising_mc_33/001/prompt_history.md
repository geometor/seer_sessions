Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**
The input and output are both single rows (1xN grids). They appear to represent a sequence of colored pixels, potentially a line or a 1D pattern.

*   **Input Structure:** The input consists of a central sequence of colored pixels flanked by white (`0`) pixels at the beginning and end. Within the central sequence, one color is clearly dominant (appears most frequently), while other colors appear sporadically as single "impurity" pixels.
*   **Output Structure:** The output mirrors the input structure in terms of dimensions and the flanking white pixels. However, the central sequence has been homogenized: all the "impurity" pixels have been replaced by the dominant color identified in the input.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the most frequent color (excluding white padding) in the input sequence and then replacing all other non-white pixels with this dominant color. The white padding pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Normalize a color sequence by replacing non-dominant, non-padding colors with the dominant color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: Both input and output are 1xN grids (single rows).
    properties:
      - structure: 1D array of colors (integers 0-9).
      - padding: Starts and ends with white pixels (0).

  - element: dominant_color_block
    description: The longest contiguous or most frequent sequence of a single color within the non-padding part of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: The color value that appears most frequently in the input, excluding white (0).
      - role: Defines the target color for normalization in the output.

  - element: impurity_pixels
    description: Pixels within the non-padding part of the input grid whose color is neither white (0) nor the dominant color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (0) and the dominant color.
      - quantity: Typically appear infrequently, often as single pixels.
      - location: Interspersed within the dominant color block.

  - element: padding_pixels
    description: White pixels (0) located at the start and end of the input/output grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: Demarcate the boundaries of the active color sequence. Remain unchanged during the transformation.

actions:
  - action: identify_dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the white (0) padding pixels.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - dominant_color

  - action: normalize_sequence
    description: Iterate through the input grid. Replace any pixel that is not white (0) and not the dominant color with the dominant color. Keep white (0) pixels and dominant color pixels unchanged.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - dominant_color
    outputs:
      - output_grid

relationships:
  - relationship: replacement
    description: Impurity pixels in the input are replaced by the dominant color in the output.
    between:
      - impurity_pixels
      - dominant_color_block

  - relationship: persistence
    description: Dominant color pixels and padding pixels maintain their color and position from input to output.
    between:
      - dominant_color_block
      - padding_pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Examine the pixels in the input grid, ignoring any leading or trailing white (`0`) pixels.
3.  Count the occurrences of each non-white color in this central section.
4.  Identify the color that occurs most frequently; this is the "dominant color".
5.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid:
    *   If the input pixel is white (`0`), copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output grid.
    *   If the input pixel's color matches the identified dominant color, copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output grid.
    *   If the input pixel's color is *not* white (`0`) and *not* the dominant color (i.e., it's an "impurity"), place the dominant color into the corresponding position in the output grid.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
