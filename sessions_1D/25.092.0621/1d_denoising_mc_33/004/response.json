The function's validation check `len(input_grid) != 1` would fail if passed a flat list, leading to the warning and returning `[]`, which subsequently causes index errors in the testing harness comparing the empty list to the expected output list.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a flat list (representing the single row) as input and return a flat list as output.\n2.  Adjust helper functions accordingly if needed (though `find_non_white_segment` and `find_dominant_color` already work with flat lists).\n3.  Re-verify the logic against all examples with the corrected data format assumption.\n4.  Update the documentation (YAML, Natural Language Program) to reflect the flat list input/output format.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
