task_description: Homogenize the colors within the central non-white segment of a single-row grid (represented as a flat list) by replacing all pixels in that segment with the segment's most frequent color. White (0) padding pixels remain unchanged.

elements:
  - element: input_row
    description: A flat list of integers (0-9) representing a single row of pixels.
    properties:
      - length: Variable (e.g., 32 in examples).
      - structure: 1D list.
      - format: Flat list (e.g., [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0]).

  - element: output_row
    description: A flat list representing the transformed row.
    properties:
      - length: Same as input_row.
      - structure: 1D list.
      - format: Flat list.

  - element: active_segment
    description: The contiguous sub-list within the input_row containing all non-white (non-zero) pixels and any white pixels potentially interspersed between them. It starts at the first non-white pixel and ends at the last non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - boundaries: Defined by the indices of the first and last non-white pixels.
      - content: Contains the core pattern/sequence to be normalized.

  - element: padding_pixels
    description: White pixels (0) located at the start and/or end of the input/output row, outside the active_segment.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: Demarcate the boundaries. Remain unchanged during transformation.
      - location: Before the start index and after the end index of the active_segment.

  - element: dominant_color
    description: The color (non-zero integer) that appears most frequently within the active_segment of the input_row.
    properties:
      - role: The target color for homogenization within the active_segment.
      - determination: Based on frequency count of non-zero pixels within the active_segment.

  - element: impurity_pixels
    description: Pixels within the active_segment of the input_row whose color is neither white (0) nor the dominant color.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-zero color other than the dominant color.
      - location: Within the active_segment.
      - fate: Replaced by the dominant_color in the output_row.

actions:
  - action: identify_active_segment
    description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous block encompassing the first to the last non-white pixel in the input row.
    inputs:
      - input_row (flat list)
    outputs:
      - start_index
      - end_index (exclusive)

  - action: identify_dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent non-zero color within the specified active_segment of the input row.
    inputs:
      - input_row (flat list)
      - start_index
      - end_index
    outputs:
      - dominant_color (integer or None)

  - action: normalize_segment
    description: Create the output row by copying the input row, then iterating through the active_segment (from start_index to end_index). If a pixel within this segment is not white (0) and not the dominant color, replace it with the dominant color. Pixels outside the segment (padding) and pixels that are already white or the dominant color remain unchanged.
    inputs:
      - input_row (flat list)
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - dominant_color
    outputs:
      - output_row (flat list)

relationships:
  - relationship: replacement
    description: Impurity pixels within the active segment in the input are replaced by the dominant color in the output segment.
    between:
      - impurity_pixels
      - dominant_color

  - relationship: persistence
    description: Dominant color pixels, white pixels within the active segment, and all padding pixels maintain their color and position from input to output.
    between:
      - dominant_color
      - padding_pixels
      - white pixels within active_segment
