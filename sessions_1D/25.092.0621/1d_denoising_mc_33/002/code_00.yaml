task_description: Normalize the colors within the central non-white segment of a single-row grid by replacing all pixels in that segment with the segment's most frequent color.
elements:
  - element: grid_row
    description: A 1xN grid representing a single row of pixels.
    properties:
      - type: list of integers (0-9)
      - structure: Contains a central segment of non-white pixels potentially flanked by leading/trailing white (0) pixels.

  - element: padding_pixels
    description: White pixels (0) located at the start and/or end of the grid row, outside the main color sequence.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: Delimit the active segment. Remain unchanged in the output.

  - element: active_segment
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence of the grid row containing all non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - content: Contains one or more non-white pixels. May contain multiple different colors.
      - location: Bounded by the first and last non-white pixels in the row.

  - element: dominant_color
    description: The color that appears most frequently within the active_segment.
    properties:
      - type: integer (1-9)
      - role: Target color for normalization. Determined by frequency count within the active_segment.

  - element: non_dominant_pixels
    description: Pixels within the active_segment whose color is not the dominant_color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color (1-9) present in the active_segment that is not the dominant_color.
      - role: Pixels to be replaced.

actions:
  - action: identify_active_segment
    description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row.
    inputs:
      - grid_row
    outputs:
      - start_index
      - end_index

  - action: determine_dominant_color
    description: Count the frequency of each color within the identified active_segment and determine the most frequent one.
    inputs:
      - active_segment (derived from grid_row, start_index, end_index)
    outputs:
      - dominant_color

  - action: normalize_segment
    description: Create the output row by copying the input row, then iterating through the active_segment and replacing any pixel whose color is not the dominant_color with the dominant_color. Padding pixels remain unchanged.
    inputs:
      - grid_row
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - dominant_color
    outputs:
      - output_grid_row

relationships:
  - relationship: replacement
    description: Non-dominant pixels within the active_segment of the input are replaced by the dominant_color in the output.
    between:
      - non_dominant_pixels
      - dominant_color

  - relationship: persistence
    description: Dominant_color pixels within the active_segment and all padding_pixels maintain their color and position from input to output.
    between:
      - dominant_color pixels in active_segment
      - padding_pixels
