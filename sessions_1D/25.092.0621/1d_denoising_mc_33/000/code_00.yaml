task_description: Normalize a color sequence by replacing non-dominant, non-padding colors with the dominant color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: Both input and output are 1xN grids (single rows).
    properties:
      - structure: 1D array of colors (integers 0-9).
      - padding: Starts and ends with white pixels (0).

  - element: dominant_color_block
    description: The longest contiguous or most frequent sequence of a single color within the non-padding part of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: The color value that appears most frequently in the input, excluding white (0).
      - role: Defines the target color for normalization in the output.

  - element: impurity_pixels
    description: Pixels within the non-padding part of the input grid whose color is neither white (0) nor the dominant color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (0) and the dominant color.
      - quantity: Typically appear infrequently, often as single pixels.
      - location: Interspersed within the dominant color block.

  - element: padding_pixels
    description: White pixels (0) located at the start and end of the input/output grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: Demarcate the boundaries of the active color sequence. Remain unchanged during the transformation.

actions:
  - action: identify_dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the white (0) padding pixels.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - dominant_color

  - action: normalize_sequence
    description: Iterate through the input grid. Replace any pixel that is not white (0) and not the dominant color with the dominant color. Keep white (0) pixels and dominant color pixels unchanged.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - dominant_color
    outputs:
      - output_grid

relationships:
  - relationship: replacement
    description: Impurity pixels in the input are replaced by the dominant color in the output.
    between:
      - impurity_pixels
      - dominant_color_block

  - relationship: persistence
    description: Dominant color pixels and padding pixels maintain their color and position from input to output.
    between:
      - dominant_color_block
      - padding_pixels
