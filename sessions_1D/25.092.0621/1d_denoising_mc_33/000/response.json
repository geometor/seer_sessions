They appear to represent a sequence of colored pixels, potentially a line or a 1D pattern.\n\n*   **Input Structure:** The input consists of a central sequence of colored pixels flanked by white (`0`) pixels at the beginning and end. Within the central sequence, one color is clearly dominant (appears most frequently), while other colors appear sporadically as single \"impurity\" pixels.\n*   **Output Structure:** The output mirrors the input structure in terms of dimensions and the flanking white pixels. However, the central sequence has been homogenized: all the \"impurity\" pixels have been replaced by the dominant color identified in the input.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the most frequent color (excluding white padding) in the input sequence and then replacing all other non-white pixels with this dominant color. The white padding pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
