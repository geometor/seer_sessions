1.  Examine the input grid (a single row).
2.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
3.  Determine the dominant color within this non-white segment (the color that appears most frequently).
4.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
5.  Iterate through each pixel within the identified non-white segment in the output grid.
6.  If a pixel's color is *not* the dominant color and not white (0), change its color to the dominant color.
7.  Leave all white pixels and pixels already matching the dominant color unchanged.
8.  The resulting grid is the final output.
