Within this segment, there might be one or more pixels of different colors (outliers). The surrounding pixels are white (color 0). The transformation identifies the dominant color within the non-white segment and replaces all outlier pixels within that segment with the dominant color. The white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
