task_type: single_row_transformation
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensionality: 1D (single row)
      height: 1
      width: variable (e.g., 32 in examples)
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      dominant_color: The most frequent color within the non-white segment.
      location: Between potential leading/trailing white pixels.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: An integer from 0-9.
      position: Index within the row.
  - type: outlier_pixel
    description: A pixel within the non-white segment whose color is different from the dominant color.
actions:
  - identify_dominant_color: Find the most frequent non-white color in the row.
  - replace_outliers: Change the color of outlier pixels within the non-white segment to the dominant color.
relationships:
  - outlier_pixels belong to the non-white segment.
  - the dominant_color is determined by the pixels within the non-white segment.
invariance:
  - White pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.
  - Pixels matching the dominant color within the non-white segment remain unchanged.
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
