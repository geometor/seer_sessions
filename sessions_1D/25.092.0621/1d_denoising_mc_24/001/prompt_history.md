Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of a single row of pixels (a 1xN grid).
2.  **Color Usage:** The grids use multiple colors. There's typically a dominant color (like maroon in example 1, gray in example 2, green in example 3) that forms a large contiguous block. There are also white (0) pixels, usually at the ends. Within the dominant color block, there are a few "impurity" pixels of different colors (red/orange in example 1, green/yellow/maroon in example 2, magenta in example 3).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the dominant color (excluding white) and then replacing the "impurity" pixels within that dominant block with the dominant color itself. The white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: color_replacement
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are 1xN grids

elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (0-9)
      - position: (row, col) # Though only col matters here as row is always 0

objects:
  - type: dominant_color_block
    description: The largest contiguous block of a single color, excluding white (0).
    properties:
      - color: The most frequent color in the input grid, ignoring white (0) pixels. Let's call this 'dominant_color'.
  - type: impurity_pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is neither white (0) nor the 'dominant_color'.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except 0 and 'dominant_color'.
      - location: Typically found within or adjacent to the dominant_color_block.
  - type: background_pixel
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - location: Often found at the beginning or end of the row.

actions:
  - name: identify_dominant_color
    input: input_grid
    output: dominant_color
    logic: Count the frequency of each color in the input grid, excluding white (0). The color with the highest frequency is the 'dominant_color'.
  - name: replace_impurity_pixels
    input:
      - input_grid
      - dominant_color
    output: output_grid
    logic: Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel's color is not white (0) and not the 'dominant_color', change its color to the 'dominant_color'. Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color.

relationships:
  - type: transformation_target
    description: Impurity pixels are the targets of the transformation.
  - type: transformation_result
    description: Impurity pixels are replaced by the dominant color.
  - type: invariance
    description: White (0) pixels and pixels already matching the dominant color remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Analyze the input grid to determine the frequency of each color, ignoring any white (0) pixels.
2.  Identify the color with the highest frequency among the non-white pixels. This is the "dominant color".
3.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid.
4.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
5.  For each pixel, check its color:
    *   If the pixel's color is white (0), keep it as white (0) in the new grid.
    *   If the pixel's color is the same as the "dominant color", keep it as the "dominant color" in the new grid.
    *   If the pixel's color is *neither* white (0) *nor* the "dominant color", change its color to the "dominant color" in the new grid.
6.  The resulting new grid is the output.
