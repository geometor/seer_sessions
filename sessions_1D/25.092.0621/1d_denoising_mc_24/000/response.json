There's typically a dominant color (like maroon in example 1, gray in example 2, green in example 3) that forms a large contiguous block. There are also white (0) pixels, usually at the ends. Within the dominant color block, there are a few \"impurity\" pixels of different colors (red/orange in example 1, green/yellow/maroon in example 2, magenta in example 3).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the dominant color (excluding white) and then replacing the \"impurity\" pixels within that dominant block with the dominant color itself. The white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
