task_type: color_replacement
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are 1xN grids

elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (0-9)
      - position: (row, col) # Though only col matters here as row is always 0

objects:
  - type: dominant_color_block
    description: The largest contiguous block of a single color, excluding white (0).
    properties:
      - color: The most frequent color in the input grid, ignoring white (0) pixels. Let's call this 'dominant_color'.
  - type: impurity_pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is neither white (0) nor the 'dominant_color'.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except 0 and 'dominant_color'.
      - location: Typically found within or adjacent to the dominant_color_block.
  - type: background_pixel
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - location: Often found at the beginning or end of the row.

actions:
  - name: identify_dominant_color
    input: input_grid
    output: dominant_color
    logic: Count the frequency of each color in the input grid, excluding white (0). The color with the highest frequency is the 'dominant_color'.
  - name: replace_impurity_pixels
    input:
      - input_grid
      - dominant_color
    output: output_grid
    logic: Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel's color is not white (0) and not the 'dominant_color', change its color to the 'dominant_color'. Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color.

relationships:
  - type: transformation_target
    description: Impurity pixels are the targets of the transformation.
  - type: transformation_result
    description: Impurity pixels are replaced by the dominant color.
  - type: invariance
    description: White (0) pixels and pixels already matching the dominant color remain unchanged.
