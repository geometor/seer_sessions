Data:
  Type: 1D array of integers (representing colors)
  Structure: Contains leading zeros, a central segment of non-zero values, and trailing zeros.
Objects:
  - Type: Segment
    Description: A contiguous block of non-zero pixels.
    Properties:
      - DominantColor: The color of the first pixel in the segment.
      - ImpurityPixels: Pixels within the segment whose color is non-zero and not the DominantColor.
      - FlankingPixels: Zero-valued pixels appearing before and after the segment.
Actions:
  - Name: IdentifySegment
    Input: Input array
    Output: Start index, End index, DominantColor
  - Name: ReplaceImpurities
    Input: Input array, Start index, End index, DominantColor
    Output: Modified array
    Rule: Iterate from Start index to End index. If a pixel's color is not zero and not DominantColor, change its color to DominantColor.
Relationships:
  - The transformation preserves the position and color of the FlankingPixels.
  - The transformation targets only the ImpurityPixels within the Segment.
  - The DominantColor determines the replacement color for ImpurityPixels.
