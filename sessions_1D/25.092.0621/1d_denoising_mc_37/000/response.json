Given their appearance, treating them as 1D arrays seems appropriate.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), magenta (6), and maroon (9).\n3.  **Structure:** Each example features a central contiguous segment of non-white pixels, flanked by white pixels (0) on both ends.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens within the non-white segment. Some pixels within this segment change their color in the output.\n5.  **Pattern:** In each example, the non-white segment has a primary or \"dominant\" color (red in example 1, magenta in example 2, blue in example 3). Other non-white, non-dominant colors (impurities) also appear within this segment (maroon in example 1; green, red, maroon in example 2; red, green, maroon in example 3). The transformation replaces these impurity pixels with the dominant color, making the non-white segment uniformly colored with the dominant color. The flanking white pixels remain unchanged.\n6.  **Dominant Color Identification:** The dominant color consistently appears to be the color of the *first* non-white pixel encountered when scanning the input from left to right.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Note its start and end positions.\n3.  Determine the \"dominant color\" for this segment, which is the color of the first pixel within the identified segment (the first non-zero pixel encountered from the start of the array).\n4.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output array.\n5.  Iterate through the pixels within the identified non-zero segment (from the start position to the end position) in the output array.\n6.  For each pixel within the segment, check if its color is *not* zero (non-white) and also *not* equal to the dominant color.\n7.  If a pixel meets these conditions (it's a non-dominant, non-white color, i.e., an \"impurity\"), change its color in the output array to the dominant color.\n8.  Leave all other pixels (zero pixels and pixels already having the dominant color) unchanged.\n9.  Return the modified output array."
