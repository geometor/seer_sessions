```python
"""
Transform a 1D sequence (list or numpy array) of color values based on the following rule:
1. Identify the contiguous segment of non-zero (non-white) pixels.
2. Determine the "dominant color", which is the color of the first pixel in this segment.
3. Iterate through the segment. Replace any pixel within the segment that is non-zero and not the dominant color with the dominant color.
4. Leave all zero (white) pixels and pixels already matching the dominant color unchanged.
