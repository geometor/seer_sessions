Data:
  Type: Sequence of integers (representing colors), likely provided as a 1D NumPy array or potentially a 2D (1xN) NumPy array.
  Structure: Contains optional leading zero(s), a central contiguous segment of non-zero values, and optional trailing zero(s). Assumed to be only one such non-zero segment per sequence.
Objects:
  - Type: Segment
    Description: The contiguous block of non-zero pixels within the sequence.
    Properties:
      - StartIndex: The index of the first non-zero pixel.
      - EndIndex: The index of the last non-zero pixel.
      - DominantColor: The color (integer value) of the pixel at StartIndex.
      - ImpurityPixels: Pixels within the segment [StartIndex, EndIndex] whose color is non-zero and not the DominantColor.
  - Type: BackgroundPixels
    Description: Pixels with zero value, located before StartIndex and after EndIndex.
Actions:
  - Name: FindSegment
    Input: Input sequence
    Output: StartIndex, EndIndex, DominantColor
    Rule: Scan the sequence to find the first non-zero value (DominantColor at StartIndex). Scan from the end to find the last non-zero value (at EndIndex). Handle cases with no non-zero values.
  - Name: ReplaceImpurities
    Input: Sequence, StartIndex, EndIndex, DominantColor
    Output: Modified sequence
    Rule: Iterate through the sequence from StartIndex to EndIndex. If a pixel's value is non-zero and not equal to DominantColor, change its value to DominantColor.
Relationships:
  - BackgroundPixels remain unchanged.
  - Pixels within the Segment that initially match the DominantColor also remain unchanged.
  - The length and overall structure (positions of zero vs. non-zero elements) of the sequence are preserved, only the values of ImpurityPixels change.
Pre-computation/Analysis:
  - Ensure the input data is treated as a 1D sequence for processing, regardless of initial format (e.g., flatten if necessary).
