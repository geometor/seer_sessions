- task: Fill in interruptions in a sequence with the dominant color.
- entities:
    - Row: A 1-dimensional sequence of pixels.
    - Segment: A contiguous subsequence of non-white pixels within a row.
    - Pixel: An individual element in the row with a color value (0-9).
    - Color:
        - White (0): Appears as background/padding, remains unchanged.
        - Non-white (1-9): Constitute the active segment.
- properties:
    - Dominant Color: The most frequent non-white color within the non-white segment of the input row.
    - Interrupting Color: Any non-white color within the segment that is not the Dominant Color.
    - Position: The index of a pixel within the row.
- relationships:
    - A Segment is bounded by white pixels or the row ends.
    - Interrupting Color pixels are located within the Segment.
- actions:
    - Identify: Locate the non-white Segment within the input row.
    - Analyze: Count the frequency of each non-white color within the Segment to find the Dominant Color.
    - Transform: Iterate through the Segment in the input row. If a pixel's color is an Interrupting Color, change its color to the Dominant Color in the output row.
    - Preserve: Keep white pixels and pixels with the Dominant Color unchanged from input to output.
