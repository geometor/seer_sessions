White (0) pixels appear at the beginning and/or end, seemingly acting as a background or padding.\n2.  **Core Pattern:** Each input row contains a central segment of non-white pixels. Within this segment, one color appears significantly more frequently than others. There are also a few pixels of different colors scattered within this dominant color sequence.\n3.  **Transformation:** The output row modifies the central non-white segment. The pixels that were *not* the dominant color in the input's central segment are changed *to* the dominant color in the output. The dominant color pixels and the surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Dominant Color Identification:** The dominant color seems to be determined by finding the most frequent non-white color within the non-white segment of the input row.\n5.  **Scope:** The transformation appears to operate independently on each row (or 1xN grid) provided.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
