This color is immediately adjacent to the leading and trailing `0`s.\n5.  **Embedded Colors:** Other colors are sometimes embedded within this central segment.\n6.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying the central non-zero segment and replacing all pixels within that segment with the dominant boundary color. The leading and trailing `0`s remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
