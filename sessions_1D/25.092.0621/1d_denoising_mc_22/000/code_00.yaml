task_description: Fill a contiguous segment of non-background pixels with its boundary color.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or single-row 2D)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_segment
    description: A sequence of non-background (non-zero) pixels bordered by background (zero) pixels.
    properties:
      - boundary_color: The color of the pixels at the start and end of the segment, immediately adjacent to the background pixels. In the provided examples, the start and end boundary colors are the same.
      - embedded_colors: Other colors present within the segment, different from the boundary color.
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    input: input_grid
    output: start_index, end_index of the non-background segment
  - name: identify_boundary_color
    input: input_grid, start_index
    output: boundary_color (color at start_index)
  - name: fill_segment
    input: output_grid (initially copy of input), start_index, end_index, boundary_color
    output: modified_output_grid
    effect: Sets all pixels from start_index to end_index (inclusive) in the output_grid to the boundary_color.
relationships:
  - The transformation preserves the background pixels (leading and trailing zeros).
  - The core transformation happens exclusively within the identified non-background segment.
  - All pixels within the segment in the output adopt the color found at the boundaries of the segment in the input.
