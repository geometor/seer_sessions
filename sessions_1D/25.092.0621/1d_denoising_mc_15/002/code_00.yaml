task_type: color_transformation
input_format: 2D_grid_of_integers (representing colors)
output_format: 2D_grid_of_integers (same dimensions as input)
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - coordinates (row, column)
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - definition: The minimal bounding box containing all non-background (non-zero) pixels.
      - pixels: All pixels within the bounding box coordinates.
      - dominant_color: The most frequent color value among all pixels within the segment's bounding box in the input grid.
      - impurity_colors: Other color values present within the segment's bounding box.
relationships:
  - description: Pixels outside the segment's bounding box remain unchanged (retain background color).
  - description: Pixels inside the segment's bounding box are affected by the transformation.
transformation:
  - action: identify_segment_bounds
    target: input_grid
    method: Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing non-zero pixels.
    result: Bounding box coordinates (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
  - action: extract_segment_pixels
    source: input_grid
    using: bounding_box_coordinates
    result: A list or array of all pixel values within the bounding box.
  - action: determine_dominant_color
    source: extracted_segment_pixels
    method: Find the most frequent color value in the list/array.
  - action: fill_segment
    target: output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
    using: bounding_box_coordinates, dominant_color
    rule: Set the color of all pixels within the bounding box in the output grid to the dominant_color.
