The `Counter` function in Python requires hashable keys (like integers or strings), but it seems to have received NumPy arrays, which suggests the input data is structured as a 2D grid (an array of arrays or list of lists).\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the input/output structure as 2D grids. The \"segment\" of non-white pixels is likely a rectangular subgrid or a connected component within the larger grid. The core logic remains similar: identify this segment, find the dominant color within it, and fill the segment with that color, leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged.\n\n**Metrics and Verification:**\n\nLet's verify the structure of the input data."
