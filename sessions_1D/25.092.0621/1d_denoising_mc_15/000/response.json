These appear unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Core Segment**: Between the leading and trailing white pixels, there's a segment of non-white pixels.\n4.  **Dominant Color**: Within this non-white segment, one color appears significantly more frequently than others. In Example 1, it's azure (8); in Example 2, it's green (3); in Example 3, it's blue (1).\n5.  **Impurity Pixels**: Scattered within the dominant color sequence are a few pixels of different colors (e.g., orange (7) in Example 1; blue (1), azure (8), yellow (4) in Example 2; orange (7), gray (5) in Example 3).\n6.  **Transformation**: The core transformation occurs within the non-white segment. All pixels within this segment, regardless of their original color, are changed to match the dominant color of that segment in the input. The white padding pixels remain untouched.\n\n**Facts (YAML Block):**\n\n"
