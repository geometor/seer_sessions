task_type: color_transformation
input_format: 1D_array_of_integers (representing colors)
output_format: 1D_array_of_integers (same dimensions as input)
elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - location: contiguous block of non-zero pixels
      - dominant_color: the most frequent color within the segment
      - impurity_colors: other colors present in the segment
relationships:
  - description: Pixels outside the non-zero segment remain unchanged.
  - description: Pixels inside the non-zero segment are affected by the transformation.
transformation:
  - action: identify_segment
    target: contiguous block of non-zero pixels
  - action: determine_dominant_color
    source: identified segment
    method: find the most frequent color value within the segment
  - action: replace_colors
    target: all pixels within the identified segment
    rule: change each pixel's color to the determined dominant_color
