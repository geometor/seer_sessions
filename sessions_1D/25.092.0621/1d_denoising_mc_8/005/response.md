Transformation Rule:

1.  Receive the input grid, expected to be a 2D NumPy array.
2.  Validate the input grid: If it's empty (size is 0), return an empty list `[]`.
3.  Determine the grid dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) from the array's shape.
4.  Check if the grid is a row vector (`H=1`, `W>0`) or a column vector (`H>0`, `W=1`).
5.  If it is a row vector, extract the first row as a 1D Python list (`linear_sequence`).
6.  If it is a column vector, extract the first column as a 1D Python list (`linear_sequence`).
7.  If it is neither a row nor a column vector (e.g., a multi-dimensional grid, a 1x1 grid, or degenerate), convert the input NumPy array to a list of lists and return it unchanged.
8.  Find the index of the first non-white (non-zero) pixel (`start_index`) and the last non-white pixel (`end_index`) in the `linear_sequence`.
9.  If no non-white pixels are found (`start_index` is None), convert the input NumPy array to a list of lists and return it unchanged.
10. Identify the `central_segment` of the `linear_sequence` (from `start_index` to `end_index` inclusive).
11. Count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color within this `central_segment`.
12. Determine the `dominant_color` (the color with the highest count).
13. Create a `new_central_segment` list with the same length as the original `central_segment`, filled entirely with the `dominant_color`.
14. Construct the `output_sequence` list by concatenating the portion of `linear_sequence` before `start_index`, the `new_central_segment`, and the portion of `linear_sequence` after `end_index`.
15. Create the `output_grid` (as a list of lists):
    *   If the input was a row vector, the `output_grid` is `[output_sequence]`.
    *   If the input was a column vector, the `output_grid` is `[[pixel] for pixel in output_sequence]`.
16. Return the `output_grid`.
