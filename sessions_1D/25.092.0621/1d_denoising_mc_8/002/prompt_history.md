Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Structure**: The inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (sequences) of colors (represented by integers 0-9).
2.  **Padding**: All examples show sequences starting and ending with white pixels (value 0). The number of leading and trailing white pixels varies but is preserved from input to output in each example.
3.  **Central Segment**: Between the leading and trailing white pixels, there is a sequence of non-white pixels. This central segment contains a mix of colors in the input.
4.  **Dominant Color**: Within the central segment of the input, one color appears significantly more often than others (azure '8' in train_1, maroon '9' in train_2 and train_3).
5.  **Transformation**: The core transformation happens within this central segment. In the output, all pixels within this segment are replaced by the single dominant color identified in the input's central segment. The leading and trailing white pixels remain unchanged.

Commonalities:
  Objects:
    - Input_Array: 1D sequence of colors.
    - Output_Array: 1D sequence of colors, same length as input.
    - White_Pixel: Color 0.
    - Non_White_Pixel: Colors 1-9.
    - Leading_White_Segment: Contiguous sequence of white pixels at the start. Can be empty.
    - Trailing_White_Segment: Contiguous sequence of white pixels at the end. Can be empty.
    - Central_Segment: Contiguous sequence of non-white pixels between leading and trailing white segments.
    - Dominant_Color: The color that appears most frequently within the input's Central_Segment.
  Relationships:
    - Input_Array consists of Leading_White_Segment + Central_Segment + Trailing_White_Segment.
    - Output_Array preserves the Leading_White_Segment and Trailing_White_Segment from the input.
    - The Output_Array's Central_Segment has the same length as the Input_Array's Central_Segment.
  Actions:
    - Identify the boundaries of the Central_Segment (first and last non-white pixel).
    - Calculate the frequency of each color within the input's Central_Segment.
    - Determine the Dominant_Color (color with highest frequency).
    - Construct the Output_Array by copying the Leading_White_Segment, creating a new Central_Segment filled entirely with the Dominant_Color, and copying the Trailing_White_Segment.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the leading sequence of white (0) pixels in the input array.
2.  Identify the trailing sequence of white (0) pixels in the input array.
3.  Define the "central segment" as the sequence of pixels located between the leading and trailing white pixels. If there are no leading or trailing white pixels, the entire array is the central segment. If the array contains only white pixels, there is no central segment.
4.  If a central segment exists:
    a.  Count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color within this central segment.
    b.  Determine the "dominant color," which is the color with the highest count. (Assume there's a unique dominant color based on examples).
    c.  Construct the output array by concatenating:
        i.  The original leading sequence of white pixels.
        ii. A new sequence of the same length as the original central segment, but filled entirely with the dominant color.
        iii. The original trailing sequence of white pixels.
5.  If no central segment exists (the input is all white pixels), the output is identical to the input.
```python
import collections

"""
Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input 1D array. This is the "central segment".
2. The parts of the array before and after this central segment (if they exist) consist solely of white (zero) pixels. These are the "leading white segment" and "trailing white segment".
3. Count the frequency of each color within the central segment of the input array.
4. Determine the "dominant color" - the color with the highest frequency in the central segment.
5. Construct the output array by:
    a. Copying the leading white segment from the input.
    b. Creating a new central segment of the same length as the original central segment, but filled entirely with the dominant color.
    c. Copying the trailing white segment from the input.
6. If the input array contains only white pixels (no central segment), the output is identical to the input.
