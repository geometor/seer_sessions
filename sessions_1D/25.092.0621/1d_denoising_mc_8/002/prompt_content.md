Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input 1D array. This is the "central segment".
2. The parts of the array before and after this central segment (if they exist) consist solely of white (zero) pixels. These are the "leading white segment" and "trailing white segment".
3. Count the frequency of each color within the central segment of the input array.
4. Determine the "dominant color" - the color with the highest frequency in the central segment.
5. Construct the output array by:
    a. Copying the leading white segment from the input.
    b. Creating a new central segment of the same length as the original central segment, but filled entirely with the dominant color.
    c. Copying the trailing white segment from the input.
6. If the input array contains only white pixels (no central segment), the output is identical to the input.
