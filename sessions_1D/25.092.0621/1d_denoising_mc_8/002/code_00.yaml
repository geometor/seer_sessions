Task: Homogenize central non-white segment of a 1D line within a 2D grid based on dominant color.

Input_Constraints:
  - Format: 2D grid (list of lists).
  - Dimensions: Examples provided are either 1xN or Nx1.
  - Color_Map: Standard ARC colors (0=white, 1-9=other colors).

Derived_Objects:
  - Grid: The input 2D list of lists.
  - Dimensions: Height (number of rows) and Width (number of columns) of the grid.
  - Is_Row_Vector: Boolean, true if Height is 1 and Width > 1.
  - Is_Column_Vector: Boolean, true if Width is 1 and Height > 1.
  - Linear_Sequence: A 1D list extracted from the grid.
    - If Is_Row_Vector, it's the first (only) row.
    - If Is_Column_Vector, it's the first (only) column (values extracted from each row).
  - Leading_White_Segment: Contiguous sequence of white pixels (0) at the start of the Linear_Sequence.
  - Trailing_White_Segment: Contiguous sequence of white pixels (0) at the end of the Linear_Sequence.
  - Central_Segment: Contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (1-9) in the Linear_Sequence, located between the leading and trailing white segments.
  - Dominant_Color: The color (1-9) that appears most frequently within the Central_Segment.

Relationships:
  - The Grid contains the Linear_Sequence.
  - Linear_Sequence = Leading_White_Segment + Central_Segment + Trailing_White_Segment.
  - The output grid has the same Dimensions as the input Grid.
  - The output Linear_Sequence = Leading_White_Segment + New_Central_Segment + Trailing_White_Segment.
  - New_Central_Segment has the same length as the original Central_Segment but contains only the Dominant_Color.

Actions:
  - Determine Grid Dimensions.
  - Check if the Grid is a Row_Vector or Column_Vector. Handle other cases (e.g., >1 row and >1 col, or 1x1) if necessary (though examples only show vectors).
  - Extract the Linear_Sequence based on whether it's a Row_Vector or Column_Vector.
  - Identify the start and end indices of the Central_Segment within the Linear_Sequence.
  - Handle the edge case where the Linear_Sequence contains only white pixels (no Central_Segment exists).
  - If a Central_Segment exists:
    - Count color frequencies within the Central_Segment.
    - Determine the Dominant_Color.
    - Create the New_Central_Segment filled with the Dominant_Color.
    - Construct the output Linear_Sequence.
  - Reconstruct the output Grid by placing the output Linear_Sequence back into the original 1xN or Nx1 structure.
  - If no Central_Segment existed, the output Grid is identical to the input Grid.
