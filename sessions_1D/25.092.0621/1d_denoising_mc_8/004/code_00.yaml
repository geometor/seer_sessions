Task: Homogenize central non-white segment of a line grid based on dominant color

Input_Format: 2D NumPy array representing a grid.
Output_Format: List of lists representing a grid.

Relevant_Input_Structures:
  - Row_Vector: Input grid shape is (1, W) where W > 0.
  - Column_Vector: Input grid shape is (H, 1) where H > 0.

Objects:
  - Input_Grid: The input 2D NumPy array.
  - Output_Grid: The transformed grid as a list of lists.
  - Linear_Sequence: A 1D list extracted from the Input_Grid if it's a Row_Vector or Column_Vector.
  - White_Pixel: Pixel value 0.
  - Non_White_Pixel: Pixel value > 0.
  - Leading_White_Segment: Contiguous sequence of White_Pixels at the start of the Linear_Sequence. Can be empty.
  - Trailing_White_Segment: Contiguous sequence of White_Pixels at the end of the Linear_Sequence. Can be empty.
  - Central_Segment: Contiguous sequence of pixels between Leading_White_Segment and Trailing_White_Segment in the Linear_Sequence. Contains at least one Non_White_Pixel.
  - Dominant_Color: The color (pixel value > 0) that appears most frequently within the Central_Segment. Assumed unique.

Relationships:
  - Input_Grid determines the Linear_Sequence.
  - Linear_Sequence consists of Leading_White_Segment + Central_Segment + Trailing_White_Segment.
  - Output_Grid dimensions match Input_Grid dimensions.
  - Output_Grid preserves the Leading_White_Segment and Trailing_White_Segment structure.
  - Output_Grid's Central_Segment has the same length as the Input_Grid's Central_Segment but is filled with the Dominant_Color.

Actions:
  - Check if Input_Grid is empty or invalid; if so, return a copy.
  - Check if Input_Grid represents a Row_Vector or Column_Vector based on its shape. If not, return a copy.
  - Extract the Linear_Sequence (as a list) from the Row_Vector or Column_Vector.
  - Find the start and end indices of the Central_Segment within the Linear_Sequence.
  - If no Central_Segment exists (all White_Pixels), return a copy of the Input_Grid (converted to list of lists if needed).
  - Count color frequencies within the Central_Segment to find the Dominant_Color.
  - Create a New_Central_Segment of the same length, filled with the Dominant_Color.
  - Construct the Output_Sequence by concatenating Leading_White_Segment + New_Central_Segment + Trailing_White_Segment.
  - Reconstruct the Output_Grid (list of lists) from the Output_Sequence, matching the original orientation (row or column).
