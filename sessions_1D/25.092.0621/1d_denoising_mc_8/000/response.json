The number of leading and trailing white pixels varies but is preserved from input to output in each example.\n3.  **Central Segment**: Between the leading and trailing white pixels, there is a sequence of non-white pixels. This central segment contains a mix of colors in the input.\n4.  **Dominant Color**: Within the central segment of the input, one color appears significantly more often than others (azure '8' in train_1, maroon '9' in train_2 and train_3).\n5.  **Transformation**: The core transformation happens within this central segment. In the output, all pixels within this segment are replaced by the single dominant color identified in the input's central segment. The leading and trailing white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
