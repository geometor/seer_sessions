      Trailing_White_Segment: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    Analysis:
      Central_Segment_Input_Colors: {8: 22, 2: 2, 9: 1}
      Dominant_Color: 8 (Azure)
      Action: Replace all pixels in the central segment with the dominant color (8).

      Trailing_White_Segment: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    Output:
      Length: 32
      Leading_White_Segment: [0]
      Central_Segment: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] # All Maroon (9)
      Trailing_White_Segment: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    Analysis:
      Central_Segment_Input_Colors: {9: 21, 2: 1, 6: 1, 3: 1}
      Dominant_Color: 9 (Maroon)
      Action: Replace all pixels in the central segment with the dominant color (9).

  - ID: train_3
    Input:
      Length: 32
      Leading_White_Segment: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      Central_Segment: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
      Trailing_White_Segment: [0, 0, 0, 0]
    Output:
      Length: 32
      Leading_White_Segment: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      Central_Segment: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] # All Maroon (9)
      Trailing_White_Segment: [0, 0, 0, 0]
    Analysis:
      Central_Segment_Input_Colors: {9: 18, 5: 1, 2: 1, 1: 1}
      Dominant_Color: 9 (Maroon)
      Action: Replace all pixels in the central segment with the dominant color (9).

Commonalities:
  Objects:
    - Input_Array: 1D sequence of colors.
    - Output_Array: 1D sequence of colors, same length as input.
    - White_Pixel: Color 0.
    - Non_White_Pixel: Colors 1-9.
    - Leading_White_Segment: Contiguous sequence of white pixels at the start. Can be empty.
    - Trailing_White_Segment: Contiguous sequence of white pixels at the end. Can be empty.
    - Central_Segment: Contiguous sequence of non-white pixels between leading and trailing white segments.
    - Dominant_Color: The color that appears most frequently within the input's Central_Segment.
  Relationships:
    - Input_Array consists of Leading_White_Segment + Central_Segment + Trailing_White_Segment.
    - Output_Array preserves the Leading_White_Segment and Trailing_White_Segment from the input.
    - The Output_Array's Central_Segment has the same length as the Input_Array's Central_Segment.
  Actions:
    - Identify the boundaries of the Central_Segment (first and last non-white pixel).
    - Calculate the frequency of each color within the input's Central_Segment.
    - Determine the Dominant_Color (color with highest frequency).
    - Construct the Output_Array by copying the Leading_White_Segment, creating a new Central_Segment filled entirely with the Dominant_Color, and copying the Trailing_White_Segment.
