Data:
  - type: 1D array (row)
  - content: integers 0-9 representing colors
Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - position: index in the array
  - type: Color Group
    properties:
      - color: the specific color value (1-9)
      - pixels: list of pixels with that color
      - frequency: count of pixels with that color
Relationships:
  - type: Frequency Comparison
    description: Counts of different non-white colors are compared to find the maximum.
  - type: Identity
    description: Pixels are compared to the dominant color and the white color (0).
Actions:
  - Identify Non-White Pixels: Filter out pixels with color 0.
  - Calculate Frequency: Count occurrences of each non-white color (1-9).
  - Determine Dominant Color: Find the non-white color with the highest frequency.
  - Replace Minority Colors: Iterate through the input array. If a pixel's color is not white (0) and not the dominant color, change its color to the dominant color.
  - Preserve White & Dominant: If a pixel's color is white (0) or already the dominant color, keep it unchanged.
Result:
  - A new 1D array where all non-white pixels are either the original dominant color or have been changed to the dominant color. White pixels remain the same.
