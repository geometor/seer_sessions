The transformation appears to operate on the entire row.\n\nKey observations across the examples:\n1.  **Color Homogenization:** The output row seems to be a modified version of the input row where some pixels have changed their color. Specifically, colors that are *not* white (0) and *not* the most frequent non-white color in the input are changed.\n2.  **Dominant Color:** There's a concept of a \"dominant\" non-white color within the input row. This dominant color is determined by frequency \u2013 it's the non-white color that appears most often.\n3.  **Target Color:** All non-white pixels that are *not* the dominant color are changed *to* the dominant color.\n4.  **White Preservation:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged throughout the transformation. They seem to act as padding or background and are not involved in the color replacement logic.\n\nIn essence, the task is to find the most common color (excluding white) in the input row and then \"paint over\" all other non-white pixels with this dominant color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create the output row by iterating through each pixel of the input row:\n    *   If the input pixel is white (color 0), copy it directly to the output row at the same position.\n    *   If the input pixel's color is the same as the dominant color identified in step 3, copy it directly to the output row at the same position.\n    *   If the input pixel's color is *not* white (color 0) and *not* the dominant color, replace it with the dominant color in the output row at the same position.\n5.
