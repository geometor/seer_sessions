Transforms an input 2D grid by identifying the most frequent non-white color (dominant color) across the entire grid. 
Then, creates an output grid where all pixels that were non-white and not the dominant color in the input are changed to the dominant color. 
White pixels (0) and pixels that already had the dominant color remain unchanged.
