Data:
  - type: 2D Grid
    properties:
      - height: Integer (observed: 1 in examples)
      - width: Integer (observed: 32 in examples)
      - cells: Contain integer values 0-9 representing colors
Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - location: (row, column) coordinates within the grid
  - type: Color Group (Grid-wide)
    properties:
      - color: the specific non-white color value (1-9)
      - pixels: list of pixel locations with that color
      - frequency: count of pixels with that color across the entire grid
Relationships:
  - type: Frequency Comparison (Grid-wide)
    description: Counts of different non-white colors across the entire grid are compared to find the maximum.
  - type: Identity
    description: A pixel's color is compared to the grid-wide dominant color and the white color (0).
Actions:
  - Identify All Non-White Pixels: Iterate through every cell of the 2D grid and collect the values of pixels with color != 0.
  - Calculate Grid-wide Frequency: Count occurrences of each distinct non-white color (1-9) found in the previous step.
  - Determine Grid-wide Dominant Color: Find the non-white color with the highest frequency count across the grid. Handle the case where no non-white pixels exist. (Tie-breaking rule still undefined by examples, assume `most_common` behavior is sufficient).
  - Create Output Grid: Initialize a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Apply Transformation Rule (Pixel-wise): Iterate through each cell (row, column) of the input grid:
      - If the input pixel's color is white (0), set the corresponding output pixel to white (0).
      - If the input pixel's color is the grid-wide dominant color, set the corresponding output pixel to the dominant color.
      - If the input pixel's color is non-white (not 0) and *not* the grid-wide dominant color, set the corresponding output pixel to the dominant color.
Result:
  - A new 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input, where all non-white pixels are colored with the single most frequent non-white color from the input grid. White pixels remain unchanged.
