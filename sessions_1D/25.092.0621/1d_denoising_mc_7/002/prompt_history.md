## Perception

The input and output data are represented as 1D arrays (single rows) of integers, where each integer corresponds to a specific color. The transformation appears to operate on the entire row.

Key observations across the examples:
1.  **Color Homogenization:** The output row seems to be a modified version of the input row where some pixels have changed their color. Specifically, colors that are *not* white (0) and *not* the most frequent non-white color in the input are changed.
2.  **Dominant Color:** There's a concept of a "dominant" non-white color within the input row. This dominant color is determined by frequency â€“ it's the non-white color that appears most often.
3.  **Target Color:** All non-white pixels that are *not* the dominant color are changed *to* the dominant color.
4.  **White Preservation:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged throughout the transformation. They seem to act as padding or background and are not involved in the color replacement logic.

In essence, the task is to find the most common color (excluding white) in the input row and then "paint over" all other non-white pixels with this dominant color.

## Facts


```yaml
Data:
  - type: 1D array (row)
  - content: integers 0-9 representing colors
Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - position: index in the array
  - type: Color Group
    properties:
      - color: the specific color value (1-9)
      - pixels: list of pixels with that color
      - frequency: count of pixels with that color
Relationships:
  - type: Frequency Comparison
    description: Counts of different non-white colors are compared to find the maximum.
  - type: Identity
    description: Pixels are compared to the dominant color and the white color (0).
Actions:
  - Identify Non-White Pixels: Filter out pixels with color 0.
  - Calculate Frequency: Count occurrences of each non-white color (1-9).
  - Determine Dominant Color: Find the non-white color with the highest frequency.
  - Replace Minority Colors: Iterate through the input array. If a pixel's color is not white (0) and not the dominant color, change its color to the dominant color.
  - Preserve White & Dominant: If a pixel's color is white (0) or already the dominant color, keep it unchanged.
Result:
  - A new 1D array where all non-white pixels are either the original dominant color or have been changed to the dominant color. White pixels remain the same.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input row and identify all pixels that are not white (color 0).
2.  Count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color found in step 1.
3.  Determine the "dominant color" which is the non-white color with the highest frequency count. (If there's a tie, the examples don't cover this, but assume any of the tied colors could be chosen or follow a specific tie-breaking rule if needed later).
4.  Create the output row by iterating through each pixel of the input row:
    *   If the input pixel is white (color 0), copy it directly to the output row at the same position.
    *   If the input pixel's color is the same as the dominant color identified in step 3, copy it directly to the output row at the same position.
    *   If the input pixel's color is *not* white (color 0) and *not* the dominant color, replace it with the dominant color in the output row at the same position.
5.  Return the completed output row.

Find the most frequent non-white color (dominant color) in the input row.
Create an output row by iterating through the input row. 
If a pixel is white (0) or the dominant color, keep its original color. 
If a pixel is non-white and not the dominant color, change its color to the dominant color.
White pixels (0) remain unchanged.
