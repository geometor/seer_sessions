"""
Find the most frequent non-white color (dominant color) in the input row.
Create an output row by iterating through the input row. 
If a pixel is white (0) or the dominant color, keep its original color. 
If a pixel is non-white and not the dominant color, change its color to the dominant color.
White pixels (0) remain unchanged.
