*   **Perception:** The input is a single row of pixels. It consists of white pixels (0) padding a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels. Within this non-white sequence, one color appears most frequently (the dominant color), while one or more other colors appear infrequently (intruder colors). The output is the same row, but with all intruder pixels within the non-white sequence replaced by the dominant color. The white padding pixels remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_transformation
    input_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    output_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    objects:
      - type: segment
        description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently within the segment.
          - intruder_colors: Colors within the segment that are not the dominant color.
      - type: padding
        description: White pixels (0) appearing at the beginning and/or end of the row, outside the non-white segment.
    actions:
      - name: identify_segment
        description: Locate the start and end indices of the non-white segment.
      - name: determine_dominant_color
        description: Count the occurrences of each non-white color within the segment and identify the color with the highest count.
      - name: replace_intruders
        description: Iterate through the pixels within the identified segment and change the color of any pixel that is not the dominant color to the dominant color.
    relationships:
      - The non-white segment is surrounded by padding pixels.
      - Intruder pixels are located within the non-white segment.
    transformation: The core transformation homogenizes the non-white segment by replacing all intruder colors with the dominant color, leaving the padding unchanged.

    ```

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input row. Ignore any leading or trailing white pixels (color 0).
    2.  Within this non-white segment, determine the dominant color by finding which non-white color appears most frequently.
    3.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
    4.  Iterate through the identified non-white segment in the output row.
    5.  For each pixel within this segment, set its color to the dominant color determined in step 2.
    6.  Leave the white padding pixels outside the segment unchanged in the output row.
    7.  Return the modified row as the output.
