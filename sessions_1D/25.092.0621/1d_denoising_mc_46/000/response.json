This region can be considered the main object.\n4.  **Impurities:** Within this main object, there are a few pixels of different colors (\"impurities\").\n    *   Train 1: maroon (9), orange (7 - two adjacent), yellow (4) impurities within the green (3) object.\n    *   Train 2: blue (1) impurity within the yellow (4) object.\n    *   Train 3: gray (5) impurity within the orange (7) object.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the main object (the large, predominantly single-colored region excluding the background). It determines the dominant color of this object. Then, it replaces all \"impurity\" pixels within that object with the object's dominant color, effectively making the object monochromatic. The background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
