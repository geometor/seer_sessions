**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 6x6 grids.
2.  **Background:** There's a consistent background color, white (0), appearing as borders (top and bottom rows in these examples).
3.  **Main Object:** Each input grid contains a large central region composed primarily of one color (green/3 in train_1, yellow/4 in train_2, orange/7 in train_3). This region can be considered the main object.
4.  **Impurities:** Within this main object, there are a few pixels of different colors ("impurities").
    *   Train 1: maroon (9), orange (7 - two adjacent), yellow (4) impurities within the green (3) object.
    *   Train 2: blue (1) impurity within the yellow (4) object.
    *   Train 3: gray (5) impurity within the orange (7) object.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the main object (the large, predominantly single-colored region excluding the background). It determines the dominant color of this object. Then, it replaces all "impurity" pixels within that object with the object's dominant color, effectively making the object monochromatic. The background pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Homogenize the color of the largest non-background object.

elements:
  - role: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: Typically forms borders or surrounds the main object.
      size: Variable, defines the area outside the main object(s).
  - role: main_object
    properties:
      identification: The largest contiguous group of non-background pixels.
      dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently within this object.
      structure: Can contain pixels of colors other than its dominant color ('impurities').
  - role: impurity_pixels
    properties:
      location: Within the boundaries of the main_object.
      color: Any color different from the main_object's dominant_color.

actions:
  - name: identify_background
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color (e.g., 0)
  - name: identify_main_object
    inputs: input_grid, background_color
    outputs: coordinates_of_main_object_pixels
    description: Find the largest contiguous object composed of non-background colors.
  - name: determine_dominant_color
    inputs: coordinates_of_main_object_pixels, input_grid
    outputs: dominant_color
    description: Find the most frequent color among the pixels identified as the main object.
  - name: replace_impurities
    inputs: input_grid, coordinates_of_main_object_pixels, dominant_color
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by changing the color of any pixel within the main object that is not the dominant color to the dominant color. Keep all other pixels (background and dominant color pixels within the object) the same.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: impurity_pixels
    object: main_object
  - type: exclusion
    subject: main_object
    object: background

constraints:
  - The grid size remains constant.
  - Background pixels are preserved.
  - Only pixels within the largest non-background object are potentially modified.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color (typically white/0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find all contiguous objects composed of non-background colors. Consider pixels connected horizontally or vertically as contiguous.
3.  Determine the largest of these objects based on the number of pixels it contains. This is the "main object".
4.  Analyze the colors of the pixels belonging to the main object and identify the most frequent color. This is the "dominant color".
5.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
6.  Iterate through each pixel identified as part of the main object in step 3.
7.  If a pixel's color within the main object is *not* the dominant color (identified in step 4), change its color in the output grid to the dominant color.
8.  Leave all background pixels and pixels within the main object that already match the dominant color unchanged.
9.  Return the modified grid as the output.
