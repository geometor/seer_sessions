task_description: Homogenize the color of the largest non-background object.

elements:
  - role: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: Typically forms borders or surrounds the main object.
      size: Variable, defines the area outside the main object(s).
  - role: main_object
    properties:
      identification: The largest contiguous group of non-background pixels.
      dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently within this object.
      structure: Can contain pixels of colors other than its dominant color ('impurities').
  - role: impurity_pixels
    properties:
      location: Within the boundaries of the main_object.
      color: Any color different from the main_object's dominant_color.

actions:
  - name: identify_background
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color (e.g., 0)
  - name: identify_main_object
    inputs: input_grid, background_color
    outputs: coordinates_of_main_object_pixels
    description: Find the largest contiguous object composed of non-background colors.
  - name: determine_dominant_color
    inputs: coordinates_of_main_object_pixels, input_grid
    outputs: dominant_color
    description: Find the most frequent color among the pixels identified as the main object.
  - name: replace_impurities
    inputs: input_grid, coordinates_of_main_object_pixels, dominant_color
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by changing the color of any pixel within the main object that is not the dominant color to the dominant color. Keep all other pixels (background and dominant color pixels within the object) the same.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: impurity_pixels
    object: main_object
  - type: exclusion
    subject: main_object
    object: background

constraints:
  - The grid size remains constant.
  - Background pixels are preserved.
  - Only pixels within the largest non-background object are potentially modified.
