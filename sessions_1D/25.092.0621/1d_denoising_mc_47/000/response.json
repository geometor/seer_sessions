Scattered within the sequence of the dominant color are a few pixels of other non-white colors. The transformation replaces these scattered, non-dominant, non-white pixels with the dominant non-white color, effectively \"cleaning up\" the sequence. The white background pixels remain unchanged. The core operation involves identifying the most frequent non-white color and then homogenizing the non-white segment to consist solely of that color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
