*   **Perception:** The input grids are all 1x32 linear arrays of pixels. Each grid primarily consists of white pixels (0) and one dominant non-white color. Scattered within the sequence of the dominant color are a few pixels of other non-white colors. The transformation replaces these scattered, non-dominant, non-white pixels with the dominant non-white color, effectively "cleaning up" the sequence. The white background pixels remain unchanged. The core operation involves identifying the most frequent non-white color and then homogenizing the non-white segment to consist solely of that color.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN or Nx1)
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: sequence
        description: A contiguous or near-contiguous sequence of non-white pixels, bounded by white pixels.
        properties:
          - dominant_color: The most frequent non-white color within the sequence.
          - minority_colors: Other non-white colors appearing less frequently within the sequence.
    transformation:
      - action: identify_dominant_color
        target: non-white pixels
        condition: most frequent
      - action: replace_color
        target: minority_colors (non-white pixels that are not the dominant color)
        replacement_color: dominant_color
        scope: entire grid
      - action: preserve_color
        target: white pixels (0)
        condition: color is white
      - action: preserve_color
        target: dominant_color pixels
        condition: color is the dominant non-white color
    relationships:
      - The transformation homogenizes the non-white segment based on frequency analysis.
      - White pixels define the boundaries and are unaffected.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input grid and identify all non-white pixels.
    2.  Count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color present in the grid.
    3.  Determine the non-white color that occurs most frequently (the "dominant color").
    4.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid:
        a.  If the input pixel is white (0), place a white pixel (0) in the corresponding position in the new grid.
        b.  If the input pixel is *not* white (0):
            i.  Place the determined dominant color in the corresponding position in the new grid.
    6.  The new grid is the output.
