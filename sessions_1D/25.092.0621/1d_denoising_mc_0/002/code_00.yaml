task_type: array_transformation_1d
input_structure: 1D array of integers (colors) representing pixels.
output_structure: 1D array of integers (colors) of the same length as the input.
objects:
  - id: background
    pixels: color 0 (white)
    location: Pixels outside the primary non-white segment. Can be at the start, end, or both.
    action: Remains unchanged.
  - id: non_white_segment
    pixels: The first contiguous sequence of non-white colors (1-9) found in the input array.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index where the segment begins.
      - end_index: The index where the segment ends (inclusive).
      - color_composition: A collection of colors present within the segment and their frequencies.
      - dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently within the segment. If there's a tie, any of the most frequent colors can be chosen.
    action: All pixels within this segment (from start_index to end_index) are replaced by the dominant_color in the output array.
relationships:
  - non_white_segment may be preceded and/or followed by background pixels.
  - Only the *first* encountered non_white_segment is processed if multiple exist (though examples only show one).
transformation:
  - Locate the first contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input array.
  - If no such segment exists, the output is identical to the input.
  - If a segment is found:
    1. Identify its start and end indices.
    2. Determine the most frequent color (dominant color) within this segment.
    3. Create the output array by copying the input array.
    4. Modify the output array by setting all pixels from the start index to the end index (inclusive) to the dominant color.
