            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D list, while the ARC framework typically provides inputs as 2D NumPy arrays. Even though the visual representation looked 1D, the examples were likely loaded as 1xN grids. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" confirms that comparisons intended for single pixel values were being performed on array objects.\n\nThe core transformation logic (identifying the non-white block, finding the dominant color, and filling the block) appears correct based on the visual input/output pairs and the successful simulation in the `tool_code` block.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Acknowledge the input is a 2D NumPy array (specifically 1xN in these examples).\n2.  Adapt the code to operate on the first (and only) row of the input grid.\n3.  Refine the helper functions (`find_first_non_white_segment`, `find_dominant_color`) to explicitly handle array slicing and element access correctly within the context of a NumPy array row.\n4.  Ensure the output is also constructed as a 2D NumPy array of the same shape.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution and re-examination of examples:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Non-White Segment (Indices) | Segment Content                                | Dominant Color | Output Matches Logic |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------- | :------------------- |\n| train_1 | (1, 32)     | (1, 32)      | (4, 23)                     | `[4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 4]`    | 4 (yellow)     | Yes                  |\n| train_2 | (1, 32)     | (1, 32)      | (0, 19)                     | `[2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2]`    | 2 (red)        | Yes                  |\n| train_3 | (1, 32)     | (1, 32)      | (7, 27)                     | `[5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 5 5 5 5 5]` | 5 (gray)       | Yes                  |\n\n*   All examples use 1x32 grids.\n*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels within the single row.\n*   The transformation correctly identifies this block, finds the most frequent color within it, and replaces the entire block's contents with that dominant color in the output.\n*   White pixels (0) outside the block remain unchanged.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
