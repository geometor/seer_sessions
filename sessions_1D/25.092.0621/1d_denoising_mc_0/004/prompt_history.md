*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or flattened grids.
    *   Each example contains a contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white (0) pixels.
    *   Within this non-white block, there is one dominant color and one or more pixels of other colors.
    *   The transformation modifies only the non-white block.
    *   The modification consists of changing the pixels with minority colors within the block to the dominant color of that block.
    *   The white pixels surrounding the block remain unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_transformation
    input_structure: 1D array of integers (colors)
    output_structure: 1D array of integers (colors)
    objects:
      - id: background
        pixels: color 0 (white)
        location: typically at the start and end of the array
        action: remains unchanged
      - id: central_block
        pixels: contiguous sequence of non-white colors (1-9)
        properties:
          - dominant_color: the most frequent color within the block
          - minority_colors: other colors present in the block
        action: all pixels within this block are changed to the dominant_color
    relationships:
      - central_block is surrounded by background pixels
    transformation: identify central_block, find its dominant_color, replace all minority_colors in central_block with dominant_color
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous segment of the input array containing non-white pixels (colors 1 through 9).
    2.  Within this identified segment, determine the color that appears most frequently (the dominant color).
    3.  Create the output array by copying the input array.
    4.  Replace every pixel within the identified non-white segment in the output array with the determined dominant color.
    5.  Leave the white pixels outside this segment unchanged.
