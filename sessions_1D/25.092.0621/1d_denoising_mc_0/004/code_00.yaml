task_type: grid_transformation
input_structure: 2D numpy array (grid), specifically 1xN shape in examples
output_structure: 2D numpy array (grid), same shape as input
objects:
  - id: background
    pixels: color 0 (white)
    location: pixels outside the central block in the grid's single row
    action: remains unchanged
  - id: central_block
    pixels: contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white colors (1-9) within the grid's single row
    properties:
      - dominant_color: the most frequent color value within the block's pixels
      - minority_colors: other color values present less frequently in the block
      - location: defined by start and end column indices within the single row
    action: all pixels within this block's column range in the output grid are replaced by the dominant_color
relationships:
  - central_block is horizontally contiguous and surrounded by (or adjacent to the edges and) background pixels within the row.
transformation:
  - identify the single row of the input grid.
  - locate the start and end column indices of the first contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in that row.
  - if no such sequence exists, return a copy of the input grid.
  - if a sequence exists, analyze the pixel values within that sequence (segment).
  - count the occurrences of each color value in the segment to find the dominant color.
  - create a copy of the input grid for the output.
  - modify the output grid by setting all pixels within the identified column range (start to end index, inclusive) in the single row to the dominant color.
