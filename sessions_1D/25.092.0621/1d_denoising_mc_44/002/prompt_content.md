"""
Identifies contiguous segments of non-background (non-zero) pixels in a 1D input grid.
For each segment, determines the most frequent color (majority color).
Constructs the output grid by replacing all pixels within each segment with that segment's majority color.
Background (zero) pixels remain unchanged.
