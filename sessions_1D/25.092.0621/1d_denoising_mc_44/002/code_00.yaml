task_description: Replace all colors within each contiguous non-background segment of a 1D grid with the most frequent color found within that segment.

elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - structure: 1-dimensional list of integers (pixels)
      - contains pixels with color values 0-9

  - element: background_pixel
    attributes:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: Separates non-background segments; remains unchanged.

  - element: non_background_segment
    attributes:
      - composition: contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels
      - location: bounded by background pixels (0) or grid edges
      - role: unit for color transformation
      - properties:
          - contains multiple pixels
          - has a majority color (most frequent color)
          - may contain one or more minority colors (less frequent colors)

actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    inputs:
      - input grid (1D list)
      - background color (0)
    outputs:
      - list of segments, each defined by start and end index

  - action: determine_majority_color
    inputs:
      - a non-background segment (list of pixel values)
    outputs:
      - the single color value that appears most frequently within the segment

  - action: homogenize_segment_color
    inputs:
      - segment indices (start, end)
      - majority color for that segment
      - output grid (initially a copy of input)
    outputs:
      - modifies the output grid in place, setting all pixels within the segment range to the majority color

relationships:
  - The transformation identifies and processes each non-background segment independently.
  - Background pixels (0) are preserved in their original locations in the output.
  - All pixels within a given non-background segment in the input are replaced by the single majority color of that segment in the output.
  - The length and overall structure (positions of background vs. non-background areas) of the grid remain unchanged.
