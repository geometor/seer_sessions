"""
Parses a 1D input grid represented as a space-separated string of integers. 
Identifies contiguous segments of non-background (non-zero) pixels. 
For each segment, determines the most frequent color (majority color). 
Constructs the output grid by replacing all pixels within each segment with that segment's majority color. 
Background (zero) pixels remain unchanged. The output is returned as a list of integers.
