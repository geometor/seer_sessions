task_description: Transforms a 1D grid by replacing minority colors within contiguous non-background segments with the segment's majority color.

input_format: List of lists representing a grid (typically with one row for this task).

output_format: List of lists representing the transformed grid, maintaining original dimensions.

elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - structure: 1-dimensional (represented as a list within a list, e.g., [[0, 1, 1, 0]]).
      - contains pixels with color values 0-9.

  - element: background_pixel
    attributes:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: Defines boundaries between segments and is unchanged by the transformation.

  - element: non_background_segment
    attributes:
      - composition: A contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
      - identification: Located between background pixels or grid boundaries.
      - properties:
          - Contains pixels of one or more colors.
          - Has a majority color (the color appearing most frequently). Ties are resolved arbitrarily by the counting method, but no ties are present in examples.
          - May contain minority colors (colors other than the majority color).

actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Scan the 1D grid to find all contiguous sequences of non-background (non-zero) pixels.
    inputs:
      - 1D grid (derived from the input list of lists).
      - background_color (0).
    outputs:
      - List of segments, each defined by start and end indices.

  - action: process_segment
    description: For a given non-background segment, find the majority color and create a new segment of the same length filled with that color.
    inputs:
      - A non-background segment (list or array of pixel values).
    outputs:
      - The majority color value for the segment.
      - A new segment (list or array) filled with the majority color.

  - action: reconstruct_grid
    description: Build the output grid by keeping original background pixels and replacing original non-background segments with their corresponding new segments (filled with the majority color).
    inputs:
      - Original 1D grid.
      - List of identified segments (start/end indices).
      - List of majority colors corresponding to each segment.
    outputs:
      - Transformed 1D grid.

relationships:
  - The transformation applies independently to each identified non_background_segment.
  - background_pixels are preserved in their original locations.
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Within each non_background_segment, all original pixel colors are replaced by the single majority_color determined for that specific segment.
