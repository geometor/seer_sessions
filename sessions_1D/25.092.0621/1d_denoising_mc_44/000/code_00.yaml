task_description: Replace minority colors within a contiguous non-background segment with the segment's majority color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - 1-dimensional structure (or represented as 1D)
      - contains pixels with color values 0-9

  - element: background_pixels
    attributes:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: typically at the start and end of the sequence
      - role: padding, unchanged by the transformation

  - element: central_segment
    attributes:
      - composition: contiguous sequence of non-background pixels
      - role: primary focus of the transformation
      - properties:
          - contains a majority color
          - may contain one or more minority colors

actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    inputs:
      - input grid
      - background color (white, 0)
    outputs:
      - list of contiguous segments of non-background pixels

  - action: determine_majority_color
    inputs:
      - a non-background segment
    outputs:
      - the color value that appears most frequently within the segment

  - action: replace_minority_colors
    inputs:
      - a non-background segment
      - the majority color for that segment
    outputs:
      - modified segment where all pixels have the majority color

relationships:
  - The transformation applies independently to each contiguous non-background segment (though only one segment is present in the examples).
  - The background pixels define the boundaries of the non-background segments.
  - The output grid preserves the location and color of background pixels.
  - The output grid replaces the pixels within each non-background segment according to the replacement rule (all become the majority color).
