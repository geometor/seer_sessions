They are presented as space-separated integers.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use colors: white (0), azure (8), maroon (9), green (3), blue (1), red (2), magenta (6), and yellow (4). White (0) consistently appears at the beginning and end of the sequence, suggesting it acts as a background or padding.\n3.  **Core Object:** The central part of the sequence consists of non-white pixels. This central part seems to be the main object or region of interest.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes occur exclusively within this central, non-white region. The white padding pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Color Change Pattern:** Within the central region, certain pixels change their color. In `train_1`, maroon (9) and green (3) become azure (8). In `train_2`, red (2) and magenta (6) become blue (1). In `train_3`, magenta (6) and yellow (4) become maroon (9).\n6.  **Dominant Color:** In each example, there is one color that is clearly dominant within the central region (azure (8) in `train_1`, blue (1) in `train_2`, maroon (9) in `train_3`). The transformation seems to involve replacing the less frequent colors in this region with the most frequent one.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
