"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by identifying contiguous segments of non-background (non-zero) pixels. 
For each segment, it determines the most frequent color (majority color). 
It then constructs the output grid by replacing all pixels within each segment with that segment's majority color. 
Background (zero) pixels remain unchanged.
