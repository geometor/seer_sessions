task_description: Replace minority colors within a contiguous non-background segment of a 1D grid with the segment's majority color.

input_format:
  - type: string
    description: Space-separated sequence of integers representing pixel colors.
  - processing_needed: Parse the string into a list or array of integers.

elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - source: Parsed from input string
      - structure: 1-dimensional array of integers (colors)
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: background_pixels
    attributes:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: Can appear anywhere, but typically form contiguous blocks at start/end.
      - role: Define boundaries of processing segments; remain unchanged.

  - element: non_background_segment
    attributes:
      - composition: A contiguous sub-sequence of the grid containing only non-zero pixels.
      - identification: Located between background pixels or grid boundaries.
      - properties:
          - Contains multiple colors.
          - Has a single majority color (most frequent color).
          - May contain one or more minority colors.
      - examples:
          - train_1: pixels from index 3 to 27 (inclusive), majority azure (8).
          - train_2: pixels from index 3 to 24 (inclusive), majority blue (1).
          - train_3: pixels from index 6 to 28 (inclusive), majority maroon (9).

actions:
  - action: parse_input
    description: Convert the input string into a 1D list/array of integer color values.
    inputs:
      - input string
    outputs:
      - 1D list/array of integers

  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find the start and end indices of all contiguous segments containing only non-zero pixels.
    inputs:
      - 1D grid (from parse_input)
      - background color (0)
    outputs:
      - list of (start_index, end_index) tuples for each segment.

  - action: determine_majority_color
    description: For a given segment, count color frequencies and identify the most frequent one.
    inputs:
      - a segment (sub-array of the 1D grid)
    outputs:
      - the majority color value

  - action: replace_segment_colors
    description: Modify the grid by replacing all pixels within a identified segment with its determined majority color.
    inputs:
      - 1D grid (can be modified in place or create a copy)
      - segment start_index
      - segment end_index
      - majority color for the segment
    outputs:
      - modified 1D grid

relationships:
  - The transformation applies independently to each non_background_segment identified.
  - Background pixels (0) are invariant and act as delimiters for segments.
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - All pixels within a processed segment in the output grid will have the same color: the majority color of that segment from the input grid.
