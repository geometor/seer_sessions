*   **Perception:** The task involves processing 1D arrays (or 1xN grids). Each example shows an input array containing sequences of numbers (colors), primarily white (0) at the ends and a dominant non-white color in the middle. Within the dominant color sequence, there are occasional "impurity" pixels of different non-white colors. The corresponding output array replaces these impurity pixels with the dominant color, effectively "cleaning up" the sequence to consist of only the dominant color, while preserving the white padding.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous Python code failed on all training examples with the error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This typically arises in NumPy when a boolean array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`). While the exact line causing the error isn't identified without a traceback, the core logic of the transformation appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The transformation consistently involves identifying the most frequent non-white color in the input and replacing *all* non-white pixels with that dominant color, while preserving white pixels.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-verify the transformation rule against all examples using metrics.
2.  Refine the documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) to precisely describe this verified rule.
3.  The coding phase will need to debug the implementation, ensuring that NumPy arrays are correctly handled in conditional statements or indexing, likely by making any implicit boolean checks explicit (e.g., using `.any()`, `.all()`, or checking `.size`).

## Metrics

Based on code execution analysis of the examples:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (1, 32), Output Shape: (1, 32)
    *   Input Non-White Colors: {blue(1): 23, azure(8): 1, red(2): 1}
    *   Dominant Input Color: blue (1)
    *   Input Colors Replaced: [red(2), azure(8)]
    *   Output Non-White Colors: {blue(1): 25}
    *   Pixels Changed: 2
    *   Output Matches Dominant: True
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (1, 32), Output Shape: (1, 32)
    *   Input Non-White Colors: {magenta(6): 18, maroon(9): 2}
    *   Dominant Input Color: magenta (6)
    *   Input Colors Replaced: [maroon(9)]
    *   Output Non-White Colors: {magenta(6): 20}
    *   Pixels Changed: 2
    *   Output Matches Dominant: True
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (1, 32), Output Shape: (1, 32)
    *   Input Non-White Colors: {yellow(4): 19, orange(7): 1, azure(8): 1, green(3): 1}
    *   Dominant Input Color: yellow (4)
    *   Input Colors Replaced: [green(3), orange(7), azure(8)]
    *   Output Non-White Colors: {yellow(4): 22}
    *   Pixels Changed: 3
    *   Output Matches Dominant: True

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation rule is consistent across all examples. The process identifies the most frequent non-white color (dominant color) in the input grid and creates an output grid where all pixels that were non-white in the input are changed to this dominant color. Pixels that were white (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output.

  - generate_output: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input.
  - apply_transformation:
      - For each pixel position:
          - If the input pixel at this position is white (0), copy white (0) to the output grid.
          - If the input pixel at this position is non-white (1-9), place the determined dominant_color into the output grid.
      - If no dominant color was determined (input was all white), the output grid is identical to the input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Identify all non-white pixels (values 1 through 9) across the entire input grid.
4.  If there are no non-white pixels in the input grid, return the initial output grid (which is a copy of the input).
5.  Count the frequency of each distinct non-white color found in the input grid.
6.  Determine the single non-white color that occurs most frequently (the "dominant color").
7.  Identify the locations (row and column indices) of *all* pixels in the input grid that are non-white (value > 0).
8.  For each of these identified locations, update the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the determined dominant color. (White pixels remain unchanged from the initial copy).
9.  Return the modified output grid.
