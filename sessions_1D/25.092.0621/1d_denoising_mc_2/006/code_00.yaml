task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D # Explicitly treating as 2D, even if 1xN
input_grid_properties:
  - shape: Variable (Observed: 1x32)
  - elements: Integers 0-9 (colors)
  - structure: Contains white (0) pixels and non-white (1-9) pixels. Typically white padding surrounds a block of mixed non-white pixels.
output_grid_properties:
  - shape: Same as input grid shape.
  - elements: Integers 0-9 (colors)
  - structure: White pixels from input are preserved. All non-white pixels adopt the single dominant non-white color identified from the input.
objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    role: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: Any position in the grid.
      - transformation: Preserved (identity transformation).
  - type: pixel_group
    role: foreground
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white (1-9)
      - location: Any position in the grid.
      - collectively_define: dominant_color (most frequent non-white color in the entire input grid)
      - transformation: All pixels in this group (regardless of original non-white color) are replaced by the calculated dominant_color.
actions:
  - identify_pixels: Distinguish between white (0) and non-white (1-9) pixels in the input grid.
  - calculate_frequency: Count occurrences of each non-white color present in the input grid.
  - determine_dominant: Select the non-white color with the highest frequency count. If no non-white pixels exist, this step is skipped.
  - generate_output: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input.
  - apply_transformation:
      - For each pixel position:
          - If the input pixel at this position is white (0), copy white (0) to the output grid.
          - If the input pixel at this position is non-white (1-9), place the determined dominant_color into the output grid.
      - If no dominant color was determined (input was all white), the output grid is identical to the input grid.
