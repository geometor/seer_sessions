task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D (effectively 1D in examples)
input_grid:
  shape: Variable (1xN in examples)
  pixels: Integers 0-9 (colors)
  properties: Contains white (0) pixels and non-white (1-9) pixels.
output_grid:
  shape: Same as input grid.
  pixels: Integers 0-9 (colors)
  relationship_to_input: White pixels are preserved. Non-white pixels are homogenized.
objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    subtype: white_pixels
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - role: background/padding
  - type: pixel_group
    subtype: non_white_pixels
    properties:
      - color: 1-9 (non-white)
      - role: foreground/data
      - contains: dominant_color (most frequent non-white color)
      - contains: impurity_colors (other non-white colors)
actions:
  - identify: Determine the dominant_color among all non_white_pixels in the input grid.
  - preserve: Copy all white_pixels from the input grid to the output grid at the same locations.
  - replace: For every non_white_pixel location in the input grid, place the identified dominant_color in the corresponding location in the output grid.
corner_cases:
  - If the input grid contains no non-white pixels, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
