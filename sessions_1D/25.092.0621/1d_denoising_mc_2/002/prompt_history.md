*   **Perception:** The task involves processing 1D arrays (or 1xN grids). Each example shows an input array containing sequences of numbers (colors), primarily white (0) at the ends and a dominant non-white color in the middle. Within the dominant color sequence, there are occasional "impurity" pixels of different non-white colors. The corresponding output array replaces these impurity pixels with the dominant color, effectively "cleaning up" the sequence to consist of only the dominant color, while preserving the white padding.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_transformation_1d
    element_type: color_pixel
    dimensionality: 1
    input_structure:
      - array_type: 1D
      - elements: integers 0-9 (colors)
      - pattern: contains white padding (0) at ends, a central block of a dominant non-white color interspersed with other non-white colors.
    output_structure:
      - array_type: 1D
      - elements: integers 0-9 (colors)
      - relationship_to_input: same length as input, white padding preserved, central block homogenized to the dominant color.
    transformation:
      - identify_non_white: Filter out pixels with value 0.
      - find_dominant_color: Determine the most frequent color among the non-white pixels in the input.
      - replace_impurities: Iterate through the input array. Replace all non-white pixels with the identified dominant color. Keep white pixels (0) unchanged.
    objects:
      - type: sequence
        properties:
          - color: dominant non-white color
          - impurities: other non-white colors within the sequence
      - type: padding
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - location: start and end of the array
    actions:
      - identify: Find the most frequent non-white color.
      - replace: Change non-white pixels that are *not* the dominant color *to* the dominant color.
      - preserve: Keep white pixels as they are.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input 1D array.
    2.  Identify all non-white pixels (pixels with values 1 through 9).
    3.  Count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color.
    4.  Determine the color that appears most frequently among the non-white pixels; this is the "dominant color".
    5.  Create a new output array of the same size as the input array.
    6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input array:
        a.  If the input pixel is white (0), set the corresponding output pixel to white (0).
        b.  If the input pixel is non-white (1-9), set the corresponding output pixel to the identified dominant color.
    7.  The resulting array is the final output.
