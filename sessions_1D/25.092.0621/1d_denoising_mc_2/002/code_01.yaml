task_type: array_homogenization
dimensionality: 1 # Effectively 1D, presented as 1xN grid
input_features:
  grid_type: 1xN array
  pixel_colors: Integers 0-9. White (0) acts as padding/background. Non-white (1-9) form a central sequence.
  key_pattern: A dominant non-white color appears frequently, interspersed with other 'impurity' non-white colors.
output_features:
  grid_type: 1xN array, same dimensions as input.
  pixel_colors: Integers 0-9. White pixels are preserved. All non-white pixels are replaced by a single color.
objects:
  - type: background_pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: Typically start and end of the array, but can be anywhere.
  - type: foreground_pixels
    properties:
      color: Non-white (1-9)
      location: Contiguous or near-contiguous block within the array.
      composition: Contains multiple distinct non-white colors.
  - type: dominant_color
    properties:
      value: The non-white color (1-9) that occurs most frequently in the input array.
actions:
  - identify_background: Recognize pixels with value 0.
  - identify_foreground: Recognize pixels with values 1-9.
  - calculate_frequency: Count occurrences of each distinct non-white color.
  - determine_dominant: Select the non-white color with the highest frequency count.
  - preserve: Keep background (white) pixels unchanged in the output.
  - replace: Change all foreground (non-white) pixels in the input to the determined dominant color in the output.
transformation_rule: Homogenize the non-white part of the array to its most frequent non-white color, leaving white pixels unchanged.
