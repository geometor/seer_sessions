task_description: Replace minority colors within a contiguous non-white segment of a 1D grid with the segment's majority color.

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 1D array (represented as a list of lists containing one list) representing a row of pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: Integer values from 0 to 9.
      - structure: Contains a single contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels, potentially bordered by white (0) pixels.

  - object: non_white_segment
    description: The contiguous sequence of pixels within the grid that are not white (0).
    properties:
      - start_index: The column index where the segment begins.
      - end_index: The column index where the segment ends.
      - pixels: The list of color values within the segment.
      - color_frequencies: A count of how many times each color appears in the segment.
      - dominant_color: The color with the highest frequency within the segment. Ties are broken by choosing the color that appears first in the segment among those with maximum frequency.

actions:
  - action: identify_segment
    description: Find the start and end column indices of the non-white segment in the input grid row.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row (as numpy array)
    outputs:
      - start_index
      - end_index

  - action: extract_segment_pixels
    description: Get the pixel values from the input grid row within the identified segment boundaries.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row (as numpy array)
      - start_index
      - end_index
    outputs:
      - segment_pixels (as list or numpy array)

  - action: find_dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent color within the extracted segment pixels.
    inputs:
      - segment_pixels
    outputs:
      - dominant_color

  - action: replace_segment_colors
    description: Create the output grid row by replacing all pixels within the original non-white segment's boundaries (from start_index to end_index inclusive) with the dominant color. Pixels outside the segment remain unchanged.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row (as numpy array)
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - dominant_color
    outputs:
      - output_grid_row (as numpy array)

  - action: format_output
    description: Convert the modified output grid row (numpy array) back into the required list-of-lists format.
    inputs:
      - output_grid_row (as numpy array)
    outputs:
      - output_grid (as list of lists)

relationships:
  - type: modification
    description: The output grid is a modified version of the input grid.
  - type: containment
    description: The non-white segment is contained within the grid row.
  - type: determination
    description: The dominant color is determined by the frequency of colors within the non-white segment.
  - type: substitution
    description: Pixels within the segment in the input grid row are substituted with the dominant color to produce the corresponding segment in the output grid row. Pixels outside the segment remain the same.
