task_description: Replace all pixels within a contiguous non-white segment of a 1D grid with the segment's single most frequent color.

elements:
  - object: grid_row
    description: A 1D list representing a row of pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: Integer values from 0 to 9.
      - structure: Contains at most one contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels, potentially bordered by white (0) pixels.

  - object: non_white_segment
    description: The contiguous sequence of pixels within the grid row that are not white (0). Identified by start and end indices.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index where the segment begins.
      - end_index: The index where the segment ends (inclusive).
      - pixels: The list of color values within the segment in the input grid row.
      - color_frequencies: A count of how many times each color appears in the segment.
      - dominant_color: The color with the highest frequency within the segment. Ties are broken by choosing the color that appears first in the segment among those with the highest frequency.

actions:
  - action: identify_segment
    description: Find the start and end indices of the single contiguous non-white segment in the input grid row.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row
    outputs:
      - start_index
      - end_index

  - action: find_dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent color within the identified non-white segment's pixels.
    inputs:
      - non_white_segment_pixels
    outputs:
      - dominant_color

  - action: construct_output_row
    description: Create the output grid row. Pixels before the segment's start index and after the segment's end index are copied directly from the input. Pixels from the start index to the end index (inclusive) are all set to the calculated dominant color.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - dominant_color
    outputs:
      - output_grid_row

relationships:
  - type: conditional_modification
    description: The output grid row is identical to the input if no non-white segment exists. Otherwise, it's a modified version.
  - type: containment
    description: The non-white segment is contained within the grid row, defined by its start and end indices.
  - type: determination
    description: The dominant color is determined by the frequency of colors within the non-white segment.
  - type: replacement
    description: Pixels within the segment's index range in the input grid row are replaced by the dominant color to produce the corresponding segment in the output grid row. Pixels outside this range are preserved.
