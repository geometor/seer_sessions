However, the provided code failed to perform the replacement step, resulting in the output being identical to the input for all training examples. The failure lies not in the perception of the rule but in the implementation within the `transform` function, specifically how the output grid was modified (or rather, failed to be modified effectively). The strategy is to re-verify the segment identification and dominant color calculation, then correct the implementation of the replacement step in the `transform` function.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's re-verify the intermediate steps for each training example using the provided functions.\n\n"
