"""
Replace minority colors within a contiguous non-white segment of a 1D grid with the segment's majority color.
The transformation identifies the single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
It then determines the most frequent color within that block (the dominant color).
Finally, it replaces all pixels within that block's original position in the grid with the dominant color.
Pixels outside this block (flanking white pixels) remain unchanged.
