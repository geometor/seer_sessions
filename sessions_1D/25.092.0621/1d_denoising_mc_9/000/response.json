The flanking white pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Dominant Color:** Within the non-white segment of each input, one color appears significantly more often than others.\n    *   Example 1: Orange (7) is dominant.\n    *   Example 2: Maroon (9) is dominant.\n    *   Example 3: Gray (5) is dominant.\n6.  **Color Change Pattern:** In the output, all pixels within the original non-white segment are changed to the dominant color identified in the input's non-white segment.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
