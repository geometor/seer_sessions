task_description: Replace minority colors within a contiguous non-white segment with the segment's majority color.

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 1D array representing a row of pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: Integer values from 0 to 9.
      - structure: Contains a contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels, possibly bordered by white (0) pixels.

  - object: non_white_segment
    description: The contiguous sequence of pixels within the grid that are not white (0).
    properties:
      - start_index: The index where the segment begins.
      - end_index: The index where the segment ends.
      - pixels: The list of color values within the segment.
      - color_frequencies: A count of how many times each color appears in the segment.
      - dominant_color: The color with the highest frequency within the segment.

actions:
  - action: identify_segment
    description: Find the start and end indices of the non-white segment in the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - non_white_segment_pixels

  - action: find_dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent color within the identified non-white segment.
    inputs:
      - non_white_segment_pixels
    outputs:
      - dominant_color

  - action: replace_colors
    description: Create the output grid by replacing all pixels within the original non-white segment's boundaries with the dominant color, keeping pixels outside the segment unchanged.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - dominant_color
    outputs:
      - output_grid

relationships:
  - type: modification
    description: The output grid is a modified version of the input grid.
  - type: containment
    description: The non-white segment is contained within the grid.
  - type: determination
    description: The dominant color is determined by the frequency of colors within the non-white segment.
  - type: substitution
    description: Pixels within the segment in the input grid are substituted with the dominant color to produce the corresponding segment in the output grid. Pixels outside the segment remain the same.
