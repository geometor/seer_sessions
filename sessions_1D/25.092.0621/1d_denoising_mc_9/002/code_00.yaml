task_description: Transforms a single-row grid by identifying the contiguous segment of non-white pixels, finding the most frequent color within that segment, and then replacing all pixels in that segment's original location with the dominant color. Pixels outside the segment remain unchanged.

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 1D grid represented as a list containing a single list of integers (colors 0-9). Example shape (1, N).
    properties:
      - colors: Integer values from 0 to 9. White (0) acts as background/padding.
      - structure: Typically contains one contiguous segment of non-white pixels, possibly bordered by white pixels.

  - object: non_white_segment
    description: The contiguous sequence of pixels within the grid's single row that are not white (0).
    properties:
      - start_column_index: The column index where the segment begins.
      - end_column_index: The column index where the segment ends.
      - pixels: The list of color values within the segment.
      - color_frequencies: A count of how many times each non-white color appears in the segment.
      - dominant_color: The color with the highest frequency within the segment. (Ties resolved by first encountered color with max frequency).

actions:
  - action: identify_segment_boundaries
    description: Find the start and end column indices of the single contiguous non-white segment in the input grid's row.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row (1D array/list of colors)
    outputs:
      - start_column_index
      - end_column_index
      - segment_exists (boolean)

  - action: extract_segment_pixels
    description: Get the list of pixel colors within the identified segment boundaries.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row
      - start_column_index
      - end_column_index
    outputs:
      - segment_pixels (list of colors)

  - action: find_dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent color within the segment pixels.
    inputs:
      - segment_pixels
    outputs:
      - dominant_color

  - action: generate_output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid, then replacing all pixels within the segment boundaries (start_column_index to end_column_index inclusive) in the row with the dominant color.
    inputs:
      - input_grid (original List[List[int]])
      - start_column_index
      - end_column_index
      - dominant_color
    outputs:
      - output_grid (List[List[int]])

relationships:
  - type: modification
    description: The output grid is a modified version of the input grid.
  - type: boundary_identification
    description: The segment boundaries are identified based on the positions of non-white pixels in the input row.
  - type: frequency_analysis
    description: The dominant color is determined by analyzing the frequency of colors within the identified segment.
  - type: targeted_substitution
    description: Only the pixels within the original segment's boundaries are substituted with the dominant color; all other pixels remain unchanged.
