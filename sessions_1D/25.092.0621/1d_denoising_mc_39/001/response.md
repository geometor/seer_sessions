"""
Identify the background color (typically 0/white). Count the occurrences of all 
other colors to find the dominant color (most frequent non-background color). 
Create a new grid of the same size. Iterate through the input grid: if a pixel 
is the background color or the dominant color, copy it to the output. If it's 
any other color (an impurity), replace it with the dominant color in the output.
