*   **Perception**: The task operates on single-row grids. Each input grid consists primarily of one dominant color, framed by a background color (white/0). Within the dominant color sequence, there are isolated pixels of different "impurity" colors. The transformation identifies the dominant color (excluding the background) and replaces all impurity pixels with this dominant color, effectively cleaning the sequence. The background pixels remain unchanged.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    components:
      - item: background_pixels
        properties:
          - color: typically white (0)
          - location: often at the start and/or end of the row
          - role: static frame, unaffected by the transformation
      - item: dominant_color_pixels
        properties:
          - color: the most frequent color excluding the background
          - location: forms the main sequence within the row
          - role: target color for replacement
      - item: impurity_pixels
        properties:
          - color: any color that is not the background or the dominant color
          - location: interspersed within the dominant color sequence
          - quantity: typically few, often single instances
          - role: pixels to be changed
    action:
      - type: identify
        target: background_color
        details: Typically color 0.
      - type: identify
        target: dominant_color
        details: Find the most frequent color in the input grid, ignoring the background color.
      - type: replace
        target: impurity_pixels
        details: Change the color of each impurity pixel to the identified dominant color.
    relationship:
      - impurity_pixels are defined relative to the background_color and dominant_color.
      - the transformation preserves the background_pixels and the dominant_color_pixels, only modifying the impurity_pixels.
    output_characteristics:
      - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
      - The output grid contains only the background color and the dominant color from the input.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the background color (which is color 0/white in these examples).
    2.  Count the occurrences of each color in the input grid, excluding the background color.
    3.  Determine the dominant color, which is the color with the highest count found in step 2.
    4.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid:
        a.  If the pixel's color is the background color, copy it to the corresponding position in the new grid.
        b.  If the pixel's color is the dominant color, copy it to the corresponding position in the new grid.
        c.  If the pixel's color is neither the background nor the dominant color (it's an impurity), place the dominant color in the corresponding position in the new grid.
    6.  The new grid is the output.
