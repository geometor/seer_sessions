Within the dominant color sequence, there are isolated pixels of different \"impurity\" colors. The transformation identifies the dominant color (excluding the background) and replaces all impurity pixels with this dominant color, effectively cleaning the sequence. The background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
