task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (likely single row or column)
  transformation_type: Color replacement based on frequency analysis

elements:
  - element_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9)
      - role: Can be 'background' (white=0), 'main' (most frequent non-white color), or 'impurity' (other non-white colors).

actions:
  - action: Identify Main Color
    description: Count the frequency of each non-white color in the input grid. The color with the highest frequency is designated as the 'main color'.
    inputs:
      - input grid
    outputs:
      - main color value
  - action: Replace Impurity Pixels
    description: Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel's color is neither white (0) nor the identified 'main color', change its color to the 'main color'. Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color.
    inputs:
      - input grid
      - main color value
    outputs:
      - output grid

relationships:
  - relationship: Frequency determines role
    description: The frequency of a non-white color determines if it's the 'main' color or an 'impurity' color.
  - relationship: Pixel transformation dependency
    description: The final color of a pixel depends on its original color and its relationship to the 'main' color and the 'background' color (white).

inferred_goal: To homogenize the non-background colors in the grid by replacing less frequent colors with the most frequent one.
