            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are presented as flat lists of numbers. Given the typical ARC format, these likely represent 1-dimensional grids (either a single row or a single column). The length varies slightly (32 or 33 pixels).\n2.  **Color Palette**: Each example uses a limited palette. There's always white (0), one dominant color (azure (8) in example 1, maroon (9) in examples 2 and 3), and one or more \"impurity\" colors (green (3) and magenta (6) in example 1; orange (7) and gray (5) in example 2; yellow (4) and orange (7) in example 3).\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation seems to be a color replacement. The \"impurity\" colors in the input grid are replaced by the dominant color in the output grid. The dominant color itself and the white pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Identifying the Dominant Color**: The dominant color appears to be the most frequent color in the input grid, excluding white (0).\n5.  **Scope**: The transformation applies globally to the entire grid, pixel by pixel, based on the frequency analysis. It doesn't seem to depend on shapes, adjacency, or position beyond the color value itself.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
