task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D list/array of pixels.
  transformation_type: Color harmonization based on frequency.
  background_color: White (0).

elements:
  - element_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9).
      - position: Index within the 1D list.

derived_elements:
  - element_type: color_group
    properties:
      - color: A specific non-white color value present in the input.
      - frequency: Count of pixels with this color in the input.
      - type: Role derived from frequency ('main' or 'impurity').

identified_objects:
  - object: main_color
    description: The non-white color with the highest frequency in the input grid.
    determination: Count frequencies of all non-white pixels; select the color with the maximum count. If there are no non-white pixels, this object is undefined or irrelevant.
  - object: impurity_color
    description: Any non-white color in the input grid that is not the main_color.

actions:
  - action: count_frequencies
    description: Count occurrences of each non-white color in the input list.
    inputs: input_list (list of pixel colors)
    outputs: frequency_map (dictionary mapping non-white colors to their counts)
  - action: identify_main_color
    description: Determine the main_color from the frequency_map.
    inputs: frequency_map
    outputs: main_color_value (integer color code, or null/indicator if none)
  - action: replace_impurities
    description: Create the output list by iterating through the input list. Replace pixels whose color is an impurity_color with the main_color_value. Keep main_color pixels and background (white) pixels unchanged.
    inputs:
      - input_list
      - main_color_value
    outputs: output_list

relationships:
  - relationship: frequency_determines_main_color
    description: The non-white color with the highest count becomes the main_color. All other non-white colors are impurity_colors.
  - relationship: pixel_transformation_rule
    description: |
      output_pixel_color = main_color_value IF input_pixel_color is an impurity_color
      output_pixel_color = input_pixel_color IF input_pixel_color is the main_color_value OR white (0)

inferred_goal: Standardize the non-background appearance of the grid by making all non-background elements conform to the most common non-background color.
