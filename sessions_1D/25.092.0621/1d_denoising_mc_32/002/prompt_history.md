Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are presented as flat lists of numbers. Given the typical ARC format, these likely represent 1-dimensional grids (either a single row or a single column). The length varies slightly (32 or 33 pixels).
2.  **Color Palette**: Each example uses a limited palette. There's always white (0), one dominant color (azure (8) in example 1, maroon (9) in examples 2 and 3), and one or more "impurity" colors (green (3) and magenta (6) in example 1; orange (7) and gray (5) in example 2; yellow (4) and orange (7) in example 3).
3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation seems to be a color replacement. The "impurity" colors in the input grid are replaced by the dominant color in the output grid. The dominant color itself and the white pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Identifying the Dominant Color**: The dominant color appears to be the most frequent color in the input grid, excluding white (0).
5.  **Scope**: The transformation applies globally to the entire grid, pixel by pixel, based on the frequency analysis. It doesn't seem to depend on shapes, adjacency, or position beyond the color value itself.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (likely single row or column)
  transformation_type: Color replacement based on frequency analysis

elements:
  - element_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9)
      - role: Can be 'background' (white=0), 'main' (most frequent non-white color), or 'impurity' (other non-white colors).

actions:
  - action: Identify Main Color
    description: Count the frequency of each non-white color in the input grid. The color with the highest frequency is designated as the 'main color'.
    inputs:
      - input grid
    outputs:
      - main color value
  - action: Replace Impurity Pixels
    description: Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel's color is neither white (0) nor the identified 'main color', change its color to the 'main color'. Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color.
    inputs:
      - input grid
      - main color value
    outputs:
      - output grid

relationships:
  - relationship: Frequency determines role
    description: The frequency of a non-white color determines if it's the 'main' color or an 'impurity' color.
  - relationship: Pixel transformation dependency
    description: The final color of a pixel depends on its original color and its relationship to the 'main' color and the 'background' color (white).

inferred_goal: To homogenize the non-background colors in the grid by replacing less frequent colors with the most frequent one.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Analyze the input grid to count the occurrences of each color, ignoring the white (0) pixels.
3.  Identify the color that appears most frequently among the non-white pixels. This is the "main color".
4.  Create a new output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid:
    a.  Check the color of the current pixel.
    b.  If the color is *not* white (0) and *not* the identified "main color", change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the "main color".
    c.  If the color *is* white (0) or *is* the "main color", leave the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid unchanged.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
"""
Analyzes the input grid (represented as a list of integers) to find the most frequent non-white (0) color (the "main color").
It then creates an output grid where all non-white pixels that are not the "main color" are replaced with the "main color".
White pixels remain unchanged.
