task_context:
  grid_representation: 1D list of integers (pixels)
  transformation_type: Color replacement based on frequency analysis
  handling_of_white: White pixels (0) are ignored during frequency analysis and remain unchanged in the output.

elements:
  - element_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9) representing a color.
      - role: Defined by frequency relative to other non-white colors.
          - background: Color is white (0).
          - main: The non-white color with the highest frequency in the input grid.
          - impurity: Any non-white color that is not the 'main' color.

actions:
  - action: Analyze Frequencies
    description: Count the occurrences of each non-white color in the input list.
    inputs:
      - input list (representing the grid)
    outputs:
      - Frequency count for each non-white color.
  - action: Identify Main Color
    description: Determine the non-white color with the maximum frequency count. If no non-white colors exist, there is no main color.
    inputs:
      - Frequency counts of non-white colors.
    outputs:
      - The integer value of the main color (or indicator of none).
  - action: Replace Impurities
    description: Create the output list by iterating through the input list. If a pixel is an 'impurity' color (non-white and not the 'main' color), change its color to the 'main' color in the output list. Otherwise, keep the original color (white or 'main' color). If no 'main' color was identified, the output list is identical to the input list.
    inputs:
      - input list
      - main color value (or indicator of none)
    outputs:
      - output list

relationships:
  - relationship: Frequency defines role
    description: The relative frequency among non-white pixels determines if a color is 'main' or 'impurity'.
  - relationship: Transformation rule
    description: Impurity colors are transformed into the main color; main and background colors are preserved.

inferred_goal: Homogenize the significant colors in the grid by replacing infrequent non-background colors with the most frequent non-background color.
