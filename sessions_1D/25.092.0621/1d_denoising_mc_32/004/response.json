            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This typically occurs in NumPy when an array is used in a context that requires a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:` or `if array == value:`). Reviewing the previous code, the most likely cause is attempting element-wise comparison (`!=`) inside the loop if the indexing unexpectedly returned an array instead of a scalar, possibly due to the input being treated as 2D when the code assumed 1D iteration.\n\nThe core logic identified seems sound:\n1.  Identify the most frequent non-white color (\"main color\").\n2.  Replace all other non-white colors (\"impurity colors\") with the main color.\n3.  Leave white (0) pixels unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the implementation to correctly handle array comparisons, potentially using vectorized operations which are generally safer and more efficient in NumPy. We also need to verify the \"main color\" identification and replacement rule against all examples.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze each training example to confirm the pattern and identify the main/impurity colors.\n\n"
