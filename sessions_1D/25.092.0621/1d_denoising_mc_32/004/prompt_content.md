"""
Analyzes the input grid (represented as a list of integers) to find the most frequent non-white (0) color (the "main color").
It then creates an output grid where all non-white pixels that are not the "main color" are replaced with the "main color".
White (0) pixels remain unchanged. If the grid contains only white pixels, it is returned unchanged.
