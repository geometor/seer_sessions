Each row consists of three parts: leading white pixels (color 0), a central segment of non-white pixels, and trailing white pixels. The central segment contains primarily one color, which acts as a background or dominant color for that segment. Scattered within this dominant color sequence are a small number of pixels of different colors (\"noise\" pixels). The transformation modifies only the central, non-white segment. Specifically, it identifies the dominant color within this segment and replaces all other non-white pixels (\"noise\" pixels) with this dominant color, effectively smoothing the segment to a single color. The leading and trailing white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
