"""
Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (primary segment) in the 
input array. Count the occurrences of each non-white color within this segment. 
Determine the dominant color (most frequent non-white color). Create the output 
array by copying the input. Iterate through the primary segment in the output 
array and replace any non-white pixel that is not the dominant color with the 
dominant color. Leave white pixels unchanged.
