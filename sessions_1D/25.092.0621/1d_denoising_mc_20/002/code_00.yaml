task_type: grid_transformation_1xN
components:
  - role: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    property: static
    location: can appear anywhere, but often frames the main content.
    persistence: remains unchanged between input and output.
  - role: primary_segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels within the single row of the grid.
    properties:
      - identification: Defined by the first and last non-white pixels in the row.
      - input_state: Can contain multiple distinct non-white colors.
      - output_state: Contains only one distinct non-white color (the dominant color).
  - role: dominant_color
    description: The non-white color that appears most frequently within the primary_segment of the input grid's row.
    determination: Requires counting the occurrences of each non-white color within the segment indices.
  - role: impurity_colors
    description: Non-white colors within the primary_segment of the input grid's row that are *not* the dominant_color.
    transformation: These colors are replaced by the dominant_color in the output grid.
relationship:
  - The dominant_color dictates the final color of all non-white pixels within the primary_segment in the output.
action:
  - identify: Locate the column indices of the first and last non-white pixels in the input grid's single row. This defines the primary_segment.
  - count: Tally the frequency of each non-white color appearing between these start and end column indices (inclusive).
  - determine: Identify the dominant_color (the non-white color with the highest count).
  - replace: Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through the columns of the primary_segment in the copied grid. Change any pixel that is non-white and not the dominant_color to the dominant_color.
  - preserve: Ensure all white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
