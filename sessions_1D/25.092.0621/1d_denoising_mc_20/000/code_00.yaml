task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    location: appears at the start and end of the array, framing the main content.
    persistence: remains unchanged between input and output.
  - role: primary_segment
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels located between the background pixels.
    properties:
      - contains multiple colors in the input.
      - contains only one non-white color in the output.
  - role: dominant_color
    description: The color that appears most frequently within the primary_segment of the input.
    determination: Requires counting the occurrences of each non-white color within the primary_segment.
  - role: impurity_colors
    description: Non-white colors within the primary_segment of the input that are *not* the dominant_color.
    transformation: These colors are replaced by the dominant_color in the output.
relationship:
  - dominant_color determines the final color of all non-white pixels in the output's primary_segment.
action:
  - identify: Locate the primary_segment (contiguous non-white pixels).
  - count: Tally the frequency of each non-white color within the primary_segment.
  - determine: Identify the dominant_color (most frequent).
  - replace: Change all impurity_colors within the primary_segment to the dominant_color.
  - preserve: Keep the background (white) pixels unchanged.
