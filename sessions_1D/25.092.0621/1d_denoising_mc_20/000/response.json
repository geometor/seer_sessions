There seems to be a central segment containing various non-white colors, potentially framed by white (0) pixels at the beginning and end.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The outputs mirror the input structure, with a central non-white segment framed by white pixels.\n5.  **Key Observation:** Within the central non-white segment of the input, there is usually one color that appears much more frequently than others. The other, less frequent colors within this segment seem to be \"impurities\". In the output, these \"impurity\" colors are replaced by the most frequent color found in that central segment of the input. The framing white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the \"dominant color\", which is the non-white color with the highest count within the primary segment.\n4.  Create the output array by copying the input array.\n5.  Iterate through the pixels within the primary segment (using the start and end indices identified in step 1) of the output array.\n6.  For each pixel in this segment, if its color is not white (0) and not the dominant color, change its color to the dominant color.\n7.  Leave all white (0) pixels unchanged, both inside and outside the primary segment.\n8.  The resulting array is the final output."
