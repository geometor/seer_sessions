The core transformation involves identifying pixels that are different from their immediate left and right neighbors, but where those two neighbors are identical to each other (and not white). These identified pixels are then changed to match the color of their neighbors. This effectively smooths out single-pixel variations within contiguous segments of non-white colors. White pixels (0) appear to serve as delimiters or background and are never modified, nor do they trigger modifications in adjacent pixels. The first and last pixels of the row are never changed as they lack two neighbors for comparison.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
