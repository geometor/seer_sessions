*   **Perception:**
    The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). The core transformation involves identifying pixels that are different from their immediate left and right neighbors, but where those two neighbors are identical to each other (and not white). These identified pixels are then changed to match the color of their neighbors. This effectively smooths out single-pixel variations within contiguous segments of non-white colors. White pixels (0) appear to serve as delimiters or background and are never modified, nor do they trigger modifications in adjacent pixels. The first and last pixels of the row are never changed as they lack two neighbors for comparison.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation_1d
    element_type: pixels
    grid_dimensionality: 1
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_segment
        description: A sequence of one or more pixels of the same non-white color.
      - type: impurity_pixel
        description: A single pixel whose color differs from its identical immediate left and right neighbors (which are non-white).
      - type: boundary_pixel
        description: White pixels (0) that often delimit segments.
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Pixels are considered neighbors if they are directly to the left or right.
      - type: color_identity
        description: Comparing the color values of neighboring pixels.
    actions:
      - type: identify
        description: Locate impurity pixels based on the color comparison rule (left == right != center, left != white).
      - type: replace_color
        description: Change the color of the identified impurity pixel to match the color of its neighbors.
    constraints:
      - The first and last pixels are never modified.
      - White pixels (0) are never modified.
      - Pixels within a uniform segment (e.g., ...X X X...) are not modified.
      - Pixels adjacent to different colored neighbors (e.g., ...X Y Z...) or adjacent to white pixels (e.g., ...0 X Y... or ...X Y 0...) are not modified by this rule.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2.  Iterate through the pixels of the input grid row from the second pixel (index 1) up to, but not including, the last pixel (index width-1).
    3.  For each pixel at the current index `i`:
        a.  Get the color of the pixel to the left (at index `i-1`), the pixel itself (at index `i`), and the pixel to the right (at index `i+1`).
        b.  Check if the left pixel's color is the same as the right pixel's color.
        c.  Check if the left pixel's color is not white (0).
        d.  Check if the center pixel's color (at index `i`) is different from the left pixel's color.
        e.  If all three conditions (a, b, and c) are true, update the color of the pixel at index `i` in the output grid to be the same as the color of the left (or right) pixel.
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D grid (represented as a single row within a 2D list) by smoothing out single-pixel color variations. 
Specifically, it identifies pixels that differ in color from their immediate left and right neighbors, but where those two neighbors share the same non-white color. 
These identified pixels are then changed to match the color of their neighbors. The first and last pixels, as well as white pixels (0), are never modified.
