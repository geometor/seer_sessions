    description: A sequence of three adjacent pixels (left, center, right).
relationships:

transformation_rule:
  - name: smooth_impurity
    condition: For a pixel at index `i` (where `0 < i < width - 1`):
               1. The color of the pixel at `i-1` is identical to the color of the pixel at `i+1`.
               2. The color of the pixel at `i-1` (and `i+1`) is not white (0).
               3. The color of the pixel at `i` is different from the color of its neighbors (at `i-1` and `i+1`).
    action: Change the color of the pixel at index `i` in the output grid to match the color of its neighbors (at `i-1` and `i+1`).
constraints:
  - The transformation is based solely on the original input grid state; changes are not applied sequentially within the iteration.
  - The first pixel (index 0) and the last pixel (index width-1) are never modified.
  - Pixels with color white (0) are never modified.
  - The neighbors considered for modification must not be white (0).
