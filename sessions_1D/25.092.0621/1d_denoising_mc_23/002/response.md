*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation rule: smoothing single-pixel "impurities" within non-white segments. However, the Python code produced errors ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous"). This specific error strongly suggests that the input data provided to the `transform` function is likely a NumPy array, not a standard Python `list[list[int]]` as assumed. NumPy arrays require element-wise comparison operators (like `np.equal`) or methods like `.any()` or `.all()` for truth testing, which the previous code didn't use. The comparison `left_pixel_color == right_pixel_color` likely failed because it was comparing arrays or slices instead of individual integer values, or the input structure wasn't handled correctly.

    The strategy to resolve this is to:
    1.  Assume the input `input_grid` is a 2D NumPy array, even if it only contains one row.
    2.  Extract the row correctly.
    3.  Perform comparisons using element-wise logic suitable for NumPy, or ensure scalar values are being compared.
    4.  Ensure the output format matches the expected format (likely a 2D NumPy array).
    5.  Re-verify the transformation logic against all examples with the corrected data handling. The logic itself (identifying `Y X Y` patterns where `Y != 0` and changing `X` to `Y`) appears sound based on visual inspection of the examples.

    condition: For a pixel at index `i` (where `0 < i < width - 1`):
               1. The color of the pixel at `i-1` is identical to the color of the pixel at `i+1`.
               2. The color of the pixel at `i-1` (and `i+1`) is not white (0).
               3. The color of the pixel at `i` is different from the color of its neighbors (at `i-1` and `i+1`).
    action: Change the color of the pixel at index `i` in the output grid to match the color of its neighbors (at `i-1` and `i+1`).
constraints:
  - The transformation is based solely on the original input grid state; changes are not applied sequentially within the iteration.
  - The first pixel (index 0) and the last pixel (index width-1) are never modified.
  - Pixels with color white (0) are never modified.
  - The neighbors considered for modification must not be white (0).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input grid (a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, width)).
    2.  Create a copy of the input grid to store the output.
    3.  Get the width of the grid (number of columns).
    4.  Iterate through the pixel indices `i` from 1 up to (but not including) `width - 1`.
    5.  For each index `i`:
        a.  Retrieve the colors of the left pixel (`input_grid[0, i-1]`), center pixel (`input_grid[0, i]`), and right pixel (`input_grid[0, i+1]`).
        b.  Check if the left pixel's color equals the right pixel's color.
        c.  Check if the left pixel's color is not white (0).
        d.  Check if the center pixel's color is different from the left pixel's color.
        e.  If all three conditions (b, c, d) are true, update the pixel at `output_grid[0, i]` to match the left pixel's color.
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
