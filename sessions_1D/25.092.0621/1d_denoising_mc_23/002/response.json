            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation rule: smoothing single-pixel \"impurities\" within non-white segments. However, the Python code produced errors (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\"). This specific error strongly suggests that the input data provided to the `transform` function is likely a NumPy array, not a standard Python `list[list[int]]` as assumed. NumPy arrays require element-wise comparison operators (like `np.equal`) or methods like `.any()` or `.all()` for truth testing, which the previous code didn't use. The comparison `left_pixel_color == right_pixel_color` likely failed because it was comparing arrays or slices instead of individual integer values, or the input structure wasn't handled correctly.\n\n    The strategy to resolve this is to:\n    1.  Assume the input `input_grid` is a 2D NumPy array, even if it only contains one row.\n    2.  Extract the row correctly.\n    3.  Perform comparisons using element-wise logic suitable for NumPy, or ensure scalar values are being compared.\n    4.  Ensure the output format matches the expected format (likely a 2D NumPy array).\n    5.  Re-verify the transformation logic against all examples with the corrected data handling. The logic itself (identifying `Y X Y` patterns where `Y != 0` and changing `X` to `Y`) appears sound based on visual inspection of the examples.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n\n"
