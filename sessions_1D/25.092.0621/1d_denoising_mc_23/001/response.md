```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D grid (represented as a single row within a 2D list) by smoothing out single-pixel color variations. 
Specifically, it identifies pixels that differ in color from their immediate left and right neighbors, but where those two neighbors share the same non-white color. 
These identified pixels are then changed to match the color of their neighbors. The first and last pixels, as well as white pixels (0), are never modified.
