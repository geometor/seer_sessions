"""
Transforms a 1D grid (represented as a single row within a 2D NumPy array) by smoothing out single-pixel color variations. 
Specifically, it identifies pixels that differ in color from their immediate left and right neighbors, but where those two neighbors share the same non-white color (not 0). 
These identified pixels are then changed to match the color of their neighbors. The first and last pixels, as well as white pixels (0), are never modified by this rule.
