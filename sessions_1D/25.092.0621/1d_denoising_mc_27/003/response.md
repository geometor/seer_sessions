"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by identifying the contiguous central segment of non-white pixels in the single row. 
Determines the most frequent non-white color (dominant color) within this segment. 
Replaces all other non-white pixels within this segment with the dominant color. 
Leading and trailing white pixels (color 0) remain unchanged. The output grid retains the 1xN shape.
