            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: find the central non-white segment, determine its dominant color, and replace all other non-white \"impurity\" colors within that segment with the dominant one. The leading and trailing white segments remain untouched.\n\nThe Python code attempted to implement this logic but failed due to a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This error strongly suggests that the code was treating the input grid as a 1D array, while it was likely being passed as a 2D array (specifically, a 1xN grid). Standard NumPy operations on 2D arrays, when used in contexts expecting single boolean values (like `if` conditions comparing array slices or elements incorrectly indexed), can lead to this error.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input structure (likely 1xN 2D array).\n2.  Verify the segment identification, dominant color finding, and replacement logic against all examples using this 2D structure assumption.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to explicitly handle the 1xN grid structure and clarify the indexing/selection process.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n"
