objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - shape: 1 row, variable columns (N)
      - description: The overall input and output structure.
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - scope: row
      - color: white (0)
      - location: start_columns_or_end_columns
      - description: Contiguous sequences of white pixels at the beginning or end of the single row. Can be empty.
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - scope: row
      - color: mixed_non_white
      - location: middle_columns
      - description: The core contiguous sequence of columns containing non-white pixels within the single row. It has one dominant color and potentially other 'impurity' non-white colors.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - location: within_middle_segment_columns
      - color: non_white
      - role: dominant_color OR impurity_color
relationships:
  - type: framing
    description: The white segments (columns) frame the non-white segment (columns) within the single row.
  - type: dominance
    description: Within the non-white segment, one color appears more frequently than others.
actions:
  - identify_segments_by_column: In the single row, determine the start and end column indices of the contiguous non-white segment. Also note the leading/trailing white segments implicitly.
  - find_dominant_color: Analyze the pixels within the identified non-white column range. Determine the most frequent non-white color (dominant color).
  - replace_impurities: Iterate through the pixels within the non-white column range. Change the color of any pixel that is non-white *and* not the dominant color to become the dominant color.
  - preserve_structure: Ensure the output grid retains the 1xN shape and that pixels outside the identified non-white column range (i.e., the leading/trailing white pixels) are unchanged.
invariance:
  - The grid shape (1xN) remains unchanged.
  - The colors and positions of pixels in the leading and trailing white segments (columns) remain unchanged.
  - The positions of pixels within the central segment remain unchanged, only their colors might change.
  - Pixels originally having the dominant color within the central segment remain unchanged.
transformation_goal: Homogenize the central non-white segment of the single row grid to its dominant color, preserving the surrounding white pixels and grid structure.
