**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output are represented as 1D arrays (or effectively 1xN grids) of colored pixels.
Each input array consists of three main parts:
1.  An optional sequence of white (0) pixels at the beginning.
2.  A central sequence of non-white pixels. This central sequence primarily consists of one dominant color but may contain isolated pixels of other non-white colors.
3.  An optional sequence of white (0) pixels at the end.

The transformation focuses solely on the central sequence of non-white pixels. Within this sequence, it identifies the color that appears most frequently (the dominant color). Then, it replaces all other non-white pixels within this central sequence with the dominant color. The leading and trailing white pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
color_palette:
  - white (0)
  - maroon (9)
  - red (2)
  - magenta (6)
  - gray (5)
  - azure (8)
objects:
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: start_or_end
      - description: Sequences of white pixels that frame the central active area. Can be empty.
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - color: mixed_non_white
      - location: middle
      - description: The core sequence containing non-white pixels. It has one dominant color and potentially other 'impurity' non-white colors.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: non_white
      - location: within_middle_segment
      - role: dominant_color OR impurity_color
relationships:
  - type: framing
    description: The white segments frame the non-white segment.
  - type: dominance
    description: Within the non-white segment, one color appears more frequently than others.
actions:
  - identify_segments: Separate the input into leading white, middle non-white, and trailing white segments.
  - find_dominant_color: Determine the most frequent color within the middle non-white segment.
  - replace_impurities: Change the color of all non-dominant, non-white pixels within the middle segment to the dominant color.
  - reconstruct: Combine the (potentially modified) segments back into the final output array.
invariance:
  - The leading and trailing white segments remain unchanged.
  - The length of the array remains unchanged.
  - The dominant color pixels within the middle segment remain unchanged.
transformation_goal: Homogenize the central non-white segment to its dominant color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array.
2.  Identify the start index and end index of the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the input array. Let these be `start_index` and `end_index`. If no non-white pixels exist, the input is the output.
3.  Extract the sub-array corresponding to this non-white sequence (from `start_index` to `end_index`, inclusive).
4.  Count the occurrences of each non-white color within this sub-array.
5.  Determine the color with the highest count (the dominant color).
6.  Iterate through the sub-array (from `start_index` to `end_index` in the original array). For each pixel in this range:
    *   If the pixel's color is not white (0) and not the dominant color, change its color in the output array to the dominant color.
7.  Return the modified output array.
