An optional sequence of white (0) pixels at the beginning.\n2.  A central sequence of non-white pixels. This central sequence primarily consists of one dominant color but may contain isolated pixels of other non-white colors.\n3.  An optional sequence of white (0) pixels at the end.\n\nThe transformation focuses solely on the central sequence of non-white pixels. Within this sequence, it identifies the color that appears most frequently (the dominant color). Then, it replaces all other non-white pixels within this central sequence with the dominant color. The leading and trailing white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
