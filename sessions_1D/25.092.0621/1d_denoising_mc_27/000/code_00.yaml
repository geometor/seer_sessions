task_type: array_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
color_palette:
  - white (0)
  - maroon (9)
  - red (2)
  - magenta (6)
  - gray (5)
  - azure (8)
objects:
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: start_or_end
      - description: Sequences of white pixels that frame the central active area. Can be empty.
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - color: mixed_non_white
      - location: middle
      - description: The core sequence containing non-white pixels. It has one dominant color and potentially other 'impurity' non-white colors.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: non_white
      - location: within_middle_segment
      - role: dominant_color OR impurity_color
relationships:
  - type: framing
    description: The white segments frame the non-white segment.
  - type: dominance
    description: Within the non-white segment, one color appears more frequently than others.
actions:
  - identify_segments: Separate the input into leading white, middle non-white, and trailing white segments.
  - find_dominant_color: Determine the most frequent color within the middle non-white segment.
  - replace_impurities: Change the color of all non-dominant, non-white pixels within the middle segment to the dominant color.
  - reconstruct: Combine the (potentially modified) segments back into the final output array.
invariance:
  - The leading and trailing white segments remain unchanged.
  - The length of the array remains unchanged.
  - The dominant color pixels within the middle segment remain unchanged.
transformation_goal: Homogenize the central non-white segment to its dominant color.
