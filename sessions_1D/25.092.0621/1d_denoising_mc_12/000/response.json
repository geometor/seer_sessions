            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both single rows (1D grids).\n2.  **Content:** Each row contains a sequence of pixels, primarily composed of white pixels (0) acting as padding or background on the ends, and a central contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n3.  **Central Object:** The core element is this central block of non-white pixels.\n4.  **Color Dominance:** Within the central non-white block, one color appears much more frequently than any other non-white color. I'll call this the \"dominant color\".\n5.  **Impurities:** Other non-white colors exist within this block, acting like \"impurities\" or noise amidst the dominant color.\n6.  **Transformation:** The transformation focuses solely on the central non-white block. It identifies the dominant color within this block and then replaces all other non-white pixels (the impurities) within that same block with the dominant color. The white background pixels remain unchanged.\n7.  **Example Walkthrough (Train 1):**\n    *   Input: `... 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 9 6 6 6 2 6 6 6 6 9 6 4 6 6 6 ...`\n    *   Central block identified.\n    *   Dominant color is magenta (6).\n    *   Impurity colors are maroon (9), red (2), and yellow (4).\n    *   Transformation replaces 9, 2, 9, 4 with 6.\n    *   Output: `... 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 ...`\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Examine only the pixels within this identified non-white block.\n4.  Count the frequency of each non-white color within this block.\n5.
