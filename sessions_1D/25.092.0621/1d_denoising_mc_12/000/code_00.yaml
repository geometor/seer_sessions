Task: Color homogenization within a non-white segment.

Examples:
  - Input:
      Grid: A single row (1D array).
      Objects:
        - Background: Contiguous blocks of white pixels (0) at the start and/or end.
        - Central Segment: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      Properties:
        - Central Segment has a dominant non-white color (most frequent).
        - Central Segment may contain other non-white 'impurity' colors.
      Example 1 Dominant Color: Magenta (6)
      Example 1 Impurity Colors: Maroon (9), Red (2), Yellow (4)
      Example 2 Dominant Color: Magenta (6)
      Example 2 Impurity Colors: Yellow (4)
      Example 3 Dominant Color: Green (3)
      Example 3 Impurity Colors: Blue (1)
  - Output:
      Grid: A single row, same dimensions as input.
      Objects:
        - Background: Identical to input background.
        - Central Segment: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels, now consisting entirely of the dominant color identified in the input.
      Relationship to Input:
        - Background pixels are unchanged.
        - Pixels within the central segment that were already the dominant color are unchanged.
        - Pixels within the central segment that were 'impurity' colors are changed to the dominant color.

Transformation:
  Action: Replace 'impurity' colors within the central non-white segment with the segment's dominant color.
  Scope: Only applies to the single contiguous block of non-white pixels. White pixels are unaffected.
