Transformation Rule:
Given a 2D input grid (specifically 1xN in the examples), identify the contiguous central segment of non-white pixels within the first row. 
Determine the most frequent color within this central segment (the background color).
Replace any pixel within the central segment (in the first row) whose color is different from the background color with the background color.
Leave all white border pixels (value 0) and any pixels outside the identified segment unchanged.
Return the modified grid.
