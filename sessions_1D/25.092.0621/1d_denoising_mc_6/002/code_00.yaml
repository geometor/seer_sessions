Task: "Clean" a central colored segment within a potentially 2D grid (examples are 1xN).

Examples:
  - ID: train_1
    Input: A 1x33 grid with white borders, a central segment primarily azure (8), containing two red (2) impurities.
    Output: The same grid, but the red (2) pixels are replaced with azure (8).
  - ID: train_2
    Input: A 1x32 grid with white borders, a central segment primarily blue (1), containing one gray (5) impurity.
    Output: The same grid, but the gray (5) pixel is replaced with blue (1).
  - ID: train_3
    Input: A 1x31 grid with white borders, a central segment primarily azure (8), containing one orange (7) and one green (3) impurity.
    Output: The same grid, but the orange (7) and green (3) pixels are replaced with azure (8).

Input Structure: 2D NumPy array (all examples are 1 row, N columns).

Objects:
  - Type: Grid
    Description: A 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9).
    Properties:
      - Shape: (height, width)
      - Pixels: Integer values representing colors.
  - Type: Segment
    Description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within a row or column. In these examples, it's always within the single row.
    Properties:
      - Location: Defined by start and end indices (columns in this case) within the specific row (row 0).
      - Pixels: The sequence of pixel values within the segment.
      - Classification: Border (white=0) or Central (non-white).
  - Type: Pixel
    Description: Individual cells in the grid.
    Properties:
      - Color: Integer value 0-9.
      - Location: (row, column) index.
      - Role: Border, Background, Impurity.

Relationships:
  - The Central Segment consists of contiguous non-white pixels.
  - In these 1xN examples, the Central Segment exists entirely within row 0.
  - Impurity pixels are located *within* the Central Segment and have a color different from the Background Color.
  - The Background Color is the most frequent color value within the Central Segment's pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end columns of the Central Segment (contiguous non-white pixels) in the relevant row (row 0 for these examples).
  - Extract: Get the sequence of pixel color values from the Central Segment.
  - Determine: Find the most frequent color value among the extracted pixels (Background Color).
  - Replace: Iterate through the pixels *within the identified column range* of the Central Segment in the grid. Change the color of any Impurity pixel (pixels within the segment that are not the Background Color) to the Background Color.

Transformation:
  - Goal: Homogenize the color of the Central Segment by removing Impurity pixels.
  - Process: For the input 2D grid, identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels (in these examples, this occurs within the first row). Find the most frequent color within this segment. Create a copy of the grid. Modify the copy by replacing any pixel within that segment's boundaries that isn't the most frequent color with the most frequent color. Preserve all white pixels (value 0). Return the modified grid.
