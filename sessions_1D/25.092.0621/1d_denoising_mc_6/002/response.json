            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe error `TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'` strongly indicates that the `transform` function received a 2D NumPy array as input, even though the examples visually appeared as 1D lists in the prompt. Iterating over a 2D NumPy array yields rows (which are 1D arrays themselves). The `collections.Counter` function expects hashable items (like integers or strings) to count, but it received these 1D NumPy arrays (rows), which are mutable and therefore unhashable, causing the error within the `get_background_color` function.\n\nThe core logic of identifying a central non-white segment, finding its most frequent color, and replacing other colors within that segment seems sound based on the visual transformation in the examples. The strategy is to adapt the implementation to correctly handle 2D NumPy array inputs, specifically extracting the relevant pixel values for counting and modification, even if the grids are only 1xN or Nx1.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  Acknowledge the input is a 2D NumPy array.\n2.  Adapt the `find_central_segment` logic. Since the examples are 1xN, the segment finding will occur within that single row.\n3.  Modify `get_background_color` to correctly count integer pixel values from the relevant segment of the 2D array, not entire row arrays.\n4.  Ensure the main `transform` function operates correctly on the 2D array structure.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the structure and how `Counter` interacts with a potential 1xN NumPy array."

Identify this primary axis/row. *Correction based on examples: Operate specifically on the first row if it contains non-white pixels, otherwise check subsequent rows. Since all examples are 1xN, focus on row 0.*\n3.  Scan the target row (row 0) to find the start and end column indices of the contiguous sequence of non-white (not 0) pixels. This defines the \"Central Segment\".\n4.  If no Central Segment is found in the target row (the row is all white or doesn't exist), return the input grid unchanged.\n5.  Extract the 1D sequence of pixel *values* from the Central Segment (i.e., from the target row between the start and end column indices).\n6.  Determine the most frequent color value within this extracted sequence. This is the \"Background Color\". If there are ties for the most frequent color, any one of the most frequent colors can be chosen (the examples suggest the dominant color is clearly identifiable).\n7.
