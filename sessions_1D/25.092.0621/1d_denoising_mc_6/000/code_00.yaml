Task: "Clean" a central colored segment within a 1D grid.

Examples:
  - ID: train_1
    Input: A 1D grid with white borders, a central segment primarily azure (8), containing two red (2) impurities.
    Output: The same grid, but the red (2) pixels are replaced with azure (8).
  - ID: train_2
    Input: A 1D grid with white borders, a central segment primarily blue (1), containing one gray (5) impurity.
    Output: The same grid, but the gray (5) pixel is replaced with blue (1).
  - ID: train_3
    Input: A 1D grid with white borders, a central segment primarily azure (8), containing one orange (7) and one green (3) impurity.
    Output: The same grid, but the orange (7) and green (3) pixels are replaced with azure (8).

Objects:
  - Type: Segment
    Description: Contiguous sequences of pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: The value of the pixels within the segment.
      - Location: Start and end indices.
      - Classification: Border (white=0) or Central (non-white).
  - Type: Pixel
    Description: Individual cells in the grid.
    Properties:
      - Color: Integer value 0-9.
      - Location: Index within the 1D grid.
      - Role: Border, Background, Impurity.

Relationships:
  - Impurity pixels are located *within* the Central segment.
  - The Central segment is surrounded by Border segments.
  - The Background color is the most frequent non-white color within the Central segment.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the Central segment (contiguous non-white pixels).
  - Determine: Find the most frequent color within the Central segment (Background color).
  - Replace: Change the color of any Impurity pixel (pixels within the Central segment that are not the Background color) to the Background color.

Transformation:
  - Goal: Homogenize the color of the Central segment by removing Impurity pixels.
  - Process: Identify the background color of the non-white segment and replace any other non-white colors within that segment with the background color. Preserve the white border pixels.
