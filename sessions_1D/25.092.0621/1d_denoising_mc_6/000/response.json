Outer border sections of white pixels (value 0).\n2.  A central contiguous section of non-white pixels.\n3.  Within this central section, there is a dominant \"background\" color (azure (8) in examples 1 and 3, blue (1) in example 2).\n4.  Also within the central section, there are one or more \"impurity\" pixels of different colors (red (2) in example 1, gray (5) in example 2, orange (7) and green (3) in example 3).\n\nThe transformation appears to involve identifying these impurity pixels within the central non-white segment and replacing them with the dominant background color of that segment. The white border pixels remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
