*   **Perception:**
    The task involves modifying pixels within a grid based on the frequency of colors present. In each example, there's a primary background color (excluding white) and one or more 'outlier' pixels of different colors embedded within this background region. The transformation replaces these outlier pixels with the dominant background color. White pixels remain unchanged.

```yaml
    examples:
      train_1:
        input:
          grid_size: [3, 12]
          dominant_color: magenta (6)
          outlier_pixels:
            - color: yellow (4)
              location: [1, 4]
          boundary_color: white (0)
        output:
          grid_size: [3, 12]
          change: The yellow pixel at [1, 4] was changed to magenta (6).
          unchanged: All magenta and white pixels.
      train_2:
        input:
          grid_size: [5, 7]
          dominant_color: yellow (4)
          outlier_pixels:
            - color: maroon (9)
              location: [2, 0]
            - color: maroon (9)
              location: [2, 6]
          boundary_color: white (0)
        output:
          grid_size: [5, 7]
          change: The maroon pixels at [2, 0] and [2, 6] were changed to yellow (4).
          unchanged: All yellow and white pixels.
      train_3:
        input:
          grid_size: [5, 7]
          dominant_color: red (2)
          outlier_pixels:
            - color: blue (1)
              location: [0, 6]
            - color: blue (1)
              location: [2, 3]
            - color: orange (7)
              location: [2, 4]
            - color: azure (8)
              location: [2, 5]
          boundary_color: white (0)
        output:
          grid_size: [5, 7]
          change: The blue pixels at [0, 6] and [2, 3], the orange pixel at [2, 4], and the azure pixel at [2, 5] were changed to red (2).
          unchanged: All red and white pixels.
    transformation:
      - identify the most frequent color in the input grid, ignoring white (0). This is the 'dominant color'.
      - iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
      - if a pixel's color is neither white (0) nor the dominant color, replace its color with the dominant color.
      - otherwise, keep the pixel's color unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Analyze the input grid to determine the frequency of each color, excluding white (0).
    2.  Identify the color with the highest frequency (the 'dominant color').
    3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    4.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid.
    5.  For each pixel, check if its color is different from both white (0) and the identified dominant color.
    6.  If the pixel's color meets this condition (it's neither white nor the dominant color), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the dominant color.
    7.  If the pixel's color is either white (0) or the dominant color, leave the corresponding pixel in the output grid unchanged.
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
