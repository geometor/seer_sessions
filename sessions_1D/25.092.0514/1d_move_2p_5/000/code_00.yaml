task_description: Shift a horizontal block of non-white pixels two positions to the right.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_relation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    color: Non-white (values 2, 3, 4 observed)
    quantity: Exactly one per grid
    properties:
      - color_remains_constant
      - shape_remains_constant (length in this 1D case)
  - object_type: background
    color: white (value 0)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: non-white contiguous block
    attributes:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - color
  - action: shift
    target: non-white contiguous block
    direction: right
    distance: 2 pixels (or indices)
relationships:
  - The non-white block is surrounded by the white background.
  - The position of the block in the output grid is determined by its position in the input grid plus a fixed offset.
