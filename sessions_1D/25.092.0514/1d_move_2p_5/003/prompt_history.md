Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are single-row grids (or 1D arrays) of pixels. Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (red, green, or yellow in the examples) surrounded by white pixels (0). The output grid is the same size as the input grid and contains the same non-white block, but its position has changed. The non-white block appears to be shifted horizontally to the right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a horizontal block of non-white pixels two positions to the right.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_relation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    color: Non-white (values 2, 3, 4 observed)
    quantity: Exactly one per grid
    properties:
      - color_remains_constant
      - shape_remains_constant (length in this 1D case)
  - object_type: background
    color: white (value 0)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: non-white contiguous block
    attributes:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - color
  - action: shift
    target: non-white contiguous block
    direction: right
    distance: 2 pixels (or indices)
relationships:
  - The non-white block is surrounded by the white background.
  - The position of the block in the output grid is determined by its position in the input grid plus a fixed offset.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Determine its color, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Create a new row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Copy the identified non-white block into the new row, placing it such that its starting index is exactly 2 greater than its original starting index in the input row.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'

## Example 2:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'

## Example 3:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred because the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string representation of the grid, while the testing environment provided the input as a NumPy array. The core transformation logic (identifying a non-white block and shifting it right by 2) appears correct based on the initial examples, but the function's input handling needs modification.

The strategy is to rewrite the `transform` function to directly accept a NumPy array as input and return a NumPy array as output. The helper function `find_block_1d` also needs to be adjusted to work with a NumPy array row.

**Metrics:**

Let's re-examine the examples assuming the input is a 1D NumPy array.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Length 25)
    *   Block: Color=2, Start=9, Length=9
    *   Expected Output Start: 9 + 2 = 11
    *   Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0]` (Correct)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Length 25)
    *   Block: Color=3, Start=7, Length=11
    *   Expected Output Start: 7 + 2 = 9
    *   Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0]` (Correct)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Length 25)
    *   Block: Color=4, Start=9, Length=6
    *   Expected Output Start: 9 + 2 = 11
    *   Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Correct)

The analysis confirms the transformation rule: shift the single non-white block two positions to the right.

**Facts:**

    quantity: Exactly one per grid

      - shape_remains_constant (length)
  - object_type: background
    color: white (value 0)

  - action: draw_block

    position: start_index (column) = input_start_index + 2
relationships:

  - The position of the block in the output grid is determined by its position in the input grid plus a fixed horizontal offset of +2.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid as a 1D NumPy array (representing a single row).
2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Determine its color, starting column index, and length.
3.  Create a new 1D NumPy array of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the output grid by adding 2 to the starting column index found in the input grid.
5.  Copy the identified non-white block (using its color and length) into the new output array, starting at the calculated target starting column index.
6.  Return the modified output array.
