task_description: Shift a horizontal block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1-row NumPy array)
  - size_relation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (length).
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    color: Non-white (values 2, 3, 4 observed)
    quantity: Exactly one per grid
    properties:
      - horizontal (spans columns in the single row)
      - color_remains_constant
      - shape_remains_constant (length)
  - object_type: background
    color: white (value 0)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: non-white contiguous block in the input row
    attributes:
      - color
      - start_index (column)
      - length
  - action: create_output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input
      - initial_fill: white (0)
  - action: draw_block
    target: output_grid
    source_attributes: color, length (from identified block)
    position: start_index (column) = input_start_index + 2
relationships:
  - The non-white block is surrounded by the white background in the input.
  - The position of the block in the output grid is determined by its position in the input grid plus a fixed horizontal offset of +2.
