            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred because the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string representation of the grid, while the testing environment provided the input as a NumPy array. The core transformation logic (identifying a non-white block and shifting it right by 2) appears correct based on the initial examples, but the function's input handling needs modification.\n\nThe strategy is to rewrite the `transform` function to directly accept a NumPy array as input and return a NumPy array as output. The helper function `find_block_1d` also needs to be adjusted to work with a NumPy array row.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples assuming the input is a 1D NumPy array.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Length 25)\n    *   Block: Color=2, Start=9, Length=9\n    *   Expected Output Start: 9 + 2 = 11\n    *   Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0]` (Correct)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Length 25)\n    *   Block: Color=3, Start=7, Length=11\n    *   Expected Output Start: 7 + 2 = 9\n    *   Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0]` (Correct)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Length 25)\n    *   Block: Color=4, Start=9, Length=6\n    *   Expected Output Start: 9 + 2 = 11\n    *   Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Correct)\n\nThe analysis confirms the transformation rule: shift the single non-white block two positions to the right.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
