Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are single-row grids (or 1D arrays) of pixels. Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (red, green, or yellow in the examples) surrounded by white pixels (0). The output grid is the same size as the input grid and contains the same non-white block, but its position has changed. The non-white block appears to be shifted horizontally to the right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a horizontal block of non-white pixels two positions to the right.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_relation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    color: Non-white (values 2, 3, 4 observed)
    quantity: Exactly one per grid
    properties:
      - color_remains_constant
      - shape_remains_constant (length in this 1D case)
  - object_type: background
    color: white (value 0)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: non-white contiguous block
    attributes:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - color
  - action: shift
    target: non-white contiguous block
    direction: right
    distance: 2 pixels (or indices)
relationships:
  - The non-white block is surrounded by the white background.
  - The position of the block in the output grid is determined by its position in the input grid plus a fixed offset.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Determine its color, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Create a new row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Copy the identified non-white block into the new row, placing it such that its starting index is exactly 2 greater than its original starting index in the input row.
```python
"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying the single contiguous horizontal block
of non-white pixels and shifting it two positions to the right. The grid size
and the block's color and length remain unchanged. The background is white (0).
