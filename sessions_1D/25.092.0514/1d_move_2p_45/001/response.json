Identifying the non-white contiguous segment in the input grid (its color, starting position, and length).\n2. Creating an output grid of the same dimensions, initialized with the background color (white, 0).\n3. Placing the identified segment into the output grid, shifted two positions to the right from its original starting position.\n4. Handling boundary conditions: If the shifted segment extends beyond the right edge of the grid, the exceeding part is clipped. Positions vacated by the segment on the left are filled with the background color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_segment(grid_row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous segment of non-background color in a 1D array.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_row: A 1D numpy array representing a row of the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (color, start_index, length) if a segment is found,\n        otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n    segment_color = None\n    start_index = -1\n    length = 0\n    \n    for i, pixel_color in enumerate(grid_row):\n        if pixel_color != 0:  # Found a non-white pixel\n            if start_index == -1: # Start of a new segment\n                segment_color = pixel_color\n                start_index = i\n                length = 1\n            elif pixel_color == segment_color: # Continuing the current segment\n                 length += 1\n            else: # Found a different color, stop (assuming only one segment)\n                 break \n        elif start_index != -1: # End of the segment (hit background)\n            break # Stop after finding the first segment\n\n    if start_index != -1:\n        return segment_color, start_index, length\n    else:\n        return None\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Shifts the single contiguous non-white segment in a 1xN grid two positions to the right.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A numpy array representing the input grid (expected to be 1xN).\n\n    Returns:\n        A numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a numpy array\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    \n    # Get grid dimensions (assuming 1 row as per examples)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid with background color (white, 0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid) \n\n    # Extract the first row (as it's effectively 1D)\n    input_row = input_grid[0, :]\n\n    # Find the non-white segment in the input row\n    segment_info = find_segment(input_row)\n\n    if segment_info:\n        segment_color, start_col, segment_length = segment_info\n        \n        # Calculate the new starting column index\n        new_start_col = start_col + 2\n        \n        # Place the segment in the output grid, handling boundaries\n        for i in range(segment_length):\n            target_col = new_start_col + i\n            \n            # Check if the target column is within the grid bounds\n            if 0 <= target_col < cols:\n                output_grid[0, target_col] = segment_color\n\n    # If no segment was found, the output grid remains all background, which is correct.\n    return output_grid\n```"
