"""
This program transforms a 1D input grid by shifting the single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels two positions to the right. 

The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the non-white contiguous segment in the input grid (its color, starting position, and length).
2. Creating an output grid of the same dimensions, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
3. Placing the identified segment into the output grid, shifted two positions to the right from its original starting position.
4. Handling boundary conditions: If the shifted segment extends beyond the right edge of the grid, the exceeding part is clipped. Positions vacated by the segment on the left are filled with the background color.
