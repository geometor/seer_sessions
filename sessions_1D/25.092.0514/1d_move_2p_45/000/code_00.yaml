task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 1D (effectively, operating on rows)
grid_properties:
  - size: Constant between input and output (1x16 in examples).
  - background_color: white (0).
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    shape: Fills the grid except for the foreground object.
  - type: foreground_segment
    count: 1 per input grid
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., blue '1', magenta '6')
    shape: contiguous horizontal segment
    properties:
      - length: variable
      - starting_position: variable
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    input: input_grid
    output: foreground_segment_details (color, start_index, length)
  - name: shift_segment
    target: foreground_segment
    parameters:
      - direction: right
      - magnitude: 2 positions
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    input: original_grid_size, background_color, shifted_segment_details
    output: output_grid
    details: Create a background grid, then place the shifted segment, handling boundary conditions (clipping segment if it exceeds the right boundary).
relationships:
  - The position of the segment in the output is determined by its position in the input plus a fixed offset (2).
  - The color and length of the segment remain unchanged.
  - The grid size remains constant.
boundary_conditions:
  - Clipping: If the shifted segment extends beyond the right grid boundary, the exceeding part is cut off.
  - Filling: Positions originally occupied by the segment (before the shift) become background color in the output.
