Each input grid features a single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels against a white background. The core transformation is a horizontal shift of this non-white block. Consistently across all examples, this block is moved exactly two positions to the right. The grid dimensions remain unchanged. Pixels shifted off the right edge are discarded, and the positions vacated by the block on the left are filled with the background white color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
