## Perception

The task involves processing single-row grids (1xN). Each input grid features a single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels against a white background. The core transformation is a horizontal shift of this non-white block. Consistently across all examples, this block is moved exactly two positions to the right. The grid dimensions remain unchanged. Pixels shifted off the right edge are discarded, and the positions vacated by the block on the left are filled with the background white color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 1D (effectively, operating on rows)
grid_properties:
  - size: Constant between input and output (1x16 in examples).
  - background_color: white (0).
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    shape: Fills the grid except for the foreground object.
  - type: foreground_segment
    count: 1 per input grid
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., blue '1', magenta '6')
    shape: contiguous horizontal segment
    properties:
      - length: variable
      - starting_position: variable
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    input: input_grid
    output: foreground_segment_details (color, start_index, length)
  - name: shift_segment
    target: foreground_segment
    parameters:
      - direction: right
      - magnitude: 2 positions
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    input: original_grid_size, background_color, shifted_segment_details
    output: output_grid
    details: Create a background grid, then place the shifted segment, handling boundary conditions (clipping segment if it exceeds the right boundary).
relationships:
  - The position of the segment in the output is determined by its position in the input plus a fixed offset (2).
  - The color and length of the segment remain unchanged.
  - The grid size remains constant.
boundary_conditions:
  - Clipping: If the shifted segment extends beyond the right grid boundary, the exceeding part is cut off.
  - Filling: Positions originally occupied by the segment (before the shift) become background color in the output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first non-white pixel. This marks the start of the foreground segment. Record its starting column index (`start_col`) and color.
3.  Continue scanning from `start_col` to find the end of the contiguous segment of the same non-white color. Record its length (`segment_length`).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the segment in the output grid: `new_start_col = start_col + 2`.
5.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `segment_length - 1`. For each `i`:
    a. Calculate the target column index in the output grid: `target_col = new_start_col + i`.
    b. Check if `target_col` is within the bounds of the grid width.
    c. If it is within bounds, set the pixel at `(row 0, target_col)` in the output grid to the color of the segment identified in step 2.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
