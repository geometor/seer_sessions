task_type: array_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row

elements:
  - element_type: block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., blue, green, azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - position: Defined by the start index within the row.
      - count: Exactly one such block exists in each input.
  - element_type: background
    description: Pixels with the white color (0).
    properties:
      - location: Can appear before and/or after the non-white block.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The non-white block is embedded within the white background pixels in the row.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: non-white block
    attributes:
      - color
      - length
      - start_index
  - action: shift
    target: non-white block
    details: Move the block 2 positions to the right.
  - action: reconstruct
    target: output row
    details: Create a new row of the same length as the input, placing the shifted block at its new position and filling the remaining positions with white pixels.
