Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

*   The inputs and outputs are single rows of pixels (1D grids).
*   Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (blue, green, or azure in the examples) surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
*   The non-white block can start at the very beginning of the row or be preceded by white pixels.
*   The block is always followed by white pixels.
*   In the output, the non-white block appears to have shifted 2 positions to the right compared to its position in the input.
*   The length and color of the non-white block remain unchanged.
*   The total number of white pixels remains the same, but their distribution changes: two white pixels are effectively moved from the right side of the block to the left side.
*   The overall length of the row remains constant.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row

elements:
  - element_type: block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., blue, green, azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - position: Defined by the start index within the row.
      - count: Exactly one such block exists in each input.
  - element_type: background
    description: Pixels with the white color (0).
    properties:
      - location: Can appear before and/or after the non-white block.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The non-white block is embedded within the white background pixels in the row.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: non-white block
    attributes:
      - color
      - length
      - start_index
  - action: shift
    target: non-white block
    details: Move the block 2 positions to the right.
  - action: reconstruct
    target: output row
    details: Create a new row of the same length as the input, placing the shifted block at its new position and filling the remaining positions with white pixels.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the input row and identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
2.  Note the color, length, and starting position (index) of this block.
3.  Calculate the new starting position for the block by adding 2 to its original starting position.
4.  Create a new output row of the same total length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
5.  Place the identified non-white block (with its original color and length) into the output row, starting at the calculated new position.
