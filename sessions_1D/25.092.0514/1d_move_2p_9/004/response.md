*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided code failed on all training examples with an identical error: `ValueError: Input grid must be a list containing exactly one list (row).` This indicates that the validation step at the beginning of the `transform` function rejected the input format it received. The validation expects the input `input_grid` to be a list containing exactly one element, which itself must be a list (representing the single row). The error suggests the input provided during testing did not conform to this `List[List[int]]` structure (e.g., it might have been passed as a flat list `List[int]`).

    The core logic for identifying the contiguous non-white block and shifting it two positions to the right has not been tested due to this initial validation failure. The strategy for resolution is to ensure the input data passed to the function strictly adheres to the expected `List[List[int]]` format, as is standard for ARC tasks, even for single-row grids. Assuming the input format is corrected, the existing block-finding and shifting logic should then be evaluated.

*   **Metrics:**
    The primary metric from the execution results is the consistent failure mode across all examples.
    *   Example 1: Failed - Input validation error.
    *   Example 2: Failed - Input validation error.
    *   Example 3: Failed - Input validation error.

    Let's analyze the structure of the grids themselves, assuming they are correctly formatted as `List[List[int]]`:

``` python
import numpy as np

# Representing inputs as List[List[int]]
train_inputs = [
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
    [[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
]

# Define the find_contiguous_block function (from previous code) to analyze block properties
def find_contiguous_block(row: np.ndarray) -> tuple:
    start_index = None
    color = None
    length = 0
    width = len(row)
    for i in range(width):
        if row[i] != 0:
            start_index = i
            color = row[i]
            break
    if start_index is not None:
        for i in range(start_index, width):
            if row[i] == color:
                length += 1
            else:
                break
    return start_index, color, length

# Analyze each input
analysis_results = []
for i, grid in enumerate(train_inputs):
    row = np.array(grid[0])
    width = len(row)
    start, color, length = find_contiguous_block(row)
    analysis_results.append({
        "example": i + 1,
        "grid_width": width,
        "block_start_index": start,
        "block_color": color,
        "block_length": length,
        "expected_new_start": start + 2 if start is not None else None
    })

print(analysis_results)
```
```
[{'example': 1, 'grid_width': 25, 'block_start_index': 9, 'block_color': np.int64(4), 'block_length': 10, 'expected_new_start': 11}, {'example': 2, 'grid_width': 25, 'block_start_index': 7, 'block_color': np.int64(7), 'block_length': 14, 'expected_new_start': 9}, {'example': 3, 'grid_width': 25, 'block_start_index': 3, 'block_color': np.int64(5), 'block_length': 7, 'expected_new_start': 5}]

```
*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1xN grid)
    input_format: List[List[int]] containing exactly one inner list (row).
    output_format: List[List[int]] containing exactly one inner list (row), same width as input.
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        properties:
          - color: non-white (varies: yellow(4), orange(7), gray(5))
          - shape: horizontal segment
          - length: variable (10, 14, 7 in examples)
          - count: 1 per grid
          - location: defined by starting index (9, 7, 3 in examples)
    actions:
      - name: horizontal_shift
        target: contiguous_block
        properties:
          - direction: right
          - distance: 2 pixels
        effects:
          - block's starting index increases by 2.
          - block maintains its original color and length.
          - pixels at the block's new location are overwritten with the block's color.
          - pixels at the block's original location (if not overlapped by the shifted block) become background_color.
          - grid dimensions remain constant.
          - if the shift causes the block to extend beyond the right edge, the overflowing part is truncated.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Receive the input grid, ensuring it is a list containing exactly one list (the row of pixels). Let the width of the row be `W`.
    2.  Create a new output row of width `W`, filled entirely with the background color ('white' - 0).
    3.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the first non-white pixel. This marks the `start_index` of the contiguous block. If no non-white pixel is found, return the all-white output row.
    4.  Record the `color` of the pixel at the `start_index`.
    5.  Determine the `length` of the contiguous block by counting how many pixels from the `start_index` onwards share the same `color`.
    6.  Calculate the `new_start_index` for the block in the output row by adding 2 to the original `start_index`.
    7.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `length - 1`:
        a.  Calculate the target index in the output row: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
        b.  If `target_index` is within the bounds of the output row (i.e., `0 <= target_index < W`), set the pixel at `output_row[target_index]` to the block's `color`.
    8.  Return the output row, wrapped in a list to match the required `List[List[int]]` format.
