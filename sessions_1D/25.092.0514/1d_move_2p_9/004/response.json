            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The provided code failed on all training examples with an identical error: `ValueError: Input grid must be a list containing exactly one list (row).` This indicates that the validation step at the beginning of the `transform` function rejected the input format it received. The validation expects the input `input_grid` to be a list containing exactly one element, which itself must be a list (representing the single row). The error suggests the input provided during testing did not conform to this `List[List[int]]` structure (e.g., it might have been passed as a flat list `List[int]`).\n\n    The core logic for identifying the contiguous non-white block and shifting it two positions to the right has not been tested due to this initial validation failure. The strategy for resolution is to ensure the input data passed to the function strictly adheres to the expected `List[List[int]]` format, as is standard for ARC tasks, even for single-row grids. Assuming the input format is corrected, the existing block-finding and shifting logic should then be evaluated.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The primary metric from the execution results is the consistent failure mode across all examples.\n    *   Example 1: Failed - Input validation error.\n    *   Example 2: Failed - Input validation error.\n    *   Example 3: Failed - Input validation error.\n\n    Let's analyze the structure of the grids themselves, assuming they are correctly formatted as `List[List[int]]`:\n"
