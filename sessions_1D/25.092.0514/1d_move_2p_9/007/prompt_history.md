*   **Perception**: The task operates on single-row grids. Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color ('yellow', 'orange', or 'gray' in the examples) surrounded by 'white' (0) background pixels. The output grid is the same size as the input grid. The transformation involves shifting the non-white block horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. The block retains its original color and length. The space vacated by the block on the left becomes 'white', and the block overwrites the 'white' pixels as it moves right.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        properties:
          - color: non-white (varies per example: yellow(4), orange(7), gray(5))
          - shape: horizontal segment
          - length: variable
          - count: 1 per grid
    actions:
      - name: horizontal_shift
        target: contiguous_block
        properties:
          - direction: right
          - distance: 2 pixels
        effects:
          - block moves 2 positions to the right
          - block maintains color and length
          - vacated positions become background_color
          - grid dimensions remain constant
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the input grid (a single row of pixels).
    2.  Locate the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels. Record its color, starting index, and length.
    3.  Create a new output grid of the same length as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color ('white' - 0).
    4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
    5.  Copy the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new index. Ensure the block does not extend beyond the grid boundaries (though in these examples, it doesn't appear to).

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing at least one non-empty list (row).

## Example 2:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing at least one non-empty list (row).

## Example 3:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing at least one non-empty list (row).
## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it assumed the input `input_grid` to the `transform` function would be a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[0, 0, 4, 4, 0]]`), representing a 2D grid with one row. However, the error message "Input grid must be a list containing at least one non-empty list (row)" suggests that the input received during testing was likely a flat list (e.g., `[0, 0, 4, 4, 0]`) or potentially structured differently than expected by the validation checks. The core transformation logic (finding a contiguous block and shifting it right by 2) appears consistent with the examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Adjust the `transform` function to correctly handle the actual input format provided by the testing environment. Based on the error and typical ARC task structures, the input might be passed as a single list representing the row, or potentially still as `List[List[int]]` but failing a specific validation check condition. Given the consistency of the error, assuming the input is directly the row (`List[int]`) seems the most likely scenario to test first.
2.  Ensure the function still returns the output in the required ARC format (`List[List[int]]`).
3.  Re-verify the block properties and shift amount using code execution on the provided examples.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the properties of the blocks and the shift in each training example.

**Findings:**

*   **Shift:** The calculated shift is consistently +2 pixels to the right in all examples where the block properties match.
*   **Block Matching:** Examples 2 and 3 show perfect matching of color and length between input and output blocks.
*   **Example 1 Anomaly:** In Example 1, the input block has length 10, but the output block has length 9. This indicates that the block is truncated when it hits the right edge of the grid during the shift. The calculated shift is still +2 (11 - 9).
*   **Grid Width:** All examples use a width of 25.
*   **Input Format:** While the analysis code used `List[List[int]]`, the original error implies the `transform` function received something else. However, the core logic derived from the `List[List[int]]` structure (1 row, find block, shift right by 2, handle truncation) remains valid based on the visual examples and the analysis results. The implementation needs to adapt to the actual input format provided during testing, while still producing the `List[List[int]]` output.

## Updated Facts


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row presented, potentially within a List[List[int]] or directly as List[int])
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: non-white (varies: yellow(4), orange(7), gray(5))
      - shape: horizontal segment
      - length: variable (consistent between input/output unless truncated)
      - count: 1 per grid (or 0 if grid is all white)
actions:
  - name: horizontal_shift_and_truncate
    target: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 pixels
    effects:
      - block's starting position moves 2 indices to the right.
      - block maintains its original color.
      - block maintains its original length *unless* the shift causes it to extend beyond the right grid boundary.
      - if the shifted block exceeds the boundary, it is truncated to fit within the grid width.
      - vacated positions become background_color (white).
      - grid dimensions remain constant.
input_format_handling: Needs adjustment to accept the format provided by the test environment (likely List[int] for the row data).
output_format_requirement: Must return List[List[int]].
```


## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid data, expecting data representing a single row (potentially as a flat list `List[int]`).
2.  Convert the input row data into a 1D numerical array. Record its width.
3.  Initialize a new 1D numerical array (output row) of the same width, filled with the background color (white - 0).
4.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the first non-white pixel.
5.  If no non-white pixel is found, proceed to step 9 (output the initialized white row).
6.  If a non-white pixel is found, record its index as the `start_index`, its color as `block_color`, and determine the `block_length` by counting how many contiguous pixels starting from `start_index` have the `block_color`.
7.  Calculate the `new_start_index` by adding 2 to the original `start_index`.
8.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `block_length - 1`. For each `i`:
    *   Calculate the target index in the output row: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
    *   If `target_index` is within the valid bounds of the output row (i.e., `0 <= target_index < width`), set the pixel at `output_row[target_index]` to `block_color`.
9.  Convert the final output row array back into a standard list of integers.
10. Return the resulting list nested within another list, conforming to the `List[List[int]]` ARC output format.
