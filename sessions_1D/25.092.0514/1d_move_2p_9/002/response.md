**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided examples consistently show a transformation where a single contiguous block of non-white pixels within a single-row grid is shifted two positions horizontally to the right. The block's color and length remain unchanged. The background color is white (0), and areas vacated by the block become white. The previous code attempted to implement this logic using NumPy.

The Python execution resulted in a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` for all training examples. While the exact line causing this error within the provided code isn't immediately obvious (as the standard NumPy operations used *shouldn't* typically trigger this in this context), the underlying transformation logic derived from the examples appears correct and consistent.

Strategy:
1.  Confirm the transformation rule details (block identification, shift distance) using code execution for metrics.
2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on the consistent pattern observed across all examples.
3.  Acknowledge the Python error but focus on describing the *intended* transformation clearly, as the conceptual understanding seems correct. The error might stem from a subtle implementation detail or the execution environment, but the core logic of "shift right by 2" holds.
