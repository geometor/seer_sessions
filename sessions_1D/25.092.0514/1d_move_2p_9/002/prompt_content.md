"""
Transforms a single-row input grid by identifying a contiguous block of a 
single non-white color and shifting this block two positions to the right. 
The space vacated by the block becomes white (0), and the background remains white.
The block retains its original color and length.

    Finds the start index, color, and length of the first contiguous
