*   **Perception**: The task operates on single-row grids. Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color ('yellow', 'orange', or 'gray' in the examples) surrounded by 'white' (0) background pixels. The output grid is the same size as the input grid. The transformation involves shifting the non-white block horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. The block retains its original color and length. The space vacated by the block on the left becomes 'white', and the block overwrites the 'white' pixels as it moves right.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        properties:
          - color: non-white (varies per example: yellow(4), orange(7), gray(5))
          - shape: horizontal segment
          - length: variable
          - count: 1 per grid
    actions:
      - name: horizontal_shift
        target: contiguous_block
        properties:
          - direction: right
          - distance: 2 pixels
        effects:
          - block moves 2 positions to the right
          - block maintains color and length
          - vacated positions become background_color
          - grid dimensions remain constant
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the input grid (a single row of pixels).
    2.  Locate the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels. Record its color, starting index, and length.
    3.  Create a new output grid of the same length as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color ('white' - 0).
    4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
    5.  Copy the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new index. Ensure the block does not extend beyond the grid boundaries (though in these examples, it doesn't appear to).

**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided examples consistently show a transformation where a single contiguous block of non-white pixels within a single-row grid is shifted two positions horizontally to the right. The block's color and length remain unchanged. The background color is white (0), and areas vacated by the block become white. The previous code attempted to implement this logic using NumPy.

The Python execution resulted in a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` for all training examples. While the exact line causing this error within the provided code isn't immediately obvious (as the standard NumPy operations used *shouldn't* typically trigger this in this context), the underlying transformation logic derived from the examples appears correct and consistent.

Strategy:
1.  Confirm the transformation rule details (block identification, shift distance) using code execution for metrics.
2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on the consistent pattern observed across all examples.
3.  Acknowledge the Python error but focus on describing the *intended* transformation clearly, as the conceptual understanding seems correct. The error might stem from a subtle implementation detail or the execution environment, but the core logic of "shift right by 2" holds.
