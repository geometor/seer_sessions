*   **Perception**: The task operates on single-row grids. Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color ('yellow', 'orange', or 'gray' in the examples) surrounded by 'white' (0) background pixels. The output grid is the same size as the input grid. The transformation involves shifting the non-white block horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. The block retains its original color and length. The space vacated by the block on the left becomes 'white', and the block overwrites the 'white' pixels as it moves right.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

## Example 2:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing exactly one list (row).

## Example 3:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing exactly one list (row).
*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided code failed on all training examples with an identical error: `ValueError: Input grid must be a list containing exactly one list (row).` This indicates that the validation step at the beginning of the `transform` function rejected the input format it received. The validation expects the input `input_grid` to be a list containing exactly one element, which itself must be a list (representing the single row). The error suggests the input provided during testing did not conform to this `List[List[int]]` structure (e.g., it might have been passed as a flat list `List[int]`).

    The core logic for identifying the contiguous non-white block and shifting it two positions to the right has not been tested due to this initial validation failure. The strategy for resolution is to ensure the input data passed to the function strictly adheres to the expected `List[List[int]]` format, as is standard for ARC tasks, even for single-row grids. Assuming the input format is corrected, the existing block-finding and shifting logic should then be evaluated.

*   **Metrics:**
    The primary metric from the execution results is the consistent failure mode across all examples.
    *   Example 1: Failed - Input validation error.
    *   Example 2: Failed - Input validation error.
    *   Example 3: Failed - Input validation error.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Receive the input grid, ensuring it is a list containing exactly one list (the row of pixels). Let the width of the row be `W`.
    2.  Create a new output row of width `W`, filled entirely with the background color ('white' - 0).
    3.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the first non-white pixel. This marks the `start_index` of the contiguous block. If no non-white pixel is found, return the all-white output row.
    4.  Record the `color` of the pixel at the `start_index`.
    5.  Determine the `length` of the contiguous block by counting how many pixels from the `start_index` onwards share the same `color`.
    6.  Calculate the `new_start_index` for the block in the output row by adding 2 to the original `start_index`.
    7.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `length - 1`:
        a.  Calculate the target index in the output row: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
        b.  If `target_index` is within the bounds of the output row (i.e., `0 <= target_index < W`), set the pixel at `output_row[target_index]` to the block's `color`.
    8.  Return the output row, wrapped in a list to match the required `List[List[int]]` format.
