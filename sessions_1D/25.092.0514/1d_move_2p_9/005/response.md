"""
Transforms a single-row input grid by identifying the first contiguous block of a 
single non-white color and shifting this block two positions horizontally 
to the right. The space vacated by the block becomes white (0), and the 
background remains white. The block retains its original color and length, 
though it might be truncated if the shift moves it partially off the right edge 
of the grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
