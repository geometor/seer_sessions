Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color ('yellow', 'orange', or 'gray' in the examples) surrounded by 'white' (0) background pixels. The output grid is the same size as the input grid. The transformation involves shifting the non-white block horizontally to the right by a fixed amount. The block retains its original color and length. The space vacated by the block on the left becomes 'white', and the block overwrites the 'white' pixels as it moves right.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
