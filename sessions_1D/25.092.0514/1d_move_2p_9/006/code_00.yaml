task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row presented, potentially within a List[List[int]] or directly as List[int])
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: non-white (varies: yellow(4), orange(7), gray(5))
      - shape: horizontal segment
      - length: variable (consistent between input/output unless truncated)
      - count: 1 per grid (or 0 if grid is all white)
actions:
  - name: horizontal_shift_and_truncate
    target: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 pixels
    effects:
      - block's starting position moves 2 indices to the right.
      - block maintains its original color.
      - block maintains its original length *unless* the shift causes it to extend beyond the right grid boundary.
      - if the shifted block exceeds the boundary, it is truncated to fit within the grid width.
      - vacated positions become background_color (white).
      - grid dimensions remain constant.
input_format_handling: Needs adjustment to accept the format provided by the test environment (likely List[int] for the row data).
output_format_requirement: Must return List[List[int]].
