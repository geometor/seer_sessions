"""
Identifies the single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input 
row (a 1D grid). Creates a new row of the same length filled with white (0) pixels. 
Places the identified block into the new row, starting 2 positions further to the 
right than its original starting position. Pixels shifted beyond the row boundary 
are clipped.

    Finds the start index and the pixel values of the first contiguous block 
    of non-zero pixels in a 1D list (row). Assumes only one such block exists.

        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - start_index (int): The starting index of the block (-1 if not found).
            - block (list): A list containing the pixel values of the block. Returns
