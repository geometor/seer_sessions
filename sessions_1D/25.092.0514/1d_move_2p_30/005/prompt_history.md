Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids) of pixels.
*   Each input row contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
*   The background color is consistently white (0).
*   The non-white block varies in color (green, red, blue) and length (3 or 6 pixels) across the examples.
*   In the output, the non-white block from the input is present, unchanged in color and length.
*   The position of the non-white block changes between the input and output.
*   Comparing the starting position of the block in the input and output reveals a consistent shift to the right.
*   In all three examples, the block shifts exactly two positions to the right.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input row of pixels.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Determine its starting index, ending index, and the sequence of colors within the block.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filling it entirely with white (0) pixels initially.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting index in the input row.
5.  Copy the identified sequence of non-white pixels from the input block into the new output row, starting at the calculated new starting index.
6.  Return the completed output row.

## Example 1:

## Example 3:

**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation: find the single contiguous block of non-white pixels and shift it two positions to the right within the 1D row. The provided code implements this logic. The error message ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly suggests that the input `input_grid` was treated as a NumPy array during evaluation in the test environment, specifically during a boolean check like `if not input_grid:`. Standard Python lists do not produce this error. The strategy is to adjust the input validation to be robust against receiving a NumPy array or to ensure the rest of the code correctly handles list operations even if the input starts as a NumPy array (which it seems to do by converting `input_grid[0]` to `input_row`). The fundamental transformation logic appears sound and consistent across examples.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Identify the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels within the row. Record the starting index (column) of this block and the sequence of pixel values it contains. Assume there is exactly one such block.
3.  Determine the dimensions (specifically, the length) of the input row.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
5.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output row by adding 2 to the starting index found in step 2.
6.  Copy the sequence of pixel values from the identified block into the output row, starting at the calculated target starting index. Ensure that pixels are only placed within the bounds of the output row (if the shift pushes part of the block beyond the row's end, those pixels are omitted).
7.  Package the completed output row into a grid format (a list containing the single output row).
8.  Return the output grid.
