  - object: "color_block"
    description: "The single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the row."
    properties:
      - color: Single, non-white color (Green, Red, Blue in examples)
      - length: Variable (3 or 6 in examples)
      - position: Defined by its starting column index.
