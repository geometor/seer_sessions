Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids) of pixels.
*   Each input row contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
*   The background color is consistently white (0).
*   The non-white block varies in color (green, red, blue) and length (3 or 6 pixels) across the examples.
*   In the output, the non-white block from the input is present, unchanged in color and length.
*   The position of the non-white block changes between the input and output.
*   Comparing the starting position of the block in the input and output reveals a consistent shift to the right.
*   In all three examples, the block shifts exactly two positions to the right.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input row of pixels.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Determine its starting index, ending index, and the sequence of colors within the block.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filling it entirely with white (0) pixels initially.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting index in the input row.
5.  Copy the identified sequence of non-white pixels from the input block into the new output row, starting at the calculated new starting index.
6.  Return the completed output row.
