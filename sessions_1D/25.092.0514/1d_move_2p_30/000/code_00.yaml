task_description: "Shift a single contiguous block of non-white pixels within a 1D row."
elements:
  - object: "pixel_row"
    description: "A 1D grid representing the input and output."
    properties:
      - size: "Variable length, consistent between input and output pairs."
      - background_color: "White (0)"
  - object: "color_block"
    description: "A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the row."
    properties:
      - color: "Variable (Green, Red, Blue in examples)"
      - length: "Variable (3 or 6 in examples)"
      - position: "Defined by start and end indices."
actions:
  - action: "identify"
    actor: "system"
    target: "color_block"
    condition: "Locate the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels."
  - action: "shift"
    actor: "system"
    target: "color_block"
    details: "Move the block horizontally to the right."
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 2
relationships:
  - type: "transformation"
    source: "input pixel_row"
    target: "output pixel_row"
    rule: "The color_block from the input row is shifted 2 positions to the right to produce the output row. The background remains white."
