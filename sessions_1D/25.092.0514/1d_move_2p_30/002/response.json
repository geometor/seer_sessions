            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code execution failed on all examples with the same error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`). Despite the code explicitly extracting the first row (`input_row = input_grid[0]`) and iterating over its elements, this error suggests that the element `pixel` within the loop `for i, pixel in enumerate(row):` was treated as an array during the comparison `if pixel != 0:` in the test environment. This could happen if the test harness supplied inputs as NumPy arrays rather than standard Python lists, and the comparison operator behaved unexpectedly, or if the `import numpy as np` statement (even if seemingly unused in the failing line) influenced type handling.\n\nThe simulation performed using the `tool_code` block confirms that the core logic (`find_color_block`, calculate new start index by adding 2, copy block) correctly transforms the inputs to the outputs when using standard Python lists.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Ensure the code relies solely on standard Python list operations and avoids NumPy to prevent potential type conflicts in the test environment. Remove the `import numpy as np` statement.\n2.  Re-affirm the transformation rule based on the examples: identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels and shift it two positions to the right within a new row of the same size, initialized with white pixels.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this refined understanding, emphasizing the use of list structures and the specific shift operation.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on inspection and the `tool_code` simulation:\n\n*   **Input/Output Structure:** All examples use a 1xN grid, represented as `list[list[int]]`. The output is also 1xN with the same N.\n*   **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).\n*   **Foreground Object:** Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n    *   Example 1: Block `[3, 3, 3]`, Input Start Index 3\n    *   Example 2: Block `[2, 2, 2]`, Input Start Index 0\n    *   Example 3: Block `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, Input Start Index 3\n*   **Transformation:** The non-white block is shifted horizontally.\n    *   Example 1: Output Start Index 5 (Shift = 5 - 3 = 2)\n    *   Example 2: Output Start Index 2 (Shift = 2 - 0 = 2)\n    *   Example 3: Output Start Index 5 (Shift = 5 - 3 = 2)\n*   **Shift Amount:** The horizontal shift is consistently +2 positions to the right across all examples.\n*   **Consistency:** The color and length of the block remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
