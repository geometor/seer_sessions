task_description: "Shift a single contiguous block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a 1D row."
input_format:
  type: grid
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a list containing one list of integers, e.g., [[...]])
  background_color: 0 (white)
output_format:
  type: grid
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a list containing one list of integers)
  size: Same as input row length.
  background_color: 0 (white)
elements:
  - object: "pixel_row"
    description: "The single row within the input/output grid."
  - object: "color_block"
    description: "The unique contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input row."
    properties:
      - color: "Variable, preserved in output."
      - length: "Variable, preserved in output."
      - start_index: "The 0-based index of the first pixel of the block in the input row."
actions:
  - action: "initialize_output"
    actor: "system"
    output: "A new list of the same length as the input row, filled with the background color (0)."
  - action: "identify_block"
    actor: "system"
    input: "input pixel_row"
    output: "start_index, list of pixel values (color_block)"
    condition: "Find the first and only contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels."
  - action: "calculate_new_position"
    actor: "system"
    input: "start_index"
    output: "new_start_index"
    calculation: "new_start_index = start_index + 2"
  - action: "place_block"
    actor: "system"
    input:
      - "color_block"
      - "new_start_index"
      - "initialized_output_row"
    output: "final_output_row"
    description: "Copy the pixel values from color_block into the output row, starting at new_start_index. Ensure indices stay within bounds."
transformation_rule: "Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Create a new row of the same length filled with white pixels. Place the identified block into the new row, starting 2 positions further to the right than its original starting position."
