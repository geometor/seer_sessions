Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the white color (0).
Scan the input grid to find the first pixel that is not white (0). Record its index (start index), its color, and determine the length of the contiguous block of this color starting from this index.
Calculate the new starting index for this block in the output grid by adding 2 to the recorded start index from the input grid.
Copy the identified contiguous block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new index.
The output grid is now complete.
