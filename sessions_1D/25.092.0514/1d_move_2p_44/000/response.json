            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided example:\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers.\n2.  **Content:** The input consists of a sequence of a repeating non-zero digit (7, representing orange) followed by zeros (representing white). The output contains the same digits but rearranged.\n3.  **Object Identification:** The sequence `7 7 7` can be seen as a single object composed of orange pixels. The `0`s represent the background (white).\n4.  **Transformation:** The orange object `7 7 7` appears to have been shifted horizontally to the right. In the input, it starts at the first position (index 0). In the output, it starts at the third position (index 2).\n5.  **Background Interaction:** The zeros originally positioned after the object seem to wrap around or fill the space vacated by the object's shift. Specifically, two zeros now appear before the object in the output.\n6.  **Consistency:** The object itself (`7 7 7`) remains unchanged in its internal structure and color. The overall length of the array remains the same (7 elements). The shift distance seems fixed at 2 positions to the right.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
