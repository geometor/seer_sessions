Okay, analyzing the provided example:

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers.
2.  **Content:** The input consists of a sequence of a repeating non-zero digit (7, representing orange) followed by zeros (representing white). The output contains the same digits but rearranged.
3.  **Object Identification:** The sequence `7 7 7` can be seen as a single object composed of orange pixels. The `0`s represent the background (white).
4.  **Transformation:** The orange object `7 7 7` appears to have been shifted horizontally to the right. In the input, it starts at the first position (index 0). In the output, it starts at the third position (index 2).
5.  **Background Interaction:** The zeros originally positioned after the object seem to wrap around or fill the space vacated by the object's shift. Specifically, two zeros now appear before the object in the output.
6.  **Consistency:** The object itself (`7 7 7`) remains unchanged in its internal structure and color. The overall length of the array remains the same (7 elements). The shift distance seems fixed at 2 positions to the right.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1
input_elements:
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-zero colored pixels starting at the beginning of the array.
    color: Variable (e.g., 7/orange in the example)
    location: Starts at index 0.
  - type: background
    description: Pixels with color 0 (white).
    location: Fills the rest of the array after the object.
output_elements:
  - type: object
    description: The same contiguous sequence of non-zero colored pixels from the input.
    color: Same as the input object's color.
    location: Starts at index 2.
  - type: background
    description: Pixels with color 0 (white).
    location: Fills the array positions not occupied by the shifted object (indices 0, 1, and positions after the object).
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  distance: 2 positions
  target: the non-zero object
  result: The object is moved 2 positions to the right, and the background pixels fill the vacated space and the space preceding the object.
constraints:
  - Input array always starts with a block of a single non-zero color.
  - Array length remains constant.
  - Object integrity (internal order and color) is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero pixels starting from the beginning (index 0) of the input array.
2.  Determine the length of this block.
3.  Create a new output array of the same total length as the input array, initially filled with zeros (background color).
4.  Copy the identified block of non-zero pixels into the output array, starting at index 2.
5.  Return the modified output array.
