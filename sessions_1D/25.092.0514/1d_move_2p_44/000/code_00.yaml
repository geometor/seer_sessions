task_type: array_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1
input_elements:
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-zero colored pixels starting at the beginning of the array.
    color: Variable (e.g., 7/orange in the example)
    location: Starts at index 0.
  - type: background
    description: Pixels with color 0 (white).
    location: Fills the rest of the array after the object.
output_elements:
  - type: object
    description: The same contiguous sequence of non-zero colored pixels from the input.
    color: Same as the input object's color.
    location: Starts at index 2.
  - type: background
    description: Pixels with color 0 (white).
    location: Fills the array positions not occupied by the shifted object (indices 0, 1, and positions after the object).
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  distance: 2 positions
  target: the non-zero object
  result: The object is moved 2 positions to the right, and the background pixels fill the vacated space and the space preceding the object.
constraints:
  - Input array always starts with a block of a single non-zero color.
  - Array length remains constant.
  - Object integrity (internal order and color) is preserved.
