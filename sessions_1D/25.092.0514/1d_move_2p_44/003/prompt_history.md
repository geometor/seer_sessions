Okay, analyzing the provided example:

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers.
2.  **Content:** The input consists of a sequence of a repeating non-zero digit (7, representing orange) followed by zeros (representing white). The output contains the same digits but rearranged.
3.  **Object Identification:** The sequence `7 7 7` can be seen as a single object composed of orange pixels. The `0`s represent the background (white).
4.  **Transformation:** The orange object `7 7 7` appears to have been shifted horizontally to the right. In the input, it starts at the first position (index 0). In the output, it starts at the third position (index 2).
5.  **Background Interaction:** The zeros originally positioned after the object seem to wrap around or fill the space vacated by the object's shift. Specifically, two zeros now appear before the object in the output.
6.  **Consistency:** The object itself (`7 7 7`) remains unchanged in its internal structure and color. The overall length of the array remains the same (7 elements). The shift distance seems fixed at 2 positions to the right.

**YAML Facts:**

input_elements:
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-zero colored pixels starting at the beginning of the array.
    color: Variable (e.g., 7/orange in the example)
    location: Starts at index 0.
  - type: background
    description: Pixels with color 0 (white).
    location: Fills the rest of the array after the object.
output_elements:
  - type: object
    description: The same contiguous sequence of non-zero colored pixels from the input.
    color: Same as the input object's color.
    location: Starts at index 2.
  - type: background
    description: Pixels with color 0 (white).
    location: Fills the array positions not occupied by the shifted object (indices 0, 1, and positions after the object).
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  distance: 2 positions
  target: the non-zero object
  result: The object is moved 2 positions to the right, and the background pixels fill the vacated space and the space preceding the object.
constraints:
  - Input array always starts with a block of a single non-zero color.
  - Array length remains constant.
  - Object integrity (internal order and color) is preserved.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

## Example 3:

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting the initial block of non-zero pixels two positions to the right. The error encountered during execution (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`) stemmed from an implementation mismatch: the helper function `find_first_zero_index` was designed for Python lists, but the `transform` function receives NumPy arrays as input within the ARC framework.

The strategy is to adapt the implementation to correctly handle NumPy arrays while keeping the core transformation logic intact, as it appears consistent across all training examples.

transformation:

  details:
    - Identify the contiguous block of non-zero pixels starting at index 0 in the input array's single row.
    - Shift this block 2 positions to the right within the row.
    - The pixels effectively wrap around, meaning the elements shifted "off" the start reappear at the end, or equivalently, the elements from the end wrap to the beginning. In this specific case, it manifests as the initial block starting at index 2, preceded by two zeros.
  distance: 2 positions
  direction: right
constraints:
  - Input array is 1xN.
  - Input array always starts with a block of a single non-zero color.
  - Array dimensions (shape) remain constant.
  - Object integrity (internal order, color, length) is preserved.
  - The shift amount is constant (2 positions).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept a 1xN NumPy array as input.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero pixels starting from the first column (index 0) of the input array's single row.
3.  Determine the length of this block.
4.  Create a new output NumPy array of the same shape as the input, initially filled with zeros (background color).
5.  Copy the identified block of non-zero pixels into the output array's row, starting at column index 2. The length of the copied block should be the same as the original block's length.
6.  Ensure the output array correctly wraps or fills the remaining positions with zeros, specifically the first two columns (indices 0 and 1) and any columns following the placed block, up to the original array width. (Alternatively: Perform a circular right shift of the input array's row by 2 positions).
7.  Return the modified 1xN output NumPy array.
