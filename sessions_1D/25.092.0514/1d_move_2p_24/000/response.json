This block acts as a single object.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves moving this non-`white` block horizontally within the grid.\n5.  **Movement Details:** By comparing the start and end positions of the non-`white` block in the input and output grids across all examples, it's consistently observed that the block shifts exactly 2 positions to the right.\n6.  **Background:** The `white` pixels act as the background. When the block shifts right, the 2 positions immediately to the left of the block's original start position become occupied by the block, and the 2 positions immediately to the right of the block's original end position become `white`. The overall count of `white` pixels and the non-`white` block's pixels remains unchanged. The grid dimensions also remain constant.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
