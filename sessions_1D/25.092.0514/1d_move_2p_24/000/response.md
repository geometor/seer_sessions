Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (rows) of pixels.
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain `white` pixels (0) and a contiguous block of a single non-`white` color (e.g., `red` (2), `orange` (7), `gray` (5)).
3.  **Object Identification:** The core element is the contiguous horizontal block of non-`white` pixels. This block acts as a single object.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves moving this non-`white` block horizontally within the grid.
5.  **Movement Details:** By comparing the start and end positions of the non-`white` block in the input and output grids across all examples, it's consistently observed that the block shifts exactly 2 positions to the right.
6.  **Background:** The `white` pixels act as the background. When the block shifts right, the 2 positions immediately to the left of the block's original start position become occupied by the block, and the 2 positions immediately to the right of the block's original end position become `white`. The overall count of `white` pixels and the non-`white` block's pixels remains unchanged. The grid dimensions also remain constant.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored horizontal segment two steps to the right within a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
  - size_constraints: Width remains constant between input and output.
objects:
  - object_type: segment
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (0). The color is consistent within the block.
      - length: Variable, but consistent between input and output for the same example.
  - object_type: background
    description: White pixels (0) surrounding the segment.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
actions:
  - action_type: translate
    target_object: segment
    details:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 pixels
      - preservation: The segment's color and length are preserved.
      - effect_on_background: White pixels fill the space vacated by the segment on the left and are displaced by the segment on the right. The total number of white pixels remains constant.
relationships:
  - type: position
    description: The segment's starting position shifts exactly 2 indices higher (to the right) in the output compared to the input.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions
  - Color and length of the non-white segment
  - Total count of non-white pixels
  - Total count of white pixels
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input grid (row) from left to right to find the first non-`white` pixel. This marks the start of the colored segment.
2.  Continue scanning to find the last contiguous non-`white` pixel of the same color. This marks the end of the segment.
3.  Record the color and length of this segment.
4.  Determine the starting index of the segment in the input grid.
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the segment in the output grid by adding 2 to the original starting index.
6.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with `white` pixels.
7.  Place the identified colored segment (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new starting index.
