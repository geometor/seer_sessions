task_description: Shift a colored horizontal segment two steps to the right within a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
  - size_constraints: Width remains constant between input and output.
objects:
  - object_type: segment
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (0). The color is consistent within the block.
      - length: Variable, but consistent between input and output for the same example.
  - object_type: background
    description: White pixels (0) surrounding the segment.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
actions:
  - action_type: translate
    target_object: segment
    details:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 pixels
      - preservation: The segment's color and length are preserved.
      - effect_on_background: White pixels fill the space vacated by the segment on the left and are displaced by the segment on the right. The total number of white pixels remains constant.
relationships:
  - type: position
    description: The segment's starting position shifts exactly 2 indices higher (to the right) in the output compared to the input.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions
  - Color and length of the non-white segment
  - Total count of non-white pixels
  - Total count of white pixels
