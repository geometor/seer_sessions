White appears to be the background color.\n*   **Objects:** In each example, there is a single contiguous block of a non-white color embedded within a background of white pixels.\n    *   Example 1: A block of red pixels.\n    *   Example 2: A block of azure pixels.\n    *   Example 3: A block of magenta pixels.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a spatial shift of the non-white block.\n    *   In `train_1`, the red block `2 2 ... 2` (19 pixels long) starts at index 0 in the input and starts at index 2 in the output.\n    *   In `train_2`, the azure block `8 8 ... 8` (9 pixels long) starts at index 2 in the input and starts at index 4 in the output.\n    *   In `train_3`, the magenta block `6 6 ... 6` (10 pixels long) starts at index 1 in the input and starts at index 3 in the output.\n*   **Consistency:** In all examples, the non-white block shifts exactly 2 positions to the right. The length of the sequence and the composition of the non-white block remain unchanged. The positions vacated by the block and the positions before the original block are filled with white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
