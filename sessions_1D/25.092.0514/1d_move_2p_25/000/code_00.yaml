Task: Shift a colored block in a 1D sequence

Input_Features:
  - type: 1D_array
  - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - contains_object: true

Object_Properties:
  - type: contiguous_block
  - color: non-white (variable, e.g., red, azure, magenta)
  - count: 1 per input
  - structure: sequence of identical non-white pixels
  - location: variable start and end index within the sequence

Output_Features:
  - type: 1D_array
  - elements: integers (0-9)
  - length: same as input
  - background_color: white (0)
  - contains_object: true (same object as input)

Transformation:
  - type: spatial_shift
  - direction: right
  - magnitude: 2 positions
  - target: the single non-white contiguous block
  - background_handling: white pixels fill the space before the shifted block and any space after it, maintaining sequence length.
  - object_integrity: color and length of the block are preserved.
