Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels (color > 0) in the input 1D sequence.
2. Determine the start index, length, and color of this block.
3. Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with white pixels (0).
4. Calculate the new start index for the block by adding 2 to its original start index.
5. Place the identified block of non-white pixels into the output sequence at the new start index.
6. If the shifted block extends beyond the sequence boundary, it is truncated. (Implicit from fixed output size).
