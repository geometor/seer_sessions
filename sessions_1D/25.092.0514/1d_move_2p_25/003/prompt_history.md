Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

*   **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (sequences) of integers representing pixel colors.
*   **Colors:** The examples use white (0), red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6). White appears to be the background color.
*   **Objects:** In each example, there is a single contiguous block of a non-white color embedded within a background of white pixels.
    *   Example 1: A block of red pixels.
    *   Example 2: A block of azure pixels.
    *   Example 3: A block of magenta pixels.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a spatial shift of the non-white block.
    *   In `train_1`, the red block `2 2 ... 2` (19 pixels long) starts at index 0 in the input and starts at index 2 in the output.
    *   In `train_2`, the azure block `8 8 ... 8` (9 pixels long) starts at index 2 in the input and starts at index 4 in the output.
    *   In `train_3`, the magenta block `6 6 ... 6` (10 pixels long) starts at index 1 in the input and starts at index 3 in the output.
*   **Consistency:** In all examples, the non-white block shifts exactly 2 positions to the right. The length of the sequence and the composition of the non-white block remain unchanged. The positions vacated by the block and the positions before the original block are filled with white pixels.

## Example 3:

**Assessment and Strategy**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" clearly indicates that the input data was treated as a NumPy array (likely a 2D grid) within the testing environment, while the previous code assumed a simple 1D list of integers. The comparison `sequence[i] != 0` failed because `sequence[i]` was an array (a row or slice of the grid), not a single integer.

The core task description explicitly states that ARC inputs/outputs are 2D grids. My initial perception misinterpreted the linear presentation of the example data.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Acknowledge 2D Structure:** Treat all inputs and outputs as 2D NumPy arrays (grids).
2.  **Identify Object:** The object is a contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels within a single row of the grid.
3.  **Refine Transformation:** The transformation involves shifting this horizontal segment 2 columns to the right within its row.
4.  **Code Adjustment:** Modify the Python code to handle 2D NumPy arrays, locate the row and column indices of the segment, and perform the shift correctly within the 2D structure.

  - contains_object: true (same object as input, shifted)

Transformation:
  - type: horizontal_shift
  - direction: right
  - magnitude: 2 columns
  - target: the single non-white contiguous horizontal segment
  - constraints: shift occurs within the original row of the segment
  - background_handling:
      - Pixels to the left of the new segment start (including the original segment location) become white (0).
      - Pixels to the right of the new segment end remain white (0).
      - Other rows (if any) remain unchanged (though examples only show 1 row).
  - object_integrity: color and length of the segment are preserved.
  - boundary_condition: if the shift causes the segment to extend beyond the grid width, it is truncated. (Implied by fixed output grid size).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (2D array).
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
4.  For each row, scan horizontally to find the first column index (`start_col`) containing a non-white pixel.
5.  If a non-white pixel is found:
    a.  Record its color (`block_color`) and the row index (`row_idx`).
    b.  Continue scanning from `start_col` to find the last contiguous column index (`end_col`) containing the same `block_color`.
    c.  Calculate the length of the segment (`length = end_col - start_col + 1`).
    d.  Calculate the new starting column index for the segment in the output grid: `new_start_col = start_col + 2`.
    e.  Copy the segment (color `block_color`, length `length`) into the output grid at `row_idx`, starting at `new_start_col`. Ensure copying does not exceed the grid boundaries (columns `0` to `width-1`). Stop searching for segments once the first one is found and processed (assuming only one segment per grid based on examples).
6.  If no non-white segment is found in the input grid, the output grid remains all white.
7.  Return the output grid.
