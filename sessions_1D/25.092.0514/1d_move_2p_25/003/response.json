Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n3. Find the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in the input grid. Identify its row index, starting column index, length, and color.\n4. Calculate the new starting column index for this segment by adding 2 to its original starting column index.\n5. Copy the segment (using its original color and length) into the corresponding row of the output grid, starting at the calculated new column index. Ensure that writing the segment does not go beyond the grid's right boundary; truncate if necessary.\n6. Return the modified output grid.
