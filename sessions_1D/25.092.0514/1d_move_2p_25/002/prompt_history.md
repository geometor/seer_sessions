Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

*   **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (sequences) of integers representing pixel colors.
*   **Colors:** The examples use white (0), red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6). White appears to be the background color.
*   **Objects:** In each example, there is a single contiguous block of a non-white color embedded within a background of white pixels.
    *   Example 1: A block of red pixels.
    *   Example 2: A block of azure pixels.
    *   Example 3: A block of magenta pixels.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a spatial shift of the non-white block.
    *   In `train_1`, the red block `2 2 ... 2` (19 pixels long) starts at index 0 in the input and starts at index 2 in the output.
    *   In `train_2`, the azure block `8 8 ... 8` (9 pixels long) starts at index 2 in the input and starts at index 4 in the output.
    *   In `train_3`, the magenta block `6 6 ... 6` (10 pixels long) starts at index 1 in the input and starts at index 3 in the output.
*   **Consistency:** In all examples, the non-white block shifts exactly 2 positions to the right. The length of the sequence and the composition of the non-white block remain unchanged. The positions vacated by the block and the positions before the original block are filled with white pixels.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Task: Shift a colored block in a 1D sequence

Input_Features:
  - type: 1D_array
  - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - contains_object: true

Object_Properties:
  - type: contiguous_block
  - color: non-white (variable, e.g., red, azure, magenta)
  - count: 1 per input
  - structure: sequence of identical non-white pixels
  - location: variable start and end index within the sequence

Output_Features:
  - type: 1D_array
  - elements: integers (0-9)
  - length: same as input
  - background_color: white (0)
  - contains_object: true (same object as input)

Transformation:
  - type: spatial_shift
  - direction: right
  - magnitude: 2 positions
  - target: the single non-white contiguous block
  - background_handling: white pixels fill the space before the shifted block and any space after it, maintaining sequence length.
  - object_integrity: color and length of the block are preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence of pixels.
2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the sequence. Note its color, start index, and length.
3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
4.  Determine the new start index for the block by adding 2 to its original start index.
5.  Copy the identified block of non-white pixels into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new start index.
6.  Return the modified sequence as the output.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels (color > 0) in the input 1D sequence.
2. Determine the start index, length, and color of this block.
3. Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with white pixels (0).
4. Calculate the new start index for the block by adding 2 to its original start index.
5. Place the identified block of non-white pixels into the output sequence at the new start index.
6. If the shifted block extends beyond the sequence boundary, it is truncated. (Implicit from fixed output size).
