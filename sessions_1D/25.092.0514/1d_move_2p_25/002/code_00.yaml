Task: Horizontally shift a colored segment within a 2D grid.

Input_Features:
  - type: 2D_grid (numpy array)
  - dimensions: variable (examples are 1x23)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - contains_object: true

Object_Properties:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
  - location: contained within a single row
  - color: non-white (variable, e.g., red, azure, magenta)
  - count: 1 per input grid
  - structure: sequence of identical non-white pixels in adjacent columns of one row
  - properties_tracked:
      - row_index
      - start_column
      - end_column
      - length
      - color

Output_Features:
  - type: 2D_grid (numpy array)
  - dimensions: same as input grid
  - background_color: white (0)
  - contains_object: true (same object as input, shifted)

Transformation:
  - type: horizontal_shift
  - direction: right
  - magnitude: 2 columns
  - target: the single non-white contiguous horizontal segment
  - constraints: shift occurs within the original row of the segment
  - background_handling:
      - Pixels to the left of the new segment start (including the original segment location) become white (0).
      - Pixels to the right of the new segment end remain white (0).
      - Other rows (if any) remain unchanged (though examples only show 1 row).
  - object_integrity: color and length of the segment are preserved.
  - boundary_condition: if the shift causes the segment to extend beyond the grid width, it is truncated. (Implied by fixed output grid size).
