**Assessment and Strategy**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" clearly indicates that the input data was treated as a NumPy array (likely a 2D grid) within the testing environment, while the previous code assumed a simple 1D list of integers. The comparison `sequence[i] != 0` failed because `sequence[i]` was an array (a row or slice of the grid), not a single integer.

The core task description explicitly states that ARC inputs/outputs are 2D grids. My initial perception misinterpreted the linear presentation of the example data.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Acknowledge 2D Structure:** Treat all inputs and outputs as 2D NumPy arrays (grids).
2.  **Identify Object:** The object is a contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels within a single row of the grid.
3.  **Refine Transformation:** The transformation involves shifting this horizontal segment 2 columns to the right within its row.
4.  **Code Adjustment:** Modify the Python code to handle 2D NumPy arrays, locate the row and column indices of the segment, and perform the shift correctly within the 2D structure.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Task: Horizontally shift a colored segment within a 2D grid.

Input_Features:
  - type: 2D_grid (numpy array)
  - dimensions: variable (examples are 1x23)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - contains_object: true

Object_Properties:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
  - location: contained within a single row
  - color: non-white (variable, e.g., red, azure, magenta)
  - count: 1 per input grid
  - structure: sequence of identical non-white pixels in adjacent columns of one row
  - properties_tracked:
      - row_index
      - start_column
      - end_column
      - length
      - color

Output_Features:
  - type: 2D_grid (numpy array)
  - dimensions: same as input grid
  - background_color: white (0)
  - contains_object: true (same object as input, shifted)

Transformation:
  - type: horizontal_shift
  - direction: right
  - magnitude: 2 columns
  - target: the single non-white contiguous horizontal segment
  - constraints: shift occurs within the original row of the segment
  - background_handling:
      - Pixels to the left of the new segment start (including the original segment location) become white (0).
      - Pixels to the right of the new segment end remain white (0).
      - Other rows (if any) remain unchanged (though examples only show 1 row).
  - object_integrity: color and length of the segment are preserved.
  - boundary_condition: if the shift causes the segment to extend beyond the grid width, it is truncated. (Implied by fixed output grid size).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (2D array).
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
4.  For each row, scan horizontally to find the first column index (`start_col`) containing a non-white pixel.
5.  If a non-white pixel is found:
    a.  Record its color (`block_color`) and the row index (`row_idx`).
    b.  Continue scanning from `start_col` to find the last contiguous column index (`end_col`) containing the same `block_color`.
    c.  Calculate the length of the segment (`length = end_col - start_col + 1`).
    d.  Calculate the new starting column index for the segment in the output grid: `new_start_col = start_col + 2`.
    e.  Copy the segment (color `block_color`, length `length`) into the output grid at `row_idx`, starting at `new_start_col`. Ensure copying does not exceed the grid boundaries (columns `0` to `width-1`). Stop searching for segments once the first one is found and processed (assuming only one segment per grid based on examples).
6.  If no non-white segment is found in the input grid, the output grid remains all white.
7.  Return the output grid.
