task_description: Shifts a single horizontal block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a single-row grid represented as a NumPy array.
grid_properties:
  - representation: NumPy array
  - dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1 row, N columns)
  - size_invariance: true (output shape matches input shape)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills space not occupied by the colored block. Exists as pixels with value 0.
  - object_type: block
    count: 1
    description: A single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white color (1-9, varies per example).
      - shape: Horizontal line segment (1 pixel high).
      - contiguity: Pixels of the same color are adjacent horizontally.
      - size_invariance: true (length remains constant during transformation).
      - location: Defined by starting and ending column indices.
relationships:
  - The block is the only non-white object in the grid.
  - The block is surrounded horizontally by white pixels (or grid boundaries).
actions:
  - action: horizontal_shift
    target_object: block
    properties:
      - direction: right
      - magnitude: 2 columns (pixels)
      - constraint: Shift operation preserves block color and length.
      - effect_on_background: White pixels fill the original location of the block's first two columns and are replaced by the block at its new location. Total count of white pixels remains the same.
input_output_mapping:
  - input: Single-row NumPy array with one non-white block.
  - output: Single-row NumPy array of the same shape, with the block shifted 2 columns right.
