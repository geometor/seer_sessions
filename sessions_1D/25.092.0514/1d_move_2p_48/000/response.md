**Perception:**

The task operates on single rows (1D arrays) of pixels. Each input row contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output row is generated by shifting this colored block exactly two positions to the right. The length of the row and the color and length of the block remain unchanged. The pixels outside the shifted block are white (0).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a contiguous block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a row.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_characteristics:
  - A single row of pixels.
  - Contains exactly one contiguous object (block) of a single non-white color.
  - The object is surrounded by white (0) pixels.
  - Row length is consistent within the example (27 pixels).
output_characteristics:
  - A single row of pixels, same length as the input.
  - Contains the same non-white object as the input.
  - The background is white (0) pixels.
transformation:
  - identify_object:
      - description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      - properties: The block consists of a single non-white color. There is only one such block per row.
  - action:
      - type: shift
      - description: Move the identified object horizontally.
      - direction: right
      - magnitude: 2 positions
  - background_fill:
      - description: Ensure all positions outside the shifted object are filled with white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (the "object") in the input row. Note its color, length, and starting index.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Calculate the new starting index for the object by adding 2 to its original starting index.
4.  Place the identified object (using its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new index.
