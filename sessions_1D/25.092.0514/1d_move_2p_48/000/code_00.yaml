task_description: Shift a contiguous block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a row.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_characteristics:
  - A single row of pixels.
  - Contains exactly one contiguous object (block) of a single non-white color.
  - The object is surrounded by white (0) pixels.
  - Row length is consistent within the example (27 pixels).
output_characteristics:
  - A single row of pixels, same length as the input.
  - Contains the same non-white object as the input.
  - The background is white (0) pixels.
transformation:
  - identify_object:
      - description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      - properties: The block consists of a single non-white color. There is only one such block per row.
  - action:
      - type: shift
      - description: Move the identified object horizontally.
      - direction: right
      - magnitude: 2 positions
  - background_fill:
      - description: Ensure all positions outside the shifted object are filled with white (0).
