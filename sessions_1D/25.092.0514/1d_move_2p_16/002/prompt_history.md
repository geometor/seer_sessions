Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (or rows). Each example features a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red or gray) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation consistently involves shifting this colored block two positions to the right within the grid. The original positions occupied by the shifted block become white, and the overall size of the grid remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non_zero # can be red (2) or gray (5) in examples
    properties:
      - variable_length
      - single_instance_per_grid
actions:
  - type: translation
    target: contiguous_block
    parameters:
      direction: right
      magnitude: 2 # shifts by 2 positions
relationships:
  - object_background: the contiguous block is surrounded by the background color
transformation_preserves:
  - grid_size
  - object_color
  - object_shape (length)
transformation_changes:
  - object_position
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid, which is a one-dimensional sequence of pixels.
2.  Determine the background color, which is white (0).
3.  Locate the single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (the object).
4.  Determine the starting index of this object sequence.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white).
6.  Copy the identified object sequence from the input grid into the output grid, starting at an index that is two positions greater than its original starting index.
