task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1 # Operates on single rows (1D arrays)
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    identifier: single instance of non-zero color pixels
    properties:
      - color: variable (2=red, 5=gray observed), but consistent within a block
      - length: variable (3, 12, 15 observed)
      - contiguity: pixels form an unbroken sequence
    location: surrounded by background color (0)
actions:
  - type: translate
    target: the identified contiguous_block
    parameters:
      direction: right (increasing index)
      magnitude: 2 pixels
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: output grid has the same number of elements as the input grid
transformation_logic:
  - find: locate the start and end indices of the non-zero contiguous block
  - create_output: initialize a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color (0)
  - calculate_new_position: determine the new start index by adding 2 to the original start index
  - copy_block: transfer the pixels from the identified block in the input grid to the output grid, starting at the calculated new position
