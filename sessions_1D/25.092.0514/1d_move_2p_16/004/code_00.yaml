task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1 # operates on 1D lists/arrays
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1 # exactly one per grid
    color: non_zero # red (2) or gray (5) in examples
    properties:
      - variable_length # length varies between examples (3, 12, 15)
      - uniform_color # block consists of only one color
actions:
  - type: translation
    target: contiguous_block # the single non-zero block
    parameters:
      direction: right
      magnitude: 2 # fixed shift amount
      fill_original_position: true # original location becomes background color
relationships:
  - object_background: the block is surrounded by the background color (white=0)
transformation_preserves:
  - grid_size
  - object_color
  - object_length # length of the contiguous block
transformation_changes:
  - object_position # starting index increases by 2
