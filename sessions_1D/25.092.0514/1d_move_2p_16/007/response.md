```python
"""
Identifies a single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels in a 1D input grid and shifts this block exactly two positions to the right. The original block content is copied, potentially clipped if the shift causes it to extend beyond the grid boundary. The original positions occupied by the block become white (0), and the grid size remains unchanged. This implementation follows the pattern observed in the first two examples, treating the third example's length change (which occurs despite available space) as an anomaly not covered by this primary rule.
