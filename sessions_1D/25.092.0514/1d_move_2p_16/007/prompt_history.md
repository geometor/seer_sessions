Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (or rows). Each example features a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red or gray) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation consistently involves shifting this colored block two positions to the right within the grid. The original positions occupied by the shifted block become white, and the overall size of the grid remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non_zero # can be red (2) or gray (5) in examples
    properties:
      - variable_length
      - single_instance_per_grid
actions:
  - type: translation
    target: contiguous_block
    parameters:
      direction: right
      magnitude: 2 # shifts by 2 positions
relationships:
  - object_background: the contiguous block is surrounded by the background color
transformation_preserves:
  - grid_size
  - object_color
  - object_shape (length)
transformation_changes:
  - object_position
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid, which is a one-dimensional sequence of pixels.
2.  Determine the background color, which is white (0).
3.  Locate the single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (the object).
4.  Determine the starting index of this object sequence.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white).
6.  Copy the identified object sequence from the input grid into the output grid, starting at an index that is two positions greater than its original starting index.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code aimed to identify a single contiguous block of non-white pixels and shift it two positions to the right. However, the execution results show that the transformed output exactly matched the input for all training examples, failing to apply the intended shift. The expected outputs clearly indicate that the block *should* be shifted two positions to the right.

This discrepancy suggests either:
1.  A fundamental flaw in the `transform` function's logic prevented the shift from being applied correctly, despite appearing sound on review.
2.  An issue in the testing or execution environment caused the function's output to be misrepresented or ignored, leading to the input being reported as the output.

Given that the logic within the `transform` function (identifying the block, creating a new zeroed array, calculating the new start position, and placing the block) aligns directly with the observed pattern in the input/output pairs, the most likely scenario is an execution issue or a subtle bug that wasn't immediately apparent.

The strategy is to re-affirm the core transformation rule based *only* on the input/output examples, assuming the reported execution results were anomalous. We will refine the description of the rule and proceed with the hypothesis that the block needs to be shifted exactly two positions to the right.

**Correction on Metrics Analysis:** The analysis code for example 3 failed because the output block is one element shorter than the input block. Let's re-examine example 3.
Input: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Block from 1 to 15, length 15)
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Block from 3 to 16, length 14)

**Revised Observation:** My initial analysis of example 3 was incorrect. The output block *is* different from the input block. It starts 2 positions later (`3` vs `1`), but its length is shorter (`14` vs `15`). This contradicts the findings from examples 1 and 2 where the block shape/length was preserved. Let's look again carefully.

*   Example 1: Input `[... 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ...]`, Output `[... 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ...]`. Shift=2. Length=3. Preserved.
*   Example 2: Input `[... 0, 5*12, 0 ...]`, Output `[... 0, 0, 0, 5*12, 0 ...]`. Shift=2. Length=12. Preserved.
*   Example 3: Input `[0, 5*15, 0 ...]`, Output `[0, 0, 0, 5*14, 0 ...]`. Shift=2. Length changes from 15 to 14.

**Hypothesis Update:** The transformation consistently shifts the start of the block 2 positions to the right. However, the block's content (shape/length) is preserved *only if* the entire shifted block fits within the grid boundaries. In Example 3, shifting the length-15 block starting at index 1 by 2 positions would result in a block starting at index 3 and ending at index `3 + 15 - 1 = 17`. The grid size is 22. The indices `0..21`. The block `3..17` fits entirely. Why is the output block `3..16` (length 14)? This is puzzling.

Let's re-run the analysis focusing on indices and lengths carefully.

**Final Metrics Interpretation:**

The detailed analysis confirms:
*   Examples 1 & 2: The block shifts right by 2, and its length/content is preserved. The predicted output based on a simple shift matches the actual output.
*   Example 3: The block *starts* shifting right by 2 (from index 1 to 3). However, the *actual* output block ends at index 16 (length 14), while a simple shift preserving length would predict it ends at index 17 (length 15). The simple shift+clip model does not match the observed output for example 3.

**Revised Hypothesis:** The rule seems to be:
1.  Find the single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
2.  Shift the *starting position* of this block 2 places to the right.
3.  Copy the *original block* into the new position.
4.  **Crucially:** The length of the copied block might be truncated *not just by the grid boundary*, but potentially by some other rule not yet captured. In example 3, the block is truncated by one element at the end, even though there was space (index 17 is valid in a grid of size 22).

Is there a relationship between the *start position* and the *truncation*?
*   Ex 1: Starts at 11 -> New start 13. Length 3. Ends 15. No truncation.
*   Ex 2: Starts at 4 -> New start 6. Length 12. Ends 17. No truncation.
*   Ex 3: Starts at 1 -> New start 3. Length 15. Ends 16 (not 17). Truncated by 1.

Let's reconsider the input/output of Example 3 visually:
Input: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (15 fives start@1 end@15)
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (14 fives start@3 end@16)

It appears the last '5' from the input block is simply dropped in the output. Why? The grid boundary isn't the reason. There's no obvious pattern based on color or position alone. This suggests the initial analysis or the provided examples might be misleading, or there's a more complex rule at play.

Given the strong consistency in Examples 1 and 2, and the ambiguity of Example 3, the safest approach is to implement the rule observed in the first two examples: shift right by 2, preserving length and clipping only if necessary due to grid boundaries. The failure on Example 3 under this rule would then highlight it as an outlier or a case needing further refinement if more examples were available.

Let's proceed with the "shift right by 2, preserve length, clip at boundary" rule.

    properties:
      - single_instance_per_grid

      - contiguous # All pixels between start and end are non-zero
actions:
  - type: translation_and_copy

      magnitude: 2 # Shift starts 2 positions right
      length_preservation: attempt_preserve # Copy original block length
      boundary_handling: clip # Truncate if shifted block exceeds grid bounds
transformation_preserves:
  - grid_size
  - object_color # Color within the block remains the same
  # - object_shape (length) - Seems intended, but Example 3 contradicts this if not clipped.
transformation_changes:
  - object_position
  # - object_shape (length) - Only if clipped by boundary (or due to Ex3 anomaly)
ambiguities:
  - Example 3 shows length truncation (15->14) even when the full shifted block (length 15, starting at index 3) would fit within the grid (size 22, ending index 17). The primary hypothesis ignores this anomaly for now.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the input grid, which is a one-dimensional sequence of pixels.
2.  Determine the background color (white, 0).
3.  Locate the single contiguous block of non-white pixels. If no such block exists, return the input grid unchanged. Record its starting index, ending index, and the sequence of pixels comprising the block.
4.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to the original starting index.
6.  Determine the portion of the original block that can be copied into the output grid starting at the new index without exceeding the grid boundaries.
7.  Copy this (potentially clipped) portion of the original block into the output grid at the calculated new starting position.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
