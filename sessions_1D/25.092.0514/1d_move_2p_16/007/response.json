The original block content is copied, potentially clipped if the shift causes it to extend beyond the grid boundary. The original positions occupied by the block become white (0), and the grid size remains unchanged. This implementation follows the pattern observed in the first two examples, treating the third example's length change (which occurs despite available space) as an anomaly not covered by this primary rule.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_contiguous_block(grid_1d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start index and the pixel values (as a numpy array)\n    of the first contiguous block of non-background (non-zero) pixels in a 1D numpy array.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_1d (np.array): A 1D numpy array representing the grid row.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (start_index, block_array) or (None, None) if no block found\n               or if the identified non-zero pixels are not contiguous.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find indices of all non-zero elements\n    non_background_indices = np.where(grid_1d != 0)[0]\n\n    # If no non-zero elements are found, return None for all values\n    if len(non_background_indices) == 0:\n        return None, None\n\n    # Determine the potential start and end of the block\n    start_index = non_background_indices[0]\n    end_index = non_background_indices[-1] # Inclusive index\n    block_length = end_index - start_index + 1\n\n    # Check for contiguity: the number of non-zero indices must match the block length\n    if len(non_background_indices) != block_length:\n        # This indicates gaps (zeros) within the range defined by the first and last non-zero element\n        return None, None # Treat as no valid block found per task constraints\n\n    # Extract the block itself if it's contiguous\n    block_array = grid_1d[start_index : end_index + 1]\n\n    return start_index, block_array\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list): A list representing the 1D input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list representing the 1D output grid with the block shifted right by 2,\n              clipped at the boundary if necessary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the input list to a numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    grid_size = len(input_array)\n\n    # Locate the single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels\n    # Gets the starting index and the actual block pixel data\n    start_idx, block = find_contiguous_block(input_array)\n\n    # If no valid block was found (e.g., all zeros or non-contiguous non-zeros),\n    # return the original input grid as a list.\n    if start_idx is None:\n        return input_grid\n\n    # Initialize the output grid as a numpy array of the same size,\n    # filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n    output_array = np.zeros_like(input_array)\n\n    # Calculate the new starting index for the block by shifting right by 2 positions.\n    new_start_idx = start_idx + 2\n    block_length = len(block) # Get the length of the identified block\n\n    # Calculate the theoretical ending index (exclusive) for slicing purposes.\n    new_end_idx_exclusive = new_start_idx + block_length\n\n    # Check if the new starting position is within the grid bounds.\n    # If the block starts off the grid, nothing needs to be copied.\n    if new_start_idx < grid_size:\n        # Determine the actual end index within the grid to handle clipping if the\n        # block goes off the right edge.\n        effective_end_idx_exclusive = min(new_end_idx_exclusive, grid_size)\n\n        # Determine how much of the block actually fits into the output grid.\n        length_to_copy = effective_end_idx_exclusive - new_start_idx\n\n        # If length_to_copy is positive, it means at least part of the block fits.\n        if length_to_copy > 0:\n            # Place the block (or the part that fits) into the output array at the new position.\n            # Slice the original block using [:length_to_copy] to ensure we only copy the part that fits.\n            output_array[new_start_idx : effective_end_idx_exclusive] = block[:length_to_copy]\n\n    # Convert the resulting numpy array back to a list before returning.\n    return output_array.tolist()\n```"
