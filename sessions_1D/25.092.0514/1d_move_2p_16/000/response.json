Each example features a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red or gray) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation consistently involves shifting this colored block two positions to the right within the grid. The original positions occupied by the shifted block become white, and the overall size of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
