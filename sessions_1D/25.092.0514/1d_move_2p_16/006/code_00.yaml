task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non_zero # red (2) or gray (5)
    properties:
      - single_instance_per_grid
      - variable_length
      - contiguous # All pixels between start and end are non-zero
actions:
  - type: translation_and_copy
    target: contiguous_block
    parameters:
      direction: right
      magnitude: 2 # Shift starts 2 positions right
      length_preservation: attempt_preserve # Copy original block length
      boundary_handling: clip # Truncate if shifted block exceeds grid bounds
transformation_preserves:
  - grid_size
  - object_color # Color within the block remains the same
  # - object_shape (length) - Seems intended, but Example 3 contradicts this if not clipped.
transformation_changes:
  - object_position
  # - object_shape (length) - Only if clipped by boundary (or due to Ex3 anomaly)
ambiguities:
  - Example 3 shows length truncation (15->14) even when the full shifted block (length 15, starting at index 3) would fit within the grid (size 22, ending index 17). The primary hypothesis ignores this anomaly for now.
