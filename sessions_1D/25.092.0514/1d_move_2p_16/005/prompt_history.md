Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (or rows). Each example features a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red or gray) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation consistently involves shifting this colored block two positions to the right within the grid. The original positions occupied by the shifted block become white, and the overall size of the grid remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non_zero # can be red (2) or gray (5) in examples
    properties:
      - variable_length
      - single_instance_per_grid
actions:
  - type: translation
    target: contiguous_block
    parameters:
      direction: right
      magnitude: 2 # shifts by 2 positions
relationships:
  - object_background: the contiguous block is surrounded by the background color
transformation_preserves:
  - grid_size
  - object_color
  - object_shape (length)
transformation_changes:
  - object_position
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid, which is a one-dimensional sequence of pixels.
2.  Determine the background color, which is white (0).
3.  Locate the single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (the object).
4.  Determine the starting index of this object sequence.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white).
6.  Copy the identified object sequence from the input grid into the output grid, starting at an index that is two positions greater than its original starting index.

**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a 1D grid. The provided Python code logically implements this transformation. However, the execution results reported that the code produced all-white output grids for all training examples, indicating a perfect mismatch (0% pixel accuracy). This discrepancy suggests either a fundamental flaw in the code's implementation details that wasn't apparent in the logical overview, or an issue with the testing environment/reporting that provided incorrect feedback.

Given the simplicity of the task and the apparent correctness of the Python code's logic (finding the block, creating a new grid, placing the block at the shifted index), it's highly likely the error lies in a subtle implementation detail missed or an external factor.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-verify the transformation rule by analyzing the input/output pairs directly.
2.  Use `tool_code` to calculate metrics confirming the properties of the input, output, and the transformation (block identification, shift amount).
3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on these verified metrics, ensuring precision.
4.  The subsequent coding phase should carefully re-implement the logic, paying close attention to array slicing, indexing, and boundary conditions, assuming the previous execution feedback was misleading or pointed to a subtle bug.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

The metrics confirm:
*   Grid size is preserved (all are length 22).
*   In each input, there is a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (colors red=2 or gray=5).
*   In the corresponding output, the same block appears shifted.
*   The `calculated_shift` is consistently +2 (rightward shift by 2 positions) across all examples.
*   Block color and shape (length) are preserved. Example 3's output block length calculation from the tool seems off (`output_block_len`: 14 vs `input_block_len`: 15), but visually inspecting example 3 shows the block `[5]*15` moves from index 1 to index 3, fitting entirely within the grid. The tool's calculation might be misinterpreting the end boundary. The core observation of a length-preserving shift of +2 remains valid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid, which is a one-dimensional sequence of pixels.
2.  Locate the single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the input grid. Determine its starting index, its length, and its pixel values (the block itself).
3.  Determine the size (length) of the input grid.
4.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to the original starting index found in step 2.
6.  Copy the sequence of pixel values representing the block (identified in step 2) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure the copied block does not exceed the grid boundaries (though examples suggest it always fits).
