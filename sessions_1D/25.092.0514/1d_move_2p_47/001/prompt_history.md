Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are presented as one-dimensional sequences of integers (colors). Each sequence in the examples has a length of 21. While ARC grids are typically 2D, these examples seem to treat the grid as a flattened sequence.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), orange (7), green (3), and yellow (4).
3.  **Transformation:** Comparing each input sequence to its corresponding output sequence reveals a consistent pattern: the entire sequence appears to be shifted cyclically to the right.
4.  **Shift Amount:**
    *   In `train_1`, the last two elements `(0, 0)` of the input move to the beginning of the output.
    *   In `train_2`, the last two elements `(0, 0)` of the input move to the beginning of the output.
    *   In `train_3`, the last two elements `(0, 0)` of the input move to the beginning of the output.
    *   This confirms a consistent circular right shift by 2 positions across all examples.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Treat the input grid as a single, one-dimensional sequence of color values (pixels).
2.  Perform a circular shift (rotation) on this sequence to the right by 2 positions.
3.  Specifically, take the last 2 elements of the input sequence and move them to the beginning of the sequence, shifting all other elements 2 positions to the right to make space.
4.  The resulting sequence is the output.
