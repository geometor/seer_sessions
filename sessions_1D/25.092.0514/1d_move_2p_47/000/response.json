Each sequence in the examples has a length of 21. While ARC grids are typically 2D, these examples seem to treat the grid as a flattened sequence.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), orange (7), green (3), and yellow (4).\n3.  **Transformation:** Comparing each input sequence to its corresponding output sequence reveals a consistent pattern: the entire sequence appears to be shifted cyclically to the right.\n4.  **Shift Amount:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the last two elements `(0, 0)` of the input move to the beginning of the output.\n    *   In `train_2`, the last two elements `(0, 0)` of the input move to the beginning of the output.\n    *   In `train_3`, the last two elements `(0, 0)` of the input move to the beginning of the output.\n    *   This confirms a consistent circular right shift by 2 positions across all examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
