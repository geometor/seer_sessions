task_description: Perform a circular shift on a 1D sequence representation of the grid.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input is a 1D sequence of color values.
    attributes:
      length: 21 (based on examples)
      colors_present: white (0) and one other non-white color per example (orange, green, yellow).
transformation:
  type: circular_shift
  parameters:
    direction: right
    amount: 2
  target: Applies to the entire input sequence.
input_output_relation:
  - input_sequence: [c_1, c_2, ..., c_n-2, c_n-1, c_n]
  - output_sequence: [c_n-1, c_n, c_1, c_2, ..., c_n-2]
  - specific_example (train_1):
      input: [7, ..., 7, 0, 0, 0, 0] (length 21)
      output: [0, 0, 7, ..., 7, 0, 0] (length 21) # Last two elements (0,0) moved to front
