Grid:
  type: 1D row vector
  dimensions: 1x21 (fixed)
  background_color: white (0)
Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal line
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable: yellow, azure, blue)
    length: variable (3, 5, 6)
    properties:
      - shape: maintained
      - color: maintained
      - length: maintained
Transformation:
  type: Translation
  target: the non-white horizontal line object
  properties:
    direction: right
    distance: 2 pixels (columns)
    boundary_handling: assumed object does not wrap or get truncated (based on examples)
Relationships:
  - output grid dimensions are identical to input grid dimensions.
  - output object is the input object shifted right by 2 positions.
  - background remains white.
