The color and length of this line vary between examples.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed across all examples is the translation (shifting) of the colored line object.\n5.  **Shift Details:** The colored line object is moved exactly two positions to the right in the output grid compared to its position in the input grid. The shape, color, and length of the object remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
