            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code aimed to solve the task by identifying a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid and shifting it two positions to the right in the output grid. The simulation using `tool_code` confirmed that the core logic within the `transform` function is correct *if* the input is treated as a strictly 1D NumPy array (`shape=(N,)`).\n\nHowever, the evaluation results show that the `transform` function consistently produced an all-white (all-zero) output grid for all training examples, failing to place the shifted segment. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue outside the core segment-finding and shifting logic itself.\n\nThe most plausible hypothesis is a mismatch between the assumed input format (1D array, `shape=(N,)`) and the format potentially used by the evaluation environment (e.g., a 2D array representing a single row, `shape=(1, N)`). NumPy functions like `np.where` and array slicing behave differently depending on the number of dimensions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-evaluate the code, specifically focusing on how it handles input dimensions.\n2.  Modify the code to robustly handle either a 1D array (`(N,)`) or a 2D array (`(1, N)`) as input.\n3.  Update the Natural Language Program and YAML facts to reflect this robust handling.\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze the inputs and expected outputs assuming a 1D structure, as visually represented.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]` (Size: 1x21)\n    *   Object: Yellow segment (4), Length 3, Start Index 14, End Index 16.\n    *   Expected Output: Yellow segment (4), Length 3, Start Index 16, End Index 18.\n    *   Result: Failed (Output all 0s).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` (Size: 1x21)\n    *   Object: Azure segment (8), Length 5, Start Index 3, End Index 7.\n    *   Expected Output: Azure segment (8), Length 5, Start Index 5, End Index 9.\n    *   Result: Failed (Output all 0s).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` (Size: 1x21)\n    *   Object: Blue segment (1), Length 6, Start Index 6, End Index 11.\n    *   Expected Output: Blue segment (1), Length 6, Start Index 8, End Index 13.\n    *   Result: Failed (Output all 0s).\n\nThe consistent failure mode (all-zero output) across examples with varying colors, lengths, and positions strongly supports the hypothesis of a systematic issue like input dimension handling rather than a logic error specific to one case.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
