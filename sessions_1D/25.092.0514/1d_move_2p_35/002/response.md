**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code aimed to solve the task by identifying a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid and shifting it two positions to the right in the output grid. The simulation using `tool_code` confirmed that the core logic within the `transform` function is correct *if* the input is treated as a strictly 1D NumPy array (`shape=(N,)`).

However, the evaluation results show that the `transform` function consistently produced an all-white (all-zero) output grid for all training examples, failing to place the shifted segment. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue outside the core segment-finding and shifting logic itself.

The most plausible hypothesis is a mismatch between the assumed input format (1D array, `shape=(N,)`) and the format potentially used by the evaluation environment (e.g., a 2D array representing a single row, `shape=(1, N)`). NumPy functions like `np.where` and array slicing behave differently depending on the number of dimensions.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-evaluate the code, specifically focusing on how it handles input dimensions.
2.  Modify the code to robustly handle either a 1D array (`(N,)`) or a 2D array (`(1, N)`) as input.
3.  Update the Natural Language Program and YAML facts to reflect this robust handling.

**Metrics Analysis**

Let's analyze the inputs and expected outputs assuming a 1D structure, as visually represented.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]` (Size: 1x21)
    *   Object: Yellow segment (4), Length 3, Start Index 14, End Index 16.
    *   Expected Output: Yellow segment (4), Length 3, Start Index 16, End Index 18.
    *   Result: Failed (Output all 0s).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` (Size: 1x21)
    *   Object: Azure segment (8), Length 5, Start Index 3, End Index 7.
    *   Expected Output: Azure segment (8), Length 5, Start Index 5, End Index 9.
    *   Result: Failed (Output all 0s).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` (Size: 1x21)
    *   Object: Blue segment (1), Length 6, Start Index 6, End Index 11.
    *   Expected Output: Blue segment (1), Length 6, Start Index 8, End Index 13.
    *   Result: Failed (Output all 0s).

The consistent failure mode (all-zero output) across examples with varying colors, lengths, and positions strongly supports the hypothesis of a systematic issue like input dimension handling rather than a logic error specific to one case.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  dimensionality: Primarily 1D (single row), but potentially represented as 2D (1xN array).
  width: 21 (fixed in examples)
  height: 1
  background_color: white (0)
Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal line segment
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable: yellow, azure, blue)
    properties:
      length: variable (3, 5, 6)
      position: variable start column index
Transformation:
  type: Translation
  target: the single non-white horizontal line segment
  properties:
    direction: right (positive column index change)
    distance: 2 pixels (columns)
    characteristics_preserved: color, length, shape (horizontal line)
  boundary_handling: Assumed sufficient space; segment does not wrap or truncate based on examples.
Output_Grid:
  dimensionality: Matches input (typically 1xN)
  dimensions: Same as input (1x21 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  content: Background pixels + the translated object.
Implementation_Note:
  - Code must handle input potentially being a 1D array (shape N,) or a 2D array (shape 1,N). Indexing and slicing logic must adapt accordingly.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid, noting it might be a 1D array of shape `(N,)` or a 2D array of shape `(1, N)`. Determine the width `N`.
2.  Create an output grid of the same shape and dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Identify the non-white pixels in the input grid.
4.  If no non-white pixels are found, return the initialized white output grid.
5.  Determine the column indices of the non-white pixels. Find the minimum column index (`start_col`) and the maximum column index (`end_col`).
6.  Determine the color of the segment (e.g., the color at `input_grid[start_col]` if 1D, or `input_grid[0, start_col]` if 2D).
7.  Calculate the new starting column index (`new_start_col`) by adding 2 to the original `start_col`.
8.  Calculate the new ending column index (`new_end_col`) by adding 2 to the original `end_col`.
9.  Verify that `new_end_col` is within the grid bounds (i.e., less than the grid width `N`). (Based on examples, this condition is always met).
10. Select the segment in the output grid corresponding to the new column range (`new_start_col` to `new_end_col`, inclusive). If the grid is 2D (`1xN`), ensure the slice selects row 0.
11. Fill the selected segment in the output grid with the determined color.
12. Return the modified output grid.
