**Perception of task elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (a single row) with a width of 21 pixels.
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).
3.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal line (an object) composed of pixels of a single non-white color. The color and length of this line vary between examples.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed across all examples is the translation (shifting) of the colored line object.
5.  **Shift Details:** The colored line object is moved exactly two positions to the right in the output grid compared to its position in the input grid. The shape, color, and length of the object remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  type: 1D row vector
  dimensions: 1x21 (fixed)
  background_color: white (0)
Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal line
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable: yellow, azure, blue)
    length: variable (3, 5, 6)
    properties:
      - shape: maintained
      - color: maintained
      - length: maintained
Transformation:
  type: Translation
  target: the non-white horizontal line object
  properties:
    direction: right
    distance: 2 pixels (columns)
    boundary_handling: assumed object does not wrap or get truncated (based on examples)
Relationships:
  - output grid dimensions are identical to input grid dimensions.
  - output object is the input object shifted right by 2 positions.
  - background remains white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find the starting and ending column indices and the color of the contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
3.  Calculate the new starting column index by adding 2 to the original starting column index.
4.  Copy the identified segment of non-white pixels (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new starting column index.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Identifies a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid.
Creates an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with white pixels.
Copies the identified segment into the output grid, shifting its position 2 pixels to the right.
Assumes the input grid is 1D (a single row) and contains exactly one such segment.
Assumes the shift will not cause the segment to go beyond the grid boundaries.
