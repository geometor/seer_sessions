"""
Identifies a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid.
Creates an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with white pixels.
Copies the identified segment into the output grid, shifting its position 2 pixels to the right.
Assumes the input grid is 1D (a single row) and contains exactly one such segment.
Assumes the shift will not cause the segment to go beyond the grid boundaries.
