Input_Grid:
  dimensionality: Primarily 1D (single row), but potentially represented as 2D (1xN array).
  width: 21 (fixed in examples)
  height: 1
  background_color: white (0)
Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal line segment
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable: yellow, azure, blue)
    properties:
      length: variable (3, 5, 6)
      position: variable start column index
Transformation:
  type: Translation
  target: the single non-white horizontal line segment
  properties:
    direction: right (positive column index change)
    distance: 2 pixels (columns)
    characteristics_preserved: color, length, shape (horizontal line)
  boundary_handling: Assumed sufficient space; segment does not wrap or truncate based on examples.
Output_Grid:
  dimensionality: Matches input (typically 1xN)
  dimensions: Same as input (1x21 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  content: Background pixels + the translated object.
Implementation_Note:
  - Code must handle input potentially being a 1D array (shape N,) or a 2D array (shape 1,N). Indexing and slicing logic must adapt accordingly.
