**Perception of task elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (a single row) with a width of 21 pixels.
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).
3.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal line (an object) composed of pixels of a single non-white color. The color and length of this line vary between examples.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed across all examples is the translation (shifting) of the colored line object.
5.  **Shift Details:** The colored line object is moved exactly two positions to the right in the output grid compared to its position in the input grid. The shape, color, and length of the object remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  type: 1D row vector
  dimensions: 1x21 (fixed)
  background_color: white (0)
Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal line
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable: yellow, azure, blue)
    length: variable (3, 5, 6)
    properties:
      - shape: maintained
      - color: maintained
      - length: maintained
Transformation:
  type: Translation
  target: the non-white horizontal line object
  properties:
    direction: right
    distance: 2 pixels (columns)
    boundary_handling: assumed object does not wrap or get truncated (based on examples)
Relationships:
  - output grid dimensions are identical to input grid dimensions.
  - output object is the input object shifted right by 2 positions.
  - background remains white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find the starting and ending column indices and the color of the contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
3.  Calculate the new starting column index by adding 2 to the original starting column index.
4.  Copy the identified segment of non-white pixels (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new starting column index.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code aimed to solve the task by identifying a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid and shifting it two positions to the right in the output grid. The simulation using `tool_code` confirmed that the core logic within the `transform` function is correct *if* the input is treated as a strictly 1D NumPy array (`shape=(N,)`).

However, the evaluation results show that the `transform` function consistently produced an all-white (all-zero) output grid for all training examples, failing to place the shifted segment. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue outside the core segment-finding and shifting logic itself.

The most plausible hypothesis is a mismatch between the assumed input format (1D array, `shape=(N,)`) and the format potentially used by the evaluation environment (e.g., a 2D array representing a single row, `shape=(1, N)`). NumPy functions like `np.where` and array slicing behave differently depending on the number of dimensions.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-evaluate the code, specifically focusing on how it handles input dimensions.
2.  Modify the code to robustly handle either a 1D array (`(N,)`) or a 2D array (`(1, N)`) as input.
3.  Update the Natural Language Program and YAML facts to reflect this robust handling.

**Metrics Analysis**

Let's analyze the inputs and expected outputs assuming a 1D structure, as visually represented.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]` (Size: 1x21)
    *   Object: Yellow segment (4), Length 3, Start Index 14, End Index 16.
    *   Expected Output: Yellow segment (4), Length 3, Start Index 16, End Index 18.
    *   Result: Failed (Output all 0s).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` (Size: 1x21)
    *   Object: Azure segment (8), Length 5, Start Index 3, End Index 7.
    *   Expected Output: Azure segment (8), Length 5, Start Index 5, End Index 9.
    *   Result: Failed (Output all 0s).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` (Size: 1x21)
    *   Object: Blue segment (1), Length 6, Start Index 6, End Index 11.
    *   Expected Output: Blue segment (1), Length 6, Start Index 8, End Index 13.
    *   Result: Failed (Output all 0s).

The consistent failure mode (all-zero output) across examples with varying colors, lengths, and positions strongly supports the hypothesis of a systematic issue like input dimension handling rather than a logic error specific to one case.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  dimensionality: Primarily 1D (single row), but potentially represented as 2D (1xN array).
  width: 21 (fixed in examples)
  height: 1
  background_color: white (0)
Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal line segment
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable: yellow, azure, blue)
    properties:
      length: variable (3, 5, 6)
      position: variable start column index
Transformation:
  type: Translation
  target: the single non-white horizontal line segment
  properties:
    direction: right (positive column index change)
    distance: 2 pixels (columns)
    characteristics_preserved: color, length, shape (horizontal line)
  boundary_handling: Assumed sufficient space; segment does not wrap or truncate based on examples.
Output_Grid:
  dimensionality: Matches input (typically 1xN)
  dimensions: Same as input (1x21 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  content: Background pixels + the translated object.
Implementation_Note:
  - Code must handle input potentially being a 1D array (shape N,) or a 2D array (shape 1,N). Indexing and slicing logic must adapt accordingly.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid, noting it might be a 1D array of shape `(N,)` or a 2D array of shape `(1, N)`. Determine the width `N`.
2.  Create an output grid of the same shape and dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Identify the non-white pixels in the input grid.
4.  If no non-white pixels are found, return the initialized white output grid.
5.  Determine the column indices of the non-white pixels. Find the minimum column index (`start_col`) and the maximum column index (`end_col`).
6.  Determine the color of the segment (e.g., the color at `input_grid[start_col]` if 1D, or `input_grid[0, start_col]` if 2D).
7.  Calculate the new starting column index (`new_start_col`) by adding 2 to the original `start_col`.
8.  Calculate the new ending column index (`new_end_col`) by adding 2 to the original `end_col`.
9.  Verify that `new_end_col` is within the grid bounds (i.e., less than the grid width `N`). (Based on examples, this condition is always met).
10. Select the segment in the output grid corresponding to the new column range (`new_start_col` to `new_end_col`, inclusive). If the grid is 2D (`1xN`), ensure the slice selects row 0.
11. Fill the selected segment in the output grid with the determined color.
12. Return the modified output grid.
