task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row array)
input_features:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    extent: fills the row outside the object
  - element: object
    type: horizontal line segment
    count: 1
    color: variable (non-white)
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - location: defined by start and end indices
      - length: variable
output_features:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    extent: fills the row outside the object
  - element: object
    type: horizontal line segment
    count: 1
    color: same as input object color
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - location: input start index + 2, input end index + 2
      - length: same as input object length
transformation:
  action: horizontal translation (shift)
  target: the single non-white line segment object
  direction: right
  magnitude: 2 positions (columns)
constraints:
  - Input is a single row (1D array).
  - Input contains exactly one contiguous segment of non-white color.
  - The shift amount is constant (2).
  - The grid width is preserved.
  - Pixels shifted beyond the right boundary are discarded (not wrapped).
