In the output, it starts at index 12 and ends at index 26. The shift is 2 positions to the right.\n-   **Example 2 (train_2):** The orange (7) line starts at index 11 and ends at index 21 in the input. In the output, it starts at index 13 and ends at index 23. The shift is 2 positions to the right.\n-   **Example 3 (train_3):** The blue (1) line starts at index 1 and ends at index 8 in the input. In the output, it starts at index 3 and ends at index 10. The shift is 2 positions to the right.\n\nThe consistent pattern is a horizontal shift of the colored line segment two positions to the right.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
