task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
input_features:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
  - element: object
    type: horizontal line segment
    count: 1
    color: variable (azure, orange, blue in examples)
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - non-white color
output_features:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
  - element: object
    type: horizontal line segment
    count: 1
    color: same as input object color
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - non-white color
      - same length as input object
transformation:
  action: horizontal shift
  target: the colored line segment object
  direction: right
  magnitude: 2 positions
constraints:
  - The input grid contains exactly one contiguous non-white object (line segment).
  - The object's color and length are preserved.
  - The shift is always 2 positions to the right.
