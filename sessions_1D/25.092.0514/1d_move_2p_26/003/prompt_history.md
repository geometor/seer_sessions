## Perception of Task Elements

The input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays represented horizontally).
Each input grid contains a single horizontal line segment of a specific color (azure, orange, or blue) surrounded by white pixels (0).
The output grid shows the same colored line segment shifted horizontally to the right.
The length and color of the line segment remain unchanged.
The background remains white.
The amount of shift appears consistent across all examples.

Let's analyze the shift amount:
-   **Example 1 (train_1):** The azure (8) line starts at index 10 and ends at index 24 in the input. In the output, it starts at index 12 and ends at index 26. The shift is 2 positions to the right.
-   **Example 2 (train_2):** The orange (7) line starts at index 11 and ends at index 21 in the input. In the output, it starts at index 13 and ends at index 23. The shift is 2 positions to the right.
-   **Example 3 (train_3):** The blue (1) line starts at index 1 and ends at index 8 in the input. In the output, it starts at index 3 and ends at index 10. The shift is 2 positions to the right.

The consistent pattern is a horizontal shift of the colored line segment two positions to the right.

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment and Strategy

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" indicates that a NumPy array is being used in a context where a single boolean value (True/False) is expected. This commonly occurs in `if` conditions. Given the structure of the provided Python code, this likely happens either in the initial check `if not input_grid or len(input_grid) != 1` or potentially if the elements (`pixel`) within the row were somehow arrays themselves (which is unlikely given the task description).

The most probable cause is that the testing environment passes the input grids as NumPy arrays rather than Python lists of lists, and the condition `if not input_grid` behaves differently for NumPy arrays compared to lists.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Input Data Type:** Confirm if the `input_grid` being passed to the `transform` function in the testing environment is a NumPy array.
2.  **Adjust Conditional Checks:** Modify the conditional statements (specifically the initial `if` check) to correctly handle NumPy arrays, possibly using `.size`, `.shape`, or `.any()`/`.all()` methods as appropriate, or by converting the input NumPy array to a list of lists at the beginning of the function.
3.  **Confirm Logic:** Re-verify the core logic (finding the segment and shifting it by 2) against the examples using explicit checks.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's use `tool_code` to inspect the examples and confirm the segment properties and shift.

    # Find non-white indices
    input_indices = np.where(input_np != 0)[0]
    output_indices = np.where(output_np != 0)[0]

```
The analysis confirms the initial observations:
*   Each input is a 1D array (single row) of length 30.
*   Each input contains a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
*   The length and color of the segment are preserved in the output.
*   The segment is shifted exactly 2 positions to the right in all examples.

The error encountered during testing strongly suggests the `transform` function received NumPy arrays, causing the `if not input_grid` check to fail. The core logic of finding the segment and shifting it right by 2 remains valid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels within the row. Determine its color, starting index, and ending index.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the segment by adding 2 to the original starting index.
5.  Iterate from the original starting index to the original ending index (inclusive). For each corresponding position `i` in the original segment:
    a.  Calculate the target index in the output row: `new_start_index + (i - original_start_index)`.
    b.  If the target index is within the bounds of the output row's length, set the pixel at the target index in the output row to the color of the identified segment.
6.  Return the newly created output row as the result (within a grid structure, e.g., a list containing the single row).
