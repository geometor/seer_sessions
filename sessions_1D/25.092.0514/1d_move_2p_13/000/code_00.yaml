task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
input_components:
  - name: background
    type: pixel_value
    value: 0 (white)
  - name: colored_block
    type: object
    properties:
      - contiguity: contiguous
      - color: non-white (e.g., 7-orange, 4-yellow)
      - count: 1 per input array
      - location: variable start and end indices
      - size: variable length
output_components:
  - name: background
    type: pixel_value
    value: 0 (white)
  - name: shifted_block
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: same as input colored_block
      - size: same as input colored_block
      - location: shifted relative to input colored_block
transformation:
  - type: spatial_manipulation
    action: shift
    details:
      - object_to_shift: colored_block
      - direction: right
      - magnitude: 2 positions
      - effect_on_vacated_space: fill with background color (white)
      - effect_on_occupied_space: replace with block color
relationship:
  - input colored_block position determines output shifted_block position based on a fixed rightward shift of 2.
