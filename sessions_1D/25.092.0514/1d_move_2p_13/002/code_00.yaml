task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D
input_grid_properties:
  - height: 1
  - width: 20
  - background_color: 0 (white)
output_grid_properties:
  - height: 1
  - width: 20
  - background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - name: colored_segment
    type: horizontal_line_segment
    count: 1 per grid
    properties:
      - contiguity: contiguous
      - color: non-white (e.g., 7-orange, 4-yellow)
      - location: defined by row index (always 0), start column index, end column index (exclusive)
      - length: variable (end_col - start_col)
transformation:
  - type: spatial_manipulation
    action: shift
    details:
      - object_to_shift: colored_segment
      - direction: right (positive column direction)
      - magnitude: 2 columns
      - row_preservation: segment stays in the same row (row 0)
      - effect_on_vacated_space: fill with background color (white)
      - effect_on_occupied_space: replace with segment's color
relationship:
  - The output grid is generated by taking the input grid, identifying the colored segment, shifting it 2 columns to the right, and filling the background appropriately.
