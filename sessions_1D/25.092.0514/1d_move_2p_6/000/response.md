Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as single sequences of numbers (colors), suggesting a 1D array or perhaps a single row/column extracted from a 2D grid.
2.  **Content:** Each sequence contains numbers representing colors. There are blocks of identical non-white colors (`2`, `5`, `8`) surrounded by white (`0`).
3.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the primary change is the position of the elements within the sequence. The sequence of colors appears to be shifted or rotated.
4.  **Shift Pattern:**
    *   In example 1, the block of `2`s starts at index 0 in the input and index 2 in the output. The last two `0`s from the input appear at the beginning of the output.
    *   In example 2, the block of `5`s starts at index 7 in the input and index 9 in the output. The two `0`s preceding the block in the output seem to have come from the end of the input.
    *   In example 3, the block of `8`s starts at index 1 in the input and index 3 in the output. The two `0`s preceding the block in the output seem to have come from the end of the input.
5.  **Conclusion:** In all cases, the entire sequence undergoes a circular shift (rotation) two positions to the right. Elements shifted off the right end reappear at the left end. The length and the elements themselves remain unchanged, only their order is modified.

**Facts**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
    description: A 1D sequence of color pixels.
    elements: integers 0-9 representing colors.
Transformation:
  - type: spatial
    action: circular_shift
    direction: right
    amount: 2
    target: the entire input sequence
Constraints:
  - input_length_equals_output_length: true
  - pixel_values_preserved: true
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence of color pixels.
2.  Treat the sequence as a circular list (where the end connects back to the beginning).
3.  Perform a circular shift of all elements in the sequence two positions to the right.
    *   This means the element originally at the last position moves to the second position.
    *   The element originally at the second-to-last position moves to the first position.
    *   All other elements move two positions to the right (e.g., index `i` moves to index `i+2`).
4.  The resulting sequence after the shift is the output.
