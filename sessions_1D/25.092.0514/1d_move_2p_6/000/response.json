There are blocks of identical non-white colors (`2`, `5`, `8`) surrounded by white (`0`).\n3.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the primary change is the position of the elements within the sequence. The sequence of colors appears to be shifted or rotated.\n4.  **Shift Pattern:**\n    *   In example 1, the block of `2`s starts at index 0 in the input and index 2 in the output. The last two `0`s from the input appear at the beginning of the output.\n    *   In example 2, the block of `5`s starts at index 7 in the input and index 9 in the output. The two `0`s preceding the block in the output seem to have come from the end of the input.\n    *   In example 3, the block of `8`s starts at index 1 in the input and index 3 in the output. The two `0`s preceding the block in the output seem to have come from the end of the input.\n5.  **Conclusion:** In all cases, the entire sequence undergoes a circular shift (rotation) two positions to the right. Elements shifted off the right end reappear at the left end. The length and the elements themselves remain unchanged, only their order is modified.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
