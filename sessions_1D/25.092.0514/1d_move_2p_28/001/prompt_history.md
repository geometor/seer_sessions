**Perception of the Elements:**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains exactly one contiguous segment of a non-white color (magenta, azure, or orange in the examples) against a white background. The transformation consistently shifts the entire content of the row two positions to the right. The two leftmost positions in the output grid are filled with the background color (white). The segment's color and length remain unchanged during the shift.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_segment
    count: 1
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable across examples: magenta, azure, orange)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      length: variable
transformation:
  type: shift
  details:
    direction: right
    distance: 2 positions
    fill_value: white (0) # for positions vacated on the left
    boundary_handling: pixels shifted off the right edge are discarded
invariance:
  - segment_color
  - segment_length
  - grid_dimensions (width remains constant)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid as a single row of pixels.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Iterate through the input grid from the leftmost pixel up to the third-to-last pixel (index `width - 3`).
4.  For each pixel at index `i` in the input grid, copy its color to the position `i + 2` in the output grid.
5.  The two leftmost positions (indices 0 and 1) of the output grid will retain their initial white color. Pixels from the last two positions of the input grid are effectively discarded.
