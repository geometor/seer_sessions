grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_segment
    count: 1
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable across examples: magenta, azure, orange)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      length: variable
transformation:
  type: shift
  details:
    direction: right
    distance: 2 positions
    fill_value: white (0) # for positions vacated on the left
    boundary_handling: pixels shifted off the right edge are discarded
invariance:
  - segment_color
  - segment_length
  - grid_dimensions (width remains constant)
