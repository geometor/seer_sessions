Each input grid contains exactly one contiguous segment of a non-white color (magenta, azure, or orange in the examples) against a white background. The transformation consistently shifts the entire content of the row two positions to the right. The two leftmost positions in the output grid are filled with the background color (white). The segment's color and length remain unchanged during the shift.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
