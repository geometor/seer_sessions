## Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a sequence. However, the code failed during execution with a `ValueError` related to ambiguous truth values of numpy arrays. This error typically arises when performing boolean comparisons on arrays expecting a single boolean result, often due to incorrect assumptions about data shape or type during iteration or comparison.

The most likely cause is an incorrect assumption about the input format provided to the `transform` function during testing. While the examples were presented linearly, ARC tasks usually use 2D grids (nested lists or numpy arrays). Even if the grid is effectively 1D (like 1xN or Nx1), it's still represented as a 2D structure. The code assumed a flat 1D list or array (`[3, 3, 3, ...]`), but it likely received a 2D structure like `[[3, 3, 3, ...]]`. Iterating over or comparing elements within this nested structure without properly indexing caused the error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the input `input_grid` is a 2D list (e.g., `[[...]]`) representing a 1xN grid.
2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the `transform` function to extract the single row (the 1D sequence) from the 2D input grid before processing.
3.  **Maintain Logic:** Keep the core logic of `find_non_white_block` and the shifting mechanism, ensuring it operates on the extracted 1D sequence.
4.  **Format Output:** Ensure the function returns the transformed sequence in the same 2D format (e.g., `[[...]]`) as the input.
5.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use code execution to check the dimensions and confirm the block-finding details on the correctly extracted sequence.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the structure and block details using the first training example, assuming the input is a 1x14 grid.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 1 Input (as a 1x14 grid)
input_grid_1 = [[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

# --- Verification ---
input_array = np.array(input_grid_1)
print(f"Input Array Shape: {input_array.shape}")

# Extract the sequence (first row)
sequence = input_array[0]
print(f"Extracted Sequence: {sequence.tolist()}")
print(f"Sequence Length: {len(sequence)}")

# Find the block in the extracted sequence
start_index = -1
color = 0
length = 0
block_found = False

for i, pixel in enumerate(sequence):
    if not block_found:
        if pixel != 0:
            start_index = i
            color = pixel
            length = 1
            block_found = True # Start looking for the end
    elif pixel == color: # Continue block
            length += 1
    else: # Block ended
        break

# Handle block extending to the end
if block_found:
    end_index = start_index + length
    print(f"Block Found: Yes")
    print(f"Block Color: {color}")
    print(f"Block Start Index: {start_index}")
    print(f"Block Length: {length}")
    print(f"Block End Index (exclusive): {end_index}")
    
    # Calculate shift
    shift_amount = 2
    new_start_index = start_index + shift_amount
    new_end_index = new_start_index + length
    
    print(f"Shift Amount: {shift_amount}")
    print(f"New Start Index: {new_start_index}")
    print(f"New End Index: {new_end_index}")
    
    # Simulate output creation
    output_sequence = np.zeros_like(sequence)
    if new_end_index <= len(sequence):
         output_sequence[new_start_index:new_end_index] = color
    
    print(f"Simulated Output Sequence: {output_sequence.tolist()}")
else:
    print("Block Found: No")
```
```
Input Array Shape: (1, 14)
Extracted Sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Sequence Length: 14
Block Found: Yes
Block Color: 3
Block Start Index: 0
Block Length: 4
Block End Index (exclusive): 4
Shift Amount: 2
New Start Index: 2
New End Index: 6
Simulated Output Sequence: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```
The code execution confirms:

1.  The input is likely a 2D grid with shape (1, N).
2.  Extracting the first row (`input_array[0]`) provides the 1D sequence for processing.
3.  The block finding logic correctly identifies the block (color 3, start 0, length 4) in the extracted sequence.
4.  The shift calculation (start 0 + 2 = 2) is correct.
5.  The simulated output sequence matches the expected output for the first example.

This supports the strategy of adapting the code to handle a 1xN input grid structure.

## Facts


```yaml
Data_Structure:
  - type: 2D grid (list of lists or numpy array)
  - shape: 1 row, N columns (N=14 in examples)
  - element_type: integer (color code 0-9)

Objects:
  - type: Contiguous_Row_Block
    properties:
      - grid_row: occurs in the single row of the grid
      - color: non-white (e.g., green '3', orange '7')
      - pixels: identical non-white color
      - location: defined by start and end column indices within the row
      - uniqueness: exactly one such block per grid
      - context: horizontally adjacent pixels are white ('0') except within the block

Transformation:
  - name: Horizontal_Shift
  - target: Contiguous_Row_Block
  - parameters:
      - direction: right (increasing column index)
      - distance: 2 columns
  - process:
      - Identify the block (color, start_col, end_col) in the single row.
      - Create a new output grid of the same shape, initialized with white ('0').
      - Calculate the new start column: `new_start_col = start_col + 2`.
      - Calculate the new end column: `new_end_col = new_start_col + length`.
      - Place the block's pixels (using its original color) into the single row of the output grid from `new_start_col` to `new_end_col`.
  - constraints:
      - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
      - Block color and length remain unchanged.
      - Assumes the shifted block fits within the grid boundaries.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Identify the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels within this row. Determine its color, its starting column index, and its length.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (1 row, same number of columns) as the input grid, initializing all pixels to white (0).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting column index.
5.  Copy the identified block of non-white pixels (using its original color and length) into the single row of the new output grid, starting at the calculated new column index.
6.  Return the new output grid.
