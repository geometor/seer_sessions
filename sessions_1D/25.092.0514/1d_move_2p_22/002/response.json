            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a sequence. However, the code failed during execution with a `ValueError` related to ambiguous truth values of numpy arrays. This error typically arises when performing boolean comparisons on arrays expecting a single boolean result, often due to incorrect assumptions about data shape or type during iteration or comparison.\n\nThe most likely cause is an incorrect assumption about the input format provided to the `transform` function during testing. While the examples were presented linearly, ARC tasks usually use 2D grids (nested lists or numpy arrays). Even if the grid is effectively 1D (like 1xN or Nx1), it's still represented as a 2D structure. The code assumed a flat 1D list or array (`[3, 3, 3, ...]`), but it likely received a 2D structure like `[[3, 3, 3, ...]]`. Iterating over or comparing elements within this nested structure without properly indexing caused the error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the input `input_grid` is a 2D list (e.g., `[[...]]`) representing a 1xN grid.\n2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the `transform` function to extract the single row (the 1D sequence) from the 2D input grid before processing.\n3.  **Maintain Logic:** Keep the core logic of `find_non_white_block` and the shifting mechanism, ensuring it operates on the extracted 1D sequence.\n4.  **Format Output:** Ensure the function returns the transformed sequence in the same 2D format (e.g., `[[...]]`) as the input.\n5.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use code execution to check the dimensions and confirm the block-finding details on the correctly extracted sequence.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the structure and block details using the first training example, assuming the input is a 1x14 grid.\n\n"
