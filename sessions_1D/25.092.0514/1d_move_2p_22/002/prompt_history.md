Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The examples are presented as 1D arrays (sequences) of integers representing colors. All examples have a length of 14.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color (e.g., green '3' or orange '7'). The rest of the sequence consists of white ('0') pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the position of the non-white block within the sequence.
4.  **Observation:** Comparing input and output sequences, the non-white block appears to be shifted horizontally to the right. The amount of shift seems constant across examples.
5.  **Detailed Shift:**
    *   In example 1, the green block `[3, 3, 3, 3]` starts at index 0 and moves to start at index 2 (a shift of +2).
    *   In example 2, the orange block `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]` starts at index 1 and moves to start at index 3 (a shift of +2).
    *   In example 3, the green block `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` starts at index 4 and moves to start at index 6 (a shift of +2).
6.  **Conclusion:** The transformation identifies the single contiguous block of non-white pixels and shifts it exactly 2 positions to the right within the 1D sequence. The pixels originally occupied by the start of the block become white, and the overall length of the sequence remains unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
Data_Structure:
  - type: 1D array (sequence)
  - element_type: integer (color code 0-9)
  - size: constant length (14 in examples)

Objects:
  - type: Contiguous_Block
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., green, orange)
      - pixels: identical non-white color
      - location: defined by start and end indices in the sequence
      - uniqueness: exactly one such block per sequence
      - context: surrounded by white (0) pixels

Transformation:
  - name: Horizontal_Shift
  - target: Contiguous_Block
  - parameters:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 positions
  - effect:
      - The block's start index increases by 2.
      - The block's end index increases by 2.
      - Pixels vacated by the shift become white (0).
      - Pixels outside the original and final block positions remain white (0).
      - The block's color and length remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels within the input 1D array. Determine its start index, end index, length, and color.
2.  Create a new 1D array of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Calculate the new start index for the block by adding 2 to its original start index.
4.  Copy the identified block of non-white pixels into the new array, starting at the calculated new start index.
5.  The resulting array is the output.
```python
"""
Identifies a single contiguous block of non-white pixels within a 1D input array.
Shifts this block 2 positions to the right.
The output array has the same length as the input, with the shifted block placed 
at its new position and all other pixels set to white (0).
