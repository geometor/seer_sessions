Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The examples are presented as 1D arrays (sequences) of integers representing colors. All examples have a length of 14.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color (e.g., green '3' or orange '7'). The rest of the sequence consists of white ('0') pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the position of the non-white block within the sequence.
4.  **Observation:** Comparing input and output sequences, the non-white block appears to be shifted horizontally to the right. The amount of shift seems constant across examples.
5.  **Detailed Shift:**
    *   In example 1, the green block `[3, 3, 3, 3]` starts at index 0 and moves to start at index 2 (a shift of +2).
    *   In example 2, the orange block `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]` starts at index 1 and moves to start at index 3 (a shift of +2).
    *   In example 3, the green block `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` starts at index 4 and moves to start at index 6 (a shift of +2).
6.  **Conclusion:** The transformation identifies the single contiguous block of non-white pixels and shifts it exactly 2 positions to the right within the 1D sequence. The pixels originally occupied by the start of the block become white, and the overall length of the sequence remains unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels within the input 1D array. Determine its start index, end index, length, and color.
2.  Create a new 1D array of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Calculate the new start index for the block by adding 2 to its original start index.
4.  Copy the identified block of non-white pixels into the new array, starting at the calculated new start index.
5.  The resulting array is the output.

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a sequence. However, the code failed during execution with a `ValueError` related to ambiguous truth values of numpy arrays. This error typically arises when performing boolean comparisons on arrays expecting a single boolean result, often due to incorrect assumptions about data shape or type during iteration or comparison.

The most likely cause is an incorrect assumption about the input format provided to the `transform` function during testing. While the examples were presented linearly, ARC tasks usually use 2D grids (nested lists or numpy arrays). Even if the grid is effectively 1D (like 1xN or Nx1), it's still represented as a 2D structure. The code assumed a flat 1D list or array (`[3, 3, 3, ...]`), but it likely received a 2D structure like `[[3, 3, 3, ...]]`. Iterating over or comparing elements within this nested structure without properly indexing caused the error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the input `input_grid` is a 2D list (e.g., `[[...]]`) representing a 1xN grid.
2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the `transform` function to extract the single row (the 1D sequence) from the 2D input grid before processing.
3.  **Maintain Logic:** Keep the core logic of `find_non_white_block` and the shifting mechanism, ensuring it operates on the extracted 1D sequence.
4.  **Format Output:** Ensure the function returns the transformed sequence in the same 2D format (e.g., `[[...]]`) as the input.
5.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use code execution to check the dimensions and confirm the block-finding details on the correctly extracted sequence.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the structure and block details using the first training example, assuming the input is a 1x14 grid.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1 Input (as a 1x14 grid)
input_grid_1 = [[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

# --- Verification ---
input_array = np.array(input_grid_1)
print(f"Input Array Shape: {input_array.shape}")

# Extract the sequence (first row)
sequence = input_array[0]
print(f"Extracted Sequence: {sequence.tolist()}")
print(f"Sequence Length: {len(sequence)}")

# Find the block in the extracted sequence
start_index = -1
color = 0
length = 0
block_found = False

for i, pixel in enumerate(sequence):
    if not block_found:
        if pixel != 0:
            start_index = i
            color = pixel
            length = 1
            block_found = True # Start looking for the end
    elif pixel == color: # Continue block
            length += 1
    else: # Block ended
        break

# Handle block extending to the end
if block_found:
    end_index = start_index + length
    print(f"Block Found: Yes")
    print(f"Block Color: {color}")
    print(f"Block Start Index: {start_index}")
    print(f"Block Length: {length}")
    print(f"Block End Index (exclusive): {end_index}")
    
    # Calculate shift
    shift_amount = 2
    new_start_index = start_index + shift_amount
    new_end_index = new_start_index + length
    
    print(f"Shift Amount: {shift_amount}")
    print(f"New Start Index: {new_start_index}")
    print(f"New End Index: {new_end_index}")
    
    # Simulate output creation
    output_sequence = np.zeros_like(sequence)
    if new_end_index <= len(sequence):
         output_sequence[new_start_index:new_end_index] = color
    
    print(f"Simulated Output Sequence: {output_sequence.tolist()}")
else:
    print("Block Found: No")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Input Array Shape: (1, 14)
Extracted Sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Sequence Length: 14
Block Found: Yes
Block Color: 3
Block Start Index: 0
Block Length: 4
Block End Index (exclusive): 4
Shift Amount: 2
New Start Index: 2
New End Index: 6
Simulated Output Sequence: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```
The code execution confirms:

1.  The input is likely a 2D grid with shape (1, N).
2.  Extracting the first row (`input_array[0]`) provides the 1D sequence for processing.
3.  The block finding logic correctly identifies the block (color 3, start 0, length 4) in the extracted sequence.
4.  The shift calculation (start 0 + 2 = 2) is correct.
5.  The simulated output sequence matches the expected output for the first example.

This supports the strategy of adapting the code to handle a 1xN input grid structure.
