Data_Structure:
  - type: 1D array (sequence)
  - element_type: integer (color code 0-9)
  - size: constant length (14 in examples)

Objects:
  - type: Contiguous_Block
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., green, orange)
      - pixels: identical non-white color
      - location: defined by start and end indices in the sequence
      - uniqueness: exactly one such block per sequence
      - context: surrounded by white (0) pixels

Transformation:
  - name: Horizontal_Shift
  - target: Contiguous_Block
  - parameters:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 positions
  - effect:
      - The block's start index increases by 2.
      - The block's end index increases by 2.
      - Pixels vacated by the shift become white (0).
      - Pixels outside the original and final block positions remain white (0).
      - The block's color and length remain unchanged.
