            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The examples are presented as 1D arrays (sequences) of integers representing colors. All examples have a length of 14.\n2.  **Key Elements:** Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color (e.g., green '3' or orange '7'). The rest of the sequence consists of white ('0') pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the position of the non-white block within the sequence.\n4.  **Observation:** Comparing input and output sequences, the non-white block appears to be shifted horizontally to the right. The amount of shift seems constant across examples.\n5.  **Detailed Shift:**\n    *   In example 1, the green block `[3, 3, 3, 3]` starts at index 0 and moves to start at index 2 (a shift of +2).\n    *   In example 2, the orange block `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]` starts at index 1 and moves to start at index 3 (a shift of +2).\n    *   In example 3, the green block `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` starts at index 4 and moves to start at index 6 (a shift of +2).\n6.  **Conclusion:** The transformation identifies the single contiguous block of non-white pixels and shifts it exactly 2 positions to the right within the 1D sequence. The pixels originally occupied by the start of the block become white, and the overall length of the sequence remains unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
