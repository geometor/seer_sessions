input_grid_properties:
  - dimensions: [1, 16] # Example dimensions
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - objects:
      count: 1
      type: contiguous_horizontal_block
      color: non-zero # e.g., 7 (orange), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta)
      properties:
        - start_index
        - length
        - color_value
output_grid_properties:
  - dimensions: same_as_input # [1, 16]
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - objects:
      count: 1
      type: contiguous_horizontal_block
      color: same_as_input_object
      length: same_as_input_object
      properties:
        - start_index: input_object_start_index + 2
transformation:
  - action: identify_object
    target: contiguous non-white block
    properties: [color, start_index, length]
  - action: initialize_output
    properties:
      dimensions: same_as_input
      fill_color: 0 # white
  - action: place_object
    target: identified_object
    destination_grid: output
    position:
      start_index: input_object_start_index + 2
    constraints:
      - maintain object color
      - maintain object length
      - grid boundaries respected (implicit truncation/background fill)
relationship:
  - The output is generated by horizontally shifting the single non-white block found in the input grid two positions to the right, while maintaining the grid size and filling the remaining space with the background color (white).
