In the examples, they are 1x16.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0) as a background color and one other color (orange (7), gray (5), or magenta (6)) for a foreground object. The output uses the same colors as the input.\n3.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels. The output grid also contains a single block of the same non-white color and length as the input block, surrounded by white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a spatial shift of the non-white block. Comparing the start and end positions of the block in the input and output reveals a consistent pattern: the block is moved two positions to the right.\n5.  **Background:** The white background pixels fill the space vacated by the shifted block on the left and adjust around the block's new position. The overall dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
