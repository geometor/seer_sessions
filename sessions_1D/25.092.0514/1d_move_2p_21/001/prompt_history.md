**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN arrays) of pixels represented by integers 0-9. In the examples, they are 1x16.
2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0) as a background color and one other color (orange (7), gray (5), or magenta (6)) for a foreground object. The output uses the same colors as the input.
3.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels. The output grid also contains a single block of the same non-white color and length as the input block, surrounded by white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a spatial shift of the non-white block. Comparing the start and end positions of the block in the input and output reveals a consistent pattern: the block is moved two positions to the right.
5.  **Background:** The white background pixels fill the space vacated by the shifted block on the left and adjust around the block's new position. The overall dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**

  - dimensions: [1, 16] # Example dimensions
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - objects:
      count: 1
      type: contiguous_horizontal_block
      color: non-zero # e.g., 7 (orange), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta)
      properties:
        - start_index
        - length
        - color_value

  - dimensions: same_as_input # [1, 16]
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - objects:

      type: contiguous_horizontal_block
      color: same_as_input_object
      length: same_as_input_object
      properties:
        - start_index: input_object_start_index + 2
transformation:
  - action: identify_object
    target: contiguous non-white block
    properties: [color, start_index, length]
  - action: initialize_output
    properties:
      dimensions: same_as_input
      fill_color: 0 # white
  - action: place_object
    target: identified_object
    destination_grid: output
    position:
      start_index: input_object_start_index + 2
    constraints:
      - maintain object color
      - maintain object length
      - grid boundaries respected (implicit truncation/background fill)
relationship:
  - The output is generated by horizontally shifting the single non-white block found in the input grid two positions to the right, while maintaining the grid size and filling the remaining space with the background color (white).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the 1-dimensional input grid. Note its color, starting index, and length.
2.  Create a new 1-dimensional grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
4.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the new grid, starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure the placement respects the grid boundaries; if the block extends beyond the right boundary, only the part that fits within the grid is placed.
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
