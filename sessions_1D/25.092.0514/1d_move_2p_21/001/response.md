"""
Identifies a single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid.
Shifts this block two positions to the right to produce the output grid.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and is filled with white pixels
except for the shifted block. If the shift causes the block to extend beyond the grid boundaries,
the block is truncated.
