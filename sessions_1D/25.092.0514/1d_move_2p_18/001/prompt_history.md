Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data are presented as single rows (1D arrays). This suggests the transformation operates on a 1D grid or potentially row-by-row on a 2D grid, although only single rows are shown. Let's assume it's a 1D transformation for now.
2.  **Pixel Content:** The grids contain pixels represented by integers. The color '0' (white) acts as a background. Each example features a single contiguous block of a non-white color (orange '7', magenta '6', gray '5').
3.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the block of non-white pixels appears to shift horizontally to the right by a fixed amount.
4.  **Shift Details:** In all three examples, the non-white block shifts exactly 2 positions to the right.
5.  **Boundary Handling:** When the block shifts right, the two leftmost positions in the output grid become white ('0'). The pixels from the input grid effectively shift right, and the content that would move past the right boundary seems to be discarded.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Structure:
  - Type: 1D array (single row)
  - Size: Variable width (all examples are 1x17)
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous_Block
    Color: Non-white (7, 6, or 5 in examples)
    Quantity: Exactly one per input grid
    Properties:
      - Start_Position: Varies
      - End_Position: Varies
      - Length: Varies
Action:
  - Type: Translation (Shift)
  - Target: The non-white contiguous block
  - Direction: Right
  - Magnitude: 2 positions
  - Boundary_Behavior:
      - Left_Side: Positions vacated by the shift are filled with the background color (0).
      - Right_Side: Pixels shifted beyond the grid boundary are discarded.
Relationship:
  - The output grid is a transformation of the input grid where the primary object (non-white block) is shifted right by 2 positions within the grid boundaries, padding with the background color on the left.
Alternative_View:
  - The entire content of the input row is shifted 2 positions to the right.
  - The first two positions of the output row are set to the background color (0).
  - The content from the input row, starting from the first position up to the (width - 2) position, is placed into the output row starting from the third position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (0, white).
2.  Iterate through the input grid's pixels from the first position (index 0) up to the third-to-last position (index width - 3).
3.  For each input pixel at index `i` in this range, copy its value to the output grid at index `i + 2`.
4.  The first two positions (indices 0 and 1) of the output grid will retain their initial background color (0).
5.  Return the resulting output grid.
