            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code implementation attempted to shift the contents of a 1D array two positions to the right, padding the left with the background color (0). However, the execution results showed that the output was consistently an array filled entirely with zeros, indicating a fundamental failure in the copy/shift operation as implemented or tested.\n\nThe core logic flaw likely stemmed from assuming the input was strictly 1D (`shape = (N,)`). If the input was passed as a 2D array with a single row (`shape = (1, N)`), calculating the width using `input_grid.shape[0]` would yield `1`, causing the condition `width > shift_amount` (i.e., `1 > 2`) to be false. Consequently, the code segment responsible for copying the shifted data would be skipped, resulting in the initialized zero array being returned.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the code to correctly handle input that might be a 2D array representing a single row, ensuring the width is determined from the correct dimension (`shape[1]`) in such cases, while still supporting genuinely 1D input. The transformation rule itself (shift right by 2, pad left with 0) remains consistent with the examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's verify the shapes and the slicing logic with Example 1, considering both 1D and 2D possibilities.\n\n"
