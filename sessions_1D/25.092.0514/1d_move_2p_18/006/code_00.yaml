Input_Structure:
  - Type: Grid, potentially 1D (shape=(N,)) or 2D with one row (shape=(1, N))
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)
  - Content: Contains a single contiguous block of a non-background color, or is entirely background.
Output_Structure:
  - Type: Grid with the same shape as the input.
Transformation:
  - Name: Horizontal Shift Right
  - Amount: 2 positions
  - Padding: The first 2 positions (columns) of the output grid are filled with the background color (0).
  - Content_Mapping: The content from the input grid, starting from the first position up to the (width - 2) position, is copied to the output grid, starting at the third position (index 2).
  - Boundary_Handling: Content that would shift beyond the right edge of the grid is discarded.
Dimensionality_Handling:
  - The width of the grid for calculation purposes must be determined correctly based on whether the input shape is (N,) or (1, N). If (N,), width is shape[0]. If (1, N), width is shape[1].
Objects:
  - Conceptual_Object: The sequence of pixel values in the row.
  - Action_On_Object: The entire sequence is shifted right by 2, with left-padding and right-truncation.
