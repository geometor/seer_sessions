**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code implementation attempted to shift the contents of a 1D array two positions to the right, padding the left with the background color (0). However, the execution results showed that the output was consistently an array filled entirely with zeros, indicating a fundamental failure in the copy/shift operation as implemented or tested.

The core logic flaw likely stemmed from assuming the input was strictly 1D (`shape = (N,)`). If the input was passed as a 2D array with a single row (`shape = (1, N)`), calculating the width using `input_grid.shape[0]` would yield `1`, causing the condition `width > shift_amount` (i.e., `1 > 2`) to be false. Consequently, the code segment responsible for copying the shifted data would be skipped, resulting in the initialized zero array being returned.

The strategy is to revise the code to correctly handle input that might be a 2D array representing a single row, ensuring the width is determined from the correct dimension (`shape[1]`) in such cases, while still supporting genuinely 1D input. The transformation rule itself (shift right by 2, pad left with 0) remains consistent with the examples.

**Metrics:**

Let's verify the shapes and the slicing logic with Example 1, considering both 1D and 2D possibilities.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 1 Input
input_1d = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0])
input_2d = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

# Parameters
shift_amount = 2
background_color = 0

# --- Test 1D Input ---
print("--- Testing 1D Input ---")
print(f"Input Shape: {input_1d.shape}")
width_1d = input_1d.shape[0]
print(f"Calculated Width (shape[0]): {width_1d}")

output_1d = np.full_like(input_1d, background_color)
if width_1d > shift_amount:
    print("Condition (width > shift_amount) is TRUE for 1D")
    input_slice_to_copy = input_1d[:width_1d - shift_amount]
    output_paste_start_index = shift_amount
    output_paste_end_index = output_paste_start_index + len(input_slice_to_copy)
    print(f"1D Input Slice to Copy: {input_slice_to_copy}")
    print(f"1D Output Paste Indices: [{output_paste_start_index}:{output_paste_end_index}]")
    output_1d[output_paste_start_index:output_paste_end_index] = input_slice_to_copy
else:
    print("Condition (width > shift_amount) is FALSE for 1D")

print(f"Resulting Output (1D): {output_1d}")

print(f"Input Shape: {input_2d.shape}")
width_2d_wrong = input_2d.shape[0] # Incorrect way for 2D row
print(f"Calculated Width (shape[0]): {width_2d_wrong}")

output_2d_wrong = np.full_like(input_2d, background_color)
if width_2d_wrong > shift_amount:
    print("Condition (width > shift_amount) is TRUE for 2D (Previous Logic)")
    # This part wouldn't execute, but showing for completeness
    # input_slice_to_copy = input_2d[0, :width_2d_wrong - shift_amount] # Adjusted slicing for 2D
    # ...
else:
    print("Condition (width > shift_amount) is FALSE for 2D (Previous Logic)")

print(f"Resulting Output (2D, Previous Logic): {output_2d_wrong}")


# --- Test 2D Input with corrected logic (width = shape[1]) ---
print("\n--- Testing 2D Input (Corrected Logic) ---")
print(f"Input Shape: {input_2d.shape}")
width_2d_correct = input_2d.shape[1] # Correct way for 2D row
print(f"Calculated Width (shape[1]): {width_2d_correct}")

output_2d_correct = np.full_like(input_2d, background_color)
if width_2d_correct > shift_amount:
    print("Condition (width > shift_amount) is TRUE for 2D (Corrected Logic)")
    # Need to slice the row correctly
    input_slice_to_copy = input_2d[0, :width_2d_correct - shift_amount]
    output_paste_start_index = shift_amount
    output_paste_end_index = output_paste_start_index + len(input_slice_to_copy)
    print(f"2D Input Slice to Copy: {input_slice_to_copy}")
    print(f"2D Output Paste Indices (Row 0): [{output_paste_start_index}:{output_paste_end_index}]")
    output_2d_correct[0, output_paste_start_index:output_paste_end_index] = input_slice_to_copy
else:
    print("Condition (width > shift_amount) is FALSE for 2D (Corrected Logic)")

print(f"Resulting Output (2D, Corrected Logic): {output_2d_correct}")
```

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   The code execution confirms the hypothesis: using `shape[0]` for width calculation fails when the input is a 2D array like `(1, 17)`, leading to the `if` condition being false and an all-zero output.
*   Using `shape[1]` for width calculation when the input is `(1, 17)` works correctly.
*   The original logic works correctly for purely 1D input `(17,)`.
*   The code needs modification to handle both `(N,)` and `(1, N)` shapes appropriately.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input_Structure:
  - Type: Grid, potentially 1D (shape=(N,)) or 2D with one row (shape=(1, N))
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)
  - Content: Contains a single contiguous block of a non-background color, or is entirely background.
Output_Structure:
  - Type: Grid with the same shape as the input.
Transformation:
  - Name: Horizontal Shift Right
  - Amount: 2 positions
  - Padding: The first 2 positions (columns) of the output grid are filled with the background color (0).
  - Content_Mapping: The content from the input grid, starting from the first position up to the (width - 2) position, is copied to the output grid, starting at the third position (index 2).
  - Boundary_Handling: Content that would shift beyond the right edge of the grid is discarded.
Dimensionality_Handling:
  - The width of the grid for calculation purposes must be determined correctly based on whether the input shape is (N,) or (1, N). If (N,), width is shape[0]. If (1, N), width is shape[1].
Objects:
  - Conceptual_Object: The sequence of pixel values in the row.
  - Action_On_Object: The entire sequence is shifted right by 2, with left-padding and right-truncation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept an input grid, which can be either a 1D numpy array or a 2D numpy array with one row.
2.  Determine the effective width (`W`) of the grid content:
    *   If the input array is 1D (e.g., shape `(N,)`), `W` is the size of that dimension (`N`).
    *   If the input array is 2D (e.g., shape `(1, N)`), `W` is the size of the second dimension (`N`).
3.  Define the shift amount: `shift = 2`.
4.  Define the background color: `bg_color = 0`.
5.  Create an output grid with the exact same shape as the input grid, initially filled entirely with `bg_color`.
6.  Check if the width `W` is greater than the `shift` amount.
7.  If `W > shift`:
    *   Identify the slice of the input grid to be copied: This includes elements from index 0 up to (but not including) index `W - shift`.
    *   Identify the target slice in the output grid: This starts at index `shift` and extends for the same length as the input slice copied.
    *   Perform the copy:
        *   If the input grid is 1D, copy the input slice `input_grid[0 : W - shift]` to the output slice `output_grid[shift : W]`.
        *   If the input grid is 2D, copy the input slice `input_grid[0, 0 : W - shift]` to the output slice `output_grid[0, shift : W]`.
8.  If `W <= shift`, the output grid remains filled with the `bg_color` (no content is copied).
9.  Return the resulting output grid.
