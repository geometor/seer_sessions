Grid_Structure:
  - Type: 1D array (single row)
  - Dimensions:
      Height: 1
      Width: 17 (consistent across training examples)
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)
Objects:
  - Type: Grid_Content
    Description: The entire sequence of pixels in the input row. It includes background pixels (0) and contiguous blocks of non-zero colors.
Transformation:
  - Name: Horizontal_Shift_Right
  - Target: The entire Grid_Content sequence.
  - Parameters:
      Shift_Amount: 2 positions to the right.
      Padding_Color: 0 (white)
  - Process:
      1. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the Padding_Color (0).
      2. Copy the pixels from the input grid, starting from index 0 up to index (width - 1 - Shift_Amount), into the output grid, starting at index Shift_Amount.
  - Boundary_Behavior:
      - Left_Side: The first 'Shift_Amount' positions (indices 0 and 1) of the output grid are filled with the Padding_Color (0).
      - Right_Side: The last 'Shift_Amount' pixels from the input grid are discarded (do not appear in the output).
Consistency:
  - The transformation rule (shift right by 2, pad left with 0) is consistent across all provided training examples.
