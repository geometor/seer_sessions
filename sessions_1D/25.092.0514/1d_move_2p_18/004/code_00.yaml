Input_Type: 1D grid (list or numpy array of integers)
Output_Type: 1D grid (numpy array of integers)
Grid_Properties:
  - Shape: Fixed at 1x17 for all training examples.
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)
Transformation_Type: Global Shift
Parameters:
  - Shift_Direction: Right
  - Shift_Magnitude: 2 cells
  - Padding_Value: 0 (background color)
  - Padding_Location: Leftmost 2 cells of the output grid
Behavior:
  - The first (width - 2) cells of the input grid are copied.
  - These copied cells are placed into the output grid starting at index 2.
  - The cells at indices 0 and 1 of the output grid are set to the padding value (0).
  - The last 2 cells of the input grid's content are effectively discarded (not copied to the output).
