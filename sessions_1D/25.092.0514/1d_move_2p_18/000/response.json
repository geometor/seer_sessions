This suggests the transformation operates on a 1D grid or potentially row-by-row on a 2D grid, although only single rows are shown. Let's assume it's a 1D transformation for now.\n2.  **Pixel Content:** The grids contain pixels represented by integers. The color '0' (white) acts as a background. Each example features a single contiguous block of a non-white color (orange '7', magenta '6', gray '5').\n3.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the block of non-white pixels appears to shift horizontally to the right by a fixed amount.\n4.  **Shift Details:** In all three examples, the non-white block shifts exactly 2 positions to the right.\n5.  **Boundary Handling:** When the block shifts right, the two leftmost positions in the output grid become white ('0'). The pixels from the input grid effectively shift right, and the content that would move past the right boundary seems to be discarded.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
