Grid_Structure:
  - Type: 1D array (single row)
  - Size: Variable width (all examples are 1x17)
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous_Block
    Color: Non-white (7, 6, or 5 in examples)
    Quantity: Exactly one per input grid
    Properties:
      - Start_Position: Varies
      - End_Position: Varies
      - Length: Varies
Action:
  - Type: Translation (Shift)
  - Target: The non-white contiguous block
  - Direction: Right
  - Magnitude: 2 positions
  - Boundary_Behavior:
      - Left_Side: Positions vacated by the shift are filled with the background color (0).
      - Right_Side: Pixels shifted beyond the grid boundary are discarded.
Relationship:
  - The output grid is a transformation of the input grid where the primary object (non-white block) is shifted right by 2 positions within the grid boundaries, padding with the background color on the left.
Alternative_View:
  - The entire content of the input row is shifted 2 positions to the right.
  - The first two positions of the output row are set to the background color (0).
  - The content from the input row, starting from the first position up to the (width - 2) position, is placed into the output row starting from the third position.
