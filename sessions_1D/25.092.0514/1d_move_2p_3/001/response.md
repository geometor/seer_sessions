"""
Identify the contiguous block of non-zero colored pixels within the input row. 
Note its color, start index, and length. Create a new output row of the same 
length as the input row, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, value 0). 
Calculate the new start index for the color block by adding 2 to its original 
start index. Copy the identified color block into the output row, starting at 
the calculated new start index.
