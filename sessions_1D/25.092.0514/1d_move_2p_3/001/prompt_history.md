Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception:**
The input and output are single rows (or 1D arrays) of pixels. Each row consists mostly of white pixels (value 0) and a single contiguous block of non-white pixels. The color of the non-white block varies across the examples (red, orange, magenta). The length of the non-white block remains the same between the input and the corresponding output. The key transformation appears to be a positional shift of this non-white block. Comparing the input and output in each example, the non-white block is moved two positions to the right.

**Facts:**

```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation
components:
  - type: background
    value: 0 # white
    role: fills the space not occupied by the color block
  - type: object
    name: color_block
    properties:
      - contiguity: True
      - color: non-zero (varies per example: 2, 7, 6)
      - shape: horizontal_line (1D segment)
      - length: preserved between input and output (e.g., 11 for red, 10 for orange, 6 for magenta)
      - position: defined by start and end indices
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: color_block
    details: Locate the contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels.
  - action: shift
    target: color_block
    direction: right
    magnitude: 2 positions
    constraints: Assumes sufficient space within the array bounds based on examples.
input_output_relation:
  - property: size
    relation: unchanged (array length is preserved)
  - property: content
    relation: The color_block from the input is repositioned in the output; background pixels fill the remaining space.
```


**Natural Language Program:**
1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero colored pixels within the input row. Note its color, start index, and end index.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, value 0).
3.  Calculate the new start index for the color block by adding 2 to its original start index.
4.  Copy the identified color block into the output row, starting at the calculated new start index.
