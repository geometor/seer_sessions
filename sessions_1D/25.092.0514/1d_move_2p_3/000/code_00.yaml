task_type: array_manipulation
components:
  - type: background
    value: 0 # white
    role: fills the space not occupied by the color block
  - type: object
    name: color_block
    properties:
      - contiguity: True
      - color: non-zero (varies per example: 2, 7, 6)
      - shape: horizontal_line (1D segment)
      - length: preserved between input and output (e.g., 11 for red, 10 for orange, 6 for magenta)
      - position: defined by start and end indices
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: color_block
    details: Locate the contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels.
  - action: shift
    target: color_block
    direction: right
    magnitude: 2 positions
    constraints: Assumes sufficient space within the array bounds based on examples.
input_output_relation:
  - property: size
    relation: unchanged (array length is preserved)
  - property: content
    relation: The color_block from the input is repositioned in the output; background pixels fill the remaining space.
