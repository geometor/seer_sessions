Each row consists mostly of white pixels (value 0) and a single contiguous block of non-white pixels. The color of the non-white block varies across the examples (red, orange, magenta). The length of the non-white block remains the same between the input and the corresponding output. The key transformation appears to be a positional shift of this non-white block. Comparing the input and output in each example, the non-white block is moved two positions to the right.\n\n**Facts:**\n"
