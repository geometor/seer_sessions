Task: Shift a colored block horizontally

Objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., magenta, red, azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel of the block in the input grid.
  - id: background
    description: The surrounding pixels.
    properties:
      - color: white (0).

Action:
  - name: shift_right
    description: Move an object horizontally to the right.
    parameters:
      - object_id: colored_block
      - shift_amount: 2 (pixels/indices)

Relationship:
  - The colored_block is embedded within the background. The transformation modifies the position of the colored_block relative to the background.

Input_Output_Mapping:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - The output grid is initially composed entirely of the background color.
  - The colored_block from the input is placed into the output grid, starting at an index equal to its original start_index plus the shift_amount (2).
