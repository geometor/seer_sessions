The background pixels are filled in where the block moves from, and the block overwrites the background pixels at its new location.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"

The transformation modifies the position of the colored_block relative to the background.\n\nInput_Output_Mapping:\n  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n  - The output grid is initially composed entirely of the background color.\n  - The colored_block from the input is placed into the output grid, starting at an index equal to its original start_index plus the shift_amount (2).\n```"
