**General Assessment:**

The error `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` confirms that the input grids are being passed as NumPy arrays to the `transform` function, not standard Python lists. The check `if not input_grid` fails for a non-empty NumPy array. The core logic of identifying a single, contiguous, non-white block and shifting it two positions to the right seems correct and consistent across all examples. The strategy is to modify the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, primarily by adjusting or removing the problematic type/emptiness check, while keeping the transformation algorithm intact.

**Metrics:**

Based on the `tool_code` analysis:
*   All input and output grids are NumPy arrays with `shape=(1, 15)` and `dtype='int64'`.
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels.
*   The transformation consistently involves:
    *   Identifying the block's start index, color, and length.
    *   Calculating a new start index by adding 2 to the original start index.
    *   Creating an output grid of the same shape, initially all white (0).
    *   Placing the block with its original color and length at the new start index in the output grid.
*   Example 1: Input block (start=6, color=6, len=4) -> Output block (start=8, color=6, len=4).
*   Example 2: Input block (start=1, color=2, len=3) -> Output block (start=3, color=2, len=3).
*   Example 3: Input block (start=1, color=8, len=5) -> Output block (start=3, color=8, len=5).

**Documented Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Horizontally shift a single colored block two steps right.

Input_Data_Type: NumPy array
Output_Data_Type: NumPy array

Grid_Properties:
  - shape: (1, N) # All examples are (1, 15)
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - content: Contains exactly one contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white color, surrounded by the background color.

Objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: The single contiguous horizontal sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color value (e.g., 6, 2, 8).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_col: The starting column index of the block in the input grid's row.
      - row_index: Always 0 (since grids are 1xN).
  - id: background
    description: Pixels with the background color value.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white).

Action:
  - name: shift_right
    description: Translate the colored_block horizontally.
    parameters:
      - object_id: colored_block
      - distance: 2 columns
      - direction: right

Input_Output_Mapping:
  - Create an output grid with the same shape and dtype as the input, initialized with the background color (0).
  - Identify the colored_block (color, length, start_col) in the input grid's single row.
  - Calculate the new starting column: new_start_col = start_col + 2.
  - Verify that the block fits within the grid at the new location (i.e., new_start_col + length <= grid_width).
  - If it fits, place the block (using its original color and length) into the output grid's row starting at new_start_col.
  - If no block is found in the input, or if the shifted position is out of bounds, the output remains the initialized background grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid (a 1xN NumPy array).
2.  Determine the width of the grid (N).
3.  Create a new output grid of the same shape (1xN) and data type as the input, filled with the background color (0).
4.  Iterate through the single row of the input grid to find the first non-white pixel.
5.  If a non-white pixel is found:
    a.  Record its column index as the `start_col`.
    b.  Record its color as the `block_color`.
    c.  Continue iterating from `start_col` to determine the `length` of the contiguous block of `block_color`.
    d.  Calculate the `new_start_col` by adding 2 to the `start_col`.
    e.  Check if the block fits horizontally: (`new_start_col` >= 0) and (`new_start_col` + `length` <= grid width).
    f.  If the block fits, fill the segment of the output grid's row from `new_start_col` to `new_start_col + length - 1` with the `block_color`.
6.  Return the output grid. (If no non-white block was found or the shifted block did not fit, the grid returned will be the one initialized in step 3).
