            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` confirms that the input grids are being passed as NumPy arrays to the `transform` function, not standard Python lists. The check `if not input_grid` fails for a non-empty NumPy array. The core logic of identifying a single, contiguous, non-white block and shifting it two positions to the right seems correct and consistent across all examples. The strategy is to modify the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, primarily by adjusting or removing the problematic type/emptiness check, while keeping the transformation algorithm intact.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the `tool_code` analysis:\n*   All input and output grids are NumPy arrays with `shape=(1, 15)` and `dtype='int64'`.\n*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n*   The transformation consistently involves:\n    *   Identifying the block's start index, color, and length.\n    *   Calculating a new start index by adding 2 to the original start index.\n    *   Creating an output grid of the same shape, initially all white (0).\n    *   Placing the block with its original color and length at the new start index in the output grid.\n*   Example 1: Input block (start=6, color=6, len=4) -> Output block (start=8, color=6, len=4).\n*   Example 2: Input block (start=1, color=2, len=3) -> Output block (start=3, color=2, len=3).\n*   Example 3: Input block (start=1, color=8, len=5) -> Output block (start=3, color=8, len=5).\n\n**Documented Facts:**\n\n"
