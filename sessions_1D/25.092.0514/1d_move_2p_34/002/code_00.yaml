Task: Horizontally shift a single colored block two steps right.

Input_Data_Type: NumPy array
Output_Data_Type: NumPy array

Grid_Properties:
  - shape: (1, N) # All examples are (1, 15)
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - content: Contains exactly one contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white color, surrounded by the background color.

Objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: The single contiguous horizontal sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color value (e.g., 6, 2, 8).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_col: The starting column index of the block in the input grid's row.
      - row_index: Always 0 (since grids are 1xN).
  - id: background
    description: Pixels with the background color value.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white).

Action:
  - name: shift_right
    description: Translate the colored_block horizontally.
    parameters:
      - object_id: colored_block
      - distance: 2 columns
      - direction: right

Input_Output_Mapping:
  - Create an output grid with the same shape and dtype as the input, initialized with the background color (0).
  - Identify the colored_block (color, length, start_col) in the input grid's single row.
  - Calculate the new starting column: new_start_col = start_col + 2.
  - Verify that the block fits within the grid at the new location (i.e., new_start_col + length <= grid_width).
  - If it fits, place the block (using its original color and length) into the output grid's row starting at new_start_col.
  - If no block is found in the input, or if the shifted position is out of bounds, the output remains the initialized background grid.
