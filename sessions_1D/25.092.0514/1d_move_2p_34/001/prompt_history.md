Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

## Perception of the Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (arrays) of pixels.
2.  **Grid Size:** All examples use a grid of size 1x15.
3.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) acting as a background, and one other non-white color (magenta-6, red-2, azure-8) forming a single block in each example.
4.  **Object Identification:** In each input, there is a single contiguous block (object) of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal shift (translation) of the non-white block.
6.  **Shift Direction & Amount:** In all examples, the non-white block shifts exactly two positions to the right.
7.  **Integrity:** The block's color and length remain unchanged during the shift. The background pixels are filled in where the block moves from, and the block overwrites the background pixels at its new location.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Shift a colored block horizontally

Objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., magenta, red, azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel of the block in the input grid.
  - id: background
    description: The surrounding pixels.
    properties:
      - color: white (0).

Action:
  - name: shift_right
    description: Move an object horizontally to the right.
    parameters:
      - object_id: colored_block
      - shift_amount: 2 (pixels/indices)

Relationship:
  - The colored_block is embedded within the background. The transformation modifies the position of the colored_block relative to the background.

Input_Output_Mapping:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - The output grid is initially composed entirely of the background color.
  - The colored_block from the input is placed into the output grid, starting at an index equal to its original start_index plus the shift_amount (2).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the input grid (a 1D array).
2.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input grid.
3.  Record the color, length, and starting index of this non-white block.
4.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting index found in step 3.
6.  Place the identified non-white block (using its recorded color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new starting index.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
