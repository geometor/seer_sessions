Each input grid contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels, surrounded by white pixels (represented by the value 0). The specific non-white color varies across the training examples (magenta, blue, gray). The transformation consistently moves this colored block horizontally within the grid. By comparing the starting position of the colored block in the input and output grids across all examples, it's evident that the block is always shifted exactly two positions to the right. The length and color of the block remain unchanged. The positions originally occupied by the block's leftmost two pixels become white in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
