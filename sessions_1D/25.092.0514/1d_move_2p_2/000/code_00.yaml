Data:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D (row)
Objects:
  - type: block
    description: A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: varies (magenta, blue, gray in examples)
      - length: constant between input and output for a given example
      - position: horizontal location within the row
Relationships:
  - The input grid contains exactly one non-white block surrounded by white pixels.
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the non-white block in the input grid (start index, end index, color).
  - Shift: Move the identified block horizontally.
    - direction: right
    - distance: 2 positions
  - Update: Modify the grid based on the shift.
    - The block occupies the new positions.
    - The positions vacated by the left end of the block become white (0).
Transformation:
  - rule: The non-white block found in the input grid is shifted two positions to the right to produce the output grid.
