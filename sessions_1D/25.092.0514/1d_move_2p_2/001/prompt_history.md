**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional grid (a single row of pixels). Each input grid contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels, surrounded by white pixels (represented by the value 0). The specific non-white color varies across the training examples (magenta, blue, gray). The transformation consistently moves this colored block horizontally within the grid. By comparing the starting position of the colored block in the input and output grids across all examples, it's evident that the block is always shifted exactly two positions to the right. The length and color of the block remain unchanged. The positions originally occupied by the block's leftmost two pixels become white in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D (row)
Objects:
  - type: block
    description: A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: varies (magenta, blue, gray in examples)
      - length: constant between input and output for a given example
      - position: horizontal location within the row
Relationships:
  - The input grid contains exactly one non-white block surrounded by white pixels.
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the non-white block in the input grid (start index, end index, color).
  - Shift: Move the identified block horizontally.
    - direction: right
    - distance: 2 positions
  - Update: Modify the grid based on the shift.
    - The block occupies the new positions.
    - The positions vacated by the left end of the block become white (0).
Transformation:
  - rule: The non-white block found in the input grid is shifted two positions to the right to produce the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its starting index, ending index, and color.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input, initially filled with white pixels (0).
3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
4.  Calculate the new ending index for the block by adding 2 to its original ending index.
5.  Copy the sequence of non-white pixels (the block) from the input row into the output row, starting at the new calculated starting index and ending at the new calculated ending index.
