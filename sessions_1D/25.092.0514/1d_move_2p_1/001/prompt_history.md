Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are single rows (1-dimensional grids).
*   Each input row contains a single contiguous block (an object) of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
*   The non-white colors vary across examples (gray, blue, orange).
*   The background is always white (0).
*   In the output, the non-white block retains its original color and length.
*   The position of the non-white block changes between the input and the output.
*   Comparing the start position of the block in the input and output, the block consistently shifts 2 positions to the right.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous segment of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, starting index, and length.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Determine the new starting index for the segment by adding 2 to its original starting index.
4.  Copy the identified segment (with its original color and length) into the output row, placing it at the calculated new starting index.
