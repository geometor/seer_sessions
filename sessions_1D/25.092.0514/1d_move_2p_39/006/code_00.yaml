task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1 # Assumed based on examples
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., magenta(6), red(2))
      length: variable
      shape: horizontal_line segment
object_attributes_invariant:
  - color
  - length
transformation:
  type: translation
  direction: horizontal_right
  magnitude: 2 positions
input_output_relation:
  - The single non-white block identified in the input grid is moved 2 cells to the right to produce the output grid.
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - All cells in the output grid not occupied by the shifted block are set to the background color (white, 0).
  - If the shift causes the block to extend beyond the right grid boundary, the block is clipped.
execution_status:
  code_provided_failed: True
  failure_output: "[[]]" for all examples
  likely_cause: Implementation error or runtime/input issue, not incorrect transformation rule.
