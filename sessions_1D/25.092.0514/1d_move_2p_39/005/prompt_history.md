## Perception

The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (or single rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color against a white (color 0) background. The output grid preserves the non-white colored block (same color, same length) but shifts its position horizontally within the grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the white background color. By comparing the starting position of the colored block in the input and output across all examples, it consistently shifts 2 positions to the right.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., magenta(6), red(2))
      length: variable
      shape: horizontal_line
object_attributes_invariant:
  - color
  - length
transformation:
  type: translation
  direction: horizontal_right
  magnitude: 2 positions
input_output_relation:
  - The single non-white block identified in the input grid is moved 2 cells to the right to produce the output grid.
  - All cells in the output grid not occupied by the shifted block are set to the background color (white).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Note its color, length, and starting index.
2.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to the original starting index.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure the placement respects the grid boundaries; if the shift causes the block to extend beyond the right edge, only the part fitting within the grid is placed (although this edge case isn't explicitly shown in the examples, it's implied by standard grid operations).

## General Assessment

The provided code aimed to implement the observed transformation: shifting a single colored block two positions to the right within a 1D grid. However, the execution results show that the `transform` function consistently returned an empty list `[[]]` for all training examples, failing to produce the expected output grids.

A manual trace of the code logic using the first training example suggests that the algorithm *should* produce the correct output. The steps for finding the block (`find_colored_block_1d`), calculating the new position, initializing the output grid, and placing the shifted block using numpy slicing appear sound.

The discrepancy between the logical trace and the execution results points towards potential issues:

1.  **Execution Environment Problem:** There might have been an issue within the code execution environment (e.g., library availability, version conflicts, output capturing).
2.  **Subtle Implementation Bug:** A less obvious error in the code that wasn't caught during the manual trace might exist, possibly related to data types or edge case handling not present in the examples.
3.  **Input/Output Formatting:** While the code attempts to handle the `List[List[int]]` format, there might be a nuance in how the environment passes or expects this data.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-verify Logic:** Double-check the core logic and implementation details.
2.  **Assume Code Logic is Intended:** Since the manual trace works, assume the core algorithm (find block, shift right by 2) is correct.
3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for maximum clarity, reflecting the intended steps accurately.
4.  **No Code Change (Yet):** Without specific error messages or further debugging information pointing to a flaw in the *logic*, changing the code significantly would be speculative. The current code *appears* logically correct based on the task description and examples. The priority is to understand *why* the execution failed.

## Metrics

Based on the execution results showing `Transformed Output: [[]]` for all examples:

*   **Output Grid Size:** 0x0 for all examples.
*   **Expected Grid Size:** 1x12 for all examples.
*   **Size Match:** False for all examples.
*   **Pixel Match:** N/A (cannot compare pixels due to size mismatch).
*   **Match:** False for all examples.

The fundamental failure is the inability to produce an output grid of the correct dimensions, let alone with the correct content.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive a 1D input grid (represented as a list containing one list of integers).
2.  Identify the single contiguous block (sequence) of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the input grid. Determine its color, its starting index (position), and its length.
3.  Create a new 1D grid (represented initially as a numpy array) with the same dimensions (width) as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the new grid by adding 2 to the original starting index found in step 2.
5.  Determine the range of indices in the output grid where the block should be placed. The starting index for placement is the calculated target starting index (step 4), but not less than 0. The ending index for placement is the target starting index plus the block's length, but not more than the grid's width.
6.  If the calculated placement start index is less than the placement end index (meaning there is space to place at least part of the block within the grid boundaries), fill the corresponding segment of the output grid with the block's original color.
7.  Convert the resulting 1D grid (numpy array) back into a list of integers and wrap it in an outer list to match the required `List[List[int]]` output format. Return this final structure.
