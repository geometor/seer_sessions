Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color against a white (color 0) background. The output grid preserves the non-white colored block (same color, same length) but shifts its position horizontally within the grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the white background color. By comparing the starting position of the colored block in the input and output across all examples, it consistently shifts 2 positions to the right.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to the original starting index.\n3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).\n4.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure the placement respects the grid boundaries; if the shift causes the block to extend beyond the right edge, only the part fitting within the grid is placed (although this edge case isn't explicitly shown in the examples, it's implied by standard grid operations)."
