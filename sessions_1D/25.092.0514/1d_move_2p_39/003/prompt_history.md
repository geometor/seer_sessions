## Perception

The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (or single rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color against a white (color 0) background. The output grid preserves the non-white colored block (same color, same length) but shifts its position horizontally within the grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the white background color. By comparing the starting position of the colored block in the input and output across all examples, it consistently shifts 2 positions to the right.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., magenta(6), red(2))
      length: variable
      shape: horizontal_line
object_attributes_invariant:
  - color
  - length
transformation:
  type: translation
  direction: horizontal_right
  magnitude: 2 positions
input_output_relation:
  - The single non-white block identified in the input grid is moved 2 cells to the right to produce the output grid.
  - All cells in the output grid not occupied by the shifted block are set to the background color (white).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Note its color, length, and starting index.
2.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to the original starting index.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure the placement respects the grid boundaries; if the shift causes the block to extend beyond the right edge, only the part fitting within the grid is placed (although this edge case isn't explicitly shown in the examples, it's implied by standard grid operations).

## General Assessment

The previous analysis accurately identified the core transformation: shifting a single, non-white contiguous block two positions to the right within a 1D grid, preserving its color and length. The Python code implemented this logic correctly.

The reported `ValueError` during testing likely stems from an interaction between the testing environment and the initial input validation check (`if not input_grid`), specifically if the `input_grid` is passed as a NumPy array instead of the expected `List[List[int]]`. Evaluating the truthiness of a multi-element NumPy array directly causes this error. The core transformation logic itself appears sound based on the examples.

The strategy is to refine the input validation in the code to be less susceptible to this type error, while keeping the correct transformation logic. The YAML facts and Natural Language Program remain largely the same, as the underlying task pattern is unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Assume the input is a grid containing a single row.
2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within that row. Record its color, starting index, and length.
3.  If no non-white block is found, return a grid of the same dimensions filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output grid by adding 2 to the original starting index found in step 2.
5.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Place the identified block (using its original color and length) into the new output row, starting at the calculated target starting index. Ensure that the placement is clipped to the boundaries of the grid (i.e., do not write pixels outside the row's length).
7.  Format the resulting row as a single-element list (representing a 1xN grid) and return it.
