"""
Identifies the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input 1D grid (row).
Calculates the new starting position by shifting the original starting position 2 cells to the right.
Creates a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color (white, 0).
Places the original block (same color, same length) into the new grid at the calculated new starting position, clipping to grid boundaries.
