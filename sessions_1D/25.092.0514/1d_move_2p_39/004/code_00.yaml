task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
grid_properties:
  width: variable (e.g., 12)
  height: 1
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1 (assumed from examples)
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., magenta(6), red(2))
      length: variable
      shape: horizontal_line (contiguous sequence)
    identification: First sequence of non-background pixels encountered when scanning left-to-right.
object_attributes_invariant:
  - color
  - length
transformation:
  type: translation
  direction: horizontal_right
  magnitude: 2 positions
boundary_handling:
  - If the shifted block extends beyond the right grid boundary, it is clipped.
  - The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.
input_output_relation:
  - The single non-white block identified in the input grid is moved 2 cells to the right.
  - A new output grid of the same dimensions as the input is created, initialized with the background color.
  - The shifted block (maintaining original color and length) is placed onto the output grid, overwriting the background pixels at the new location, respecting grid boundaries.
