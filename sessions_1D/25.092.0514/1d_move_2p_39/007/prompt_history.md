## Perception

The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (or single rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color against a white (color 0) background. The output grid preserves the non-white colored block (same color, same length) but shifts its position horizontally within the grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the white background color. By comparing the starting position of the colored block in the input and output across all examples, it consistently shifts 2 positions to the right.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., magenta(6), red(2))
      length: variable
      shape: horizontal_line
object_attributes_invariant:
  - color
  - length
transformation:
  type: translation
  direction: horizontal_right
  magnitude: 2 positions
input_output_relation:
  - The single non-white block identified in the input grid is moved 2 cells to the right to produce the output grid.
  - All cells in the output grid not occupied by the shifted block are set to the background color (white).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Note its color, length, and starting index.
2.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to the original starting index.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure the placement respects the grid boundaries; if the shift causes the block to extend beyond the right edge, only the part fitting within the grid is placed (although this edge case isn't explicitly shown in the examples, it's implied by standard grid operations).

**General Assessment:**

The provided code implements the transformation logic derived from the initial analysis: identify a single contiguous block of non-white color in a 1D grid and shift it two positions to the right. The code correctly uses numpy for array manipulation and includes logic to find the block and place it in the new position, handling boundary clipping.

However, the execution results show that the `transform` function consistently produced an empty output (`[[]]`) for all training examples, failing to match the expected outputs. The helper function `find_colored_block_1d` was verified and correctly identifies the blocks in all examples. The main `transform` function's logic, when traced manually, also appears to correctly calculate the shifted position and construct the output array.

The discrepancy strongly suggests that the failure is not due to a misunderstanding of the transformation rule (which is consistently "shift block right by 2" across examples) but rather an issue during execution. Potential causes include:
1.  **Input Format Mismatch:** The test harness might be passing input in a format that triggers the function's initial validation checks, causing it to return `[[]]`.
2.  **Runtime Environment:** An unexpected error (e.g., related to numpy operations or type incompatibilities) might occur in the specific testing environment, leading to an abnormal termination or default empty output.
3.  **Hidden Edge Case:** While the visible examples are consistent, there might be an implicit edge case (though none are obvious) that the code doesn't handle, leading to an error.

Since the observed transformation rule ("shift block right by 2") remains consistent and explains all input-output pairs perfectly, the strategy is to maintain this rule description. The failure indicates a need for debugging the implementation or understanding the execution context better, rather than revising the rule itself.

**Metrics:**

The `find_colored_block_1d` helper function was tested against the training inputs:
*   **Example 1:** Input `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Block: color=6, start=1, length=7. Shifted start = 1 + 2 = 3. Expected output `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]`.
*   **Example 2:** Input `[2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Block: color=2, start=0, length=3. Shifted start = 0 + 2 = 2. Expected output `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
*   **Example 3:** Input `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Block: color=6, start=0, length=6. Shifted start = 0 + 2 = 2. Expected output `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

The core logic aligns perfectly with the expected outputs. The execution failure resulting in `[[]]` does not provide new information to alter the perceived transformation rule.

task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1 # Assumed based on examples
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., magenta(6), red(2))
      length: variable
      shape: horizontal_line segment
object_attributes_invariant:
  - color
  - length
transformation:
  type: translation
  direction: horizontal_right
  magnitude: 2 positions
input_output_relation:
  - The single non-white block identified in the input grid is moved 2 cells to the right to produce the output grid.
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - All cells in the output grid not occupied by the shifted block are set to the background color (white, 0).
  - If the shift causes the block to extend beyond the right grid boundary, the block is clipped.
execution_status:
  code_provided_failed: True
  failure_output: "[[]]" for all examples
  likely_cause: Implementation error or runtime/input issue, not incorrect transformation rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive a 1D input grid (represented as a list containing one list of integers).
2.  Verify the input grid format. If invalid, handle appropriately (the previous code returned `[[]]`, indicating a potential failure point or expected error handling).
3.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the input grid. Record its color, starting index, and length.
4.  If no non-white block is found, return a grid of the same dimensions filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  If a block is found, calculate the target starting index for this block in the output grid by adding 2 to its original starting index.
6.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
7.  Determine the actual indices where the block should be placed in the output grid by considering the calculated starting index, the block's length, and the grid's boundaries. Clip the placement range so it does not exceed the grid dimensions (i.e., index 0 to width-1).
8.  Place the identified block (using its original color) into the calculated, clipped index range within the output grid.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
