task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row, represented as 1xN grid)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    properties:
      color: non-white (variable per example, e.g., magenta(6), red(2))
      length: variable (e.g., 7, 3, 6)
      shape: horizontal_line
      position: variable start index (e.g., 1, 0)
object_attributes_invariant:
  - color
  - length
transformation:
  type: translation
  direction: horizontal_right
  magnitude: 2 positions
input_output_relation:
  - The single non-white block identified in the input grid is moved 2 cells to the right relative to its starting position to produce the output grid.
  - All cells in the output grid not occupied by the shifted block are set to the background color (white).
validation_notes:
  - The previous code failed with a `ValueError` likely due to an input type mismatch (NumPy array vs. List) interacting with the `if not input_grid` check. This check should be adjusted or removed. The core logic of finding the block and shifting it by 2 is confirmed by the metrics.
