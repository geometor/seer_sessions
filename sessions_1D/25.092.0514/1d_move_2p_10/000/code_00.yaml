grid_dimensionality: 1D # Assumed based on representation, could be 1xN 2D grid
grid_properties:
  - width: constant (23 in examples)
  - height: constant (1 in examples)
colors:
  - background: white (0)
  - foreground: single non-white color per example (magenta/6, yellow/4, red/2)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: foreground_color
    count: 1

    properties:
      - shape: horizontal segment
      - size: variable (length of the block)
transformation:
  - type: shift

    boundary_handling:
      - right_edge: discard pixels shifted beyond the boundary
      - left_edge: fill new positions with background_color (white/0)
