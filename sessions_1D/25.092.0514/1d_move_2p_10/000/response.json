They all have the same length within each example pair, and the length (23) is consistent across all training examples.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use white (0) as a background color and one other non-white color (magenta/6, yellow/4, red/2) for a foreground object in each example.\n3.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous block (object) of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output grids reveals a spatial shift. The entire content of the input grid seems to move to the right.\n5.  **Shift Amount:** By comparing the starting position of the non-white block in the input and output, the shift appears to be consistently 2 positions to the right in all examples.\n6.  **Boundary Handling:** Pixels shifted off the right edge are discarded. The two new positions created at the left edge are filled with the background color (white/0). The size of the grid remains constant.\n7.  **Object Integrity:** The shape, size, and color of the foreground object are preserved during the shift.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (1xN), initially filled with the background color (white, 0).\n4.  Copy the pixel values from the input grid, starting from the first column (index 0) up to the column at index N-3, into the output grid, starting at the third column (index 2) up to the last column (index N-1).\n5.  The first two columns (index 0 and 1) of the output grid remain filled with the background color (white, 0).\n6.  Return the generated output grid.\n\nEssentially, shift the entire content of the input grid two positions to the right, discarding the two rightmost original pixels and filling the two leftmost positions with white (0)."
