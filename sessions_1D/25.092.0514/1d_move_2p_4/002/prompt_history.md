*   **Perception of Elements**:
    *   The input and output are single rows (1D arrays) of pixels.
    *   Each input row contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (green, gray, or blue in the examples) surrounded by white (0) pixels.
    *   The output row has the same dimensions and colors as the input row.
    *   The position of the non-white block changes between the input and the output.

*   **YAML Facts**:

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, starting position (index), and length.
    2.  Calculate the new starting position for this block by adding 2 to its original starting position.
    3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels.
    4.  Place the identified non-white block (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new position.
