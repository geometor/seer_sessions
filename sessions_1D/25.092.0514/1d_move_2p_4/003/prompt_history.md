*   **Perception of Elements**:
    *   The input and output are single rows (1D arrays) of pixels.
    *   Each input row contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (green, gray, or blue in the examples) surrounded by white (0) pixels.
    *   The output row has the same dimensions and colors as the input row.
    *   The position of the non-white block changes between the input and the output.

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" indicates that the code is attempting to evaluate a NumPy array (likely the input grid or a part of it) in a boolean context, which is not allowed directly. This commonly occurs when the input data, assumed to be a 1D Python list (`List[int]`) in the previous code, is actually a 2D NumPy array, even if it only contains a single row (e.g., shape `(1, N)`).

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the code to correctly handle a 2D NumPy array input, specifically extracting the single row for processing.
2.  Ensure the core logic (finding the non-white block and shifting it right by 2 positions) remains the same, as it aligns with the visual transformation shown in the examples.
3.  Verify the block properties (color, start index, length) and the shift distance (+2) across all examples using code execution.
4.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the input data structure (2D NumPy array) and the refined understanding.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Assume the input is a 2D grid with exactly one row.
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
3.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within this row. Record its color, starting column index, and length.
4.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the output grid by adding 2 to the original starting column index found in step 3.
5.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
6.  Copy the identified non-white block (using its recorded color and length) into the first row of the output grid, starting at the calculated target starting column index. Ensure the block does not extend beyond the grid boundaries.
