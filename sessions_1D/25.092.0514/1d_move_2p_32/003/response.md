"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying a contiguous horizontal segment of a 
non-white color in the first row and translating it 2 positions to the right. 
The segment retains its color and length. The operation is confined to the 
first row, and the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, 
containing the transformed first row and white pixels elsewhere (though examples 
only show 1 row). Assumes background color is white (0).
