Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs appear to be single rows (or potentially columns) of a larger grid, represented as 1D arrays.
*   Each example involves a background of white pixels (0) and a single contiguous horizontal segment (object) of a non-white color (6-magenta, 8-azure, 2-red).
*   The transformation seems to involve moving this non-white segment horizontally within the row.
*   The color and length of the non-white segment remain unchanged between input and output.
*   The length of the row remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Horizontal translation of a colored segment within a row.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static container
  - type: object
    description: A single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      color: Varies (magenta, azure, red in examples), but consistent within a pair.
      length: Varies, but consistent within a pair.
      location: Changes between input and output.
actions:
  - name: translate
    target: non-white object
    details:
      direction: horizontal (right)
      distance: 2 pixels
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The non-white object moves relative to the fixed boundaries of the row.
  - type: identity
    description: The non-white object maintains its color and length during translation.
constraints:
  - Only one non-white object per row.
  - The object is always contiguous.
  - The translation is always horizontal and to the right by a fixed amount (2).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, starting column index, and length.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Calculate the new starting column index for the segment by adding 2 to its original starting column index.
4.  Place the identified segment (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new column index.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Identifies a contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color in the first row
of the input grid and translates it 2 positions to the right, maintaining its

Returns a grid containing only the transformed first row.
