            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" indicates that the code is attempting a boolean comparison on a multi-element array, likely because the input data is being interpreted as a 2D grid (list of lists or 2D numpy array) rather than the single list (1D array) initially assumed for the row. Although the visual representation shows a single row, the underlying data structure passed to the function seems to be a grid containing that row.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input data structure using code execution.\n2.  Adjust the code to explicitly handle a 2D grid input, focusing the transformation logic on the first row (`input_grid[0]`).\n3.  Ensure the `find_segment` function iterates correctly over the elements of the extracted first row.\n4.  Verify the output format matches the examples (a grid containing the single transformed row).\n5.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this understanding.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's examine the structure of the first training example's input and output as they would likely be represented in the testing environment.\n\n"
