"""
Identifies a contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color in the first row
of the input grid and translates it 2 positions to the right, maintaining its
color and length. The background is assumed to be white (0).
Assumes input is a grid (list of lists) format.
Returns a grid containing only the transformed first row.
