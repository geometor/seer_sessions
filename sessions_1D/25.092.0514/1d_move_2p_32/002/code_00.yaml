task_description: Horizontally translate a colored segment within the first row of a grid.
input_format: 2D grid (list of lists or numpy array), typically 1xN dimensions.
output_format: 2D grid containing only the transformed first row, same dimensions as input.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: Fills the first row, except for the colored segment.
  - type: object
    description: A single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels located within the first row.
    properties:
      color: Varies (magenta, azure, red in examples), but consistent within a pair.
      length: Varies, but consistent within a pair.
      location: Position within the first row changes between input and output.
      row_index: Always 0 (the first row).
actions:
  - name: extract_row
    target: input grid
    details: Select the first row (index 0) for processing.
  - name: find_segment
    target: extracted first row
    details: Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels, noting its color, starting column index, and length.
  - name: translate_segment
    target: identified segment
    details:
      direction: horizontal (right)
      distance: 2 pixels (columns)
      boundary_handling: Segment is placed starting at the new calculated position. If the shift causes part of the segment to go beyond the right boundary, that part is truncated (implicitly handled by array slicing).
  - name: construct_output
    details: Create a new 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with white (0). Place the translated segment into the first row of this new grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The non-white segment moves horizontally within the confines of the first row.
  - type: identity
    description: The non-white segment retains its color and length during translation.
constraints:
  - Only the first row of the input grid contains relevant information.
  - There is exactly one contiguous non-white segment in the first row.
  - The translation is always 2 pixels to the right.
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
