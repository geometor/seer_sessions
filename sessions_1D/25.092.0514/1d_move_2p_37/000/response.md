*   **Perception:** The task operates on single-row grids. Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid contains the same block of non-white pixels, but its position within the row has changed. The block appears to be shifted horizontally to the right by a fixed amount.

            details: The block of blue pixels moves 2 positions to the right.
        background_color: 0 # white

    analysis:
      consistency: The transformation rule (shift right by 2) is consistent across all examples.
      object_properties: The color and size of the non-white block remain unchanged.
      grid_properties: The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.
      shift_details: The shift is purely horizontal (within the row). Pixels shifted beyond the right boundary are discarded. Empty spaces created on the left are filled with the background color (white).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color and its starting and ending column indices.
    2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
    3.  Calculate the new starting column index for the non-white sequence by adding 2 to its original starting index.
    4.  Copy the original sequence of non-white pixels into the new output row, starting at the calculated new starting column index. Ensure that copying stops if the end of the row is reached.
