Okay, I will analyze the provided task examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples consist of a single row (a 1xN grid).
2.  **Color Palette:** Each input uses white (0) and one other non-white color (red=2, magenta=6, green=3).
3.  **Object:** The primary object in each input row is a contiguous horizontal block (segment) of the non-white color.
4.  **Background:** The remaining cells are filled with the white color (0).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the non-white block.
6.  **Shift Direction:** Comparing input and output, the non-white block moves to the right.
7.  **Shift Amount:** In all three examples, the block shifts exactly 2 positions to the right.
8.  **Grid Size:** The dimensions (length) of the row remain unchanged.
9.  **Content Preservation:** The non-white block itself (its color and length) is preserved during the shift. The white pixels rearrange to fill the space left by the shift and the space before the new block position.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: non-white # The specific color varies (red, magenta, green)
    contiguity: contiguous_horizontal
    quantity: 1 # Exactly one such segment per input
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
actions:
  - name: shift_segment
    target: non-white segment
    direction: right
    magnitude: 2 positions
    constraints:
      - grid_boundary: The shift occurs within the row boundaries.
      - content_preservation: The color and length of the segment are unchanged.
relationships:
  - The non-white segment is embedded within the white background.
  - The output is a result of repositioning the non-white segment within the same grid dimensions, filling the remaining space with the white background color.
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: Input and output rows have the same length.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Determine the starting column index of this segment.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  Copy the identified non-white segment into the output row, starting at a column index equal to its original starting index plus 2.
5.  Ensure the segment does not extend beyond the row boundaries (though this doesn't seem to be a constraint tested in the examples, it's good practice).
6.  The output row, now containing the shifted segment and the surrounding white pixels, is the result.
