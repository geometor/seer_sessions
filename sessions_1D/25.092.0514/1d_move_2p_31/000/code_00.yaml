task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: non-white # The specific color varies (red, magenta, green)
    contiguity: contiguous_horizontal
    quantity: 1 # Exactly one such segment per input
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
actions:
  - name: shift_segment
    target: non-white segment
    direction: right
    magnitude: 2 positions
    constraints:
      - grid_boundary: The shift occurs within the row boundaries.
      - content_preservation: The color and length of the segment are unchanged.
relationships:
  - The non-white segment is embedded within the white background.
  - The output is a result of repositioning the non-white segment within the same grid dimensions, filling the remaining space with the white background color.
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: Input and output rows have the same length.
