## General Assessment

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation: locating a single contiguous block of non-white color in a 1D grid and shifting it two positions to the right. The provided code implemented this logic using NumPy. However, all examples failed with the error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()".

This error typically arises when a multi-element NumPy array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if my_array:`). While local testing of the provided NumPy code showed it produced the correct outputs for the training examples, the error suggests an incompatibility or unexpected interaction within the execution environment where the code was tested.

**Strategy:**
The most likely cause is the use of NumPy arrays interacting unexpectedly with the testing framework. To resolve this, the transformation logic will be implemented using standard Python lists and operations, avoiding NumPy entirely. This should prevent the ambiguous truth value error, assuming the core logic remains correct. The natural language program describing the transformation remains accurate.

## Metrics

Let's verify the block properties for each training example.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Re-use the helper function from the previous attempt for analysis
def find_colored_block(row):
    start_index = -1
    end_index = -1
    color = 0
    in_block = False
    # Ensure row is treated as a standard list or 1D sequence
    row_list = list(row) 
    for i, pixel in enumerate(row_list):
        # Basic type check and conversion if possible
        try:
            p_val = int(pixel)
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            continue # Skip non-integer values

        if p_val != 0 and not in_block:
            start_index = i
            color = p_val
            in_block = True
            end_index = i
        elif p_val != 0 and in_block:
            if p_val == color:
                end_index = i
            else:
                 break
        elif p_val == 0 and in_block:
            break
    if start_index == -1:
        return None, None, None
    return start_index, end_index, color

print("--------|-------------|-----------|--------|-------|--------------|------------")

for i, (input_row, output_row) in enumerate(zip(inputs, outputs)):
    width = len(input_row)
    in_start, in_end, in_color = find_colored_block(input_row)
    out_start, out_end, out_color = find_colored_block(output_row)
    
    if in_start is not None:
        in_len = in_end - in_start + 1
        # Calculate expected output start based on input start + shift
        expected_out_start = in_start + 2 
        # Check if calculated output start matches observed output start
        match = (expected_out_start == out_start) if out_start is not None else False
        print(f"Train {i+1} | {in_start:<11} | {in_end:<9} | {in_len:<6} | {in_color:<5} | {out_start:<12} | {out_end:<10} | Shift +2 Match: {match}")
    else:
        print(f"Train {i+1} | No block found in input")

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 18] # Observed in examples, consistently 1x18
  output: [1, 18] # Same as input
grid_representation: 1D array or list
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: single non-white color (e.g., 2 (red), 6 (magenta))
      shape: horizontal_line (segment in 1D)
      count: 1 # Exactly one block per input grid
      location: Variable start/end indices within the row
      size: Variable length (e.g., 10, 11, 3 pixels in examples)
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  distance: 2 # Pixels/indices
  constraints:
    - The block's color and length are preserved.
    - The shift occurs relative to the block's starting position.
    - The grid boundaries are maintained; pixels shifted beyond the boundary are clipped (implicitly, as the output grid is initialized to background).
relationship:
  - The colored block is the only non-background element.
  - The output is generated by relocating the input block within a same-sized background grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Assume the input is a single row (a list of integers).
2.  Identify the single contiguous block (sequence) of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the input row. Record its starting index, ending index, and color.
3.  Determine the length of the identified block.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 (the shift distance) to the original starting index found in step 2.
6.  Place the identified colored block into the output row starting at the calculated new starting index. Iterate for the length of the block, writing the block's color into the corresponding positions in the output row, ensuring not to write past the end of the row.
7.  Return the modified output row, formatted as a list within a list to match the expected grid structure `[[row]]`.
