task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 18] # Observed in examples, consistently 1x18
  output: [1, 18] # Same as input
grid_representation: 1D array or list
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: single non-white color (e.g., 2 (red), 6 (magenta))
      shape: horizontal_line (segment in 1D)
      count: 1 # Exactly one block per input grid
      location: Variable start/end indices within the row
      size: Variable length (e.g., 10, 11, 3 pixels in examples)
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  distance: 2 # Pixels/indices
  constraints:
    - The block's color and length are preserved.
    - The shift occurs relative to the block's starting position.
    - The grid boundaries are maintained; pixels shifted beyond the boundary are clipped (implicitly, as the output grid is initialized to background).
relationship:
  - The colored block is the only non-background element.
  - The output is generated by relocating the input block within a same-sized background grid.
