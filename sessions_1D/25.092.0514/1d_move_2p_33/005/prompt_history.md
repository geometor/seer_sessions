## Perception

The task involves transforming a 1-dimensional grid (represented as a single row).
Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
The transformation consists of shifting this colored block two positions to the right within the grid.
The size and color of the block remain unchanged.
The background remains white.
All example grids have a width of 18.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 18] # Observed in examples
  output: [1, 18] # Same as input
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., 2 (red), 6 (magenta))
      shape: horizontal_line
      count: 1 # Only one such block per input grid
transformation:
  action: shift
  direction: right
  distance: 2 # Pixels
relationship:
  - The colored block is embedded within a white background.
  - The position of the block changes, but its color and size are preserved.
  - The output grid maintains the original dimensions and background color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input grid.
2.  Determine the starting and ending coordinates of this block.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Place the identified colored block into the output grid, shifted two positions to the right from its original starting position.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests that the `transform` function, specifically the earlier version tested, was receiving a NumPy array as input and attempting to use it directly in a boolean context (e.g., `if input_grid:` or similar). While the latest provided code uses standard Python lists, the error likely originated from the interaction between the testing environment (which might use NumPy) and a previous version of the code expecting NumPy arrays but handling them incorrectly in conditional statements.

The core logic identified—finding a single contiguous block of non-white color and shifting it two positions to the right—appears correct and consistent across all training examples. The `find_colored_block` helper function successfully identifies the block properties in test runs.

**Strategy:**

The most robust approach is to ensure the `transform` function explicitly handles the expected input format. Given the error, assuming the input might be a NumPy array (even if the desired output is a list of lists) is safer. The function should:
1.  Accept the input, potentially converting it to a NumPy array if it isn't already, or handling list/NumPy input gracefully.
2.  Use the `find_colored_block` helper (adapted if necessary for NumPy) to locate the block.
3.  Create the output array using NumPy for potentially easier slicing/assignment.
4.  Perform the shift by assigning the block's color to the new indices in the output array.
5.  Convert the final NumPy array back to the required list of lists format before returning.

**Correction:** The metric calculation showed an output width of 17 for example 3, which contradicts the visual inspection and the problem description. Let me re-check the provided output for example 3.
Input: `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]` (18 wide)
Output: `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0]]` (18 wide)
The code output indicating 17 wide for example 3 output is incorrect, likely a typo in my manual transcription within the `tool_code` block. The actual data shows it's 18 wide. All examples maintain dimensions, color, and length, with a consistent right shift of 2.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels. Let the width of the row be `W`.
2.  Identify the single contiguous sequence (block) of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Record its starting column index (`start_col`), ending column index (`end_col`), and color (`block_color`).
3.  Calculate the length of the block: `length = end_col - start_col + 1`.
4.  Create a new output row of width `W`, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block in the output row: `new_start_col = start_col + 2`.
6.  For each column index `j` from `new_start_col` to `new_start_col + length - 1`:
    *   Check if `j` is a valid column index (i.e., `0 <= j < W`).
    *   If `j` is valid, set the pixel at index `j` in the output row to `block_color`.
7.  Return the output row, formatted as a grid (a list containing the single output row).
