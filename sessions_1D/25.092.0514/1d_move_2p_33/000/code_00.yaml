task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 18] # Observed in examples
  output: [1, 18] # Same as input
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., 2 (red), 6 (magenta))
      shape: horizontal_line
      count: 1 # Only one such block per input grid
transformation:
  action: shift
  direction: right
  distance: 2 # Pixels
relationship:
  - The colored block is embedded within a white background.
  - The position of the block changes, but its color and size are preserved.
  - The output grid maintains the original dimensions and background color.
