task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 18] # Observed in all examples
  output: [1, 18] # Same as input
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., 2 (red), 6 (magenta))
      shape: horizontal_line (1 pixel high)
      count: 1 # Exactly one non-white block per input grid
      length: variable (3, 10, 11 pixels observed)
      position: variable start column
transformation:
  action: shift # Translation
  direction: right # Positive x-direction
  distance: 2 # Pixels/columns
relationship:
  - The single non-white block is the only object modified.
  - The block's color and length are preserved during the shift.
  - The background remains unchanged (white).
  - The grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The transformation is independent of the block's color or length.
constraints:
  - Input grids are always 1 row high.
  - Input grids always contain exactly one contiguous block of non-white color.
  - Blocks shifted past the right edge are truncated (implicitly, as they are not drawn outside bounds).
