## General Assessment

The core logic identified previously – finding a single contiguous block of non-white color in a 1D row and shifting it two positions to the right – appears correct based on the visual inspection of the examples. The reported error (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`) strongly suggests that the testing environment executed an earlier version of the code which relied on NumPy arrays, and encountered an issue in a boolean context (like an `if` statement checking the array itself instead of using `.any()` or `.all()`).

The final provided Python code (labeled "Previous Code" in the prompt) uses standard Python lists and avoids NumPy, which should prevent this specific error. Assuming this list-based code is the intended version for evaluation, the strategy is to verify the logic against the examples and ensure the implementation handles potential edge cases correctly (e.g., blocks near the edges, empty inputs). The transformation seems consistent across all examples.

## Metrics

Let's gather metrics for the colored block in each example using the provided `find_colored_block` helper function.


``` python
import collections

# Copied from the provided 'Previous Code'
def find_colored_block(row):
    if not isinstance(row, list) or not row:
        return None, None, None
    start_index = -1
    end_index = -1
    color = 0
    in_block = False
    for i, pixel in enumerate(row):
        try:
            p_val = int(pixel)
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            p_val = 0
        if p_val != 0 and not in_block:
            start_index = i
            color = p_val
            in_block = True
            end_index = i
        elif p_val != 0 and in_block:
            if p_val == color:
                end_index = i
            else:
                break
        elif p_val == 0 and in_block:
            break
    if start_index == -1:
        return None, None, None
    return start_index, end_index, color

# --- Calculate Metrics ---
metrics = []
for i, (in_row, out_row) in enumerate([(train_1_in, train_1_out), (train_2_in, train_2_out), (train_3_in, train_3_out)], 1):
    in_start, in_end, in_color = find_colored_block(in_row)
    out_start, out_end, out_color = find_colored_block(out_row)
    in_len = (in_end - in_start + 1) if in_start is not None else 0
    out_len = (out_end - out_start + 1) if out_start is not None else 0
    shift = (out_start - in_start) if in_start is not None and out_start is not None else None

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 18] # Observed in all examples
  output: [1, 18] # Same as input
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., 2 (red), 6 (magenta))
      shape: horizontal_line (1 pixel high)
      count: 1 # Exactly one non-white block per input grid
      length: variable (3, 10, 11 pixels observed)
      position: variable start column
transformation:
  action: shift # Translation
  direction: right # Positive x-direction
  distance: 2 # Pixels/columns
relationship:
  - The single non-white block is the only object modified.
  - The block's color and length are preserved during the shift.
  - The background remains unchanged (white).
  - The grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The transformation is independent of the block's color or length.
constraints:
  - Input grids are always 1 row high.
  - Input grids always contain exactly one contiguous block of non-white color.
  - Blocks shifted past the right edge are truncated (implicitly, as they are not drawn outside bounds).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Assume the input is a single row (a list of pixel values).
2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the input row. Record its starting index, ending index, and color.
3.  Determine the width of the input row.
4.  Create a new output row of the same width, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 (the shift distance) to the original starting index found in step 2.
6.  Iterate from the calculated new starting index up to `new_start_index + block_length - 1`. For each index in this range:
    *   Check if the index is within the valid bounds of the output row (i.e., between 0 and `width - 1`).
    *   If it is within bounds, set the pixel at that index in the output row to the color of the block identified in step 2.
7.  Return the completed output row, formatted as a list within a list to represent the 1xN grid.
