  output: [1, 18] # Confirmed 1x18 for all examples

objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (2=red, 6=magenta observed)
      shape: horizontal_line # Segment on a single row
      count: 1 # Exactly one block per input grid
      location: defined by start and end column indices
      size: defined by length (number of pixels in the block)
transformation:
  action: shift # Horizontal translation
  direction: right # Increasing column index
  distance: 2 # Pixels/columns
consistency_checks: # Properties preserved during transformation
