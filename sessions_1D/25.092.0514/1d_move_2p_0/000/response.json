            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Although ARC tasks usually involve 2D grids, the input and output are presented here as flat, 1D sequences of numbers (pixels). The length of each sequence is 25, suggesting an underlying 5x5 grid structure, but the transformation seems to operate on the 1D sequence directly.\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses two colors: white (`0`) as the background and one other color (`2` - red, `7` - orange, `8` - azure) forming a single contiguous block within the sequence.\n3.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output sequences, the block of non-white pixels maintains its internal structure and length, but its position within the sequence changes. The sequence appears to be shifted or rotated.\n4.  **Shift Pattern:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the red block starts at index 0 in the input and index 2 in the output. The last two elements (`0, 0`) of the input appear at the beginning of the output.\n    *   In `train_2`, the orange block starts at index 4 in the input and index 6 in the output. The last two elements (`0, 0`) of the input appear at the beginning of the output.\n    *   In `train_3`, the azure block starts at index 1 in the input and index 3 in the output. The last two elements (`0, 0`) of the input appear at the beginning of the output.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The transformation is consistently a circular right shift (or rotation) of the entire 1D sequence by 2 positions.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
