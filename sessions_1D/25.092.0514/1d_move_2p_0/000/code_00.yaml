Data:
  Structure: 1D array of pixels (likely flattened from a 2D grid).
  Length: 25 (consistent across examples).
Elements:
  Pixels: Integers representing colors.
  Background: White (0).
  Foreground: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels. The specific color varies (red, orange, azure).
Transformation:
  Type: Circular shift (rotation).
  Direction: Right.
  Magnitude: 2 positions.
  Operation: The entire 1D array is treated as a sequence, and its elements are rotated 2 steps to the right, with elements shifting off the end wrapping around to the beginning.
