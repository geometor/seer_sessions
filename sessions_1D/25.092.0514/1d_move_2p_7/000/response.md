Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are all 1-dimensional grids (rows) of size 1x7.
2.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) as a background color. Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (green (3) or red (2)).
3.  **Object Identification:** The key object in each input is the contiguous block of non-white pixels. In all examples, this block has a length of 3.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the position of the non-white block within the grid. The color and length of the block remain unchanged.
5.  **Positional Change:**
    *   In `train_1`, the green block `[3, 3, 3]` moves from starting index 1 to starting index 3 (a shift of +2).
    *   In `train_2`, the red block `[2, 2, 2]` moves from starting index 0 to starting index 2 (a shift of +2).
    *   In `train_3`, the green block `[3, 3, 3]` moves from starting index 0 to starting index 2 (a shift of +2).
6.  **Pattern:** In all examples, the single non-white block is shifted exactly 2 positions to the right. The rest of the grid remains the background white color.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation_1d
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # Represents a row
  size: [1, 7] # Consistent across examples
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: block
    description: A single contiguous sequence of non-background pixels.
    properties:
      color: variable (non-zero, e.g., 2, 3)
      length: 3 (consistent across examples)
      count: 1 per grid
transformation:
  action: shift
  target: block object
  details:
    direction: right
    distance: 2 positions
    constraints:
      - Color of the block is preserved.
      - Length of the block is preserved.
      - Grid dimensions are preserved.
      - Background pixels fill the remaining space.
relationship:
  output_block_start_index: input_block_start_index + 2
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define the background color as white (0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid (row) to locate the starting index and color of the contiguous block of non-background pixels.
3.  Determine the length of this block.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output grid by adding 2 to the starting index found in the input grid.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, and initialize all its pixels to the background color (white).
6.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated target starting index.
