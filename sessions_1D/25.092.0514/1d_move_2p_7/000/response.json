Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (green (3) or red (2)).\n3.  **Object Identification:** The key object in each input is the contiguous block of non-white pixels. In all examples, this block has a length of 3.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the position of the non-white block within the grid. The color and length of the block remain unchanged.\n5.  **Positional Change:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the green block `[3, 3, 3]` moves from starting index 1 to starting index 3 (a shift of +2).\n    *   In `train_2`, the red block `[2, 2, 2]` moves from starting index 0 to starting index 2 (a shift of +2).\n    *   In `train_3`, the green block `[3, 3, 3]` moves from starting index 0 to starting index 2 (a shift of +2).\n6.  **Pattern:** In all examples, the single non-white block is shifted exactly 2 positions to the right. The rest of the grid remains the background white color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
