task_type: grid_transformation_1d
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # Represents a row
  size: [1, 7] # Consistent across examples
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: block
    description: A single contiguous sequence of non-background pixels.
    properties:
      color: variable (non-zero, e.g., 2, 3)
      length: 3 (consistent across examples)
      count: 1 per grid
transformation:
  action: shift
  target: block object
  details:
    direction: right
    distance: 2 positions
    constraints:
      - Color of the block is preserved.
      - Length of the block is preserved.
      - Grid dimensions are preserved.
      - Background pixels fill the remaining space.
