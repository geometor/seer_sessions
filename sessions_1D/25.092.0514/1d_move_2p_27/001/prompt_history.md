## train_1

**input:**
```
1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0
```


## train_3

**input:**
```

**output:**
```

Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

*   The input and output are both single rows (1-dimensional grids).
*   Each input row starts with a sequence of identical non-white pixels, followed by white pixels (0) filling the rest of the row.
*   The non-white color varies between examples (blue, orange, red).
*   The length of the non-white block also varies (5, 4, 3).
*   In the output, the block of non-white pixels is shifted to the right.
*   The amount of shift appears constant across all examples. Comparing the starting position (index 0) in the input to the starting position in the output (index 2), the shift is 2 positions to the right.
*   The space vacated by the shift (the first two positions) is filled with white pixels.
*   The pixels to the right of the shifted block remain white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 9]
  output: [1, 9]
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white # varies per example (1, 7, 2)
    location_input: starts at index 0
    location_output: starts at index 2
transformation:
  type: translation
  properties:
    object_to_move: the contiguous non-white block
    direction: right
    distance: 2 pixels
    fill_vacated_space_with: background_color (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels starting at the beginning (index 0) of the input row. Record its color and length.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Copy the identified non-white block from the input into the output row, starting at index 2.
