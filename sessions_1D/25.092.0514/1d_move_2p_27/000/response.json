Comparing the starting position (index 0) in the input to the starting position in the output (index 2), the shift is 2 positions to the right.\n*   The space vacated by the shift (the first two positions) is filled with white pixels.\n*   The pixels to the right of the shifted block remain white.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
