In example 1, the block `4 4 4` moves from index 5 to index 7 (shift of 2). In example 2, the block `4...4` moves from index 1 to index 3 (shift of 2). In example 3, the block `3 3 3 3` moves from index 0 to index 2 (shift of 2). The shift is consistently 2 positions to the right.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
