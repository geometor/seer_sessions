task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Specifically 1xN shape
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    location: within the single row of the grid
    properties:
      - color: non-white (varies: red (2), orange (7))
      - size: variable length (preserved during transformation)
      - position: variable column indices (changes during transformation)
actions:
  - name: shift_object_horizontally
    target: the non-white contiguous_block
    direction: right
    distance: 2 columns
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The non-white block exists entirely within the first (and only) row, bounded horizontally by the background color.
constraints:
  - The input grid dimensions are always 1xN (1 row, N columns).
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions (1xN).
  - The color of the block remains unchanged.
  - The length (number of columns) of the block remains unchanged.
  - There is always exactly one non-white contiguous block in the input row.
  - The shifted block must fit entirely within the grid boundaries in the output (observed from examples, no wrapping or truncation shown).
