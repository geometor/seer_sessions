**Perception:**

The input and output are both 1-dimensional arrays (or grids of height 1) containing integer values representing colors. In each example pair, the input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red or orange) surrounded by white pixels (0). The output grid shows this same block of color, identical in size and color, shifted two positions to the right compared to its position in the input grid. The rest of the grid remains filled with white pixels.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine the starting and ending indices of this block.
3.  Calculate the new starting index by adding 2 to the original starting index.
4.  Calculate the new ending index by adding 2 to the original ending index.
5.  Create a new grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Place the original non-white block into the new grid starting at the calculated new starting index and ending at the calculated new ending index.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: find a single contiguous block of non-white color and shift it two positions to the right. The code failure stemmed from an incorrect assumption about the input data structure. While visually presented as 1D arrays, ARC tasks consistently use 2D grids (lists of lists). The code treated the input as a flat 1D list `[...]` instead of a 2D list containing one row `[[...]]`. This mismatch caused errors in numpy array manipulation, specifically in index calculation (`np.where`) and value assignment, resulting in empty output grids.

The strategy is straightforward: Adjust the code to expect and operate on a 2D grid of shape 1xN. This involves correctly extracting the single row, finding the block's column indices within that row, and placing the block into the corresponding row and updated column indices of the output grid.

**Metrics:**

Metrics gathered via code execution confirm the block properties and the expected shift:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is guaranteed to be a 2D grid with exactly one row (shape 1xN).
2.  Create an output grid of the same 1xN dimensions, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Examine the single row of the input grid.
4.  Locate the sequence of contiguous non-white pixels (the colored block).
5.  Identify the starting column index, the ending column index (exclusive), and the color of this block.
6.  Calculate the new starting column index by adding 2 to the original starting column index.
7.  Calculate the new ending column index by adding 2 to the original ending column index.
8.  In the single row of the output grid, fill the pixels from the new starting column index up to (but not including) the new ending column index with the color identified in step 5.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
