**Perception:**

The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output is identical to the input, except that the colored block has been shifted exactly two positions to the right. The color and length of the block remain unchanged. The rest of the grid remains white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a 1D object
Input:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 1xN (single row)
  - content:
    - background: white pixels (0)
    - object:
      - type: contiguous block
      - count: 1
      - color: non-white (e.g., orange, yellow, red)
      - properties:
        - color: preserved in output
        - length: preserved in output
Output:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: same as input (1xN)
  - content:
    - background: white pixels (0)
    - object:
      - type: contiguous block (same as input)
      - location: shifted compared to input
Transformation:
  - action: horizontal shift
  - target: the single non-white object
  - parameters:
    - direction: right
    - distance: 2 positions
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, starting position, and length.
2.  Create an output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output row, starting at a position 2 units to the right of its original starting position in the input row.
