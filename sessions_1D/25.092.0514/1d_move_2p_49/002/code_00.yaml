Task: Shift a 1D object horizontally
Input_Format:
  - type: grid (potentially NumPy array)
  - dimensions: 1xN (single row, N=29 in examples)
Input_Content:
  - background: white pixels (0)
  - object:
    - type: contiguous horizontal block
    - count: 1
    - color: non-white (orange, yellow, red observed)
    - properties:
      - location: defined by start_index
      - size: defined by length
Output_Format:
  - type: grid (match input format, likely NumPy array if input is)
  - dimensions: same as input (1xN)
Output_Content:
  - background: white pixels (0)
  - object:
    - type: same contiguous block as input
    - properties:
      - color: same as input object
      - length: same as input object
      - location: start_index shifted compared to input
Transformation:
  - action: horizontal_shift
  - target: the single non-white object
  - parameters:
    - direction: right
    - distance: 2 positions
Constraints:
  - Input grid is always 1 row.
  - Only one contiguous non-white object exists.
  - Object does not wrap around edges (based on examples).
