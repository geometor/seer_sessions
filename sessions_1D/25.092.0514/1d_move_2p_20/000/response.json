Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (magenta or yellow in the examples) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation involves shifting this colored block exactly two positions to the right within the grid boundaries. The size of the grid, the color of the block, and the length of the block remain unchanged. The white pixels are rearranged to fill the space around the shifted block.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
