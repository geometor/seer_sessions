Task: Shift a colored block
Components:
  - Grid: A single row of pixels.
  - Background: Consists of white pixels (0).
  - Object:
      Type: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      Properties:
        - Color: Consistent within the block (e.g., Green (3) or Yellow (4)).
        - Size: The number of pixels in the block remains constant between input and output.
        - Position: Defined by the start and end indices within the row.
Transformation:
  - Action: The object (colored block) is shifted horizontally.
  - Details:
      - Direction: Right.
      - Amount: 2 positions.
      - Integrity: The color and size of the block are preserved.
      - Background: Remains white (0).
Relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by repositioning the single colored block.
  - The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.
