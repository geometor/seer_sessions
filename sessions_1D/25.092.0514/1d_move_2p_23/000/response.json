The input grid contains a sequence of white pixels (value 0) and a single contiguous block of a non-white color (Green=3 or Yellow=4). The output grid has the same dimensions and contains the same block of non-white color, but its position within the row has changed. The rest of the grid remains white. Specifically, the non-white block appears to be shifted two positions to the right in each example.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
