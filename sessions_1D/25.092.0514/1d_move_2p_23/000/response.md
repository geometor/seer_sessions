Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

Each example consists of a single row (or a 1xN grid). The input grid contains a sequence of white pixels (value 0) and a single contiguous block of a non-white color (Green=3 or Yellow=4). The output grid has the same dimensions and contains the same block of non-white color, but its position within the row has changed. The rest of the grid remains white. Specifically, the non-white block appears to be shifted two positions to the right in each example.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a colored block
Components:
  - Grid: A single row of pixels.
  - Background: Consists of white pixels (0).
  - Object:
      Type: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      Properties:
        - Color: Consistent within the block (e.g., Green (3) or Yellow (4)).
        - Size: The number of pixels in the block remains constant between input and output.
        - Position: Defined by the start and end indices within the row.
Transformation:
  - Action: The object (colored block) is shifted horizontally.
  - Details:
      - Direction: Right.
      - Amount: 2 positions.
      - Integrity: The color and size of the block are preserved.
      - Background: Remains white (0).
Relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by repositioning the single colored block.
  - The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Determine its color, start index, and end index.
2.  Calculate the new start index by adding 2 to the original start index.
3.  Calculate the new end index by adding 2 to the original end index.
4.  Create a new output row of the same size as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
5.  Place the identified block of non-white pixels (using its original color) into the new output row, starting at the calculated new start index and ending at the calculated new end index.
6.  Return the modified row as the output.
