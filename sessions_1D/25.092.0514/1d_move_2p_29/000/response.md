*   **Perception:** The input and output are single rows (1D grids) of pixels. Each input row contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output row contains the same non-white block, also surrounded by white pixels, but shifted horizontally to the right. The size and color of the non-white block remain unchanged. The overall size of the row remains unchanged. The transformation appears to be a fixed horizontal shift of the non-white object.

        Transformation:

            Amount: 2 positions
            Result: Object 1 moved from starting index 1 to starting index 3. Background (white pixels) rearranged accordingly.

            Amount: 2 positions
            Result: Object 1 moved from starting index 0 to starting index 2. Background (white pixels) rearranged accordingly.

    General Rule:
      - Input contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (the object) on a white background.
      - The transformation shifts this object exactly 2 positions to the right.
      - The background pixels (white) fill the space vacated by the object on the left and any space remaining on the right.
      - The size of the grid and the object remain unchanged.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, length, and starting index.
    2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
    3.  Calculate the new starting index for the non-white block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
    4.  Place the identified non-white block (with its original color and length) into the output row starting at the calculated new index. Ensure the block stays within the grid boundaries (no wrapping occurs in the examples).
