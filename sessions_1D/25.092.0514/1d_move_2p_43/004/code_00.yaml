Grid_Type: 1D array (represented as a single row in a 2D grid)
Grid_Dimensions:
  - Width: 15 (consistent across examples)
  - Height: 1 (consistent across examples)
Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Extent: Fills the grid cells not occupied by the Shape object.
  - Type: Shape
    Description: A single contiguous block (horizontal line segment) of non-white pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Variable (azure, yellow, magenta in examples)
      - Length: Variable (8, 10, 11 in examples)
      - Position: Defined by start index in the 1D array.
Relationships:
  - The Shape object is embedded within the Background along the single row.
Actions:
  - Action_Type: Translate Shape Object
  - Target: The single non-white Shape object.
  - Direction: Right (positive index direction)
  - Magnitude: 2 positions (columns)
  - Effect:
    - The Shape object's start index in the output is the input start index + 2.
    - The area occupied by the Shape object in the output is filled with its original color.
    - If the translation causes the Shape object to extend beyond the right grid boundary, the exceeding part is truncated.
    - All other positions in the output grid are filled with the Background color (white).
Constraints:
  - Grid dimensions (width, height) remain constant.
  - Shape color and length remain constant (unless truncated by boundary).
  - Only one non-white object exists in the input.
