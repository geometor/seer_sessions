Transformation Rule Description:
The transformation takes a 1-dimensional input grid (represented as a single row).
It identifies the first contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
This block is then shifted exactly 2 positions to the right.
The pixels in the new positions occupied by the shifted block take the color of the block.
All other pixels in the output grid are set to white (0).
The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.
