Grid_Type: 1D array (represented as a 1xN grid)
Background_Color: white (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Segment
    Description: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except white (azure, yellow, magenta in examples). Persists through transformation.
      - Length: Variable (8, 10, 11 in examples). Persists through transformation.
      - Start_Index: Variable (1, 1, 0 in examples). Defines the leftmost position of the segment.
Relationships:
  - The Segment is embedded within the Background.
Transformation:
  - Type: Horizontal Translation
  - Target: The Segment object.
  - Parameters:
      - Direction: Right
      - Distance: 2 pixels (columns)
  - Effects:
      - The Segment's Start_Index increases by 2.
      - The area occupied by the translated Segment in the output grid takes the Segment's color.
      - Pixels outside the translated Segment's area become Background_Color (white).
  - Constraints:
      - Grid dimensions (height=1, width=N) remain unchanged.
      - Only one Segment object exists per grid.
      - Segment color and length remain unchanged.
      - If the translation pushes part of the Segment beyond the right edge of the grid, that part is truncated (not observed in examples, but a necessary consideration for robust implementation).
