**General Assessment:**

The previous code execution failed to produce the correct outputs for all training examples, instead returning the original input grids. The results indicate zero transformation occurred. However, the initial analysis and the natural language program correctly identified the transformation rule: shifting the single non-white block two positions to the right. The trace of the intended logic confirms it should produce the expected outputs. This discrepancy suggests an error in the previous code's implementation (perhaps a variable misuse or incorrect return statement) or an issue in the execution environment that ran the code. The core strategy remains valid: identify the block and shift it.

The metrics confirm:
*   All inputs are 1x15 grids.
*   Each input has one contiguous block of non-white pixels.
*   The block's color and length are preserved in the output.
*   The block's starting position consistently shifts right by exactly 2 positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Type: 1D array (represented as a 1xN grid)
Background_Color: white (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Segment
    Description: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except white (azure, yellow, magenta in examples). Persists through transformation.
      - Length: Variable (8, 10, 11 in examples). Persists through transformation.
      - Start_Index: Variable (1, 1, 0 in examples). Defines the leftmost position of the segment.
Relationships:
  - The Segment is embedded within the Background.
Transformation:
  - Type: Horizontal Translation
  - Target: The Segment object.
  - Parameters:
      - Direction: Right
      - Distance: 2 pixels (columns)
  - Effects:
      - The Segment's Start_Index increases by 2.
      - The area occupied by the translated Segment in the output grid takes the Segment's color.
      - Pixels outside the translated Segment's area become Background_Color (white).
  - Constraints:
      - Grid dimensions (height=1, width=N) remain unchanged.
      - Only one Segment object exists per grid.
      - Segment color and length remain unchanged.
      - If the translation pushes part of the Segment beyond the right edge of the grid, that part is truncated (not observed in examples, but a necessary consideration for robust implementation).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to be a single row (1xN).
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the input row. Record its color, starting column index, and length.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the segment by adding 2 to its original starting index.
5.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `length - 1` of the identified segment:
    *   Calculate the target column index in the output row: `target_index = new_starting_index + i`.
    *   Check if `target_index` is within the valid bounds of the output row (i.e., `0 <= target_index < width`).
    *   If it is within bounds, set the pixel at `output_row[target_index]` to the segment's color.
6.  Format the completed output row as a 1xN grid (a list containing the single output row).
7.  Return the output grid.
