Transformation Rule Description:
The transformation takes a 2D input grid, which for this task is expected to have a height of 1 (a single row).
It identifies the first contiguous block (horizontal line segment) of non-white (non-zero) pixels within this row.
This identified block is then shifted exactly 2 positions (columns) to the right.
The pixels in the new positions occupied by the shifted block take the color of the block. 
If the shift causes part of the block to extend beyond the right boundary of the grid, that part is truncated.
All other pixels in the output grid row (positions not occupied by the shifted block) are set to the background color, which is white (0).
The dimensions (height and width) of the grid remain unchanged.
