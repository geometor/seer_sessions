The rest of the grid consists of white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the block of non-white pixels appears to shift its position within the array. Specifically, it moves to the right.\n5.  **Shift Amount:** In all three examples, the starting position of the non-white block is shifted exactly two positions to the right in the output compared to the input.\n6.  **Consistency:** The size of the grid and the color and length of the non-white block remain unchanged. The positions vacated by the shift on the left become white, and any pixels originally to the right of the block remain white or become white if the shifted block now occupies their position.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
