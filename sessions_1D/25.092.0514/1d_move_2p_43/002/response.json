            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous execution failed with a `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.` for all training examples. This indicates that the input data format provided to the `transform` function during testing did not match the expected `list[list[int]]` structure, specifically failing the `all(isinstance(row, list) for row in input_grid)` check. While the visual examples showed single lines of numbers, the standard ARC format represents grids as nested lists. The core transformation logic (identifying a single non-white block and shifting it right by 2 positions) appears consistent across the examples. The strategy is to maintain the assumption that input grids are `list[list[int]]` (even if height is 1) and refine the documentation (YAML, NL Program) to be explicit about this structure and the transformation logic. The code itself seems prepared for this format, suggesting the error might be in the testing environment's data parsing or presentation, but the solution logic should adhere to the standard format.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe execution failed during input validation for all examples, preventing the collection of metrics related to object detection or transformation success.\n\n*   **Example 1:** `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.`\n*   **Example 2:** `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.`\n*   **Example 3:** `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.`\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```"
