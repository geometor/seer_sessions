**General Assessment:**

The previous execution failed with a `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.` for all training examples. This indicates that the input data format provided to the `transform` function during testing did not match the expected `list[list[int]]` structure, specifically failing the `all(isinstance(row, list) for row in input_grid)` check. While the visual examples showed single lines of numbers, the standard ARC format represents grids as nested lists. The core transformation logic (identifying a single non-white block and shifting it right by 2 positions) appears consistent across the examples. The strategy is to maintain the assumption that input grids are `list[list[int]]` (even if height is 1) and refine the documentation (YAML, NL Program) to be explicit about this structure and the transformation logic. The code itself seems prepared for this format, suggesting the error might be in the testing environment's data parsing or presentation, but the solution logic should adhere to the standard format.

**Metrics:**

The execution failed during input validation for all examples, preventing the collection of metrics related to object detection or transformation success.

*   **Example 1:** `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.`
*   **Example 2:** `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.`
*   **Example 3:** `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.`

**YAML Facts:**

```
yaml
Grid_Type: 2D array (list[list[int]])
Grid_Dimensions:
  Input_Height: 1
  Output_Height: 1
  Input_Width: Variable (e.g., 15 in examples)
  Output_Width: Same as Input_Width
Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Extent: Fills the grid except for the Shape object.
  - Type: Shape
    Description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the single row.
    Properties:
      - Color: Variable (azure, yellow, magenta in examples)
      - Length: Variable
      - Position: Defined by start and end column indices within the single row.
Relationships:
  - The Shape object is embedded horizontally within the Background in the single row.
Actions:
  - Action_Type: Horizontal Translation
  - Target: The non-white Shape object.
  - Parameters:
    - Direction: Right
    - Distance: 2 pixels (columns)
  - Effect:
    - The Shape object's starting column index in the output row is the input starting column index + 2.
    - The area occupied by the Shape object in the output row is filled with its color, potentially truncated if shifted beyond the grid boundary.
    - All other positions in the output row are filled with the Background color (white).
Constraints:
  - Grid height and width remain constant.
  - Shape color and length remain constant (though the visible length might be truncated if shifted off-grid).
  - Input grid always has a height of 1.
