Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or grids of height 1).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** Each example uses white (0) as a background color and contains a single contiguous block of another color (azure, yellow, or magenta).
3.  **Object Identification:** The primary object in each input grid is the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels. The rest of the grid consists of white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the block of non-white pixels appears to shift its position within the array. Specifically, it moves to the right.
5.  **Shift Amount:** In all three examples, the starting position of the non-white block is shifted exactly two positions to the right in the output compared to the input.
6.  **Consistency:** The size of the grid and the color and length of the non-white block remain unchanged. The positions vacated by the shift on the left become white, and any pixels originally to the right of the block remain white or become white if the shifted block now occupies their position.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Type: 1D array
Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Extent: Fills the grid except for the Shape object.
  - Type: Shape
    Description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Variable (azure, yellow, magenta in examples)
      - Length: Variable
      - Position: Defined by start and end indices in the 1D array.
Relationships:
  - The Shape object is embedded within the Background.
Actions:
  - Action_Type: Translate Shape Object
  - Target: The non-white Shape object.
  - Direction: Right
  - Magnitude: 2 positions
  - Effect: The Shape object's start index in the output is the input start index + 2. The area occupied by the Shape object in the output is filled with its color. All other positions in the output grid are filled with the Background color (white).
Constraints:
  - Grid dimensions remain constant.
  - Shape color and length remain constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input 1D array. Note its color, its starting index, and its length.
2.  Create a new 1D array of the same length as the input array, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Calculate the new starting index for the non-white block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
4.  Copy the identified non-white block (with its original color and length) into the new array, starting at the calculated new starting index.
5.  The resulting array is the output.

"""
Transformation Rule Description:
The transformation takes a 1-dimensional input grid (represented as a single row).
It identifies the first contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
This block is then shifted exactly 2 positions to the right.
The pixels in the new positions occupied by the shifted block take the color of the block.
All other pixels in the output grid are set to white (0).
The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Input grid must be a list of lists.

## Example 2:
Error: Input grid must be a list of lists.

## Example 3:
Error: Input grid must be a list of lists.
**General Assessment:**

The previous execution failed with a `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.` for all training examples. This indicates that the input data format provided to the `transform` function during testing did not match the expected `list[list[int]]` structure, specifically failing the `all(isinstance(row, list) for row in input_grid)` check. While the visual examples showed single lines of numbers, the standard ARC format represents grids as nested lists. The core transformation logic (identifying a single non-white block and shifting it right by 2 positions) appears consistent across the examples. The strategy is to maintain the assumption that input grids are `list[list[int]]` (even if height is 1) and refine the documentation (YAML, NL Program) to be explicit about this structure and the transformation logic. The code itself seems prepared for this format, suggesting the error might be in the testing environment's data parsing or presentation, but the solution logic should adhere to the standard format.

**Metrics:**

The execution failed during input validation for all examples, preventing the collection of metrics related to object detection or transformation success.

*   **Example 1:** `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.`
*   **Example 2:** `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.`
*   **Example 3:** `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists.`

    Color: white (0)
    Extent: Fills the grid except for the Shape object.
  - Type: Shape
    Description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the single row.
    Properties:
      - Color: Variable (azure, yellow, magenta in examples)
      - Length: Variable
      - Position: Defined by start and end column indices within the single row.
Relationships:
  - The Shape object is embedded horizontally within the Background in the single row.
Actions:
  - Action_Type: Horizontal Translation
  - Target: The non-white Shape object.
  - Parameters:
    - Direction: Right
    - Distance: 2 pixels (columns)
  - Effect:
    - The Shape object's starting column index in the output row is the input starting column index + 2.
    - The area occupied by the Shape object in the output row is filled with its color, potentially truncated if shifted beyond the grid boundary.
    - All other positions in the output row are filled with the Background color (white).
Constraints:
  - Grid height and width remain constant.
  - Shape color and length remain constant (though the visible length might be truncated if shifted off-grid).
  - Input grid always has a height of 1.
