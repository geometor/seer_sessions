task_description: Horizontally shift a contiguous block of non-white pixels within a single row grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: All examples are 1x25 grids.
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: horizontal_line_segment
    properties:
      - color: non-white (varies per example: green (3), gray (5), blue (1))
      - contiguity: The pixels forming the line are adjacent horizontally.
      - uniqueness: There is only one such segment per input grid.
    actions:
      - type: shift
        direction: right
        magnitude: 2 positions
relationships:
  - The non-white line segment is embedded within a background of white pixels.
transformation_rule:
  - Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
  - Translate this segment 2 positions to the right.
  - Ensure the grid dimensions remain the same, padding with the background color (white) as needed.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions.
  - Color of the line segment.
  - Length of the line segment.
  - Background color.
