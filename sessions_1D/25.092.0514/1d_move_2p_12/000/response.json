The rest of the row consists of white pixels (color 0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves shifting the colored line segment horizontally to the right.\n4.  **Shift Magnitude:** In all examples, the colored line segment shifts exactly two positions to the right.\n5.  **Consistency:** The color, length, and integrity of the colored line segment are preserved during the shift. The white pixels effectively fill the space vacated by the line segment on the left and are pushed out on the right, maintaining the overall row length.\n6.  **Background:** The background is uniformly white (color 0).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
