task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively operating on rows
input_features:
  - name: background_pixels
    value: 0
    color: white
  - name: foreground_object
    description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (blue, gray, yellow in examples)
      - length: Varies (3 or 7 in examples)
      - start_index: Varies (0, 1, 3 in examples)
output_features:
  - name: background_pixels
    value: 0
    color: white
  - name: foreground_object
    description: The same block as in the input, but shifted.
    properties:
      - color: Same as input block
      - length: Same as input block
      - start_index: Input start_index + 2
transformation:
  - action: identify_block
    target: foreground_object
    details: Find the start index, end index, and pixel values of the non-white contiguous block.
  - action: calculate_new_position
    input: block_start_index
    operation: add 2
    output: new_start_index
  - action: construct_output
    details: Create a new grid of the same size filled with white pixels, then place the identified block at the calculated new_start_index.
inferred_rule: The single contiguous block of non-white pixels is shifted 2 positions to the right.
