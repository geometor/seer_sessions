The output grid is the same size as the input and also contains the same non-white block, but its position is shifted. Observing the examples:\n\n1.  **Example 1:** The block `1 1 1` (blue) starts at index 3 in the input and index 5 in the output. The shift is +2 positions.\n2.  **Example 2:** The block `5 5 5 5 5 5 5` (gray) starts at index 1 in the input and index 3 in the output. The shift is +2 positions.\n3.  **Example 3:** The block `4 4 4 4 4 4 4` (yellow) starts at index 0 in the input and index 2 in the output. The shift is +2 positions.\n\nIn all cases, the single contiguous block of non-white pixels is shifted exactly 2 positions to the right. The pixels originally occupied by the block become white (0) in the output, and the block overwrites the pixels at its new location.\n\n**Facts:**\n"
