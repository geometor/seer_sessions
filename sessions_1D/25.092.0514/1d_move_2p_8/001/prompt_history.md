**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional grid (represented as a row) containing a single contiguous block of a non-white color surrounded by white pixels (represented by 0). The transformation consistently shifts this colored block exactly two positions to the right within the grid. The size and color of the block remain unchanged. The rest of the grid remains white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row, effectively 1D processing
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: fixed (1x9 in examples)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: non-white (variable, e.g., red (2), azure (8))
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - size: variable length (e.g., 4, 3, 5)
      - count: exactly one per input grid
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The non-white block is surrounded by the white background.
actions:
  - name: identify_object
    input: input_grid
    target: non-white contiguous_block
    output: block_color, block_start_index, block_length
  - name: shift_object
    input: contiguous_block
    parameters:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 positions
    output: shifted_block_position
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    input: grid_dimensions, background_color, shifted_block_position, block_color, block_length
    output: output_grid
transformation_rule:
  - The single contiguous block of non-white color is identified.
  - The block is moved two positions to the right.
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, with the shifted block placed in its new position and the remaining cells filled with the background color (white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find the first occurrence of a non-white pixel. This marks the start of the colored block.
3.  Determine the color and length of this contiguous non-white block.
4.  Calculate the new starting position (index) for the block by adding 2 to its original starting position in the input grid.
5.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new position.
