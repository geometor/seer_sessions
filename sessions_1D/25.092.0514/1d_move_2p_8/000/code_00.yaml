task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row, effectively 1D processing
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: fixed (1x9 in examples)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: non-white (variable, e.g., red (2), azure (8))
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - size: variable length (e.g., 4, 3, 5)
      - count: exactly one per input grid
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The non-white block is surrounded by the white background.
actions:
  - name: identify_object
    input: input_grid
    target: non-white contiguous_block
    output: block_color, block_start_index, block_length
  - name: shift_object
    input: contiguous_block
    parameters:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 positions
    output: shifted_block_position
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    input: grid_dimensions, background_color, shifted_block_position, block_color, block_length
    output: output_grid
transformation_rule:
  - The single contiguous block of non-white color is identified.
  - The block is moved two positions to the right.
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, with the shifted block placed in its new position and the remaining cells filled with the background color (white).
