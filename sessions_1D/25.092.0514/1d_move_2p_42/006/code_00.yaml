task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Formal representation is a 1xN grid
grid_properties:
  size_invariant: True
  width: 27 # Consistent across examples
  height: 1 # Consistent across examples
  input_dtype: list[list[int]] # Outer list represents grid, inner list represents the single row
  output_dtype: list[list[int]] # Same structure as input
objects:
  - type: grid_row
    description: The single effective element of the grid, a sequence of pixels.
    attributes:
      - length: 27
      - content: sequence of integers (0-9)
transformation:
  type: geometric
  operation: circular_shift # Also known as rotation
  target: grid_row # The operation applies to the sequence of pixels within the row
  parameters:
    - axis: horizontal (implicit in 1D row context)
    - direction: right
    - magnitude: 2 # Constant shift value
    - boundary_condition: circular # Elements wrap from end to beginning
relationships:
  - input_output: The output grid consists of a single row which is the input grid's single row after applying the circular shift.
