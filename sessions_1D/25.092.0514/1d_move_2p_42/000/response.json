The four white '0's at the end of the input seem to wrap around to the beginning of the output (two '0's appear before the red block).\n    *   In `train_2`, the block of orange '7's starts at index 14 in the input and index 16 in the output.\n    *   In `train_3`, the block of blue '1's starts at index 2 in the input and index 4 in the output.\n5.  **Consistency:** Across all examples, the colored block (and implicitly all pixels) appears to shift two positions to the right. This shift is circular, meaning pixels shifted off the right end reappear at the left end.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
