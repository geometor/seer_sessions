Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are presented as single rows of numbers, representing 1-dimensional grids or sequences of pixels.
2.  **Grid Size:** In all three examples, the input and output grids have the same length (27 pixels).
3.  **Colors:** The grids contain white pixels (0) and blocks of a single non-white color (red '2', orange '7', blue '1').
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   In `train_1`, the block of red '2's starts at index 0 in the input and index 2 in the output. The four white '0's at the end of the input seem to wrap around to the beginning of the output (two '0's appear before the red block).
    *   In `train_2`, the block of orange '7's starts at index 14 in the input and index 16 in the output.
    *   In `train_3`, the block of blue '1's starts at index 2 in the input and index 4 in the output.
5.  **Consistency:** Across all examples, the colored block (and implicitly all pixels) appears to shift two positions to the right. This shift is circular, meaning pixels shifted off the right end reappear at the left end.

**Facts**

    description: The entire input grid treated as a linear sequence.
  - type: pixel_block
    description: Contiguous sequences of pixels of the same color (e.g., the block of red, orange, or blue pixels).
transformation:

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Take the input grid, which is a single row of pixels.
2.  Perform a circular shift (rotation) of all pixels in the row two positions to the right.
3.  The resulting shifted row is the output grid.
```python
"""
Takes a 1D input grid (represented as a single row in a 2D list) and performs a circular shift (rotation) of all pixels in the row two positions to the right.
"""

import numpy as np

def circular_shift_right(arr, k):
    """
    Performs a circular right shift on a 1D list or array.

    Args:
        arr: The list or array to shift.

    Returns:
        A new list representing the circularly shifted array.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    k = k % n  # Ensure k is within the bounds of the array length
    if k == 0:

    # Slice the array: take the last k elements and prepend them to the first n-k elements
    shifted_arr = arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]
    return shifted_arr

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Applies a circular right shift of 2 positions to the input grid row.
