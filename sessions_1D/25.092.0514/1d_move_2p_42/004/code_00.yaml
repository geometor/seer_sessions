task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input/output are single rows.
grid_properties:
  size_invariant: True # Input and output have the same dimensions.
  width: 27 # Confirmed for all training examples.
  height: 1 # All examples are single rows.
input_format: list[list[int]] # Standard ARC format, expected [[row_pixels]].
output_format: list[list[int]] # Standard ARC format, expected [[row_pixels]].
objects:
  - type: grid_row
    description: The single row of pixels constituting the entire grid.
transformation:
  type: geometric
  operation: circular_shift
  axis: horizontal # Shifting along the row.
  direction: right
  magnitude: 2 # Shift by 2 positions.
  target: grid_row # The entire row is shifted.
  wrap_around: True # Pixels shifted off the right end appear on the left.
relationships:
  - input_output: The output grid's single row is the input grid's single row circularly shifted 2 positions to the right.
