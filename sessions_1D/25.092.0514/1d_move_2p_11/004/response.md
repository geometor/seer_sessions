**General Assessment:**

The previous code execution failed with a `ValueError` related to boolean ambiguity of arrays, occurring across all training examples. This type of error typically arises when a multi-element array (like a NumPy array) is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`). Given that the provided Python code explicitly uses standard Python lists (`List[List[int]]`) and performs element-wise integer comparisons, the error is unlikely to originate within the core logic of the `transform` function itself, *unless* the input `input_grid` was unexpectedly passed as a NumPy array by the testing environment, or the comparison logic *between* the generated output and the expected output in the test harness uses NumPy arrays inappropriately.

The core perception—identifying a single contiguous block of non-white color in a 1D row and shifting it right by two positions—appears consistent across all examples. The strategy is to maintain this core logic but ensure the implementation details (handled in the coder phase) are robust against potential type mismatches or unexpected array behavior introduced by the execution environment. The natural language program and factual description remain largely valid based on visual inspection of the examples.

**Metrics:**

Manual analysis of the examples confirms the pattern:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 1x24
    *   Block Color: 8 (azure)
    *   Block Position (Input): cols 6-9 (Length 4)
    *   Block Position (Output): cols 8-11 (Shift +2)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 1x24
    *   Block Color: 3 (green)
    *   Block Position (Input): cols 2-18 (Length 17)
    *   Block Position (Output): cols 4-20 (Shift +2)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 1x24
    *   Block Color: 7 (orange)
    *   Block Position (Input): cols 12-14 (Length 3)
    *   Block Position (Output): cols 14-16 (Shift +2)

All examples are 1x24 grids. Each contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color. The transformation is consistently a shift of this block 2 positions to the right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input and output are single rows (represented as List[List[int]])
grid_size: Constant (1x24 in all training examples) # Observation from examples, might not be a general rule
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    properties:
      color: non-white (any single color other than 0)
      shape: horizontal_line_segment
      size: variable (length varies)
      position: variable (horizontal position varies)
      continuity: single contiguous block confirmed in all examples
actions:
  - action_type: horizontal_shift
    target: the single contiguous_block
    properties:
      direction: right
      distance: 2 pixels (columns)
      boundary_handling: 
        - vacated_pixels: filled with background_color (white, 0)
        - shifted_out_pixels: truncated (pixels shifted beyond the right edge are lost)
relationships:
  - The non-white block is always surrounded by the background color (white), except possibly at the grid edges after shifting.
constraints:
  - Input grid always contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white color.
  - Input grid is always 1 row high.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept a 1-row input grid.
2.  Initialize an output row of the same width as the input row, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Scan the input row to locate the single contiguous block of non-white pixels. Record its starting column index, ending column index, and color.
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting column index.
5.  Iterate from the original starting column index to the original ending column index of the block found in step 3.
6.  For each pixel within the original block, calculate its corresponding target column index in the output row (original column index + 2).
7.  If the calculated target column index is within the bounds of the output row's width, place the recorded block color at that target index in the output row. Ignore pixels whose target index falls outside the grid boundaries (truncation).
8.  Return the completed output row, formatted as a 1-row grid.
