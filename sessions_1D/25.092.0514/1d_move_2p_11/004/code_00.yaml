task_type: grid_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input and output are single rows (represented as List[List[int]])
grid_size: Constant (1x24 in all training examples) # Observation from examples, might not be a general rule
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    properties:
      color: non-white (any single color other than 0)
      shape: horizontal_line_segment
      size: variable (length varies)
      position: variable (horizontal position varies)
      continuity: single contiguous block confirmed in all examples
actions:
  - action_type: horizontal_shift
    target: the single contiguous_block
    properties:
      direction: right
      distance: 2 pixels (columns)
      boundary_handling: 
        - vacated_pixels: filled with background_color (white, 0)
        - shifted_out_pixels: truncated (pixels shifted beyond the right edge are lost)
relationships:
  - The non-white block is always surrounded by the background color (white), except possibly at the grid edges after shifting.
constraints:
  - Input grid always contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white color.
  - Input grid is always 1 row high.
