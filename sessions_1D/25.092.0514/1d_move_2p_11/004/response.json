            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code execution failed with a `ValueError` related to boolean ambiguity of arrays, occurring across all training examples. This type of error typically arises when a multi-element array (like a NumPy array) is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`). Given that the provided Python code explicitly uses standard Python lists (`List[List[int]]`) and performs element-wise integer comparisons, the error is unlikely to originate within the core logic of the `transform` function itself, *unless* the input `input_grid` was unexpectedly passed as a NumPy array by the testing environment, or the comparison logic *between* the generated output and the expected output in the test harness uses NumPy arrays inappropriately.\n\nThe core perception\u2014identifying a single contiguous block of non-white color in a 1D row and shifting it right by two positions\u2014appears consistent across all examples. The strategy is to maintain this core logic but ensure the implementation details (handled in the coder phase) are robust against potential type mismatches or unexpected array behavior introduced by the execution environment. The natural language program and factual description remain largely valid based on visual inspection of the examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nManual analysis of the examples confirms the pattern:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 1x24\n    *   Block Color: 8 (azure)\n    *   Block Position (Input): cols 6-9 (Length 4)\n    *   Block Position (Output): cols 8-11 (Shift +2)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 1x24\n    *   Block Color: 3 (green)\n    *   Block Position (Input): cols 2-18 (Length 17)\n    *   Block Position (Output): cols 4-20 (Shift +2)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 1x24\n    *   Block Color: 7 (orange)\n    *   Block Position (Input): cols 12-14 (Length 3)\n    *   Block Position (Output): cols 14-16 (Shift +2)\n\nAll examples are 1x24 grids. Each contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color. The transformation is consistently a shift of this block 2 positions to the right.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
