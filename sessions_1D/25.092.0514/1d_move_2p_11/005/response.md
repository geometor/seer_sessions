Transforms a 1-row input grid by identifying the single contiguous block of 
non-white pixels and shifting this block exactly two positions to the right. 
The background remains white (0). Pixels vacated by the block's movement 
become white. Pixels shifted beyond the right grid boundary are truncated.
