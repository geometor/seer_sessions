"""
Transforms a 1-row input grid by identifying the single contiguous block of 
non-white pixels (color 0) and shifting this block exactly two positions to the right. 
The background remains white. Pixels vacated by the block's movement become white. 
Pixels shifted beyond the right grid boundary are truncated. The input might be 
a list of lists or a NumPy array, and the output should match the expected format 
(likely NumPy array based on potential environment).
