```

**Perception:**

The input and output are both single-row grids (1-dimensional arrays). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (azure, green, orange in the examples) surrounded by white pixels. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that the non-white colored block has been shifted exactly two positions to the right. The size and color of the block remain unchanged. The pixels shifted "off" the right end by the block's movement are replaced by white pixels at the beginning of the row, and the pixels vacated by the block's leftward movement are also filled with white pixels.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input and output are single rows
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (any color except 0)
      count: exactly one per grid
      shape: horizontal line segment
      size: variable
      position: variable
actions:
  - action_type: horizontal_shift
    target: contiguous_block
    properties:
      direction: right
      distance: 2 pixels
      boundary_handling: wrap-around is not observed; shifted pixels are replaced by background color (white). The space left behind is also filled with the background color.
relationships:
  - The non-white block is always surrounded by the background color (white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Determine the starting and ending column indices of this block.
3.  Create a new output row of the same size as the input row, initially filled with the background color (white).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index by adding 2 to the original starting column index.
5.  Copy the identified non-white block into the output row starting at the new calculated index. Ensure the copied block fits within the grid boundaries.

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a single contiguous block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a single-row grid. The generated Python code reflects this logic. However, the execution resulted in errors ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") across all training examples. This error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (like a standard `if` statement), suggesting the testing environment might be passing NumPy arrays to the `transform` function, even though the type hint specifies `List[List[int]]`. The input validation (`if not input_grid`) or potentially comparisons within the loop might be causing this when encountering a NumPy array.

The strategy to resolve this involves:
1.  Confirming the structure and properties of the input/output grids using code execution.
2.  Adjusting the Python code, particularly the input handling and any boolean checks, to correctly process NumPy arrays if that's the confirmed or likely input type provided by the execution environment. The core logic of finding the block and shifting it seems correct based on the visual examples.

**Metrics:**

Let's analyze the structure and block properties for each training example.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
input_type_inference: Likely NumPy array based on error message.
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (azure=8, green=3, orange=7 in examples)
      count: exactly one per grid
      shape: horizontal line segment
      size: variable (length 4, 17, 3 in examples)
      position: variable (starts at col 6, 2, 12 in examples)
actions:
  - action_type: horizontal_shift
    target: contiguous_block
    properties:
      direction: right
      distance: 2 pixels
      boundary_handling:
        - vacated_pixels: filled with background color (white)
        - overflow_pixels: truncated (pixels shifted beyond the right edge are discarded)
relationships:
  - The non-white block is always surrounded by the background color (white).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, potentially as a NumPy array with shape (1, N).
2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Determine its color, starting column index, and length. Assume white (0) is the background color.
3.  Create a new output row of the same width as the input row, initially filled entirely with the background color (white).
4.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the output row by adding 2 to the original starting column index.
5.  Iterate from the target starting column index for the length of the original block. For each position within this range:
    *   Check if the calculated column index is within the bounds of the output row's width.
    *   If it is within bounds, set the pixel at that index in the output row to the color of the identified block.
    *   If it is out of bounds (i.e., greater than or equal to the width), do nothing (truncating the part of the block that shifts off the grid).
6.  Format the resulting output row as a grid structure (e.g., a list containing the single row, or a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N)).
