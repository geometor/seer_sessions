"""
Identifies a single contiguous block of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid (a single row) 
and shifts this block exactly two positions to the right in the output grid. 
The background remains white (0). Pixels vacated by the block's movement become white. 
Pixels shifted beyond the right boundary are truncated.
