            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a single contiguous block of non-white pixels two positions to the right within a single-row grid. The generated Python code reflects this logic. However, the execution resulted in errors (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") across all training examples. This error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (like a standard `if` statement), suggesting the testing environment might be passing NumPy arrays to the `transform` function, even though the type hint specifies `List[List[int]]`. The input validation (`if not input_grid`) or potentially comparisons within the loop might be causing this when encountering a NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this involves:\n1.  Confirming the structure and properties of the input/output grids using code execution.\n2.  Adjusting the Python code, particularly the input handling and any boolean checks, to correctly process NumPy arrays if that's the confirmed or likely input type provided by the execution environment. The core logic of finding the block and shifting it seems correct based on the visual examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and block properties for each training example.\n\n"
