task_type: grid_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
input_type_inference: Likely NumPy array based on error message.
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (azure=8, green=3, orange=7 in examples)
      count: exactly one per grid
      shape: horizontal line segment
      size: variable (length 4, 17, 3 in examples)
      position: variable (starts at col 6, 2, 12 in examples)
actions:
  - action_type: horizontal_shift
    target: contiguous_block
    properties:
      direction: right
      distance: 2 pixels
      boundary_handling:
        - vacated_pixels: filled with background color (white)
        - overflow_pixels: truncated (pixels shifted beyond the right edge are discarded)
relationships:
  - The non-white block is always surrounded by the background color (white).
