task_type: grid_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples show a single row grid.
grid_size:
  width: 24 # Consistent across examples
  height: 1 # Consistent across examples
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (azure: 8, green: 3, orange: 7 observed)
      count: exactly one per grid
      shape: horizontal line segment
      size: variable length (4, 17, 3 observed)
      position: variable start column (6, 2, 12 observed)
      integrity: The block's color and length are preserved in the output.
actions:
  - action_type: horizontal_translation # More specific term than shift
    target: contiguous_block
    properties:
      direction: right
      distance: 2 pixels # Consistently observed (8-6=2, 4-2=2, 14-12=2)
      boundary_handling:
        - Pixels vacated by the block become the background color (white).
        - If the shifted block extends beyond the right boundary, the exceeding part is truncated (not explicitly shown but implied by fixed grid size and rightward shift).
relationships:
  - The non-white block is always surrounded by the background color (white) in the input.
  - The output maintains the same grid size and background color.
