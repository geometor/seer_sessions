"""
This transformation identifies a single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color 
within a single-row input grid. It then creates an output grid of the same dimensions, 
initially filled with white (0). Finally, it places the color of the original segment 
at the start and end indices of where the segment was located in the input, leaving 
all other cells white.
