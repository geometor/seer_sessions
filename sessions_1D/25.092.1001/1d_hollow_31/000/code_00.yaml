task_type: Grid Transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_composition:
  - background: white (0) pixels
  - object:
      type: contiguous horizontal segment
      count: 1
      color: non-white (magenta, green, yellow in examples)
      properties:
        - start_index
        - end_index
        - color_value
output_composition:
  - background: white (0) pixels
  - objects:
      type: individual pixels
      count: 2 (unless the segment length is 1)
      color: same as the input segment color
      location:
        - at the start_index of the input segment
        - at the end_index of the input segment
transformation:
  - Identify the single contiguous non-white segment in the input row.
  - Determine its color, start index, and end index.
  - Create an output row of the same size, initialized to white (0).
  - Place the segment's color at the start index in the output row.
  - Place the segment's color at the end index in the output row.
  - All other pixels in the output row remain white (0).
relationships:
  - The output grid size is identical to the input grid size.
  - The color of the output pixels is determined by the color of the input segment.
  - The positions of the output pixels correspond to the start and end positions of the input segment.
