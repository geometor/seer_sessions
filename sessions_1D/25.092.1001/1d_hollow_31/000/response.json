The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. The transformation rule seems to isolate the endpoints of the colored segment. Specifically, it keeps the first and the last pixel of the colored segment and changes all the pixels *between* these endpoints to white (color 0). The pixels outside the original colored segment remain white. The color of the endpoints in the output matches the color of the segment in the input.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
