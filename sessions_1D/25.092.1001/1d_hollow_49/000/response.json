Record its index as `start_index` and its color. If no non-white pixel is found, the task is complete, and the output is identical to the input.\n3.  Scan the input grid from right to left (or continue scanning from `start_index`) to find the last non-white pixel belonging to the same contiguous block identified in step 2. Record its index as `end_index`.\n4.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.\n5.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to white (0).\n6.  Ensure the pixels at `start_index` and `end_index` in the output grid retain their original color from the input. (This is implicitly handled by initializing the output as a copy and only modifying the interior, but stating it adds clarity).\n7.  Return the modified output grid."
