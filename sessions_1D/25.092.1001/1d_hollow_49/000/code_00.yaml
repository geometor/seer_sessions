task_description: Modifying a contiguous horizontal block of color within a 1D grid.
elements:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (represented by integers 0-9)
      - position (index in the 1D array)
  - type: object
    definition: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color (uniform within the object)
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - length

    input_object:
      color: gray (5)
      start_index: 1

      - color: gray (5)
        index: 1
      - color: gray (5)
        index: 4
      - color: white (0)
        index: 2
      - color: white (0)
        index: 3
  - example: train_2

      - color: orange (7)
        index: 4
      - color: white (0)
        index: 1
      - color: white (0)
        index: 2
      - color: white (0)
        index: 3
relationships_and_actions:
  - action: find_object
    description: Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine its color, start index, and end index.
  - action: preserve_endpoints
    description: In the output grid, keep the pixels at the start index and end index of the identified block with their original color.
  - action: replace_interior
    description: Change the color of all pixels located *between* the start index and end index of the identified block to white (0).
  - action: preserve_background
    description: All pixels in the input grid that were not part of the identified block (i.e., were originally white) remain white in the output grid.
constraints:
  - Assumes only one contiguous non-white block exists in the input.
  - Assumes the block has a length of at least 1. If the length is 1, the start and end index are the same, and only that single pixel is preserved.
