Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

*   The input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers representing colors.
*   Each input contains a single contiguous horizontal segment (block) of a non-white color (gray, green, orange in the examples) surrounded by white (0).
*   The length and position of this colored block vary across examples.
*   In the output, only the first and the last pixel of the original colored block retain their color and position.
*   All the pixels that were originally *between* the first and last pixels of the block are changed to white (0) in the output.
*   The white pixels outside the original block remain unchanged.
*   The specific color of the block does not influence the transformation logic, only its extent (start and end positions).

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: find_object
    description: Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine its color, start index, and end index.
  - action: preserve_endpoints
    description: In the output grid, keep the pixels at the start index and end index of the identified block with their original color.
  - action: replace_interior
    description: Change the color of all pixels located *between* the start index and end index of the identified block to white (0).
  - action: preserve_background
    description: All pixels in the input grid that were not part of the identified block (i.e., were originally white) remain white in the output grid.
constraints:
  - Assumes only one contiguous non-white block exists in the input.
  - Assumes the block has a length of at least 1. If the length is 1, the start and end index are the same, and only that single pixel is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the first non-white pixel. Record its index as `start_index` and its color. If no non-white pixel is found, the task is complete, and the output is identical to the input.
3.  Scan the input grid from right to left (or continue scanning from `start_index`) to find the last non-white pixel belonging to the same contiguous block identified in step 2. Record its index as `end_index`.
4.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
5.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to white (0).
6.  Ensure the pixels at `start_index` and `end_index` in the output grid retain their original color from the input. (This is implicitly handled by initializing the output as a copy and only modifying the interior, but stating it adds clarity).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
