Each input row contains a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels, flanked by white pixels (0). The specific non-white color varies between examples (blue, orange, gray). The output grid retains the dimensions of the input grid. The transformation preserves the first and last pixel of the non-white segment and changes all the pixels *between* the first and last pixel of that segment to white (0). The white pixels outside the original segment remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
