task_description: Identify horizontal segments of non-white pixels and keep only the endpoints of each segment, turning the interior pixels white.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: All examples are 1D (1xN grids). Assume the rule applies row-wise for 2D grids.
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: horizontal_segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more non-white pixels in a single row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment (e.g., blue, orange, gray).
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - start_index: The column index of the first pixel in the segment.
      - end_index: The column index of the last pixel in the segment.
actions:
  - action: hollow_segment
    input: a horizontal_segment
    condition: segment length must be greater than 2.
    output: Modifies the grid in place or creates a new grid.
    steps:
      - Identify the start_index and end_index of the segment.
      - Change the color of all pixels from index `start_index + 1` to `end_index - 1` (inclusive) in that row to white (0).
      - Pixels at `start_index` and `end_index` remain unchanged.
      - Pixels outside the segment (before `start_index` and after `end_index`) remain unchanged.
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - The transformation operates independently on each horizontal segment found. (Though examples only show one segment per grid).
  - If a segment has length 1 or 2, it remains unchanged as there are no 'interior' pixels.
