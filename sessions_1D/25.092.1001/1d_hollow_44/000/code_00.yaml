task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D rows within a 2D grid representation
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: Contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color of the pixels in the segment (e.g., red, yellow, orange).
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - start_index: The column index of the first pixel in the segment.
      - end_index: The column index of the last pixel in the segment.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Segments are separated by one or more white (0) pixels.
actions:
  - name: hollow_segment
    input: non-white segment
    condition: segment length must be 3 or greater.
    output: modified segment
    process:
      - Identify the first pixel (at start_index) and the last pixel (at end_index) of the segment.
      - Keep the color of the first and last pixels unchanged.
      - Change the color of all pixels between the start_index and end_index to white (0).
transformation_scope: Applies independently to each row and each identified segment within that row.
background_pixels: White (0) pixels remain unchanged unless they are part of the interior of a segment being hollowed.
