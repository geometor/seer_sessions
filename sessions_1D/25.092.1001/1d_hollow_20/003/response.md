"""
Transforms a single-row NumPy grid by modifying the first contiguous block of non-white pixels found.
If such a block exists and its length is greater than 2, the interior pixels 
(all pixels between the first and last pixel of the block) are changed to white (0), 
while the first and last pixels retain their original color. 
Blocks of length 1 or 2, and grids with no non-white pixels, remain unchanged.
The input is expected to be a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, width).
