"""
Transforms a single-row grid by modifying a contiguous block of non-white pixels.
If a block of non-white pixels exists and its length is greater than 2,
the first and last pixels of the block retain their original color, while
all pixels between them are changed to white (0). Blocks of length 1 or 2,
and grids with no non-white pixels, remain unchanged.
