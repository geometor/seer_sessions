task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)

input_features:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: variable
  - type: object
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (varies)
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - location: variable start and end indices
      - length: variable (>= 1, observed >= 4 in examples)
    count: 1

output_features:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: matches input background locations + modified block interior
  - type: object
    description: Potentially modified version of the input block.
    properties:
      - color: same as input block's color
      - shape: two points (endpoints of the original block), or the original block if length <= 2
      - location: first and last index of the original block
    count: 1 (represented as two separate pixels if length > 2)

transformation:
  - action: identify_object
    target: the contiguous non-white block
  - action: get_properties
    target: the identified block
    properties: [start_index, end_index, length, color]
  - action: conditional_modification
    condition: block length > 2
    steps:
      - preserve pixel at start_index with original color
      - preserve pixel at end_index with original color
      - change pixels from (start_index + 1) to (end_index - 1) to white (0)
  - action: conditional_no_change
    condition: block length <= 2
    steps:
      - leave the block as is

relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - The locations of white pixels outside the block remain unchanged.
  - The output object's color is derived from the input object's color.
  - The output object's final state depends on the input object's length.
