The color of this block varies across examples (orange, green, gray).\n3.  **Transformation**: The transformation focuses solely on the non-white block. The white background pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Output Structure**: The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids.\n5.  **Output Content**: In the output, the non-white block from the input is modified. Only the first and the last pixel of the original block retain their color. All the pixels *between* the first and last pixel of the original block are changed to white (0).\n6.  **Edge Cases (Implied)**: Although not shown, if the block length is 1 or 2, the transformation likely leaves the block unchanged as there are no 'in-between' pixels to turn white. If the input contains no non-white block, the output should be identical to the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
