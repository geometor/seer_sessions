Okay, analyzing the provided examples, here's my understanding of the task:

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure**: The inputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
2.  **Content**: Each input grid primarily consists of white pixels (value 0), except for a single contiguous horizontal segment (or block) of a non-white color (value > 0). The color of this block varies across examples (orange, green, gray).
3.  **Transformation**: The transformation focuses solely on the non-white block. The white background pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Output Structure**: The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids.
5.  **Output Content**: In the output, the non-white block from the input is modified. Only the first and the last pixel of the original block retain their color. All the pixels *between* the first and last pixel of the original block are changed to white (0).
6.  **Edge Cases (Implied)**: Although not shown, if the block length is 1 or 2, the transformation likely leaves the block unchanged as there are no 'in-between' pixels to turn white. If the input contains no non-white block, the output should be identical to the input.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)

input_features:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: variable
  - type: object
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (varies)
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - location: variable start and end indices
      - length: variable (>= 1, observed >= 4 in examples)
    count: 1

output_features:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: matches input background locations + modified block interior
  - type: object
    description: Potentially modified version of the input block.
    properties:
      - color: same as input block's color
      - shape: two points (endpoints of the original block), or the original block if length <= 2
      - location: first and last index of the original block
    count: 1 (represented as two separate pixels if length > 2)

transformation:
  - action: identify_object
    target: the contiguous non-white block
  - action: get_properties
    target: the identified block
    properties: [start_index, end_index, length, color]
  - action: conditional_modification
    condition: block length > 2
    steps:
      - preserve pixel at start_index with original color
      - preserve pixel at end_index with original color
      - change pixels from (start_index + 1) to (end_index - 1) to white (0)
  - action: conditional_no_change
    condition: block length <= 2
    steps:
      - leave the block as is

relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - The locations of white pixels outside the block remain unchanged.
  - The output object's color is derived from the input object's color.
  - The output object's final state depends on the input object's length.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find the start index and end index of the contiguous block of non-white pixels. Record the color of this block.
3.  If no non-white block is found, return the copied grid as is.
4.  Calculate the length of the block (end\_index - start\_index + 1).
5.  If the length of the block is greater than 2:
    a.  Iterate from the position `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
    b.  Set the pixel value at each position in this range in the output grid to white (0).
6.  If the length of the block is 1 or 2, make no changes to the copied grid in the block's region.
7.  Return the modified output grid.

"""
Transforms a single-row grid by modifying a contiguous block of non-white pixels.
If a block of non-white pixels exists and its length is greater than 2,
the first and last pixels of the block retain their original color, while
all pixels between them are changed to white (0). Blocks of length 1 or 2,
and grids with no non-white pixels, remain unchanged.
