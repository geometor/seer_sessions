task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row), represented as 2D NumPy array with shape (1, width)
grid_size:
  width: variable (observed 21)
  height: 1

input_features:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: variable, complements the object block
  - type: object
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color.
    source: input grid
    properties:
      - color: non-white (observed orange(7), green(3), gray(5))
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - location: defined by start_index and end_index
      - length: end_index - start_index + 1 (observed 9, 6, 4)
    count: 1

output_features:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: original white background locations + interior of modified block
  - type: object
    description: Modified version of the input block, reduced to its endpoints if length > 2.
    source: derived from input object
    properties:
      - color: same as input block's color
      - shape: two points (if original length > 2), or original line segment (if length <= 2)
      - location: original start_index and end_index
    count: 1 (represented as two pixels or the original block)

transformation_steps:
  - action: identify_object_properties
    target: input grid row
    outputs: [start_index, end_index, color, length] of the first contiguous non-white block. Returns None if no block exists.
  - action: copy_grid
    source: input grid
    destination: output grid
  - action: conditional_modification
    condition: block was found AND block length > 2
    target: output grid
    steps:
      - iterate indices from (start_index + 1) to (end_index - 1)
      - set pixel value at each index to white (0)
  - action: no_modification
    condition: no block found OR block length <= 2
    target: output grid (remains identical to input grid in the block region)

relationships:
  - Output grid shape is identical to input grid shape.
  - The transformation preserves the color and the start/end positions of the original block.
  - The transformation specifically targets the *interior* pixels of the block.
  - Only the first contiguous non-white block is considered if multiple exist (inferred, based on simplicity and examples).
