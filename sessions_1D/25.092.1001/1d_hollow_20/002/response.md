## General Assessment

The core transformation logic identified previously seems correct based on the input-output pairs: identify a contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color, and if its length is greater than 2, hollow it out, leaving only the endpoints. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests that the input grids are being passed as NumPy arrays, and the initial check `if not input_grid` in the previous `transform` function is causing the failure, as NumPy doesn't allow direct boolean evaluation of multi-element arrays.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input data type and structure using `tool_code`.
2.  Adapt the code to handle NumPy array inputs correctly, particularly dimension checks and element access.
3.  Verify the block identification logic and metrics (start, end, length) for each example.
4.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on confirmed details and NumPy handling.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row), represented as 2D NumPy array with shape (1, width)
grid_size:
  width: variable (observed 21)
  height: 1

input_features:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: variable, complements the object block
  - type: object
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color.
    source: input grid
    properties:
      - color: non-white (observed orange(7), green(3), gray(5))
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - location: defined by start_index and end_index
      - length: end_index - start_index + 1 (observed 9, 6, 4)
    count: 1

output_features:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: original white background locations + interior of modified block
  - type: object
    description: Modified version of the input block, reduced to its endpoints if length > 2.
    source: derived from input object
    properties:
      - color: same as input block's color
      - shape: two points (if original length > 2), or original line segment (if length <= 2)
      - location: original start_index and end_index
    count: 1 (represented as two pixels or the original block)

transformation_steps:
  - action: identify_object_properties
    target: input grid row
    outputs: [start_index, end_index, color, length] of the first contiguous non-white block. Returns None if no block exists.
  - action: copy_grid
    source: input grid
    destination: output grid
  - action: conditional_modification
    condition: block was found AND block length > 2
    target: output grid
    steps:
      - iterate indices from (start_index + 1) to (end_index - 1)
      - set pixel value at each index to white (0)
  - action: no_modification
    condition: no block found OR block length <= 2
    target: output grid (remains identical to input grid in the block region)

relationships:
  - Output grid shape is identical to input grid shape.
  - The transformation preserves the color and the start/end positions of the original block.
  - The transformation specifically targets the *interior* pixels of the block.
  - Only the first contiguous non-white block is considered if multiple exist (inferred, based on simplicity and examples).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to be a NumPy array with shape (1, width).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
3.  Examine the single row of the input grid to find the start index (`start_idx`), end index (`end_idx`), and color (`block_color`) of the first contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
4.  If no such sequence (block) is found, return the copied grid without changes.
5.  Calculate the length of the block: `length = end_idx - start_idx + 1`.
6.  If the `length` is greater than 2:
    a.  Iterate through the indices `i` from `start_idx + 1` up to, but not including, `end_idx`.
    b.  For each index `i`, set the pixel value in the *output* grid at row 0, column `i` to white (0).
7.  If the `length` is 1 or 2, make no modifications to the copied grid.
8.  Return the final output grid.
