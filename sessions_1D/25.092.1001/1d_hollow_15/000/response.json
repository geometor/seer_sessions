All pixels *between* the start and end points of the segment are changed to white (0).\n    *   The white pixels outside the original segment remain white.\n    *   The specific non-white color used (orange or red) is preserved at the endpoints but does not affect the logic of *which* pixels change.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
