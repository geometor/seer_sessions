Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (1 row, 9 columns).
2.  **Colors**: The colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).
3.  **Input Pattern**: The inputs contain a contiguous block of a single non-white color, surrounded by white pixels.
    *   Example 1: Block of 5 blue pixels.
    *   Example 2: Block of 5 gray pixels.
    *   Example 3: Block of 4 gray pixels.
4.  **Output Pattern**: In the outputs, the contiguous block of non-white color has been modified. Only the first and last pixels of the original block retain their color. All the pixels *between* the first and last pixel of the block have been changed to white (0). Pixels outside the original block remain unchanged.
5.  **Transformation Logic**: The core transformation identifies contiguous horizontal segments of the same non-white color. If such a segment has a length of 3 or more, its interior pixels are turned white (0), while its endpoints retain their original color. Segments shorter than 3 (hypothesized) and white pixels are likely unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Modify contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  size: 1x9 in all examples
colors:
  background: white (0)
  active: blue (1), gray (5) # Any non-zero color
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    definition: A sequence of adjacent pixels in a row with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - start_index: Column index of the first pixel.
      - end_index: Column index of the last pixel.
transformation:
  action: hollow_segment
  target: contiguous_horizontal_segment
  condition: length >= 3
  effect:
    - Retain the color of the pixel at start_index.
    - Retain the color of the pixel at end_index.
    - Change the color of pixels from start_index + 1 to end_index - 1 to white (0).
  notes:
    - Segments with length < 3 are unchanged.
    - White (0) pixels are unchanged unless they are part of the interior of a segment being hollowed.
    - The process applies independently to each identified segment.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid row by row (in this case, there is only one row).
3.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of the *same* non-white color (value > 0). For each segment, note its color, start column index, and end column index.
4.  For each identified segment:
    a. Calculate the length of the segment (`length = end_index - start_index + 1`).
    b. If the length is 3 or greater:
        i. Iterate through the column indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
        ii. Set the color of the pixel at the current row and each of these intermediate column indices in the *output* grid to white (0).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
