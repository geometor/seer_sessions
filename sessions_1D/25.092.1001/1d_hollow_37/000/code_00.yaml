task_description: Modify contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  size: 1x9 in all examples
colors:
  background: white (0)
  active: blue (1), gray (5) # Any non-zero color
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    definition: A sequence of adjacent pixels in a row with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - start_index: Column index of the first pixel.
      - end_index: Column index of the last pixel.
transformation:
  action: hollow_segment
  target: contiguous_horizontal_segment
  condition: length >= 3
  effect:
    - Retain the color of the pixel at start_index.
    - Retain the color of the pixel at end_index.
    - Change the color of pixels from start_index + 1 to end_index - 1 to white (0).
  notes:
    - Segments with length < 3 are unchanged.
    - White (0) pixels are unchanged unless they are part of the interior of a segment being hollowed.
    - The process applies independently to each identified segment.
