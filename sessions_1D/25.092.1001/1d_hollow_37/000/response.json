Only the first and last pixels of the original block retain their color. All the pixels *between* the first and last pixel of the block have been changed to white (0). Pixels outside the original block remain unchanged.\n5.  **Transformation Logic**: The core transformation identifies contiguous horizontal segments of the same non-white color. If such a segment has a length of 3 or more, its interior pixels are turned white (0), while its endpoints retain their original color. Segments shorter than 3 (hypothesized) and white pixels are likely unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
