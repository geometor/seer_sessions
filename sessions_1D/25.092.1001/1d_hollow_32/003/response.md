```python
"""
Identifies a contiguous horizontal segment of a non-background color (0) in a single-row input grid (represented as a 1D numpy array). 
If the segment length is greater than 1, it preserves the color of the first and last pixels of the segment 
and changes all pixels between them to the background color (0). Pixels outside the segment remain unchanged. 
If the segment length is 1 or no segment exists, the input row is returned unchanged.
