They consist of pixels represented by integers 0-9.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and gray (5). White seems to be the background color.\n3.  **Structure:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color, surrounded by the white background color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is the modification of this non-white segment. In the output, only the first and last pixels of the original segment retain their color. All the pixels *between* the first and last pixels of the segment are changed to the background color (white, 0).\n5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three examples, regardless of the specific non-white color (azure or gray) or the length of the segment (as long as the length is greater than 1). The position of the segment within the row also changes, but the rule remains the same.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
