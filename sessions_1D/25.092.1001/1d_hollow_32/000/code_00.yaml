observations:
  - task_type: object_transformation # Modifying existing objects
  - grid_dimensions: single_row # Examples are 1xN grids
  - background_color: 0 # White
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous_segment
        color: non-zero # Can be azure (8) or gray (5) in examples
        properties:
          - horizontal
          - surrounded_by_background
          - variable_length (must be > 1 for transformation to occur)
          - variable_position
  - actions:
      - identify: the contiguous segment of non-background color in the input row.
      - locate: the start and end indices of this segment.
      - modify:
          if segment_length > 1:
            preserve: the pixel color at the start index.
            preserve: the pixel color at the end index.
            change: all pixels between the start and end indices to the background color (0).
          else: # Segment length is 1 or 0
            preserve: the original row content. # No change
      - output: the modified row.
  - relationships:
      - The output row has the same dimensions as the input row.
      - The transformation depends only on the location and extent of the non-background segment within the row.
      - Pixels outside the identified segment remain unchanged.
