observations:
  - task_type: object_modification # Modifying existing objects
  - grid_dimensions: single_row # Examples are 1xN grids (interpreted as 1D arrays)
  - background_color: 0 # White
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous_segment
        color: non-zero # Can be azure (8) or gray (5) in examples
        properties:
          - horizontal
          - potentially_surrounded_by_background
          - variable_length
          - variable_position
  - actions:
      - identify: the background color (0).
      - locate: all pixels in the input row that do not match the background color.
      - if: non-background pixels exist:
          - determine: the minimum column index (`start_col`) and maximum column index (`end_col`) of these non-background pixels. This defines the segment.
          - create: a copy of the input row for the output.
          - if: the segment length (`end_col - start_col + 1`) is greater than 1:
              - modify: the output row by setting the pixel value to the background color (0) for all column indices `c` such that `start_col < c < end_col`.
              - keep: the pixels at `start_col` and `end_col` unchanged from the input.
          - else: # Segment length is 1 or 0 (no non-background pixels)
              - keep: the output row identical to the input row.
      - else: # No non-background pixels found
          - keep: the output row identical to the input row.
  - relationships:
      - The output row has the same dimensions as the input row.
      - The transformation depends only on the location and extent of the non-background segment within the row.
      - Pixels outside the identified segment (before `start_col` and after `end_col`) remain unchanged.
      - Pixels at the exact start (`start_col`) and end (`end_col`) of the segment remain unchanged.
