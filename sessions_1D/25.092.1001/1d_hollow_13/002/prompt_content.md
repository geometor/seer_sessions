import copy

"""
Transforms the input 1D grid by identifying the first contiguous block of non-white pixels. 
It keeps the first and last pixel of this block and changes all pixels strictly between them to white (0). 
Pixels outside the original block remain unchanged.
"""

    Finds the start and end indices of the first contiguous block of non-white pixels.
