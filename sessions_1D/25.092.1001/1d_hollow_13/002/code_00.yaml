task_context:
  grid_type: 1D NumPy array (represented as a 1xN 2D NumPy array)
  colors_present:
    input: white (0), orange (7), azure (8)
    output: white (0), orange (7), azure (8)
  input_structure: Confirmed as 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, N).
objects:
  - object_id: main_block
    description: The single contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels within the input row.
    properties:
      color: The non-white color value (e.g., 7 for orange, 8 for azure).
      start_index: The column index of the first pixel of the block.
      end_index: The column index of the last pixel of the block.
      length: The number of pixels in the block (end_index - start_index + 1). Found lengths: 7, 17.
  - object_id: background
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: Pixels in the row outside the indices [start_index, end_index].
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The main_block exists within the single row of the input grid, potentially bounded by background pixels or the grid edges.
actions_on_objects:
  - action: find_block_boundaries
    target: input grid row
    result: Determine the `start_index` and `end_index` of the `main_block` by finding the first and last non-white pixels.
  - action: preserve_endpoints
    target: main_block
    effect: Ensure the pixels in the output grid at `(0, start_index)` and `(0, end_index)` retain the original `color` of the `main_block`.
  - action: hollow_interior
    target: main_block
    condition: Only if `length` > 2 (i.e., `end_index > start_index + 1`).
    effect: Set the pixels in the output grid row at indices from `start_index + 1` to `end_index - 1` (inclusive) to white (0).
  - action: preserve_background
    target: background
    effect: Ensure pixels in the output grid row at indices less than `start_index` or greater than `end_index` retain their original white (0) color.
transformation_goal: Modify the input 1xN NumPy array by identifying the contiguous non-white block, keeping its first and last pixels, replacing the interior pixels (if any) with white (0), and leaving all other white pixels unchanged.
