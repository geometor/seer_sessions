The input sequences contain a single contiguous block of a non-white color (orange or azure in the examples) surrounded by white pixels. The transformation focuses specifically on this non-white block. The core action is to \"hollow out\" this block, keeping only its start and end pixels and replacing the interior pixels with white. The pixels outside the original block remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
