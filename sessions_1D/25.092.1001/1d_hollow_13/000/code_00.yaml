task_context:
  grid_type: 1D array (represented as 1xN grid)
  colors_present:
    input: white (0), orange (7), azure (8)
    output: white (0), orange (7), azure (8) # Same set of colors
objects:
  - object_id: main_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels within the input array.
    properties:
      color: The specific non-white color (e.g., orange, azure).
      length: The number of pixels in the block.
      start_index: The index of the first pixel of the block.
      end_index: The index of the last pixel of the block.
  - object_id: background
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: Surrounding the main_block or potentially the entire array.
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: The main_block is contained within the background pixels (or forms the boundary at the start/end of the array).
actions_on_objects:
  - action: identify_boundaries
    target: main_block
    result: Determine the start_index and end_index of the main_block.
  - action: preserve_endpoints
    target: main_block
    effect: The pixels at start_index and end_index in the output retain the original color and position of the main_block's endpoints.
  - action: replace_interior
    target: main_block
    effect: All pixels strictly between start_index and end_index are changed to white (0) in the output.
  - action: preserve_background
    target: background
    effect: All background pixels outside the original span of the main_block (i.e., indices < start_index or > end_index) retain their white color and position in the output.
transformation_goal: To modify the input array by keeping only the first and last pixels of the contiguous non-white block and replacing the pixels between them with white, while leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged.
