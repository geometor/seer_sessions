Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on 1-dimensional sequences (or grids of height 1). The input sequences contain a single contiguous block of a non-white color (orange or azure in the examples) surrounded by white pixels. The transformation focuses specifically on this non-white block. The core action is to "hollow out" this block, keeping only its start and end pixels and replacing the interior pixels with white. The pixels outside the original block remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_type: 1D array (represented as 1xN grid)
  colors_present:
    input: white (0), orange (7), azure (8)
    output: white (0), orange (7), azure (8) # Same set of colors
objects:
  - object_id: main_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels within the input array.
    properties:
      color: The specific non-white color (e.g., orange, azure).
      length: The number of pixels in the block.
      start_index: The index of the first pixel of the block.
      end_index: The index of the last pixel of the block.
  - object_id: background
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: Surrounding the main_block or potentially the entire array.
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: The main_block is contained within the background pixels (or forms the boundary at the start/end of the array).
actions_on_objects:
  - action: identify_boundaries
    target: main_block
    result: Determine the start_index and end_index of the main_block.
  - action: preserve_endpoints
    target: main_block
    effect: The pixels at start_index and end_index in the output retain the original color and position of the main_block's endpoints.
  - action: replace_interior
    target: main_block
    effect: All pixels strictly between start_index and end_index are changed to white (0) in the output.
  - action: preserve_background
    target: background
    effect: All background pixels outside the original span of the main_block (i.e., indices < start_index or > end_index) retain their white color and position in the output.
transformation_goal: To modify the input array by keeping only the first and last pixels of the contiguous non-white block and replacing the pixels between them with white, while leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array.
2.  Find the index of the first non-white pixel in the input array (`start_index`).
3.  Find the index of the last non-white pixel in the input array (`end_index`).
4.  If no non-white pixels are found (`start_index` or `end_index` is invalid), return the original input array.
5.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index + 1` up to, but not including, `end_index`.
6.  For each index in this range, set the value in the output array to white (0).
7.  Return the modified output array.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The core logic identified previously â€“ finding a contiguous block of non-white pixels and replacing its interior with white pixels while keeping the endpoints â€“ appears correct based on visually inspecting the input/output pairs. The Python code implemented this logic for lists.

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" indicates that the input data provided to the `transform` function during testing was likely a NumPy array, not a standard Python list of lists as assumed in the initial code implementation. Standard Python list checks like `if not my_list:` work differently than NumPy array checks.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Data Type:** Verify that the inputs are indeed NumPy arrays using `tool_code`.
2.  **Adapt Code Logic:** Modify the checks and potentially the iteration logic to be compatible with NumPy arrays. Specifically, checks for emptiness or existence need to use `.size`, `.any()`, or `.all()`. Accessing elements might remain similar (`array[0]`), but helper functions might need adjustments.
3.  **Recalculate Metrics:** Use `tool_code` to gather metrics based on the assumption of NumPy arrays.
4.  **Refine YAML and Natural Language Program:** Update the documentation to reflect the NumPy data structure and any refined understanding of the transformation. The core transformation rule itself likely remains the same, but the description of *how* it's applied to the data structure needs adjustment.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid (a 1xN NumPy array).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
4.  Find all column indices in the row where the pixel value is not white (0).
5.  If no non-white pixels are found, return the copied input grid as is.
6.  Otherwise, determine the `start_index` (the minimum non-white index) and `end_index` (the maximum non-white index).
7.  Iterate through the column indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
8.  For each index `i` in this range, set the value in the output grid's row at `(0, i)` to white (0).
9.  Return the modified output grid.
