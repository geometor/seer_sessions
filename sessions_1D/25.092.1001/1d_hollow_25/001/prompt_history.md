**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input grid (a single row) into an output grid of the same dimensions. The core operation seems to be modifying contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. Specifically, the middle pixel(s) within these segments are changed to white (0), while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.

*   In Example 1, a segment of three orange pixels (`7 7 7`) has its middle pixel changed to white (`7 0 7`).
*   In Example 2, a segment of three magenta pixels (`6 6 6`) has its middle pixel changed to white (`6 0 6`).
*   In Example 3, a segment of four orange pixels (`7 7 7 7`) has its two middle pixels changed to white (`7 0 0 7`).

This suggests a rule based on the length of the non-white segment:
*   If the segment length is odd and greater than 1, the single central pixel is turned white.
*   If the segment length is even and greater than 1, the two central pixels are turned white.
*   Segments of length 1 and background (white) pixels are unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (Row)
  Properties:
    - Height: Always 1
    - Width: Variable (e.g., 8 in examples)
    - Background_Color: White (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Horizontal Segment
    Definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more non-white pixels in the row.
    Properties:
      - Color: The color of the pixels in the segment (e.g., Orange (7), Magenta (6)).
      - Length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - Position: Start and end indices within the row.
Relationships:
  - Segments are separated by white (0) pixels or grid boundaries.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all horizontal segments of non-white pixels.
  - Modify:
    - Target: Segments with Length > 1.
    - Operation: Replace the middle pixel(s) of the target segment with White (0).
      - If Length is odd: Replace the single middle pixel.
      - If Length is even: Replace the two middle pixels.
  - Preserve:
    - Pixels outside identified segments (background).
    - The first and last pixels of modified segments (unless the segment length is 2, in which case both middle pixels are changed, effectively removing the segment).
    - Segments with Length = 1.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid row (as there is only one row).
3.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. For each segment:
    a.  Record its start index, end index, and length.
    b.  If the length of the segment is greater than 1:
        i.  Calculate the middle index or indices.
            - If the length is odd, the middle index is `start_index + floor(length / 2)`.
            - If the length is even, the middle indices are `start_index + (length / 2) - 1` and `start_index + (length / 2)`.
        ii. Change the pixel(s) at the calculated middle index(es) in the output grid row to white (0).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
