```python
"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (represented as a list containing a single list)
by finding contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels (value > 0).
For segments longer than one pixel, the middle pixel(s) are changed to
white (0). If the segment length is odd, the single central pixel is changed.
If the segment length is even, the two central pixels are changed.
Segments of length 1 and background pixels remain unchanged.
