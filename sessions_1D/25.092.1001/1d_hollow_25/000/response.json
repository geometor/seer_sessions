The core operation seems to be modifying contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. Specifically, the middle pixel(s) within these segments are changed to white (0), while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n*   In Example 1, a segment of three orange pixels (`7 7 7`) has its middle pixel changed to white (`7 0 7`).\n*   In Example 2, a segment of three magenta pixels (`6 6 6`) has its middle pixel changed to white (`6 0 6`).\n*   In Example 3, a segment of four orange pixels (`7 7 7 7`) has its two middle pixels changed to white (`7 0 0 7`).\n\nThis suggests a rule based on the length of the non-white segment:\n*   If the segment length is odd and greater than 1, the single central pixel is turned white.\n*   If the segment length is even and greater than 1, the two central pixels are turned white.\n*   Segments of length 1 and background (white) pixels are unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
