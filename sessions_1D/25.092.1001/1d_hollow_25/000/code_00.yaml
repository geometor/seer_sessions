Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (Row)
  Properties:
    - Height: Always 1
    - Width: Variable (e.g., 8 in examples)
    - Background_Color: White (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Horizontal Segment
    Definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more non-white pixels in the row.
    Properties:
      - Color: The color of the pixels in the segment (e.g., Orange (7), Magenta (6)).
      - Length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - Position: Start and end indices within the row.
Relationships:
  - Segments are separated by white (0) pixels or grid boundaries.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all horizontal segments of non-white pixels.
  - Modify:
    - Target: Segments with Length > 1.
    - Operation: Replace the middle pixel(s) of the target segment with White (0).
      - If Length is odd: Replace the single middle pixel.
      - If Length is even: Replace the two middle pixels.
  - Preserve:
    - Pixels outside identified segments (background).
    - The first and last pixels of modified segments (unless the segment length is 2, in which case both middle pixels are changed, effectively removing the segment).
    - Segments with Length = 1.
