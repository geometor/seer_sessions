Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Properties:
    - Height: Always 1 (based on examples)
    - Width: Variable
    - Background_Color: White (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Horizontal Segment
    Definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels in the row with the same non-white color.
    Properties:
      - Color: The specific non-white color of the pixels (e.g., Orange (7), Magenta (6)).
      - Length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - Position: Start and end column indices within the row.
Relationships:
  - Segments are bounded by white (0) pixels or the grid edges.
  - Multiple segments can exist in a single row, separated by white pixels.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all horizontal segments of non-white pixels within the single row.
  - Filter: Select segments whose Length is greater than 1.
  - Modify (for selected segments):
    - Operation: Replace the middle pixel(s) of the segment with White (0).
    - Rule (Odd Length): Replace the single pixel at `start_index + floor(Length / 2)`.
    - Rule (Even Length): Replace the two pixels at `start_index + (Length / 2) - 1` and `start_index + (Length / 2)`.
  - Preserve:
    - All white (0) pixels.
    - Pixels belonging to segments with Length = 1.
    - The non-middle pixels of modified segments.
