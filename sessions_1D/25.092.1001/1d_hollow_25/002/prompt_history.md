**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input grid (a single row) into an output grid of the same dimensions. The core operation seems to be modifying contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. Specifically, the middle pixel(s) within these segments are changed to white (0), while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.

*   In Example 1, a segment of three orange pixels (`7 7 7`) has its middle pixel changed to white (`7 0 7`).
*   In Example 2, a segment of three magenta pixels (`6 6 6`) has its middle pixel changed to white (`6 0 6`).
*   In Example 3, a segment of four orange pixels (`7 7 7 7`) has its two middle pixels changed to white (`7 0 0 7`).

This suggests a rule based on the length of the non-white segment:
*   If the segment length is odd and greater than 1, the single central pixel is turned white.
*   If the segment length is even and greater than 1, the two central pixels are turned white.
*   Segments of length 1 and background (white) pixels are unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (Row)
  Properties:
    - Height: Always 1
    - Width: Variable (e.g., 8 in examples)
    - Background_Color: White (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Horizontal Segment
    Definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more non-white pixels in the row.
    Properties:
      - Color: The color of the pixels in the segment (e.g., Orange (7), Magenta (6)).
      - Length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - Position: Start and end indices within the row.
Relationships:
  - Segments are separated by white (0) pixels or grid boundaries.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all horizontal segments of non-white pixels.
  - Modify:
    - Target: Segments with Length > 1.
    - Operation: Replace the middle pixel(s) of the target segment with White (0).
      - If Length is odd: Replace the single middle pixel.
      - If Length is even: Replace the two middle pixels.
  - Preserve:
    - Pixels outside identified segments (background).
    - The first and last pixels of modified segments (unless the segment length is 2, in which case both middle pixels are changed, effectively removing the segment).
    - Segments with Length = 1.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid row (as there is only one row).
3.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. For each segment:
    a.  Record its start index, end index, and length.
    b.  If the length of the segment is greater than 1:
        i.  Calculate the middle index or indices.
            - If the length is odd, the middle index is `start_index + floor(length / 2)`.
            - If the length is even, the middle indices are `start_index + (length / 2) - 1` and `start_index + (length / 2)`.
        ii. Change the pixel(s) at the calculated middle index(es) in the output grid row to white (0).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by finding contiguous horizontal segments of
non-white pixels (value > 0). For segments longer than one pixel,
the middle pixel(s) are changed to white (0). If the segment length
is odd, the single central pixel is changed. If the segment length is
even, the two central pixels are changed. Segments of length 1 and
background pixels remain unchanged.
