Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure**: Each input is a single row (or a 1D array) of pixels.
2.  **Key Feature**: The central feature in each input row is a contiguous horizontal segment (or block) of a single non-white color (red, magenta, blue). This block is flanked by white pixels (0) on both sides.
3.  **Output Structure**: The output is also a single row of the same length as the input.
4.  **Transformation**: The transformation seems to isolate the *endpoints* of the colored block found in the input.
5.  **Color Preservation**: The color of the pixels kept in the output is the same as the color of the original block in the input.
6.  **Interior Modification**: All the pixels *between* the start and end points of the original colored block are changed to white (0) in the output. The pixels outside the original block (which were already white) remain white.
7.  **Dimensionality**: The task operates solely within a 1D context, preserving the row length.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  input_composition: Contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color surrounded by white pixels.
  output_composition: Contains exactly two pixels of the non-white color from the input, surrounded by white pixels. Or, if the input block was length 1 or 2, it's identical to the input.
objects:
  - type: color_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels with the same non-white color in the input row.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., red, magenta, blue).
      - start_index: The column index of the first pixel in the block.
      - end_index: The column index of the last pixel in the block.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    description: Find the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row.
    inputs:
      - input_row
    outputs:
      - color_block object (with color, start_index, end_index)
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create the output row based on the identified block.
    inputs:
      - input_row_length
      - color_block object
    process:
      - Initialize an output row of the same length as the input, filled with white pixels (0).
      - If a color_block was found:
        - Place the block's color at the start_index in the output row.
        - Place the block's color at the end_index in the output row.
    outputs:
      - output_row
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_row
    to: output_row
    rule: The output row retains only the first and the last pixel of the contiguous non-white block found in the input row, preserving their original positions and color. All other pixels, including those originally inside the block, become white.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find the first non-white pixel. Record its row index, column index (start\_index), and color.
3.  Continue iterating from that point to find the last non-white pixel that belongs to the same contiguous block (same color). Record its column index (end\_index). *Correction*: Since it's a 1D grid, just find the first and last non-white pixels overall.
4.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white color in the input row. Note its color, the starting column index, and the ending column index.
5.  In the output grid (which is initially all white), set the pixel at the starting column index to the identified color.
6.  In the output grid, set the pixel at the ending column index to the identified color.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
