This block is flanked by white pixels (0) on both sides.\n3.  **Output Structure**: The output is also a single row of the same length as the input.\n4.  **Transformation**: The transformation seems to isolate the *endpoints* of the colored block found in the input.\n5.  **Color Preservation**: The color of the pixels kept in the output is the same as the color of the original block in the input.\n6.  **Interior Modification**: All the pixels *between* the start and end points of the original colored block are changed to white (0) in the output. The pixels outside the original block (which were already white) remain white.\n7.  **Dimensionality**: The task operates solely within a 1D context, preserving the row length.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the single contiguous block of non-white color in the input row. Note its color, the starting column index, and the ending column index.\n5.
