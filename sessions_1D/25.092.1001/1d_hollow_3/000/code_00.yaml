task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  input_composition: Contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color surrounded by white pixels.
  output_composition: Contains exactly two pixels of the non-white color from the input, surrounded by white pixels. Or, if the input block was length 1 or 2, it's identical to the input.
objects:
  - type: color_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels with the same non-white color in the input row.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., red, magenta, blue).
      - start_index: The column index of the first pixel in the block.
      - end_index: The column index of the last pixel in the block.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    description: Find the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row.
    inputs:
      - input_row
    outputs:
      - color_block object (with color, start_index, end_index)
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create the output row based on the identified block.
    inputs:
      - input_row_length
      - color_block object
    process:
      - Initialize an output row of the same length as the input, filled with white pixels (0).
      - If a color_block was found:
        - Place the block's color at the start_index in the output row.
        - Place the block's color at the end_index in the output row.
    outputs:
      - output_row
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_row
    to: output_row
    rule: The output row retains only the first and the last pixel of the contiguous non-white block found in the input row, preserving their original positions and color. All other pixels, including those originally inside the block, become white.
