task_type: object modification
grid_dimensions: 1 row, variable columns (observed: 18 columns)
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., red, yellow, green).
      - start_index: The column index of the leftmost pixel of the segment.
      - end_index: The column index of the rightmost pixel of the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1).
  - type: background
    description: Pixels with the white color (0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    description: Find the start and end indices of the non-white segment.
  - name: modify_segment
    description: >
      Keep the pixels at the start_index and end_index of the segment.
      Change all pixels between the start_index and end_index to the background color (white, 0).
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - The positions of the background pixels outside the original segment remain unchanged.
  - The color and position of the start_index pixel in the output match the start_index pixel of the input segment.
  - The color and position of the end_index pixel in the output match the end_index pixel of the input segment.
  - If the segment length is 1 or 2, the segment remains unchanged in the output. (Inferred, not explicitly shown in examples, but consistent with the rule).
