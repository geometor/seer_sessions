Each input contains a contiguous horizontal block (segment) of a single non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input. The transformation involves modifying the colored segment: only the leftmost and rightmost pixels of the original segment retain their color, while all pixels *between* these two endpoints are changed to white (color 0). The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged. The specific color of the segment varies between examples (red, yellow, green) but the transformation logic is consistent.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
