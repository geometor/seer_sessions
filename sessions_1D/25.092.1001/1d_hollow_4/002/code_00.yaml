objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white color (value > 0) in the single row.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color value.
      - start_index: The column index of the leftmost pixel of the segment.
      - end_index: The column index of the rightmost pixel of the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1).
  - type: background
    description: Pixels with the white color (value 0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    description: Find the column indices of all non-white pixels. If any exist, determine the start_index as the minimum index and the segment color from that position. Find the end_index by checking consecutive pixels from the start_index until the color changes or the row ends.
  - name: modify_segment
    description: >
      Create a copy of the input grid.
      If a segment is found and its length is greater than 2 (i.e., end_index > start_index + 1):
      Set the pixels in the copied grid's row from column `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index` to the background color (white, 0).
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same shape and data type as the input grid.
  - The positions of the background pixels (value 0) outside the original segment remain unchanged.
  - The color and position of the pixel at `start_index` in the output match the input.
  - The color and position of the pixel at `end_index` in the output match the input.
  - Pixels between `start_index` and `end_index` are changed to 0.
  - If the segment length is 1 or 2, or if no segment exists, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
