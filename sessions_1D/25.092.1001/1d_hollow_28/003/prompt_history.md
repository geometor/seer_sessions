Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

Each example consists of a 1-dimensional input grid (a single row) and a corresponding 1-dimensional output grid of the same size. The grids contain white pixels (0) and a single contiguous block of non-white pixels of a specific color (gray, green, magenta). The transformation modifies this non-white block.

*   **Input 1:** A block of 3 gray pixels `[5, 5, 5]` is present.
*   **Output 1:** The middle gray pixel is changed to white, resulting in `[5, 0, 5]`. The first and last gray pixels are retained.

*   **Input 2:** A block of 4 green pixels `[3, 3, 3, 3]` is present.
*   **Output 2:** The two middle green pixels are changed to white, resulting in `[3, 0, 0, 3]`. The first and last green pixels are retained.

*   **Input 3:** A block of 5 magenta pixels `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` is present.
*   **Output 3:** The three middle magenta pixels are changed to white, resulting in `[6, 0, 0, 0, 6]`. The first and last magenta pixels are retained.

The core pattern appears to be: identify the single horizontal block of non-white pixels, keep its start and end pixels, and replace all pixels strictly between the start and end with white pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Modifies a single horizontal block of non-white pixels in a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable: gray, green, magenta in examples)
    properties:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - length
relationships:
  - The block is surrounded by white pixels or grid boundaries.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the start and end indices of the non-white block.
  - modify: Change the color of pixels within the block.
transformation_rule:
  - Preserve the pixel at the start_index of the block.
  - Preserve the pixel at the end_index of the block.
  - If the block length is greater than 2, change all pixels strictly between the start_index and end_index to white (0).
  - Pixels outside the block (original white pixels) remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the first (leftmost) non-white pixel. Record its index (`start_index`) and color.
3.  Scan the input grid from right to left to find the last (rightmost) non-white pixel. Record its index (`end_index`).
4.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
5.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
6.  Return the modified output grid.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because it encountered ambiguity when evaluating the truthiness of a NumPy array, likely passed by the testing environment instead of a simple Python list. The core logic of identifying the start and end of the non-white block and filling the interior with white (0) seems correct based on the visual inspection of the examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the code to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs, converting them to lists or using NumPy functions for processing.
2.  Verify the assumptions about the input structure (1D array or potentially 2D array with one row) using code execution.
3.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts based on confirmed input characteristics.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a 2D NumPy array with exactly one row.
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
4.  Find the column indices of all pixels in the row that are not white (value is not 0).
5.  If any non-white pixels were found:
    a.  Determine the minimum index (`start_index`) among the non-white pixel indices.
    b.  Determine the maximum index (`end_index`) among the non-white pixel indices.
    c.  Iterate through the column indices starting from `start_index + 1` up to, but not including, `end_index`.
    d.  For each index in this iteration, set the value of the pixel at that column index in the output grid's first row to white (0).
6.  Return the modified output grid (which maintains the original 2D array structure).
