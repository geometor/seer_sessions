            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nEach example consists of a 1-dimensional input grid (a single row) and a corresponding 1-dimensional output grid of the same size. The grids contain white pixels (0) and a single contiguous block of non-white pixels of a specific color (gray, green, magenta). The transformation modifies this non-white block.\n\n*   **Input 1:** A block of 3 gray pixels `[5, 5, 5]` is present.\n*   **Output 1:** The middle gray pixel is changed to white, resulting in `[5, 0, 5]`. The first and last gray pixels are retained.\n\n*   **Input 2:** A block of 4 green pixels `[3, 3, 3, 3]` is present.\n*   **Output 2:** The two middle green pixels are changed to white, resulting in `[3, 0, 0, 3]`. The first and last green pixels are retained.\n\n*   **Input 3:** A block of 5 magenta pixels `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` is present.\n*   **Output 3:** The three middle magenta pixels are changed to white, resulting in `[6, 0, 0, 0, 6]`. The first and last magenta pixels are retained.\n\nThe core pattern appears to be: identify the single horizontal block of non-white pixels, keep its start and end pixels, and replace all pixels strictly between the start and end with white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
