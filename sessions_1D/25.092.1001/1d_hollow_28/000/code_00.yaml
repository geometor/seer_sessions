task_description: Modifies a single horizontal block of non-white pixels in a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable: gray, green, magenta in examples)
    properties:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - length
relationships:
  - The block is surrounded by white pixels or grid boundaries.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the start and end indices of the non-white block.
  - modify: Change the color of pixels within the block.
transformation_rule:
  - Preserve the pixel at the start_index of the block.
  - Preserve the pixel at the end_index of the block.
  - If the block length is greater than 2, change all pixels strictly between the start_index and end_index to white (0).
  - Pixels outside the block (original white pixels) remain unchanged.
