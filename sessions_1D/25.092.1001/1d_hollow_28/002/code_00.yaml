task_description: Modifies a single horizontal block of non-white pixels within a single-row grid.
grid_properties:
  - type: 2D NumPy array
  - shape: (1, width) where width varies
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1 per grid (in the first row)
    color: non-white (variable: gray, green, magenta in examples)
    location: Resides within the single row of the grid.
    properties:
      - start_column_index
      - end_column_index
      - length
relationships:
  - The block is surrounded horizontally by white pixels or grid boundaries.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the start and end column indices of the non-white block in the first row.
  - modify: Change the color of pixels within the block.
transformation_rule:
  - The input is a 2D NumPy array with a single row.
  - Create a copy of the input array for the output.
  - Find all non-white pixels in the row.
  - Determine the minimum (start_index) and maximum (end_index) column index among these non-white pixels.
  - If the block length (end_index - start_index + 1) is greater than 1:
      - Iterate through the column indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
      - For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid's first row to white (0).
  - Pixels outside this range (the start and end pixels of the block, and the original white pixels) remain unchanged.
  - Return the modified 2D NumPy array.
