Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

Each example consists of a 1-dimensional input grid (a single row) and a corresponding 1-dimensional output grid of the same size. The grids contain white pixels (0) and a single contiguous block of non-white pixels of a specific color (gray, green, magenta). The transformation modifies this non-white block.

*   **Input 1:** A block of 3 gray pixels `[5, 5, 5]` is present.
*   **Output 1:** The middle gray pixel is changed to white, resulting in `[5, 0, 5]`. The first and last gray pixels are retained.

*   **Input 2:** A block of 4 green pixels `[3, 3, 3, 3]` is present.
*   **Output 2:** The two middle green pixels are changed to white, resulting in `[3, 0, 0, 3]`. The first and last green pixels are retained.

*   **Input 3:** A block of 5 magenta pixels `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` is present.
*   **Output 3:** The three middle magenta pixels are changed to white, resulting in `[6, 0, 0, 0, 6]`. The first and last magenta pixels are retained.

The core pattern appears to be: identify the single horizontal block of non-white pixels, keep its start and end pixels, and replace all pixels strictly between the start and end with white pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Modifies a single horizontal block of non-white pixels in a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable: gray, green, magenta in examples)
    properties:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - length
relationships:
  - The block is surrounded by white pixels or grid boundaries.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the start and end indices of the non-white block.
  - modify: Change the color of pixels within the block.
transformation_rule:
  - Preserve the pixel at the start_index of the block.
  - Preserve the pixel at the end_index of the block.
  - If the block length is greater than 2, change all pixels strictly between the start_index and end_index to white (0).
  - Pixels outside the block (original white pixels) remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the first (leftmost) non-white pixel. Record its index (`start_index`) and color.
3.  Scan the input grid from right to left to find the last (rightmost) non-white pixel. Record its index (`end_index`).
4.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
5.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
