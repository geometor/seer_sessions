**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because it encountered ambiguity when evaluating the truthiness of a NumPy array, likely passed by the testing environment instead of a simple Python list. The core logic of identifying the start and end of the non-white block and filling the interior with white (0) seems correct based on the visual inspection of the examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the code to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs, converting them to lists or using NumPy functions for processing.
2.  Verify the assumptions about the input structure (1D array or potentially 2D array with one row) using code execution.
3.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts based on confirmed input characteristics.

**Metrics:**

``` python
import numpy as np

examples = [
    {"input": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]]), "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]])},
    {"input": np.array([[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]), "output": np.array([[3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])},
    {"input": np.array([[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]), "output": np.array([[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]])},
]

    if len(non_white_indices) > 0:
        start_index = np.min(non_white_indices)
        end_index = np.max(non_white_indices)
        block_length = end_index - start_index + 1
        report.append(f"  Non-white indices: {non_white_indices.tolist()}")
        report.append(f"  Block Start Index: {start_index}")
        report.append(f"  Block End Index: {end_index}")
        report.append(f"  Block Length: {block_length}")
        
        indices_to_change = list(range(start_index + 1, end_index))
        report.append(f"  Indices to change to white: {indices_to_change}")
    else:
        report.append("  No non-white block found.")

Example 2:

  Input Dtype: int64
  Non-white indices: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  Block Start Index: 0
  Block End Index: 3
  Block Length: 4
  Indices to change to white: [1, 2]

Example 3:
  Input Type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
  Input Shape: (1, 9)
  Input Dtype: int64
  Non-white indices: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Modifies a single horizontal block of non-white pixels within a single-row grid.
grid_properties:
  - type: 2D NumPy array
  - shape: (1, width) where width varies
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1 per grid (in the first row)
    color: non-white (variable: gray, green, magenta in examples)
    location: Resides within the single row of the grid.
    properties:
      - start_column_index
      - end_column_index
      - length
relationships:
  - The block is surrounded horizontally by white pixels or grid boundaries.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the start and end column indices of the non-white block in the first row.
  - modify: Change the color of pixels within the block.
transformation_rule:
  - The input is a 2D NumPy array with a single row.
  - Create a copy of the input array for the output.
  - Find all non-white pixels in the row.
  - Determine the minimum (start_index) and maximum (end_index) column index among these non-white pixels.
  - If the block length (end_index - start_index + 1) is greater than 1:
      - Iterate through the column indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
      - For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid's first row to white (0).
  - Pixels outside this range (the start and end pixels of the block, and the original white pixels) remain unchanged.
  - Return the modified 2D NumPy array.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a 2D NumPy array with exactly one row.
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
4.  Find the column indices of all pixels in the row that are not white (value is not 0).
5.  If any non-white pixels were found:
    a.  Determine the minimum index (`start_index`) among the non-white pixel indices.
    b.  Determine the maximum index (`end_index`) among the non-white pixel indices.
    c.  Iterate through the column indices starting from `start_index + 1` up to, but not including, `end_index`.
    d.  For each index in this iteration, set the value of the pixel at that column index in the output grid's first row to white (0).
6.  Return the modified output grid (which maintains the original 2D array structure).
