task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # Input/output are effectively 1-dimensional arrays (single row grids)
input_format: array_like (likely NumPy array) containing a single row of integers (pixels)
output_format: list containing a single list of integers (pixels)
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A single contiguous horizontal sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    attributes:
      color: non-white (variable: 1-blue, 2-red, 7-orange in examples)
      contiguity: horizontal
      location: surrounded by white (0) pixels
      count_per_input: 1
    identification: Find all non-white pixels. The first index is the start, the last index is the end.
actions:
  - name: initialize_output
    input: input_grid_dimensions
    output: output_grid (same dimensions as input, filled with white pixels)
  - name: identify_segment_endpoints
    input: input_grid
    output: segment_properties (color, start_index, end_index)
    steps:
      - Find indices of all non-white pixels.
      - If non-white pixels exist:
          - start_index = minimum index
          - end_index = maximum index
          - segment_color = color at start_index
      - Else: segment does not exist.
  - name: transfer_endpoints
    target: output_grid
    using: segment_properties (color, start_index, end_index)
    effect:
      - If a segment was identified:
          - Set pixel at start_index in output_grid to segment_color.
          - Set pixel at end_index in output_grid to segment_color.
relationships_transformation:
  - segment_interior_pixels (input) -> white_pixels (output)
  - segment_endpoint_pixels (input) -> endpoint_pixels (output, color preserved)
  - surrounding_white_pixels (input) -> surrounding_white_pixels (output, unchanged)
invariance:
  - grid_dimensions (height=1, width preserved)
  - color_of_segment_endpoints
  - position_of_segment_endpoints
  - surrounding_white_pixels
variance:
  - color_of_non_white_segment
  - length_of_non_white_segment
  - position_of_non_white_segment
error_cause: Likely improper handling of NumPy array input type in conditional statements or type checks.
resolution_strategy: Modify code to explicitly handle NumPy arrays, potentially using NumPy functions for finding indices and array creation. Ensure output format matches ARC standard (list of lists).
