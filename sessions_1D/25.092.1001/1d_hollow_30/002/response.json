            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: isolating the endpoints of a single horizontal segment of non-white color within a 1D grid. The provided Python code attempted to implement this logic. However, it failed on all training examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the `transform` function received the input grid as a NumPy array rather than the assumed list of lists, and the type checks (`isinstance`) or conditional logic (`if not input_grid`) failed when applied to a NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, likely by converting the input to a NumPy array explicitly at the beginning or by using NumPy-native operations for indexing and manipulation. The core logic of finding the segment endpoints and placing their color in an otherwise white output grid remains valid.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nAll three training examples consist of a single row (1xN grid).\n*   **Example 1:** Input: 1x29 grid, contains a blue (1) segment from index 9 to 25. Output: 1x29 grid, blue (1) at indices 9 and 25, white (0) elsewhere.\n*   **Example 2:** Input: 1x28 grid, contains a red (2) segment from index 12 to 24. Output: 1x28 grid, red (2) at indices 12 and 24, white (0) elsewhere.\n*   **Example 3:** Input: 1x29 grid, contains an orange (7) segment from index 1 to 22. Output: 1x29 grid, orange (7) at indices 1 and 22, white (0) elsewhere.\n\nThe error occurred identically in all cases, indicating the problem is fundamental to how the code handles the input data structure, not specific to the data values within the examples. The failure point is likely the initial type checking or boolean evaluation of the input grid when treated as a NumPy array.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
