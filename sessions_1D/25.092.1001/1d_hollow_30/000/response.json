Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels. The transformation isolates the endpoints of this non-white segment. The color of the segment is preserved at these endpoints, while the interior pixels of the segment are changed to white. Pixels outside the original segment remain unchanged (white).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
