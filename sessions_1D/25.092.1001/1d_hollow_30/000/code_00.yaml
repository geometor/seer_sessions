task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # Grids are effectively 1-dimensional arrays
objects:
  - type: segment
    attributes:
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., blue, red, orange)
      contiguity: horizontal
      count_per_input: 1
    relationships:
      location: surrounded by white pixels
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    input: input_grid
    output: segment_properties (color, start_index, end_index)
  - name: create_output_grid
    based_on: input_grid_dimensions
    initial_state: all_white_pixels
  - name: preserve_endpoints
    target: output_grid
    using: segment_properties
    effect: set pixels at start_index and end_index to the segment's color
relationships_transformation:
  - input_segment_interior_pixels -> output_white_pixels
  - input_segment_endpoint_pixels -> output_endpoint_pixels (color preserved)
  - input_surrounding_white_pixels -> output_surrounding_white_pixels (unchanged)
invariance:
  - grid_dimensions
  - color_of_endpoints
  - position_of_endpoints
  - surrounding_white_pixels
variance:
  - color_of_non_white_segment (between examples)
  - length_of_non_white_segment
  - position_of_non_white_segment
  - interior_pixels_of_segment (change from non-white to white)
