**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels. The transformation isolates the endpoints of this non-white segment. The color of the segment is preserved at these endpoints, while the interior pixels of the segment are changed to white. Pixels outside the original segment remain unchanged (white).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Scan the grid to locate the contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
3.  Record the color of this segment, its starting column index, and its ending column index.
4.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
5.  In the new grid, set the pixel at the recorded starting column index to the recorded segment color.
6.  In the new grid, set the pixel at the recorded ending column index to the recorded segment color.
7.  Output the modified grid.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: isolating the endpoints of a single horizontal segment of non-white color within a 1D grid. The provided Python code attempted to implement this logic. However, it failed on all training examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the `transform` function received the input grid as a NumPy array rather than the assumed list of lists, and the type checks (`isinstance`) or conditional logic (`if not input_grid`) failed when applied to a NumPy array.

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, likely by converting the input to a NumPy array explicitly at the beginning or by using NumPy-native operations for indexing and manipulation. The core logic of finding the segment endpoints and placing their color in an otherwise white output grid remains valid.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

All three training examples consist of a single row (1xN grid).
*   **Example 1:** Input: 1x29 grid, contains a blue (1) segment from index 9 to 25. Output: 1x29 grid, blue (1) at indices 9 and 25, white (0) elsewhere.
*   **Example 2:** Input: 1x28 grid, contains a red (2) segment from index 12 to 24. Output: 1x28 grid, red (2) at indices 12 and 24, white (0) elsewhere.
*   **Example 3:** Input: 1x29 grid, contains an orange (7) segment from index 1 to 22. Output: 1x29 grid, orange (7) at indices 1 and 22, white (0) elsewhere.

The error occurred identically in all cases, indicating the problem is fundamental to how the code handles the input data structure, not specific to the data values within the examples. The failure point is likely the initial type checking or boolean evaluation of the input grid when treated as a NumPy array.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, likely as a NumPy array representing a single row of pixels.
2.  Determine the dimensions (width) of the input row.
3.  Create a new output row of the same width, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  Identify all indices in the input row that contain non-white pixels.
5.  If non-white pixels are found:
    a.  Determine the minimum index (`start_index`) and maximum index (`end_index`) among them.
    b.  Identify the color (`segment_color`) of the pixel at the `start_index` in the input row.
    c.  In the output row, set the pixel at `start_index` to `segment_color`.
    d.  In the output row, set the pixel at `end_index` to `segment_color`. (This correctly handles segments of length 1, where `start_index` equals `end_index`).
6.  Format the output row as a list within a list.
7.  Return the formatted output grid.
