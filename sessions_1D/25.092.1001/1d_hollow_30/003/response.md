"""
Transforms a 1D input grid containing a single horizontal segment of non-white color.
The transformation identifies the start and end points of this segment.
It creates an output grid of the same dimensions, initially all white (0).
The color of the original segment is then placed at the start and end indices in the output grid, leaving all other pixels white.
Handles input as a NumPy array and returns the output as a list of lists.
