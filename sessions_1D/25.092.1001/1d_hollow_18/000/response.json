The input arrays contain contiguous sequences (blocks) of a single non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (0). The transformation identifies these non-white blocks. For each block found, it preserves the first and last pixel of the block and replaces all the pixels *between* the first and the last with white (0). Pixels outside these blocks (the surrounding white pixels) are unchanged. The color of the block itself (azure, blue, orange in the examples) does not affect the logic, only its non-white status.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
