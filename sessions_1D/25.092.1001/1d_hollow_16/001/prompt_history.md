Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are single-row grids (or can be treated as 1D arrays).
2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0), magenta (6), orange (7), and azure (8).
3.  **Key Feature:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal segment (a line) of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens *within* the non-white segment. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
5.  **Segment Modification:** The non-white segment in the input is modified in the output such that only its first and last pixels retain their original color. All pixels *between* the first and last pixel of the segment are changed to white (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Keep only the endpoints of a horizontal colored line.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Single row (or treatable as 1D).
  - background_color: white (0).
objects:
  - type: horizontal_line
    description: A single contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (magenta, orange, azure in examples).
      - length: Varies (4, 6, 18 in examples).
      - location: Surrounded by white pixels.
transformation:
  - action: identify_line
    target: The contiguous non-white segment in the input.
    details: Find its start and end positions and its color.
  - action: preserve_endpoints
    target: The identified line segment.
    details: Keep the pixel at the start position and the pixel at the end position unchanged in the output.
  - action: erase_middle
    target: The identified line segment.
    details: Change all pixels strictly between the start and end positions to white (0).
  - action: preserve_background
    target: All white pixels outside the identified line segment.
    details: Keep these pixels unchanged in the output.
relationships:
  - input_output_dimensions: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - color_conservation: The color of the endpoints in the output matches the color of the line in the input.
  - position_conservation: The endpoints in the output are at the same positions as the start and end of the line in the input. The background pixels retain their positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels within the input grid.
2.  Determine the starting position and ending position of this segment.
3.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the positions strictly between the starting position and the ending position of the identified segment.
5.  For each of these intermediate positions, change the pixel value in the output grid to white (0).
6.  Leave all other pixels (the segment's endpoints and the surrounding background) in the output grid unchanged from their values in the input grid.
