task_description: Keep only the endpoints of a horizontal colored line.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Single row (or treatable as 1D).
  - background_color: white (0).
objects:
  - type: horizontal_line
    description: A single contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (magenta, orange, azure in examples).
      - length: Varies (4, 6, 18 in examples).
      - location: Surrounded by white pixels.
transformation:
  - action: identify_line
    target: The contiguous non-white segment in the input.
    details: Find its start and end positions and its color.
  - action: preserve_endpoints
    target: The identified line segment.
    details: Keep the pixel at the start position and the pixel at the end position unchanged in the output.
  - action: erase_middle
    target: The identified line segment.
    details: Change all pixels strictly between the start and end positions to white (0).
  - action: preserve_background
    target: All white pixels outside the identified line segment.
    details: Keep these pixels unchanged in the output.
relationships:
  - input_output_dimensions: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - color_conservation: The color of the endpoints in the output matches the color of the line in the input.
  - position_conservation: The endpoints in the output are at the same positions as the start and end of the line in the input. The background pixels retain their positions.
