The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Segment Modification:** The non-white segment in the input is modified in the output such that only its first and last pixels retain their original color. All pixels *between* the first and last pixel of the segment are changed to white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
