Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are all 1-dimensional grids (or rows) of size 1x11.
*   Each input grid contains exactly one contiguous horizontal segment (object) of a single non-white color (green in example 1 and 3, gray in example 2). The rest of the grid is white (0).
*   The transformation modifies only the pixels within this colored segment.
*   Specifically, the first and last pixels of the colored segment remain unchanged in the output.
*   All pixels *between* the first and last pixels of the segment are changed to white (0) in the output.
*   If the segment has a length of 1 or 2, it appears unchanged because there are no pixels "between" the start and end pixels. Example 1 shows a segment of length 3, where the middle pixel changes. Example 2 shows a segment of length 6, where the four middle pixels change. Example 3 shows a segment of length 4, where the two middle pixels change.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Modifies a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white color within a 1D grid by changing its interior pixels to white.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: 1x11
objects:
  - name: colored_segment
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color of the segment (e.g., green, gray).
      - start_index: The column index of the first pixel of the segment.
      - end_index: The column index of the last pixel of the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1).
    identification: Find the first and last non-white pixels in the row.
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: The colored_segment is contained within the input grid. Other pixels are white.
actions:
  - name: hollow_segment
    input: colored_segment
    output: modified_segment (in the output grid)
    condition: Only applied if the segment length is greater than 2.
    rule:
      - Keep the pixel at the start_index unchanged.
      - Keep the pixel at the end_index unchanged.
      - Change all pixels between start_index + 1 and end_index - 1 (inclusive) to white (0).
  - name: preserve_background
    input: pixels outside the colored_segment
    output: corresponding pixels in the output grid
    rule: Keep white (0) pixels unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels within the input row. Determine its start column index and end column index.
2.  If no such segment exists, or if the segment has a length of 1 or 2 (i.e., the start and end indices are the same or adjacent), copy the input grid directly to the output.
3.  If the segment has a length greater than 2:
    a.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
    b.  Iterate through the columns from `start_index + 1` up to, but not including, `end_index`.
    c.  For each column in this range, set the pixel value in the output grid to white (0).
    d.  Leave all other pixels (the start and end pixels of the segment, and all pixels outside the segment) unchanged from the input grid.
4.  Return the modified grid as the output.
