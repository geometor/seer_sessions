The rest of the grid is white (0).\n*   The transformation modifies only the pixels within this colored segment.\n*   Specifically, the first and last pixels of the colored segment remain unchanged in the output.\n*   All pixels *between* the first and last pixels of the segment are changed to white (0) in the output.\n*   If the segment has a length of 1 or 2, it appears unchanged because there are no pixels \"between\" the start and end pixels. Example 1 shows a segment of length 3, where the middle pixel changes. Example 2 shows a segment of length 6, where the four middle pixels change. Example 3 shows a segment of length 4, where the two middle pixels change.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
