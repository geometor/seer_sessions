task_description: Modifies a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white color within a 1D grid by changing its interior pixels to white.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: 1x11
objects:
  - name: colored_segment
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color of the segment (e.g., green, gray).
      - start_index: The column index of the first pixel of the segment.
      - end_index: The column index of the last pixel of the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1).
    identification: Find the first and last non-white pixels in the row.
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: The colored_segment is contained within the input grid. Other pixels are white.
actions:
  - name: hollow_segment
    input: colored_segment
    output: modified_segment (in the output grid)
    condition: Only applied if the segment length is greater than 2.
    rule:
      - Keep the pixel at the start_index unchanged.
      - Keep the pixel at the end_index unchanged.
      - Change all pixels between start_index + 1 and end_index - 1 (inclusive) to white (0).
  - name: preserve_background
    input: pixels outside the colored_segment
    output: corresponding pixels in the output grid
    rule: Keep white (0) pixels unchanged.
