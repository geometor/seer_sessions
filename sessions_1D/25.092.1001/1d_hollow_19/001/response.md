"""
Modifies a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white color 
within a 1D grid (represented as a 1xN 2D array) by changing its 
interior pixels to white (0).

1. Identifies the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
2. If the segment length is greater than 2, it hollows the segment 
   by changing all pixels between the start and end pixels to white (0).
3. Otherwise, the grid remains unchanged.
