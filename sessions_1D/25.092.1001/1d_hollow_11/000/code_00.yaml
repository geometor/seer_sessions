task_type: object_modification
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D as all action happens on a single row segment
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., blue, gray)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
properties:
  - segment_length: variable (>= 2 pixels)
  - segment_endpoints: first and last pixel of the non-white segment
  - segment_interior: pixels between the endpoints
actions:
  - identify: the contiguous non-white segment
  - locate: the start and end pixels of the segment
  - preserve: the start and end pixels of the segment in the output
  - modify: change the color of all pixels within the segment's interior (between the endpoints) to white (0)
  - preserve: background pixels (white) remain unchanged
relationships:
  - adjacency: The non-white pixels form a single contiguous block.
  - transformation_focus: The action is applied specifically to the interior of the identified segment.
