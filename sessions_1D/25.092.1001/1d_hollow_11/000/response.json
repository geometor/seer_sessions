The first and last pixels of the block remain unchanged in the output. However, all the pixels *between* the first and last pixel of the block are changed to white ('0').\n4.  **Consistency:** The background white pixels remain white in the output. The transformation only affects the interior of the identified non-white segment. The length of the non-white segment varies across examples, but the rule holds.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
