Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples use 1xN grids (single rows).
2.  **Color Usage:** Each input features a single contiguous block of a non-white color (blue '1' or gray '5') surrounded by white ('0').
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation focuses on modifying the non-white block. The first and last pixels of the block remain unchanged in the output. However, all the pixels *between* the first and last pixel of the block are changed to white ('0').
4.  **Consistency:** The background white pixels remain white in the output. The transformation only affects the interior of the identified non-white segment. The length of the non-white segment varies across examples, but the rule holds.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_modification
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D as all action happens on a single row segment
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., blue, gray)
    shape: contiguous horizontal line
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
properties:
  - segment_length: variable (>= 2 pixels)
  - segment_endpoints: first and last pixel of the non-white segment
  - segment_interior: pixels between the endpoints
actions:
  - identify: the contiguous non-white segment
  - locate: the start and end pixels of the segment
  - preserve: the start and end pixels of the segment in the output
  - modify: change the color of all pixels within the segment's interior (between the endpoints) to white (0)
  - preserve: background pixels (white) remain unchanged
relationships:
  - adjacency: The non-white pixels form a single contiguous block.
  - transformation_focus: The action is applied specifically to the interior of the identified segment.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to find the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
2.  Identify the starting column index and the ending column index of this segment.
3.  Create a new grid identical to the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the columns from the starting index + 1 up to (but not including) the ending index.
5.  For each column in this range, set the value of the pixel in the new grid at that column (and the row of the segment) to white (0).
6.  The resulting grid is the output.
