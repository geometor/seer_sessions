Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids) of pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Colors:** The examples use white (0), green (3), and azure (8). White appears to be the background color.
3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. In each example, there is exactly one such segment.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation targets these non-white segments. Specifically, it modifies the *inner* part of the segment. The first and last pixels of the segment remain unchanged, while all pixels between them are turned into the background color (white, 0). Segments of length 1 or 2 would remain unchanged by this rule, although the examples only show segments of length 4 and 5.
5.  **Background:** The background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Modifies horizontal segments of non-background pixels by hollowing them out, keeping only the endpoints.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as single rows)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segment
    properties:
      - color: non-zero (non-white)
      - length: variable (examples show 4 and 5)
      - location: variable within the row
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    inputs: input grid
    outputs: list of segments (defined by start_index, end_index, color)
  - name: modify_segment
    condition: segment length > 2
    inputs: segment definition, output grid
    processing:
      - Iterate from segment start_index + 1 to end_index - 1.
      - Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the background color (0).
    outputs: modified output grid
relationships:
  - The transformation only affects pixels within identified non-white segments of length 3 or more.
  - Background pixels (0) are preserved.
  - The first and last pixels of modified segments retain their original color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. A segment is defined by its starting index, ending index, and color.
3.  For each segment found:
    a.  Calculate the length of the segment (ending index - starting index + 1).
    b.  If the length is greater than 2:
        i.  Iterate through the indices from the starting index + 1 up to (but not including) the ending index.
        ii. For each index in this range, set the value in the corresponding position in the *output grid* to 0 (white).
4.  Return the final output grid.
