task_description: Modifies horizontal segments of non-background pixels by hollowing them out, keeping only the endpoints.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as single rows)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segment
    properties:
      - color: non-zero (non-white)
      - length: variable (examples show 4 and 5)
      - location: variable within the row
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    inputs: input grid
    outputs: list of segments (defined by start_index, end_index, color)
  - name: modify_segment
    condition: segment length > 2
    inputs: segment definition, output grid
    processing:
      - Iterate from segment start_index + 1 to end_index - 1.
      - Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the background color (0).
    outputs: modified output grid
relationships:
  - The transformation only affects pixels within identified non-white segments of length 3 or more.
  - Background pixels (0) are preserved.
  - The first and last pixels of modified segments retain their original color.
