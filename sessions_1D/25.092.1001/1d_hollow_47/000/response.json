White appears to be the background color.\n3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. In each example, there is exactly one such segment.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation targets these non-white segments. Specifically, it modifies the *inner* part of the segment. The first and last pixels of the segment remain unchanged, while all pixels between them are turned into the background color (white, 0). Segments of length 1 or 2 would remain unchanged by this rule, although the examples only show segments of length 4 and 5.\n5.  **Background:** The background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
