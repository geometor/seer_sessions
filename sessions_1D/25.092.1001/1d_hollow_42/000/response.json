Specifically, it retains the first and last pixels of the segment but changes all the pixels *between* the first and last to white (0).\n    *   Pixels outside the original non-white segment remain unchanged (they stay white).\n    *   The length and starting position of the non-white segment vary between examples.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
