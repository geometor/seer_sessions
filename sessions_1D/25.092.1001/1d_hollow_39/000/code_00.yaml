task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
input_features:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
      - count: 1 per example
      - properties:
          - color: non-zero (8-azure, 4-yellow, 5-gray in examples)
          - length: variable (4, 12, 6 in examples)
          - location: surrounded by background_color
transformation:
  - action: modify_object
  - target: the contiguous_horizontal_block
  - modification:
      - keep the first pixel of the block
      - keep the last pixel of the block
      - change all pixels between the first and last pixel to background_color (0)
  - background: remains unchanged
output_features:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - objects:
      - type: pair_of_pixels (representing the ends of the original block)
      - properties:
          - color: same as the input block's color
          - separation: distance between them is original_block_length - 1
          - infill: background_color (0) between the pair
