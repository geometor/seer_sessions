Create a new grid of the same size as the input, initially filled with the background color (0).\n3.  Copy the non-white pixel from the starting index of the identified block in the input to the same index in the output grid.\n4.  If the starting index and ending index are different (i.e., the block has a length greater than 1), copy the non-white pixel from the ending index of the identified block in the input to the same index in the output grid.\n5.  Copy all the white pixels (0) from the input grid that were *outside* the identified block to their corresponding positions in the output grid. (Alternatively, steps 2-4 implicitly handle this if the output grid is initialized correctly or if the input is copied initially and then modified).\n6.  A simpler approach: Copy the entire input grid to the output grid. Then, iterate from the starting index + 1 up to (but not including) the ending index of the identified block, changing the pixel color at each of these intermediate indices to white (0)."
