"""
Identifies the first contiguous horizontal block of a non-background color (non-zero) in the input grid (assumed to be 1xN).
Keeps the first and last pixel of this block.
Changes all pixels between the first and last pixel of the block to the background color (0).
Pixels outside the block remain unchanged.
If the block has only one pixel, it remains unchanged.
If no block is found, the grid remains unchanged.
