The examples show that the input contains a contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white color (blue, green, or orange) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output retains only the first and the last pixel of this colored block, changing all the intermediate pixels within the original block to white. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged. The core operation seems to be identifying the extent (start and end) of a colored segment and preserving only its boundary pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
