task_type: object_modification
components:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensionality: 1-dimensional (row)
      content: pixels with color values (0-9)
  - type: object
    definition: contiguous horizontal block of pixels with the same non-white color
    properties:
      - color: the specific non-white color of the block (e.g., blue, green, orange)
      - start_index: the position of the first pixel of the block
      - end_index: the position of the last pixel of the block
      - length: the number of pixels in the block
relationships:
  - input grid contains one or more non-overlapping colored blocks.
  - output grid is derived from the input grid.
  - pixels outside the colored blocks remain white in the output.
  - pixels inside the colored blocks (excluding the start and end pixels) are changed to white in the output.
actions:
  - identify: Locate contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - extract: For each block, determine its color, start index, and end index.
  - transform: Create an output grid of the same size as the input, initially filled with white (0).
  - preserve_boundaries: For each identified block in the input, place its color at the start index and end index in the output grid.
