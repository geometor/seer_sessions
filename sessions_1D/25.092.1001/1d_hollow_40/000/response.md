Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

The input and output are single-row grids (or 1D arrays) of pixels. The examples show that the input contains a contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white color (blue, green, or orange) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output retains only the first and the last pixel of this colored block, changing all the intermediate pixels within the original block to white. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged. The core operation seems to be identifying the extent (start and end) of a colored segment and preserving only its boundary pixels.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_modification
components:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensionality: 1-dimensional (row)
      content: pixels with color values (0-9)
  - type: object
    definition: contiguous horizontal block of pixels with the same non-white color
    properties:
      - color: the specific non-white color of the block (e.g., blue, green, orange)
      - start_index: the position of the first pixel of the block
      - end_index: the position of the last pixel of the block
      - length: the number of pixels in the block
relationships:
  - input grid contains one or more non-overlapping colored blocks.
  - output grid is derived from the input grid.
  - pixels outside the colored blocks remain white in the output.
  - pixels inside the colored blocks (excluding the start and end pixels) are changed to white in the output.
actions:
  - identify: Locate contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - extract: For each block, determine its color, start index, and end index.
  - transform: Create an output grid of the same size as the input, initially filled with white (0).
  - preserve_boundaries: For each identified block in the input, place its color at the start index and end index in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the white color (0).
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to identify contiguous horizontal blocks of non-white pixels.
3.  For each non-white block found:
    a.  Note the color of the block.
    b.  Record the index (position) of the first pixel of the block.
    c.  Record the index (position) of the last pixel of the block.
    d.  In the output grid, set the pixel at the recorded first index to the block's color.
    e.  In the output grid, set the pixel at the recorded last index to the block's color.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
