task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # (represented as 1xN grids)
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_sequence
    properties:
      color: non-zero (e.g., 7, 4, 5)
      minimum_length: 1
      surrounded_by: color 0 (white) or grid boundary
transformation:
  target: each identified non-zero color sequence
  action: conditional_pixel_replacement
  condition: sequence length > 2
  details:
    - Keep the color of the first pixel in the sequence.
    - Keep the color of the last pixel in the sequence.
    - Change the color of all pixels strictly between the first and last pixel to 0 (white).
  unchanged_elements:
    - Background pixels (color 0).
    - Sequences of length 1 or 2.
