Each input array contains one or more contiguous sequences of a single non-white color, embedded within a background of white pixels (color 0). The transformation focuses on modifying these non-white sequences. Specifically, for each sequence, only the first and the last pixel retain their original color, while all pixels *between* the first and the last are changed to white (color 0). Sequences of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged as there are no pixels strictly *between* the first and last. The white background pixels remain unaffected.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
