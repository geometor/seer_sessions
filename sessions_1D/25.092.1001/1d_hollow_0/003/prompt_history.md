**Perception:**

The task involves processing 1-dimensional arrays (or single-row grids) of colored pixels. Each input array contains one or more contiguous sequences of a single non-white color, embedded within a background of white pixels (color 0). The transformation focuses on modifying these non-white sequences. Specifically, for each sequence, only the first and the last pixel retain their original color, while all pixels *between* the first and the last are changed to white (color 0). Sequences of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged as there are no pixels strictly *between* the first and last. The white background pixels remain unaffected.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # (represented as 1xN grids)
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_sequence
    properties:
      color: non-zero (e.g., 7, 4, 5)
      minimum_length: 1
      surrounded_by: color 0 (white) or grid boundary
transformation:
  target: each identified non-zero color sequence
  action: conditional_pixel_replacement
  condition: sequence length > 2
  details:
    - Keep the color of the first pixel in the sequence.
    - Keep the color of the last pixel in the sequence.
    - Change the color of all pixels strictly between the first and last pixel to 0 (white).
  unchanged_elements:
    - Background pixels (color 0).
    - Sequences of length 1 or 2.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through the input array from left to right.
2.  Identify the start and end indices of each maximal contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (pixels with color > 0).
3.  For each identified sequence:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  If the length is greater than 2:
        i.  Keep the pixel at the start index unchanged.
        ii. Keep the pixel at the end index unchanged.
        iii. Change the color of all pixels located at indices between the start index and the end index to white (0).
    c.  If the length is 1 or 2, leave the sequence unchanged.
4.  Keep all original white pixels (color 0) unchanged.
5.  Construct the output array based on these modifications.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` consistently occurred across all training examples. This error typically arises in Python when a boolean condition (like in an `if` statement) receives a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values instead of a single `True` or `False`.

Investigation revealed that this likely happened in the initial input validation check: `if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:`. If the testing environment passed the input grid as a NumPy array instead of a standard Python list of lists, this check would attempt to evaluate the truthiness of a multi-element array, causing the error.

The core logic for identifying sequences (`find_sequences`) and applying the transformation (hollowing out sequences longer than 2) appears correct based on manual tracing and the provided examples.

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to handle the input robustly, whether it's a list of lists or a NumPy array, by converting it to a NumPy array explicitly and using NumPy-appropriate methods for checks (e.g., checking `.size`). The underlying transformation logic remains unchanged.

**Metrics:**

Let's verify the properties of the examples. We assume the input format is a list containing a single list (representing one row).

print(f"Example 3 Metrics: {metrics_3}")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Example 1 Metrics: {'dimensions': (1, 16), 'sequences': [{'start': 3, 'end': 11, 'color': 7, 'length': 9}]}
Example 2 Metrics: {'dimensions': (1, 16), 'sequences': [{'start': 4, 'end': 14, 'color': 4, 'length': 11}]}
Example 3 Metrics: {'dimensions': (1, 16), 'sequences': [{'start': 5, 'end': 7, 'color': 5, 'length': 3}]}

```
The metrics confirm:
- All examples are 1x16 grids.
- Each contains a single contiguous sequence of a non-white color.
- Sequence lengths are 9, 11, and 3, respectively.
- The transformation involves hollowing these sequences as their lengths are > 2.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to contain exactly one row (a 1xN grid). Handle potential variations in input data type (list of lists or NumPy array).
2.  Identify all maximal contiguous horizontal sequences of non-white pixels (color > 0) within the row. For each sequence, note its start index, end index, and length.
3.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
4.  Iterate through each identified sequence:
    a.  Check the length of the sequence.
    b.  If the length is greater than 2:
        i.  Modify the output row copy: Change the color of all pixels at indices *between* the start index (exclusive) and the end index (exclusive) to white (0).
        ii. Leave the pixels at the start and end indices unchanged in the output row copy (they retain their original non-white color).
    c.  If the length is 1 or 2, make no changes to the corresponding pixels in the output row copy for this sequence.
5.  Pixels in the output row copy that were not part of any non-white sequence (i.e., original background white pixels) remain unchanged.
6.  Return the modified output row, formatted as a grid (a list containing the single modified list).
