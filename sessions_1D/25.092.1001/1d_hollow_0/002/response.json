            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` consistently occurred across all training examples. This error typically arises in Python when a boolean condition (like in an `if` statement) receives a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values instead of a single `True` or `False`.\n\nInvestigation revealed that this likely happened in the initial input validation check: `if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:`. If the testing environment passed the input grid as a NumPy array instead of a standard Python list of lists, this check would attempt to evaluate the truthiness of a multi-element array, causing the error.\n\nThe core logic for identifying sequences (`find_sequences`) and applying the transformation (hollowing out sequences longer than 2) appears correct based on manual tracing and the provided examples.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `transform` function to handle the input robustly, whether it's a list of lists or a NumPy array, by converting it to a NumPy array explicitly and using NumPy-appropriate methods for checks (e.g., checking `.size`). The underlying transformation logic remains unchanged.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's verify the properties of the examples. We assume the input format is a list containing a single list (representing one row).\n"
