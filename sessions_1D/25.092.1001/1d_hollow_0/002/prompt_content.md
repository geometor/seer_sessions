"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal sequences of non-white pixels in a 1D input array (represented as a 1xN grid). 
For each sequence found:
If the sequence length is greater than 2, it keeps the first and last pixels of the sequence and changes all pixels in between to white (0).
If the sequence length is 1 or 2, it leaves the sequence unchanged.
White background pixels remain unchanged.
