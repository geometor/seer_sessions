task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # Specifically, 1xN grids
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_sequence
    properties:
      color: non-zero (any color other than white)
      minimum_length: 1
      contained_within: a single row
      surrounded_by: color 0 (white) horizontally, or grid boundary
transformation:
  scope: operates independently on the single row provided in the input grid
  target: each maximal contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels within the row
  action: conditional_pixel_replacement
  condition: sequence length > 2
  details:
    - Preserve the color of the first pixel in the sequence.
    - Preserve the color of the last pixel in the sequence.
    - Change the color of all pixels strictly between the first and last pixel to 0 (white).
  unchanged_elements:
    - Background pixels (color 0).
    - Non-white sequences of length 1 or 2.
input_format_robustness: Needs to handle input as list-of-lists or NumPy array.
