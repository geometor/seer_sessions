## Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed because it assumed the input grids were standard Python lists (`List[int]`), while the execution environment likely passed them as NumPy arrays. The error "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" typically occurs when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`).

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm that the input data is indeed handled as NumPy arrays.
2.  Modify the Python code to work directly with NumPy arrays, using NumPy indexing and functions where appropriate.
3.  Re-verify the core logic: identifying the start and end of the contiguous non-white block and constructing the output array.
4.  Update the observations, facts, and natural language program to accurately reflect the use of NumPy arrays and the refined transformation logic.

## Metrics

Let's examine the structure of the input data as interpreted by NumPy.

``` python
import numpy as np
import io

# Helper to parse string input into numpy array
def parse_grid(grid_str):
  return np.loadtxt(io.StringIO(grid_str), dtype=int, ndmin=2)

# Example Inputs
input_str_1 = "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
input_str_2 = "0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0"
input_str_3 = "0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"

# Parse inputs
grid1 = parse_grid(input_str_1)
grid2 = parse_grid(input_str_2)
grid3 = parse_grid(input_str_3)

# Print shapes and data types
print(f"Example 1: Shape={grid1.shape}, Dtype={grid1.dtype}")
print(f"Example 2: Shape={grid2.shape}, Dtype={grid2.dtype}")
print(f"Example 3: Shape={grid3.shape}, Dtype={grid3.dtype}")

# Find block info for Example 1 using numpy
non_white_indices_1 = np.where(grid1[0] != 0)[0]
if len(non_white_indices_1) > 0:
    start_index_1 = non_white_indices_1[0]
    end_index_1 = non_white_indices_1[-1]
    color_1 = grid1[0, start_index_1]
    print(f"Example 1 Block: Start={start_index_1}, End={end_index_1}, Color={color_1}, Length={end_index_1 - start_index_1 + 1}")
else:
    print("Example 1 Block: Not found")

# Find block info for Example 2 using numpy
non_white_indices_2 = np.where(grid2[0] != 0)[0]
if len(non_white_indices_2) > 0:
    start_index_2 = non_white_indices_2[0]
    end_index_2 = non_white_indices_2[-1]
    color_2 = grid2[0, start_index_2]
    print(f"Example 2 Block: Start={start_index_2}, End={end_index_2}, Color={color_2}, Length={end_index_2 - start_index_2 + 1}")
else:
    print("Example 2 Block: Not found")

# Find block info for Example 3 using numpy
non_white_indices_3 = np.where(grid3[0] != 0)[0]
if len(non_white_indices_3) > 0:
    start_index_3 = non_white_indices_3[0]
    end_index_3 = non_white_indices_3[-1]
    color_3 = grid3[0, start_index_3]
    print(f"Example 3 Block: Start={start_index_3}, End={end_index_3}, Color={color_3}, Length={end_index_3 - start_index_3 + 1}")
else:
    print("Example 3 Block: Not found")
```
```
Example 1: Shape=(1, 31), Dtype=int64
Example 2: Shape=(1, 31), Dtype=int64
Example 3: Shape=(1, 31), Dtype=int64
Example 1 Block: Start=9, End=14, Color=2, Length=6
Example 2 Block: Start=3, End=28, Color=3, Length=26
Example 3 Block: Start=3, End=10, Color=1, Length=8

```
The metrics confirm that the inputs are parsed as 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, N), representing a single row. The data type is integer. The core logic of finding the start/end indices and color of the non-white block using `np.where` seems appropriate.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Specifically 1xN NumPy arrays
background_color: white (0)
input_data_type: numpy.ndarray (dtype=int)
output_data_type: numpy.ndarray (dtype=int)

objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: A horizontal sequence of identical non-white pixels within the single row of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9) representing the color of the block.
      - location: Defined by the start and end column indices within the row.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).

actions:
  - action: identify_block_endpoints
    input: input_grid (1xN NumPy array)
    output: block_color (int), start_index (int), end_index (int) OR indication of no block found.
    description: Locates the column indices of the first and last non-white pixels in the row. Assumes only one contiguous block exists. Extracts the color of the block.
  - action: create_output_grid
    input: input_grid_shape (tuple), block_color (int), start_index (int), end_index (int)
    output: output_grid (1xN NumPy array)
    description: Generates an output grid of the same shape as the input, initialized with the background color (white). Sets the pixels at the start and end indices of the identified block to the block's color.

transformation:
  - description: Hollow out the block
    details: The transformation identifies the horizontal contiguous block of non-white color. It creates a new grid of the same dimensions, initially all white. It then places the block's color only at the starting and ending column indices of where the block was located in the input grid. If the block has length 1, only that single pixel is colored in the output.
    input_elements:
      - input_grid (1xN NumPy array)
    output_elements:
      - output_grid (1xN NumPy array) where:
          - output_grid[0, start_index] = block_color
          - output_grid[0, end_index] = block_color
          - All other output_grid elements are 0 (white).

relationships:
  - The output grid must have the exact same shape as the input grid.
  - The non-white pixels in the output grid correspond directly to the column indices of the start and end positions of the non-white block in the input grid's single row.
  - The color of the non-white pixels in the output is identical to the color of the block in the input.
  - If no non-white block exists in the input, the output is an all-white grid of the same shape.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid as a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N).
2.  Create an output grid of the same shape as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Find the column indices of all non-white pixels (pixels with value > 0) in the input grid's single row.
4.  If any non-white pixels are found:
    a.  Determine the index of the first non-white pixel (this is the `start_index`).
    b.  Determine the index of the last non-white pixel (this is the `end_index`).
    c.  Get the color of the block by reading the value from the input grid at the `start_index` (or `end_index`, as they belong to the same block).
    d.  Set the value of the output grid at `[0, start_index]` to the identified block color.
    e.  Set the value of the output grid at `[0, end_index]` to the identified block color. (Note: If `start_index` equals `end_index`, this step simply overwrites the same pixel).
5.  Return the output grid.
