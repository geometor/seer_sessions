Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Grid Structure:** The inputs are single-row grids (vectors) containing a contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color (magenta or gray) surrounded by white pixels.
*   **Output Grid Structure:** The outputs are also single-row grids of the same dimensions as the inputs. They consist mostly of white pixels, with two pixels matching the non-white color from the input.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to identify the horizontal block of non-white color in the input. It then keeps only the first (leftmost) and the last (rightmost) pixels of that block, replacing all the pixels *between* them with white. The pixels outside the original block remain white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Type: 1-dimensional (single row)
  - Background Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block
  - Color: Non-white (magenta (6) or gray (5) in examples)
  - Properties:
      - Start Position (column index)
      - End Position (column index)
      - Color

Actions:
  - Identify the non-white contiguous block in the input.
  - Determine the start and end positions of this block.
  - Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).
  - Place the original non-white color at the start position in the new grid.
  - Place the original non-white color at the end position in the new grid.

Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions.
  - The two non-white pixels in the output correspond to the start and end pixels of the non-white block in the input.
  - The color of the non-white pixels in the output matches the color of the block in the input.
  - All other pixels in the output are white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Find the contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels within the input grid.
2.  Record the color of this segment, its starting column index, and its ending column index.
3.  Create an output grid identical in size to the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at the recorded starting column index to the recorded color.
5.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at the recorded ending column index to the recorded color.
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
