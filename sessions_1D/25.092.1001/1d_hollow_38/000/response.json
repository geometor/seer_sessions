They consist mostly of white pixels, with two pixels matching the non-white color from the input.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to identify the horizontal block of non-white color in the input. It then keeps only the first (leftmost) and the last (rightmost) pixels of that block, replacing all the pixels *between* them with white. The pixels outside the original block remain white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
