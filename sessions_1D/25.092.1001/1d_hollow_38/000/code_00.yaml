Grid Properties:
  - Type: 1-dimensional (single row)
  - Background Color: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block
  - Color: Non-white (magenta (6) or gray (5) in examples)
  - Properties:
      - Start Position (column index)
      - End Position (column index)
      - Color

Actions:
  - Identify the non-white contiguous block in the input.
  - Determine the start and end positions of this block.
  - Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).
  - Place the original non-white color at the start position in the new grid.
  - Place the original non-white color at the end position in the new grid.

Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions.
  - The two non-white pixels in the output correspond to the start and end pixels of the non-white block in the input.
  - The color of the non-white pixels in the output matches the color of the block in the input.
  - All other pixels in the output are white.
