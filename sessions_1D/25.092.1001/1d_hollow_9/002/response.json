            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code assumed the input and output grids were single rows (1xN arrays). The `list index out of range` error strongly suggests this assumption was incorrect. The visual representation in the initial prompt likely flattened the actual grid structure. The core logic of identifying a contiguous segment of non-white pixels and hollowing it out (keeping endpoints, zeroing the middle) seems conceptually correct based on the visual transformation, but it needs to be applied correctly to the actual data structure. The strategy is to first inspect the true structure of the input/output grids using code execution, then adapt the logic to work with that structure, likely operating on columns instead of rows.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's verify the dimensions and structure of the training examples.\n"

If we reach the end of the grid (last row) and the pixel is non-white and `start_index` is not -1, record the current row index as `end_index`. Then, proceed to step 5.\n5.
