- description: Input and Output structure
  facts:
    - Both input and output are 2D grids.
    - All training examples have input grids with dimensions N rows x 1 column (column vectors).
    - The output grid has the identical dimensions (N rows x 1 column) as the input grid.

- description: Object Identification
  facts:
    - The primary objects are contiguous vertical segments (blocks) of a single non-white color in the single column.
    - The background consists of white (0) pixels.
    - Each example contains exactly one non-white vertical segment.

- description: Transformation
  facts:
    - The transformation operates on the identified non-white vertical segment within the column.
    - For the non-white segment:
      - The pixel at the starting row index of the segment remains unchanged in the output.
      - The pixel at the ending row index of the segment remains unchanged in the output.
      - All pixels within the segment, located strictly between the starting and ending row indices, are changed to white (0) in the output.
    - Pixels that were originally white (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output.
    - The color of the endpoints in the output matches the color of the segment in the input.

- description: Relationships
  facts:
    - The position of the endpoints (start and end row index) of the non-white segment determines which pixels are modified.
    - The length of the non-white segment must be greater than 2 for any change to occur. (If length is 1 or 2, the start and end are the same or adjacent, and no pixels are strictly 'between' them).
