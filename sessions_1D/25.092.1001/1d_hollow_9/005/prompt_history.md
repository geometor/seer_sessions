**Perception:**

The input and output are both single-row grids (or 1D arrays) of the same length. The inputs contain contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of a single non-white color (magenta '6' or gray '5') surrounded by white '0' pixels. The transformation modifies these non-white segments. Specifically, it keeps the first and the last pixel of each non-white segment and changes all the pixels *between* the first and the last pixel of that segment to white '0'. The white pixels outside the original non-white segments remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
- description: Input and Output structure
  facts:
    - Both input and output are 1D arrays (single rows) of pixels.
    - The length of the output array is identical to the length of the input array.

- description: Object Identification
  facts:
    - The primary objects are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of non-white pixels.
    - The background consists of white (0) pixels.
    - Each example contains exactly one non-white segment.

- description: Transformation
  facts:
    - The transformation operates independently on each identified non-white segment.
    - For each non-white segment:
      - The pixel at the starting index of the segment remains unchanged in the output.
      - The pixel at the ending index of the segment remains unchanged in the output.
      - All pixels within the segment, located between the starting and ending indices, are changed to white (0) in the output.
    - Pixels that were originally white (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output.
    - The color of the endpoints in the output matches the color of the segment in the input.

- description: Relationships
  facts:
    - The position of the endpoints of the non-white segment determines which pixels are modified.
    - The length of the non-white segment must be at least 2 for any change to occur (if length is 1, the start and end are the same, and no pixels are 'between'). If the length is 2, the start and end pixels are kept, and there are no pixels between them to change. If the length is greater than 2, the inner pixels are changed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
3.  For each identified non-white segment:
    a.  Find the starting index and the ending index of the segment.
    b.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
    c.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel value in the output row to white (0).
4.  Return the modified row as the output.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: list index out of range

## Example 2:
Error: list index out of range

## Example 3:
Error: list index out of range
**General Assessment:**

The error `list index out of range` clearly indicates that the code executed (`code_00.py` as referenced in the results) was attempting to access grid elements assuming a structure different from the actual input data. The provided examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) consistently show input and output grids as single rows (1xN shape). The failing code, however, seems designed for column vectors (Nx1 shape), specifically using indexing like `grid[r][0]`, which would fail if `grid[r]` is just an integer (as it would be in a single-row list like `[[...]]` when `r=0`) or if `r` exceeds the number of rows (which is 1).

The initial "Perception" and "Natural Language Program" provided *before* the failing code seem to correctly describe the transformation for single-row inputs with horizontal segments. The strategy is to disregard the failing code's logic (vertical processing) and refine the description based *only* on the examples and the initial correct perception.

  facts:
    - The background color is white (0).
    - The key object in the input is a single, contiguous, horizontal segment (or block) of non-white pixels.
    - The non-white colors observed are magenta (6) and gray (5).
    - The length of the non-white segment varies between examples (14, 6, 8 pixels).

- description: Transformation Rule
  facts:
    - The transformation modifies the non-white segment found in the input row.
    - The first pixel (leftmost) of the segment in the input retains its position and color in the output.
    - The last pixel (rightmost) of the segment in the input retains its position and color in the output.
    - All pixels located strictly *between* the first and last pixels of the original segment are changed to white (0) in the output.
    - If the segment length is 1 or 2, no pixels are strictly between the start and end, so the segment remains unchanged in the output (though the code check was simplified, the examples only show length > 2 cases leading to change).
    - Pixels that were originally white (0) outside the segment remain white (0).

- description: Verification
  facts:
    - Applying the transformation rule (keep endpoints, change middle to white) successfully reproduces the output for all three training examples.
    - The execution error previously reported was due to attempting to run code designed for vertical segments on this horizontal segment task.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept a single-row input grid.
2.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
3.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the first non-white pixel. Record its index as `start_index`.
4.  If no non-white pixel is found, return the unchanged copy of the input row.
5.  Continue scanning from `start_index` to find the last contiguous non-white pixel belonging to the same segment. Record its index as `end_index`. (In these examples, there's only one segment, so this is the last non-white pixel overall).
6.  Check if the segment length (`end_index - start_index + 1`) is greater than 2.
7.  If the length is greater than 2, iterate through the indices `i` from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`. For each `i`, set the pixel value at index `i` in the output row to white (0).
8.  Return the modified output row, wrapped in a list to maintain the grid structure `[[...]]`.
