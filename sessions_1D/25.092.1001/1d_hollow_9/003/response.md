"""
Identifies a contiguous vertical segment of non-white pixels in a single-column input grid. 
It keeps the first (top) and last (bottom) pixel of the segment and changes 
all pixels strictly between the first and last pixel to white (0). 
Pixels outside the identified segment remain unchanged. Assumes input is always a column vector (Nx1 grid).
