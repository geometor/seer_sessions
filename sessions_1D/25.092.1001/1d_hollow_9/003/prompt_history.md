**Perception:**

The input and output are both single-row grids (or 1D arrays) of the same length. The inputs contain contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of a single non-white color (magenta '6' or gray '5') surrounded by white '0' pixels. The transformation modifies these non-white segments. Specifically, it keeps the first and the last pixel of each non-white segment and changes all the pixels *between* the first and the last pixel of that segment to white '0'. The white pixels outside the original non-white segments remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
- description: Input and Output structure
  facts:
    - Both input and output are 1D arrays (single rows) of pixels.
    - The length of the output array is identical to the length of the input array.

- description: Object Identification
  facts:
    - The primary objects are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of non-white pixels.
    - The background consists of white (0) pixels.
    - Each example contains exactly one non-white segment.

- description: Transformation
  facts:
    - The transformation operates independently on each identified non-white segment.
    - For each non-white segment:
      - The pixel at the starting index of the segment remains unchanged in the output.
      - The pixel at the ending index of the segment remains unchanged in the output.
      - All pixels within the segment, located between the starting and ending indices, are changed to white (0) in the output.
    - Pixels that were originally white (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output.
    - The color of the endpoints in the output matches the color of the segment in the input.

- description: Relationships
  facts:
    - The position of the endpoints of the non-white segment determines which pixels are modified.
    - The length of the non-white segment must be at least 2 for any change to occur (if length is 1, the start and end are the same, and no pixels are 'between'). If the length is 2, the start and end pixels are kept, and there are no pixels between them to change. If the length is greater than 2, the inner pixels are changed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
3.  For each identified non-white segment:
    a.  Find the starting index and the ending index of the segment.
    b.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
    c.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel value in the output row to white (0).
4.  Return the modified row as the output.

## Example 3:
Error: list index out of range
**General Assessment:**

The previous code assumed the input and output grids were single rows (1xN arrays). The `list index out of range` error strongly suggests this assumption was incorrect. The visual representation in the initial prompt likely flattened the actual grid structure. The core logic of identifying a contiguous segment of non-white pixels and hollowing it out (keeping endpoints, zeroing the middle) seems conceptually correct based on the visual transformation, but it needs to be applied correctly to the actual data structure. The strategy is to first inspect the true structure of the input/output grids using code execution, then adapt the logic to work with that structure, likely operating on columns instead of rows.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's verify the dimensions and structure of the training examples.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid (which is an N x 1 column vector).
2.  Create a deep copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
3.  Initialize variables to track the start and end row index of a potential non-white segment. Set `start_index` to -1.
4.  Iterate through the rows of the input grid's single column (from row index 0 to N-1):
    a.  Read the pixel value at the current row index.
    b.  If the pixel is non-white (not 0) and `start_index` is -1, record the current row index as `start_index`.
    c.  If the pixel is white (0) and `start_index` is not -1 (meaning we were just inside a segment), record the previous row index (`current_index - 1`) as `end_index`. Then, proceed to step 5.
    d.  If we reach the end of the grid (last row) and the pixel is non-white and `start_index` is not -1, record the current row index as `end_index`. Then, proceed to step 5.
5.  If a segment was found (`start_index` is not -1 and `end_index` was determined):
    a.  Check if the segment length (`end_index - start_index + 1`) is greater than 2.
    b.  If it is, iterate through the row indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
    c.  For each row index in this range, set the corresponding pixel value in the output grid's column to white (0).
    d. Reset `start_index` to -1 to potentially find another segment (although examples only show one).
6.  Return the modified grid as the output.
