- description: Grid Structure
  facts:
    - Input and output grids consist of a single row.
    - The width (number of columns) of the output grid is identical to the width of the input grid.
    - All example grids have a shape of (1, 18).

- description: Object Identification
  facts:
    - The background color is white (0).
    - The key object in the input is a single, contiguous, horizontal segment (or block) of non-white pixels.
    - The non-white colors observed are magenta (6) and gray (5).
    - The length of the non-white segment varies between examples (14, 6, 8 pixels).

- description: Transformation Rule
  facts:
    - The transformation modifies the non-white segment found in the input row.
    - The first pixel (leftmost) of the segment in the input retains its position and color in the output.
    - The last pixel (rightmost) of the segment in the input retains its position and color in the output.
    - All pixels located strictly *between* the first and last pixels of the original segment are changed to white (0) in the output.
    - If the segment length is 1 or 2, no pixels are strictly between the start and end, so the segment remains unchanged in the output (though the code check was simplified, the examples only show length > 2 cases leading to change).
    - Pixels that were originally white (0) outside the segment remain white (0).

- description: Verification
  facts:
    - Applying the transformation rule (keep endpoints, change middle to white) successfully reproduces the output for all three training examples.
    - The execution error previously reported was due to attempting to run code designed for vertical segments on this horizontal segment task.
