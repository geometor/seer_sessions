"""
Identifies the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels 
in the input row (assumed to be a single-row grid). It keeps the 
first (leftmost) and last (rightmost) pixel of this segment and changes 
all pixels strictly between them to white (0). Pixels outside the segment, 
and segments of length 1 or 2, remain unchanged.

    Finds the start and end indices of the single contiguous horizontal 
    segment of non-white pixels in a single row. Assumes only one such
    segment exists per row based on examples.

        tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the start and end index (inclusive).
