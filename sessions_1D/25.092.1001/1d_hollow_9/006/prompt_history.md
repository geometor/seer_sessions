**Perception:**

The input and output are both single-row grids (or 1D arrays) of the same length. The inputs contain contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of a single non-white color (magenta '6' or gray '5') surrounded by white '0' pixels. The transformation modifies these non-white segments. Specifically, it keeps the first and the last pixel of each non-white segment and changes all the pixels *between* the first and the last pixel of that segment to white '0'. The white pixels outside the original non-white segments remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
- description: Input and Output structure
  facts:
    - Both input and output are 1D arrays (single rows) of pixels.
    - The length of the output array is identical to the length of the input array.

- description: Object Identification
  facts:
    - The primary objects are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of non-white pixels.
    - The background consists of white (0) pixels.
    - Each example contains exactly one non-white segment.

- description: Transformation
  facts:
    - The transformation operates independently on each identified non-white segment.
    - For each non-white segment:
      - The pixel at the starting index of the segment remains unchanged in the output.
      - The pixel at the ending index of the segment remains unchanged in the output.
      - All pixels within the segment, located between the starting and ending indices, are changed to white (0) in the output.
    - Pixels that were originally white (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output.
    - The color of the endpoints in the output matches the color of the segment in the input.

- description: Relationships
  facts:
    - The position of the endpoints of the non-white segment determines which pixels are modified.
    - The length of the non-white segment must be at least 2 for any change to occur (if length is 1, the start and end are the same, and no pixels are 'between'). If the length is 2, the start and end pixels are kept, and there are no pixels between them to change. If the length is greater than 2, the inner pixels are changed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
3.  For each identified non-white segment:
    a.  Find the starting index and the ending index of the segment.
    b.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
    c.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel value in the output row to white (0).
4.  Return the modified row as the output.
