The array is primarily composed of white pixels (0), with a single contiguous block of non-white pixels embedded within it. In the examples provided, the non-white blocks are gray (5) or magenta (6).\n\nThe output retains the same dimensions as the input. The transformation focuses specifically on the contiguous block of non-white pixels. The core operation is to preserve the first and the last pixel of this non-white block while changing all the pixels *between* them to white (0). The pixels outside this block (the surrounding white pixels) remain unchanged. The color of the non-white block is preserved for the boundary pixels but is irrelevant for identifying the block or performing the transformation logic.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
