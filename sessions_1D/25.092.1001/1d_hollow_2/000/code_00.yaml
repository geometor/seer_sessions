task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D grid)
  pixel_colors_present:
    - white (0)
    - at least one non-white color (e.g., gray(5), magenta(6))
  input_pattern: Contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels.
  output_pattern: Modifies the non-white block from the input, preserving surrounding white pixels.

objects:
  - object_type: non_white_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color of the block (variable across examples).
      - location: Defined by a start index and an end index within the 1D array.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
    relationships:
      - surrounded_by: white pixels (0).

actions:
  - action: identify_block_boundaries
    description: Find the start and end indices of the single contiguous non-white block.
  - action: modify_block_internals
    description: |
      Change the color of pixels within the non-white block.
      Specifically, change all pixels between the start and end index (exclusive) to white (0).
  - action: preserve_block_boundaries
    description: |
      Keep the color of the pixels at the start and end indices of the non-white block unchanged.
      This applies only if the block length is greater than 0. If the length is 1 or 2, all block pixels are effectively boundary pixels.

transformation_rule:
  - Find the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input array.
  - Determine the start and end indices of this block.
  - If such a block exists and its length is greater than 2:
    - Create the output array as a copy of the input array.
    - Iterate from the index immediately after the start index up to (but not including) the end index.
    - Set the color of each pixel in this range to white (0) in the output array.
  - If the block length is 1 or 2, the output is identical to the input (as there are no internal pixels to change).
  - If no non-white block exists, the output is identical to the input.
