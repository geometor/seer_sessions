*   **Perception:** The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (single rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels. The transformation modifies this non-white block. Specifically, it preserves the first and last pixels of the block while changing all the interior pixels of the block to white. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged. The color of the non-white block varies between examples (red, green) but is consistent within each example's block.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    2.  Determine the starting column index and the ending column index of this block.
    3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
    4.  Iterate through the column indices starting from one position after the starting index up to one position before the ending index.
    5.  For each index in this range, set the pixel value in the copied grid to white (0).
    6.  The resulting grid is the output.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` strongly indicates that the testing environment passed the input grid as a NumPy array, and the previous code attempted to evaluate this array directly in a boolean context (specifically in the initial `if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:` check). Standard Python `if` statements require a single boolean value, while evaluating a multi-element NumPy array for truthiness is ambiguous.

The core logic of identifying the non-white block and replacing its interior with white pixels appears correct based on the examples. The strategy for resolving the error is to:
1.  Modify the code to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs, likely by converting the input to a NumPy array if it isn't already.
2.  Replace the problematic boolean check with NumPy-compatible methods (e.g., checking `.size` or `.shape`).
3.  Perform the array manipulations using NumPy operations for clarity and potentially better performance.
4.  Ensure the helper function `find_block_indices` also works correctly with NumPy arrays or create a NumPy-specific version.
5.  Convert the final result back to the standard list-of-lists format expected by the ARC environment before returning.

**Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Non-white Block: Color Red (2), indices [2, 7], length 6.
    *   Transformation: Keep index 2 (Red), keep index 7 (Red), set indices 3, 4, 5, 6 to White (0).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Non-white Block: Color Green (3), indices [4, 8], length 5.
    *   Transformation: Keep index 4 (Green), keep index 8 (Green), set indices 5, 6, 7 to White (0).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Grid: `[[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Output Grid: `[[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Non-white Block: Color Red (2), indices [0, 6], length 7.
    *   Transformation: Keep index 0 (Red), keep index 6 (Red), set indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to White (0).

**Communalities:**
*   All grids are 1x11.
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color.
*   The transformation preserves the dimensions and the surrounding white pixels.
*   The core action is to "hollow out" the non-white block, keeping only its endpoints.
*   The length of the block determines the extent of the hollowing. Blocks of length 1 or 2 would have no interior to hollow out.

  - contains_single_object: true
    object_type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    object_color: non-white (uniform color within the block, varies between examples)
    object_location: surrounded by white pixels (0), or adjacent to grid edge if block starts/ends there.
    object_properties:
      - start_index: column index of the first pixel
      - end_index: column index of the last pixel

      conditions: applies only if block length >= 3
      details:
        - Pixels at start_index and end_index retain their original color.
        - Pixels at indices from start_index + 1 to end_index - 1 are changed to white (0).
        - If block length is 1 or 2, the block remains unchanged.
relationship: The output is derived by identifying the extent of the non-white block in the input and selectively changing its interior pixels (if any) to white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within the row. Determine its starting column index (`start`) and ending column index (`end`).
3.  If no non-white block is found, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  Calculate the length of the block (`length = end - start + 1`).
5.  If the block length is less than 3 (i.e., the block has only one or two pixels), return the input grid unchanged, as there are no interior pixels to modify.
6.  If the block length is 3 or more:
    a.  Create a copy of the input grid.
    b.  Iterate through the column indices from `start + 1` up to (but not including) `end`.
    c.  For each index in this range, set the pixel value in the copied grid to white (0).
    d.  Return the modified grid.
