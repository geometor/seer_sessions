task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_features:
  - contains_single_object: true
    object_type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    object_color: non-white (uniform color within the block, varies between examples)
    object_location: surrounded by white pixels (0), or adjacent to grid edge if block starts/ends there.
    object_properties:
      - start_index: column index of the first pixel
      - end_index: column index of the last pixel
      - length: (end_index - start_index + 1)
output_features:
  - preserves_grid_dimensions: true
  - preserves_white_pixels: true (pixels outside the original block)
  - modifies_object:
      action: hollow_out_block
      conditions: applies only if block length >= 3
      details:
        - Pixels at start_index and end_index retain their original color.
        - Pixels at indices from start_index + 1 to end_index - 1 are changed to white (0).
        - If block length is 1 or 2, the block remains unchanged.
relationship: The output is derived by identifying the extent of the non-white block in the input and selectively changing its interior pixels (if any) to white.
