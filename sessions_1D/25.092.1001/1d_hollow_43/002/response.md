**General Assessment:**

The error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` strongly indicates that the testing environment passed the input grid as a NumPy array, and the previous code attempted to evaluate this array directly in a boolean context (specifically in the initial `if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:` check). Standard Python `if` statements require a single boolean value, while evaluating a multi-element NumPy array for truthiness is ambiguous.

The core logic of identifying the non-white block and replacing its interior with white pixels appears correct based on the examples. The strategy for resolving the error is to:
1.  Modify the code to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs, likely by converting the input to a NumPy array if it isn't already.
2.  Replace the problematic boolean check with NumPy-compatible methods (e.g., checking `.size` or `.shape`).
3.  Perform the array manipulations using NumPy operations for clarity and potentially better performance.
4.  Ensure the helper function `find_block_indices` also works correctly with NumPy arrays or create a NumPy-specific version.
5.  Convert the final result back to the standard list-of-lists format expected by the ARC environment before returning.

**Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Non-white Block: Color Red (2), indices [2, 7], length 6.
    *   Transformation: Keep index 2 (Red), keep index 7 (Red), set indices 3, 4, 5, 6 to White (0).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Non-white Block: Color Green (3), indices [4, 8], length 5.
    *   Transformation: Keep index 4 (Green), keep index 8 (Green), set indices 5, 6, 7 to White (0).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Grid: `[[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Output Grid: `[[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)
    *   Non-white Block: Color Red (2), indices [0, 6], length 7.
    *   Transformation: Keep index 0 (Red), keep index 6 (Red), set indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to White (0).

**Communalities:**
*   All grids are 1x11.
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color.
*   The transformation preserves the dimensions and the surrounding white pixels.
*   The core action is to "hollow out" the non-white block, keeping only its endpoints.
*   The length of the block determines the extent of the hollowing. Blocks of length 1 or 2 would have no interior to hollow out.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_features:
  - contains_single_object: true
    object_type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    object_color: non-white (uniform color within the block, varies between examples)
    object_location: surrounded by white pixels (0), or adjacent to grid edge if block starts/ends there.
    object_properties:
      - start_index: column index of the first pixel
      - end_index: column index of the last pixel
      - length: (end_index - start_index + 1)
output_features:
  - preserves_grid_dimensions: true
  - preserves_white_pixels: true (pixels outside the original block)
  - modifies_object:
      action: hollow_out_block
      conditions: applies only if block length >= 3
      details:
        - Pixels at start_index and end_index retain their original color.
        - Pixels at indices from start_index + 1 to end_index - 1 are changed to white (0).
        - If block length is 1 or 2, the block remains unchanged.
relationship: The output is derived by identifying the extent of the non-white block in the input and selectively changing its interior pixels (if any) to white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within the row. Determine its starting column index (`start`) and ending column index (`end`).
3.  If no non-white block is found, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  Calculate the length of the block (`length = end - start + 1`).
5.  If the block length is less than 3 (i.e., the block has only one or two pixels), return the input grid unchanged, as there are no interior pixels to modify.
6.  If the block length is 3 or more:
    a.  Create a copy of the input grid.
    b.  Iterate through the column indices from `start + 1` up to (but not including) `end`.
    c.  For each index in this range, set the pixel value in the copied grid to white (0).
    d.  Return the modified grid.
