            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` strongly indicates that the testing environment passed the input grid as a NumPy array, and the previous code attempted to evaluate this array directly in a boolean context (specifically in the initial `if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:` check). Standard Python `if` statements require a single boolean value, while evaluating a multi-element NumPy array for truthiness is ambiguous.\n\nThe core logic of identifying the non-white block and replacing its interior with white pixels appears correct based on the examples. The strategy for resolving the error is to:\n1.  Modify the code to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs, likely by converting the input to a NumPy array if it isn't already.\n2.  Replace the problematic boolean check with NumPy-compatible methods (e.g., checking `.size` or `.shape`).\n3.  Perform the array manipulations using NumPy operations for clarity and potentially better performance.\n4.  Ensure the helper function `find_block_indices` also works correctly with NumPy arrays or create a NumPy-specific version.\n5.  Convert the final result back to the standard list-of-lists format expected by the ARC environment before returning.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)\n    *   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)\n    *   Non-white Block: Color Red (2), indices [2, 7], length 6.\n    *   Transformation: Keep index 2 (Red), keep index 7 (Red), set indices 3, 4, 5, 6 to White (0).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]]` (1x11)\n    *   Output Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]` (1x11)\n    *   Non-white Block: Color Green (3), indices [4, 8], length 5.\n    *   Transformation: Keep index 4 (Green), keep index 8 (Green), set indices 5, 6, 7 to White (0).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Grid: `[[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)\n    *   Output Grid: `[[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1x11)\n    *   Non-white Block: Color Red (2), indices [0, 6], length 7.\n    *   Transformation: Keep index 0 (Red), keep index 6 (Red), set indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to White (0).\n\n**Communalities:**\n*   All grids are 1x11.\n*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color.\n*   The transformation preserves the dimensions and the surrounding white pixels.\n*   The core action is to \"hollow out\" the non-white block, keeping only its endpoints.\n*   The length of the block determines the extent of the hollowing. Blocks of length 1 or 2 would have no interior to hollow out.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
