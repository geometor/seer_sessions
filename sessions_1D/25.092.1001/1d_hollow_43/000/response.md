*   **Perception:** The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (single rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels. The transformation modifies this non-white block. Specifically, it preserves the first and last pixels of the block while changing all the interior pixels of the block to white. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged. The color of the non-white block varies between examples (red, green) but is consistent within each example's block.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    input_features:
      - contains_single_contiguous_block: true
        block_color: non-white (color varies, e.g., red, green)
        block_location: surrounded by white pixels (0)
    output_features:
      - preserves_grid_dimensions: true
      - preserves_surrounding_white_pixels: true
      - modifies_non_white_block:
          action: keep_endpoints_blank_middle
          details: The first and last pixels of the original non-white block retain their color and position. All pixels between the first and last pixel of the original block are changed to white (0).
    relationship: The output is derived by identifying the extent of the non-white block in the input and selectively changing its interior pixels to white.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    2.  Determine the starting column index and the ending column index of this block.
    3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
    4.  Iterate through the column indices starting from one position after the starting index up to one position before the ending index.
    5.  For each index in this range, set the pixel value in the copied grid to white (0).
    6.  The resulting grid is the output.
