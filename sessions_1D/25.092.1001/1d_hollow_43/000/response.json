The transformation modifies this non-white block. Specifically, it preserves the first and last pixels of the block while changing all the interior pixels of the block to white. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged. The color of the non-white block varies between examples (red, green) but is consistent within each example's block.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
