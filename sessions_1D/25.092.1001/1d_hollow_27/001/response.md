"""
Identifies a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid.
Creates an output grid of the same size, initially all white.
Places the color of the identified segment at the starting and ending positions of that segment in the output grid.
All other pixels in the output grid remain white.
If the segment has length 1, only that single position is colored in the output.
