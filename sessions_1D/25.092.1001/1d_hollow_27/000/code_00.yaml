Examples:
  - ID: train_1
    Input: A row with a segment of 5 blue pixels.
    Output: The first and last pixels of the blue segment remain blue, the pixels between them become white.
  - ID: train_2
    Input: A row with a segment of 7 orange pixels.
    Output: The first and last pixels of the orange segment remain orange, the pixels between them become white.
  - ID: train_3
    Input: A row with a segment of 4 blue pixels.
    Output: The first and last pixels of the blue segment remain blue, the pixels between them become white.

Input Structure:
  - Type: 1D grid (row vector)
  - Content: Contains exactly one contiguous segment of a single non-white color. The rest are white (0).
  - Object: The contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
    - Properties:
      - Color (variable, e.g., blue, orange)
      - Length (variable, e.g., 5, 7, 4)
      - Start Index
      - End Index

Output Structure:
  - Type: 1D grid (row vector) of the same size as the input.
  - Content: Primarily white pixels (0). Contains at most two non-white pixels.
  - Transformation:
    - Identify the non-white segment in the input.
    - Determine its color, start index, and end index.
    - Create an output grid filled with white (0).
    - Place the identified color at the start index in the output grid.
    - If the start index is different from the end index (i.e., the segment length is greater than 1), place the identified color at the end index in the output grid as well.

Relationships:
  - The output grid size is identical to the input grid size.
  - The non-white color in the output is the same as the non-white color in the input segment.
  - The positions of the non-white pixels in the output correspond to the start and end positions of the non-white segment in the input.
  - All other pixels in the output are white (0).
