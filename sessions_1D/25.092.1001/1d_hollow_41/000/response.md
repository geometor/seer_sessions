Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains a single horizontal segment (a contiguous block) of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation modifies this non-white segment while leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged. Specifically, it retains only the start and end pixels of the non-white segment, changing all the pixels *between* the start and end pixels to white. The color of the segment itself varies across examples (red, green, azure).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 1D Array (single row)
  - Size: Variable width (e.g., 1x23 in examples)
  - Background_Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Name: Color_Segment
    Description: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Varies (e.g., Red(2), Green(3), Azure(8))
      - Start_Index: The column index where the segment begins.
      - End_Index: The column index where the segment ends.
      - Length: (End_Index - Start_Index + 1)

Transformation:
  - Input: Grid containing one Color_Segment surrounded by White pixels.
  - Output: Grid of the same dimensions.
  - Action:
    - Identify the Color_Segment (find its Start_Index and End_Index).
    - Preserve the pixel at Start_Index in the output grid.
    - Preserve the pixel at End_Index in the output grid.
    - Set all pixels between Start_Index + 1 and End_Index - 1 (inclusive) to White (0) in the output grid.
    - Keep all pixels outside the original Color_Segment (the surrounding White pixels) unchanged in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row).
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Iterate through the input row to find the first non-white pixel. Record its index (start\_index) and color.
4.  Iterate through the input row starting from the end to find the last non-white pixel. Record its index (end\_index).
5.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at start\_index to the output grid at start\_index.
6.  If the start\_index is different from the end\_index, copy the pixel value from the input grid at end\_index to the output grid at end\_index.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
