Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 1D Array (single row)
  - Size: Variable width (e.g., 1x23 in examples)
  - Background_Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Name: Color_Segment
    Description: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Varies (e.g., Red(2), Green(3), Azure(8))
      - Start_Index: The column index where the segment begins.
      - End_Index: The column index where the segment ends.
      - Length: (End_Index - Start_Index + 1)

Transformation:
  - Input: Grid containing one Color_Segment surrounded by White pixels.
  - Output: Grid of the same dimensions.
  - Action:
    - Identify the Color_Segment (find its Start_Index and End_Index).
    - Preserve the pixel at Start_Index in the output grid.
    - Preserve the pixel at End_Index in the output grid.
    - Set all pixels between Start_Index + 1 and End_Index - 1 (inclusive) to White (0) in the output grid.
    - Keep all pixels outside the original Color_Segment (the surrounding White pixels) unchanged in the output grid.
