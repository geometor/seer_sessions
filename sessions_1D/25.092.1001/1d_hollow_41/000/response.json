Each input grid contains a single horizontal segment (a contiguous block) of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation modifies this non-white segment while leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged. Specifically, it retains only the start and end pixels of the non-white segment, changing all the pixels *between* the start and end pixels to white. The color of the segment itself varies across examples (red, green, azure).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
