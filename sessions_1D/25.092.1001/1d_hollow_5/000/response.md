Okay, let's analyze the task.

## Perception

The input and output are single rows of pixels (1D grids). Each example contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white (0) pixels. The transformation modifies this block. Specifically, it retains the first and last pixels of the non-white block while changing all the pixels *between* the first and last pixels to white (0). The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation
dimensionality: 1D
input_characteristics:
  - Single row array.
  - Contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color.
  - The non-white block is surrounded by white (0) pixels.
output_characteristics:
  - Single row array, same dimensions as input.
  - Contains the same non-white color as the input.
  - The non-white pixels form two points: the start and end positions of the original contiguous block.
  - Pixels between the start and end positions of the original block are changed to white (0).
  - Pixels outside the original block remain white (0).
transformation:
  - Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - Keep the first pixel of the block.
  - Keep the last pixel of the block.
  - Change all pixels between the first and last pixels of the block to white (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input row to find the start index and end index of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
2.  Create a new row that is a copy of the input row.
3.  Iterate from the index immediately *after* the start index up to (but not including) the end index.
4.  For each index in this range, set the pixel value in the new row to white (0).
5.  The resulting new row is the output.
