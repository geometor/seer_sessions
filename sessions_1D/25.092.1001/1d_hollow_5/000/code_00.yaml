task_type: array_manipulation
dimensionality: 1D
input_characteristics:
  - Single row array.
  - Contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color.
  - The non-white block is surrounded by white (0) pixels.
output_characteristics:
  - Single row array, same dimensions as input.
  - Contains the same non-white color as the input.
  - The non-white pixels form two points: the start and end positions of the original contiguous block.
  - Pixels between the start and end positions of the original block are changed to white (0).
  - Pixels outside the original block remain white (0).
transformation:
  - Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - Keep the first pixel of the block.
  - Keep the last pixel of the block.
  - Change all pixels between the first and last pixels of the block to white (0).
