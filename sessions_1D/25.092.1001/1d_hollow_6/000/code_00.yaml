task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: input_array
    description: A 1D array containing pixels.
  - type: output_array
    description: A 1D array derived from the input array, having the same length.
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels within the input array. Assumed to be unique per input based on examples.
    properties:
      - color: The color (non-zero value) of the pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel of the block.
      - end_index: The index of the last pixel of the block.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
  - type: background
    description: Pixels with the white color (value 0) in the input array, typically surrounding the block.
transformation:
  - action: identify_block
    description: Find the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input array. Determine its color, start index, and end index.
  - action: modify_block
    description: Create the output array based on the input array.
    steps:
      - Keep all white background pixels from the input unchanged in the output.
      - Keep the pixel at the start_index of the block unchanged in the output.
      - Keep the pixel at the end_index of the block unchanged in the output.
      - Change all pixels within the block (from start_index + 1 to end_index - 1) to white (0) in the output.
relationship: The output array is constructed by preserving the start and end points of the identified non-white block from the input, changing the interior of the block to white, and preserving the surrounding white background pixels.
