Each input array contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6', green '3') surrounded by white pixels ('0'). The transformation modifies this non-white block. In the output, only the first and the last pixel of the original non-white block retain their color. All the pixels that were originally between the first and last pixel of the block are changed to white ('0'). The white pixels outside the original block remain unchanged. The length of the output array is identical to the length of the input array.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
