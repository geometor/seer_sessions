Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The task uses 1x30 grids (single rows of 30 pixels).
2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0), orange (7), and blue (1).
3.  **Key Feature:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color. This segment is surrounded by white pixels or extends to the grid boundaries.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies this non-white segment. In the output grid, only the *first* and *last* pixels of this segment retain their original color. All other pixels in the output grid become white (0).
5.  **Consistency:** The color of the non-white segment in the input is preserved for the two endpoint pixels in the output. The size and shape of the grid remain unchanged (1x30).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - shape: [1, 30] # All examples are 1 row, 30 columns
    - constant_shape: true # Output shape matches input shape
  colors_used:
    - white: 0
    - orange: 7
    - blue: 1
  input_features:
    - contains_single_contiguous_non_white_segment: true
    - segment_color: Varies (orange or blue in examples)
    - segment_position: Varies
    - segment_length: Varies
  output_features:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - retains_segment_endpoints: true
    - number_of_colored_pixels: 2 (unless segment length is 1)
    - endpoint_color: Matches the input segment color
transformation_details:
  operation: Identify segment endpoints
  steps:
    - Find the first index (leftmost) of a non-white pixel.
    - Find the last index (rightmost) of a non-white pixel.
    - Determine the color of the non-white segment.
    - Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initialized to white (0).
    - Set the pixel at the first index in the output grid to the segment color.
    - Set the pixel at the last index in the output grid to the segment color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but set all pixel values to white (0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right to find the index and color of the first non-white pixel encountered. Store this index as `start_index` and the color as `segment_color`. If no non-white pixel is found, the output remains all white.
3.  Iterate through the input grid from right to left to find the index of the first non-white pixel encountered. Store this index as `end_index`. (The color will be the same `segment_color`).
4.  In the output grid, set the pixel at `start_index` to `segment_color`.
5.  In the output grid, set the pixel at `end_index` to `segment_color`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
