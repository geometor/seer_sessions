This segment is surrounded by white pixels or extends to the grid boundaries.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies this non-white segment. In the output grid, only the *first* and *last* pixels of this segment retain their original color. All other pixels in the output grid become white (0).\n5.  **Consistency:** The color of the non-white segment in the input is preserved for the two endpoint pixels in the output. The size and shape of the grid remain unchanged (1x30).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
