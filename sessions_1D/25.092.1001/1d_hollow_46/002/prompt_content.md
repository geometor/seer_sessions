import copy

"""
Retain only the endpoints of a single contiguous non-white horizontal segment.
1.  Identify the contiguous block (segment) of non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Find the starting index and the ending index of this segment.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
4.  Copy the pixel value (color) from the input row at the starting index of the segment to the same index in the output row.
5.  Copy the pixel value (color) from the input row at the ending index of the segment to the same index in the output row.
6.  The resulting row is the final output. Assumes the input is effectively 1D or operates only on the first row if multiple rows exist.
