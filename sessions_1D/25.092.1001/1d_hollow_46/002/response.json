            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed due to a `ValueError` indicating ambiguity in evaluating the truthiness of an array, likely a NumPy array passed by the test harness instead of the expected list of lists. The core logic identified (find the non-white segment, keep only its start and end points) appears correct based on the visual transformation in the examples. The strategy is to modify the code to be robust to the input data type, potentially by converting NumPy arrays to lists or using safer checks, while retaining the core transformation logic focused on the first row.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the provided examples:\n\n*   **Input/Output Structure:** All examples show a single row (1D array) being transformed into another single row of the same length. The execution environment might represent this as a 2D grid with one row (e.g., `[[...]]`). The code error suggests the input format might be a NumPy array.\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 1x26 (assuming represented as a single row)\n    *   Segment: Color 8 (azure), Indices 3-13 (Length 11)\n    *   Output: Keep index 3 (8), index 13 (8), others 0. Correctly matches rule.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 1x26\n    *   Segment: Color 2 (red), Indices 7-11 (Length 5)\n    *   Output: Keep index 7 (2), index 11 (2), others 0. Correctly matches rule.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 1x26\n    *   Segment: Color 8 (azure), Indices 10-13 (Length 4)\n    *   Output: Keep index 10 (8), index 13 (8), others 0. Correctly matches rule.\n\n**Observations:**\n*   The transformation consistently operates on a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels within what appears to be the first (and only) row of the input.\n*   The rule is to preserve the color and position of the very first and very last pixel of this segment and change all other pixels (including those within the original segment) to white (0).\n*   The background (pixels outside the segment) remains white (0).\n*   The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. If the input had multiple rows, the current logic assumes only the first row is processed, and other rows in the output would be white.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
