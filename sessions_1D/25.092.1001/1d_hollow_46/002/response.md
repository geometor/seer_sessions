## General Assessment

The previous code failed due to a `ValueError` indicating ambiguity in evaluating the truthiness of an array, likely a NumPy array passed by the test harness instead of the expected list of lists. The core logic identified (find the non-white segment, keep only its start and end points) appears correct based on the visual transformation in the examples. The strategy is to modify the code to be robust to the input data type, potentially by converting NumPy arrays to lists or using safer checks, while retaining the core transformation logic focused on the first row.

## Metrics

Based on the provided examples:

*   **Input/Output Structure:** All examples show a single row (1D array) being transformed into another single row of the same length. The execution environment might represent this as a 2D grid with one row (e.g., `[[...]]`). The code error suggests the input format might be a NumPy array.
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 1x26 (assuming represented as a single row)
    *   Segment: Color 8 (azure), Indices 3-13 (Length 11)
    *   Output: Keep index 3 (8), index 13 (8), others 0. Correctly matches rule.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 1x26
    *   Segment: Color 2 (red), Indices 7-11 (Length 5)
    *   Output: Keep index 7 (2), index 11 (2), others 0. Correctly matches rule.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 1x26
    *   Segment: Color 8 (azure), Indices 10-13 (Length 4)
    *   Output: Keep index 10 (8), index 13 (8), others 0. Correctly matches rule.

**Observations:**
*   The transformation consistently operates on a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels within what appears to be the first (and only) row of the input.
*   The rule is to preserve the color and position of the very first and very last pixel of this segment and change all other pixels (including those within the original segment) to white (0).
*   The background (pixels outside the segment) remains white (0).
*   The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. If the input had multiple rows, the current logic assumes only the first row is processed, and other rows in the output would be white.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Retain only the endpoints of a single contiguous non-white horizontal segment found in the first row of the input grid.
objects:
  - type: grid # Input and Output are 2D grids, though examples primarily show transformation on the first row.
    properties:
      - dimensions: height (number of rows), width (number of columns)
      - pixels: 2D array of color values (0-9)
  - type: segment # A contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within a single row.
    properties:
      - row_index: The index of the row containing the segment (assumed to be 0 based on examples).
      - color: The single non-white color of the segment (e.g., azure, red).
      - start_column_index: The column index of the first pixel in the segment.
      - end_column_index: The column index of the last pixel in the segment.
      - length: Number of pixels in the segment (end_column_index - start_column_index + 1).
actions:
  - identify_input_properties: Determine the dimensions (height, width) of the input grid.
  - locate_segment: Scan the first row (index 0) of the input grid to find the single contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
  - identify_segment_properties: Determine the color, start_column_index, and end_column_index of the segment found in the first row. Handle the case where no segment exists.
  - create_output_grid: Generate a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
  - preserve_endpoints: If a segment was found in the first row of the input:
      - Copy the pixel color from the input grid at `[0][start_column_index]` to the output grid at the same position.
      - Copy the pixel color from the input grid at `[0][end_column_index]` to the output grid at the same position. (Note: If segment length is 1, start and end indices are the same, correctly placing one pixel).
relationships:
  - input_output_dimensions: The output grid must have the same height and width as the input grid.
  - modification_rule: The output grid is identical to an all-white grid of the same dimensions, except that the first and last pixels of the non-white segment found in the *first row* of the input grid retain their original color and position in the first row of the output grid. All other pixels in the output grid are white (0).
assumptions:
  - Only one non-white contiguous segment exists in the first row.
  - The transformation logic only applies to the first row. Other rows, if present in the input, do not affect the output (output rows other than the first remain white).
  - Input data might be provided as a NumPy array, requiring handling or conversion.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid. Note its dimensions (height and width).
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Examine the first row (row index 0) of the input grid.
4.  Find the contiguous sequence (segment) of non-white pixels within this first row.
5.  If such a segment exists:
    a.  Identify the column index of the first pixel of the segment (start index).
    b.  Identify the column index of the last pixel of the segment (end index).
    c.  Determine the color of the pixels in the segment (they all have the same color).
    d.  In the output grid, set the pixel at `[row 0, column start_index]` to the segment's color.
    e.  In the output grid, set the pixel at `[row 0, column end_index]` to the segment's color.
6.  If no non-white segment is found in the first row, the output grid remains entirely white.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
