For each row, find the first and last non-white pixels, which define the span of a contiguous block (assuming only one block per row). Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with white (0). For each row in the output grid corresponding to a row with a block in the input:\n1. Set the pixel at the starting column index of the block to the block's original color.\n2. Set the pixel at the ending column index of the block to the block's original color.\n3. All other pixels in that output row (between the start and end, and outside the start/end) remain white (0).\nIf a row in the input grid contains no non-white pixels, the corresponding row in the output grid remains all white (0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_block_endpoints(row: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int | None, int | None, int | None]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start index, end index, and color of the contiguous non-white block in a row.\n\n    Args:\n        row: A 1D NumPy array representing a row of the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (start_index, end_index, color).
