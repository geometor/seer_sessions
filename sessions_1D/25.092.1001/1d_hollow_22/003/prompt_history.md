*   **Perception:** The input and output are 1D arrays (or single rows/columns of a 2D grid) of pixels. Each input contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (yellow or green) surrounded by white pixels. The transformation modifies this block. Specifically, it keeps the first and last pixel of the block unchanged, while changing all the pixels *between* the first and last pixels to white (0). Pixels outside the original block remain white.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input array to find the first and last indices of the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (the "block"). Note the color of this block.
    2.  Create a new output array of the same size as the input, initially filled with white pixels (0).
    3.  Copy all white pixels from the input array to the corresponding positions in the output array.
    4.  If a non-white block was found:
        a.  Place the block's original color at the starting index of the block in the output array.
        b.  Place the block's original color at the ending index of the block in the output array.
        c.  Ensure all positions in the output array strictly between the starting and ending indices of the block are filled with white pixels (0).

## General Assessment and Strategy

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests that the `transform` function, designed to work on a Python `List[int]`, was actually called with a NumPy array during testing. Specifically, the condition `if pixel != 0:` inside the helper function `find_non_white_block_indices` likely received an array (a row of the grid) instead of a single integer pixel value, causing the error when the resulting boolean array was used in the `if` statement.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Adapt to NumPy:** Modify the code to accept and process NumPy arrays, which are the standard format for ARC grids. Assume the input `input_grid` to `transform` will be a 2D NumPy array.
2.  **Row-wise Processing:** Since the examples provided seem to represent single rows (or the transformation clearly operates independently on rows), the logic should iterate through each row of the input grid (if there are multiple rows) or process the single row if the grid is 1xN.
3.  **NumPy Operations:** Utilize NumPy functions like `np.where` to efficiently find the indices of non-white pixels, which simplifies finding the start and end of the block.
4.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the use of NumPy grids and row-wise processing.

## Metrics

Based on the initial examples and confirmed with code execution:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
    *   Block Info: Color=4 (yellow), Start=5, End=8, Length=4
    *   Expected Output Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
    *   Block Info: Color=3 (green), Start=9, End=12, Length=4
    *   Expected Output Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0]`
    *   Block Info: Color=3 (green), Start=12, End=19, Length=8
    *   Expected Output Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0]`

**Key Observation:** The transformation preserves the first and last pixel of a contiguous non-white block within a row, setting all intermediate pixels within that block to white (0). Pixels outside the block remain unchanged (white in these examples). The logic holds for blocks of length >= 2. Blocks of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged by this rule.

  - properties:
      - Each row contains at most one contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white color.

      - Examples provided show grids with a single row.

  - steps:
      - For each row in the input grid:
          - Identify the start and end column indices of the contiguous non-white block, if present. Note its color.
          - Create a corresponding output row, initially identical to the input row or filled with white pixels.
          - If a block exists:
              - Ensure the pixel at the start index in the output row retains the block's color.
              - Ensure the pixel at the end index in the output row retains the block's color.
              - Set all pixels in the output row strictly between the start and end indices to white (0).
          - Pixels outside the original block's span (before start index, after end index) remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row:
    a.  Find the column indices of all non-white pixels in the current row.
    b.  If no non-white pixels are found, the corresponding row in the output grid remains all white (or copy the input row if it might contain non-white pixels outside blocks, though examples only show white). Proceed to the next row.
    c.  If non-white pixels are found, determine the index of the first non-white pixel (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-white pixel (`end_index`). Record the color of the pixel at `start_index` (assuming a single-color block as per examples).
    d.  Copy the pixel value (the block's color) from the input row at `start_index` to the output grid at the same row and `start_index`.
    e.  Copy the pixel value (the block's color) from the input row at `end_index` to the output grid at the same row and `end_index`.
    f.  Ensure all pixels in the output grid row between `start_index` (exclusive) and `end_index` (exclusive) are set to white (0). Pixels before `start_index` and after `end_index` remain white (0).
3.  Return the completed output grid.
