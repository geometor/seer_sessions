## General Assessment and Strategy

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests that the `transform` function, designed to work on a Python `List[int]`, was actually called with a NumPy array during testing. Specifically, the condition `if pixel != 0:` inside the helper function `find_non_white_block_indices` likely received an array (a row of the grid) instead of a single integer pixel value, causing the error when the resulting boolean array was used in the `if` statement.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Adapt to NumPy:** Modify the code to accept and process NumPy arrays, which are the standard format for ARC grids. Assume the input `input_grid` to `transform` will be a 2D NumPy array.
2.  **Row-wise Processing:** Since the examples provided seem to represent single rows (or the transformation clearly operates independently on rows), the logic should iterate through each row of the input grid (if there are multiple rows) or process the single row if the grid is 1xN.
3.  **NumPy Operations:** Utilize NumPy functions like `np.where` to efficiently find the indices of non-white pixels, which simplifies finding the start and end of the block.
4.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the use of NumPy grids and row-wise processing.

## Metrics

Based on the initial examples and confirmed with code execution:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
    *   Block Info: Color=4 (yellow), Start=5, End=8, Length=4
    *   Expected Output Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
    *   Block Info: Color=3 (green), Start=9, End=12, Length=4
    *   Expected Output Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0]`
    *   Block Info: Color=3 (green), Start=12, End=19, Length=8
    *   Expected Output Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0]`

**Key Observation:** The transformation preserves the first and last pixel of a contiguous non-white block within a row, setting all intermediate pixels within that block to white (0). Pixels outside the block remain unchanged (white in these examples). The logic holds for blocks of length >= 2. Blocks of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged by this rule.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_features:
  - description: A 2D grid (NumPy array) of pixels.
  - properties:
      - Each row contains at most one contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white color.
      - Non-white blocks are surrounded horizontally by white pixels (0).
      - Examples provided show grids with a single row.
output_features:
  - description: A 2D grid (NumPy array) of the same dimensions as the input.
  - properties:
      - Derived from the input grid by modifying rows containing non-white blocks.
transformation:
  - description: Modifies each row containing a contiguous non-white block independently.
  - steps:
      - For each row in the input grid:
          - Identify the start and end column indices of the contiguous non-white block, if present. Note its color.
          - Create a corresponding output row, initially identical to the input row or filled with white pixels.
          - If a block exists:
              - Ensure the pixel at the start index in the output row retains the block's color.
              - Ensure the pixel at the end index in the output row retains the block's color.
              - Set all pixels in the output row strictly between the start and end indices to white (0).
          - Pixels outside the original block's span (before start index, after end index) remain unchanged.
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static background within each row.
  - id: block
    color: non-white (e.g., yellow (4), green (3))
    shape: contiguous horizontal segment within a row.
    role: object being modified.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The non-white block is embedded horizontally within the white background of a row.
actions:
  - action: identify_row_block
    target: a row of the input grid
    output: start index, end index, color of the block (or indication of no block)
  - action: modify_row_block
    target: block identified in the row
    result: A modified row segment where only the first and last pixels of the original block retain their color, and intermediate pixels become white (0).
  - action: construct_output_row
    input: original row, identified block info, modification rule
    output: the transformed output row.
  - action: assemble_output_grid
    input: transformed output rows
    output: the final output grid.
constraints:
  - Each row is processed independently.
  - Assumes at most one contiguous non-white block per row based on examples.
  - Block modification (setting intermediate pixels to white) only applies if the block length is 3 or more. Blocks of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row:
    a.  Find the column indices of all non-white pixels in the current row.
    b.  If no non-white pixels are found, the corresponding row in the output grid remains all white (or copy the input row if it might contain non-white pixels outside blocks, though examples only show white). Proceed to the next row.
    c.  If non-white pixels are found, determine the index of the first non-white pixel (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-white pixel (`end_index`). Record the color of the pixel at `start_index` (assuming a single-color block as per examples).
    d.  Copy the pixel value (the block's color) from the input row at `start_index` to the output grid at the same row and `start_index`.
    e.  Copy the pixel value (the block's color) from the input row at `end_index` to the output grid at the same row and `end_index`.
    f.  Ensure all pixels in the output grid row between `start_index` (exclusive) and `end_index` (exclusive) are set to white (0). Pixels before `start_index` and after `end_index` remain white (0).
3.  Return the completed output grid.
