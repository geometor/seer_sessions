task_type: grid_transformation
input_features:
  - description: A 2D grid (NumPy array) of pixels.
  - properties:
      - Each row contains at most one contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white color.
      - Non-white blocks are surrounded horizontally by white pixels (0).
      - Examples provided show grids with a single row.
output_features:
  - description: A 2D grid (NumPy array) of the same dimensions as the input.
  - properties:
      - Derived from the input grid by modifying rows containing non-white blocks.
transformation:
  - description: Modifies each row containing a contiguous non-white block independently.
  - steps:
      - For each row in the input grid:
          - Identify the start and end column indices of the contiguous non-white block, if present. Note its color.
          - Create a corresponding output row, initially identical to the input row or filled with white pixels.
          - If a block exists:
              - Ensure the pixel at the start index in the output row retains the block's color.
              - Ensure the pixel at the end index in the output row retains the block's color.
              - Set all pixels in the output row strictly between the start and end indices to white (0).
          - Pixels outside the original block's span (before start index, after end index) remain unchanged.
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static background within each row.
  - id: block
    color: non-white (e.g., yellow (4), green (3))
    shape: contiguous horizontal segment within a row.
    role: object being modified.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The non-white block is embedded horizontally within the white background of a row.
actions:
  - action: identify_row_block
    target: a row of the input grid
    output: start index, end index, color of the block (or indication of no block)
  - action: modify_row_block
    target: block identified in the row
    result: A modified row segment where only the first and last pixels of the original block retain their color, and intermediate pixels become white (0).
  - action: construct_output_row
    input: original row, identified block info, modification rule
    output: the transformed output row.
  - action: assemble_output_grid
    input: transformed output rows
    output: the final output grid.
constraints:
  - Each row is processed independently.
  - Assumes at most one contiguous non-white block per row based on examples.
  - Block modification (setting intermediate pixels to white) only applies if the block length is 3 or more. Blocks of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged.
