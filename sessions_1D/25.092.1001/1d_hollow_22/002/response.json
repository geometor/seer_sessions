            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly suggests that the `transform` function, designed to work on a Python `List[int]`, was actually called with a NumPy array during testing. Specifically, the condition `if pixel != 0:` inside the helper function `find_non_white_block_indices` likely received an array (a row of the grid) instead of a single integer pixel value, causing the error when the resulting boolean array was used in the `if` statement.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Adapt to NumPy:** Modify the code to accept and process NumPy arrays, which are the standard format for ARC grids. Assume the input `input_grid` to `transform` will be a 2D NumPy array.\n2.  **Row-wise Processing:** Since the examples provided seem to represent single rows (or the transformation clearly operates independently on rows), the logic should iterate through each row of the input grid (if there are multiple rows) or process the single row if the grid is 1xN.\n3.  **NumPy Operations:** Utilize NumPy functions like `np.where` to efficiently find the indices of non-white pixels, which simplifies finding the start and end of the block.\n4.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the use of NumPy grids and row-wise processing.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the initial examples and confirmed with code execution:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   Block Info: Color=4 (yellow), Start=5, End=8, Length=4\n    *   Expected Output Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   Block Info: Color=3 (green), Start=9, End=12, Length=4\n    *   Expected Output Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0]`\n    *   Block Info: Color=3 (green), Start=12, End=19, Length=8\n    *   Expected Output Row: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0]`\n\n**Key Observation:** The transformation preserves the first and last pixel of a contiguous non-white block within a row, setting all intermediate pixels within that block to white (0). Pixels outside the block remain unchanged (white in these examples). The logic holds for blocks of length >= 2. Blocks of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged by this rule.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
