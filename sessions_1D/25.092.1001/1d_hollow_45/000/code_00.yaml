task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are row vectors
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    count: 1 per input grid
    properties:
      - color: varies (non-white: 5-gray, 8-azure, 3-green in examples)
      - start_index: the column index of the first pixel of the segment
      - end_index: the column index of the last pixel of the segment
      - length: number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1)
transformation:
  - action: identify_segment
    input: input_grid
    output: identified non-white segment (color, start_index, end_index)
  - action: modify_segment
    input: identified segment
    output: modified_grid
    rule:
      - keep the pixel at start_index with its original color
      - keep the pixel at end_index with its original color
      - change all pixels between start_index + 1 and end_index - 1 to the background_color (0)
  - action: preserve_background
    rule: all pixels outside the original segment's range (less than start_index or greater than end_index) remain unchanged (background_color 0).
relationship:
  - the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - the transformation depends only on the single non-white segment found in the input.
  - the color of the endpoints in the output matches the color of the segment in the input.
