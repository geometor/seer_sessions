Each input grid contains exactly one contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color, surrounded by or adjacent to white pixels (color 0). The transformation modifies this colored segment. Specifically, it retains the first and last pixels of the original colored segment in their original positions and color, while changing all the pixels *between* these two endpoints to white (color 0). The pixels outside the original colored segment remain unchanged (they stay white).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
