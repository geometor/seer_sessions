Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input is always a 1-dimensional grid (a single row). Each input grid contains exactly one contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color, surrounded by or adjacent to white pixels (color 0). The transformation modifies this colored segment. Specifically, it retains the first and last pixels of the original colored segment in their original positions and color, while changing all the pixels *between* these two endpoints to white (color 0). The pixels outside the original colored segment remain unchanged (they stay white).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are row vectors
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    count: 1 per input grid
    properties:
      - color: varies (non-white: 5-gray, 8-azure, 3-green in examples)
      - start_index: the column index of the first pixel of the segment
      - end_index: the column index of the last pixel of the segment
      - length: number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1)
transformation:
  - action: identify_segment
    input: input_grid
    output: identified non-white segment (color, start_index, end_index)
  - action: modify_segment
    input: identified segment
    output: modified_grid
    rule:
      - keep the pixel at start_index with its original color
      - keep the pixel at end_index with its original color
      - change all pixels between start_index + 1 and end_index - 1 to the background_color (0)
  - action: preserve_background
    rule: all pixels outside the original segment's range (less than start_index or greater than end_index) remain unchanged (background_color 0).
relationship:
  - the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - the transformation depends only on the single non-white segment found in the input.
  - the color of the endpoints in the output matches the color of the segment in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in the input row grid. Determine its color, its starting column index, and its ending column index.
2.  Create an output row grid of the same size as the input, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Copy the pixel at the starting column index from the input grid (the first pixel of the segment) to the same position in the output grid.
4.  Copy the pixel at the ending column index from the input grid (the last pixel of the segment) to the same position in the output grid.
5.  Ensure all other pixels in the output grid remain the background color (white, 0). (This implicitly handles pixels outside the segment and fills the middle of the segment).
```python
import numpy as np # numpy might be used by the ARC environment, though examples are lists

def transform(input_grid: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """

    Transforms the grid by keeping only the first and last pixels of this segment in their original positions and color,
    changing all pixels between these endpoints to white (0). Pixels outside the original segment remain white (0).
    Assumes input is a flat list of integers representing a single row.
