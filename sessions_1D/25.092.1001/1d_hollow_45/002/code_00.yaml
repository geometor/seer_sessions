task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Confirmed inputs are 2D arrays
grid_shape: (1, N) # All examples have shape 1 row, variable columns (N)
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    count: 1 per input grid (located in the first row)
    properties:
      - color: varies (non-white: 5-gray, 8-azure, 3-green in examples)
      - start_column_index: the column index of the first pixel of the segment
      - end_column_index: the column index of the last pixel of the segment
      - length: number of pixels in the segment (end_column_index - start_column_index + 1)
transformation:
  - action: identify_segment
    input: input_grid (1xN array)
    target: row 0
    output: identified non-white segment (color, start_column_index, end_column_index)
  - action: create_output_grid
    properties:
      - shape: same as input grid (1xN)
      - initial_fill: background_color (0)
  - action: modify_segment_in_output
    input: identified segment properties, output_grid
    output: modified_output_grid
    rule:
      - place the segment's color at position (0, start_column_index) in the output_grid.
      - place the segment's color at position (0, end_column_index) in the output_grid.
      - ensure all other pixels in the output grid remain the background_color (0).
relationship:
  - the output grid has the same dimensions (shape) as the input grid.
  - the transformation depends only on the single non-white segment found in the first row of the input.
  - the color of the endpoints in the output matches the color of the segment in the input.
