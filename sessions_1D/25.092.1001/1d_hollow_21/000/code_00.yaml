task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D, presented as single-row 2D arrays
grid_properties:
  - single_row
objects:
  - type: segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment (e.g., green, orange).
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel in the segment.
      - end_index: The index of the last pixel in the segment.
  - type: background
    definition: Pixels with value 0 (white).
relationships:
  - segments are surrounded by background pixels or grid boundaries.
actions:
  - identify: Locate all contiguous segments of non-white pixels in the input row.
  - modify: For each identified segment:
      - If the segment length is greater than 2:
          - Change the color of all pixels between the start_index and end_index (exclusive) to white (0).
      - Retain the original color of the pixels at the start_index and end_index.
  - preserve: Keep all background (white) pixels unchanged.
invariance:
  - The color of the non-white segment does not affect the transformation logic.
  - The position of the segment within the row does not affect the transformation logic, only its internal structure.
  - The overall length of the row remains the same.
