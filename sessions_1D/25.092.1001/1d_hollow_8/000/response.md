Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input consists of a single row (a 1D array) of pixels. The background is uniformly white (0). Within this row, there is a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels (e.g., green, orange, yellow). The output retains the same dimensions and the white background. The key transformation affects the non-white segment: only the first and last pixels of this segment retain their original color, while all the pixels *between* the first and last are changed to white (0). If the segment has only one or two pixels, all its pixels are retained.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Retain Endpoints of Horizontal Segment

Input:
  - type: grid (1D horizontal array)
  - elements:
    - background_pixels:
      - color: white (0)
      - count: variable
    - foreground_segment:
      - type: contiguous horizontal block
      - color: non-white (variable, e.g., green, orange, yellow)
      - count: >= 1 pixel
      - properties:
        - start_index
        - end_index
        - length

Output:
  - type: grid (1D horizontal array, same dimensions as input)
  - elements:
    - background_pixels:
      - color: white (0)
    - retained_pixels:
      - count: 2 (or 1 if input segment length is 1)
      - location:
        - start_index of the input foreground_segment
        - end_index of the input foreground_segment
      - color: same as the input foreground_segment color

Transformation:
  - action: Identify the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in the input.
  - action: Determine the starting index and ending index of this segment.
  - action: Create an output grid of the same size, initially filled with white (0).
  - action: In the output grid, set the pixel at the starting index to the color of the input segment.
  - action: In the output grid, set the pixel at the ending index to the color of the input segment.
  - note: If the segment length is 1, the start and end indices are the same, resulting in one retained pixel. If the length is 2, both pixels are retained as they are the start and end.

Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions.
  - The locations of the retained non-white pixels correspond to the start and end positions of the original non-white segment.
  - The color of the retained pixels matches the color of the original segment.
  - All other pixels in the output are white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Note the color of this block.
3.  Find the column index of the first pixel (start index) and the last pixel (end index) of this block.
4.  Create a new output row with the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
5.  Set the pixel in the output row at the start index to the noted color.
6.  Set the pixel in the output row at the end index to the noted color. (If the start and end indices are the same, this step effectively does nothing new).
7.  The resulting row is the final output.
