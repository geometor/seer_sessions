Task: Retain Endpoints of Horizontal Segment

Input:
  - type: grid (1D horizontal array)
  - elements:
    - background_pixels:
      - color: white (0)
      - count: variable
    - foreground_segment:
      - type: contiguous horizontal block
      - color: non-white (variable, e.g., green, orange, yellow)
      - count: >= 1 pixel
      - properties:
        - start_index
        - end_index
        - length

Output:
  - type: grid (1D horizontal array, same dimensions as input)
  - elements:
    - background_pixels:
      - color: white (0)
    - retained_pixels:
      - count: 2 (or 1 if input segment length is 1)
      - location:
        - start_index of the input foreground_segment
        - end_index of the input foreground_segment
      - color: same as the input foreground_segment color

Transformation:
  - action: Identify the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in the input.
  - action: Determine the starting index and ending index of this segment.
  - action: Create an output grid of the same size, initially filled with white (0).
  - action: In the output grid, set the pixel at the starting index to the color of the input segment.
  - action: In the output grid, set the pixel at the ending index to the color of the input segment.
  - note: If the segment length is 1, the start and end indices are the same, resulting in one retained pixel. If the length is 2, both pixels are retained as they are the start and end.

Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions.
  - The locations of the retained non-white pixels correspond to the start and end positions of the original non-white segment.
  - The color of the retained pixels matches the color of the original segment.
  - All other pixels in the output are white.
