Within this row, there is a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels (e.g., green, orange, yellow). The output retains the same dimensions and the white background. The key transformation affects the non-white segment: only the first and last pixels of this segment retain their original color, while all the pixels *between* the first and last are changed to white (0). If the segment has only one or two pixels, all its pixels are retained.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
