"""
Transforms a single-row grid by hollowing out contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels longer than two pixels.

Specifically, it identifies contiguous sequences of non-white pixels (segments).
For each segment with a length greater than 2, it retains the first and last pixels
of the segment and changes all the pixels strictly between them to white (0).
Segments of length 1 or 2, and all white pixels, remain unchanged.
