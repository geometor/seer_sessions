elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensionality: 1D (row vector, 1xN)
      input_representation: May be list[list[int]] or numpy.ndarray.
      size: Constant 1x14 in examples.
      content: Contains background pixels and one segment.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: Integer 0-9.
      role:
        - background (white '0')
        - segment_pixel (non-white, non-zero)
  - type: segment
    properties:
      definition: A single, contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
      location: Surrounded by white pixels.
      color: Uniform within the segment, but can vary between grids (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6').
      length: Variable (e.g., 8, 6, 5 pixels in examples).
      structure: Composed of a start_pixel, end_pixel, and optional interior_pixels.

actions:
  - name: ensure_list_format
    inputs: input_grid_row (potentially NumPy array)
    outputs: list_representation_of_row
    description: Convert the input row data structure to a standard Python list for consistent processing.
  - name: locate_segment_endpoints
    inputs: grid_row (list)
    outputs: start_index, end_index
    description: Find the index of the first non-white pixel (start_index) and the last non-white pixel (end_index) in the row. Returns identifiers (e.g., None or -1) if no segment or segment of length < 2 is found.
  - name: preserve_endpoints_and_background
    inputs: input_grid_row (list), start_index, end_index
    outputs: partially_modified_row (list)
    description: Create a copy of the input row. The pixels at start_index and end_index, and all pixels outside the segment (before start_index and after end_index), retain their original colors.
  - name: hollow_segment_interior
    inputs: partially_modified_row (list), start_index, end_index
    outputs: final_output_row (list)
    description: If the segment has interior pixels (i.e., end_index > start_index + 1), change the color of all pixels strictly between start_index and end_index to white ('0'). Otherwise, the row remains unchanged from the previous step.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels within the segment are horizontally contiguous.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output row is derived from the input row by identifying the non-white segment, preserving its first and last pixels and all background pixels, and replacing the segment's interior pixels (if any) with white pixels.
