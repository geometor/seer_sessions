"""
Identifies a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid (row).
Modifies the segment by changing all interior pixels (pixels between the first and last pixel of the segment) to white (0).
The first and last pixels of the segment, and all pixels outside the segment, remain unchanged.
