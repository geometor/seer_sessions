elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
      size: 1x14 (constant across examples)
  - type: segment
    properties:
      definition: A contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
      occurrence: Exactly one per input grid.
      color: Variable (e.g., gray '5', magenta '6').
      location: Surrounded by white ('0') pixels.
      length: Variable (e.g., 8 in train_1, 6 in train_2, 5 in train_3).
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: Integer 0-9, representing specific colors.
      role:
        - background (white '0')
        - segment_member (non-white)
        - segment_endpoint (first or last non-white pixel in the segment)
        - segment_interior (non-white pixels between endpoints)

actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: segment_start_index, segment_end_index, segment_color
    description: Finds the start and end positions of the single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - name: modify_segment_interior
    inputs: output_grid_copy, segment_start_index, segment_end_index
    outputs: modified_output_grid
    description: Changes the color of pixels strictly between the start and end indices of the segment to white ('0').

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels within the segment are contiguous.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by modifying only the interior pixels of the identified non-white segment. The endpoints of the segment and all pixels outside the segment are preserved.
