```python
"""
Identifies a contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color in a 1D input grid (row).
The transformation keeps the first and last pixels of this segment unchanged in the output grid.
All pixels between the first and last pixels of the segment are changed to white (0).
All pixels outside the segment (originally white) remain white in the output.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
If the segment consists of only one pixel, that pixel remains unchanged.
