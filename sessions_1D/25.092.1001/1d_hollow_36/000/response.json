Each input row contains a single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation modifies this non-white segment. Specifically, it retains the first and the last pixel of the segment in their original positions and color, while changing all the pixels *between* the first and last pixel to white (color 0). The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
