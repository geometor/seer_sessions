Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color. Each input contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color (azure, red, yellow).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation operates specifically on the non-white colored block within the input grid.
4.  **Pattern:** In the output grid, only the first and the last pixels of the original colored block retain their color. All the pixels *between* the first and last pixels of the block are changed to white (0). Pixels outside the original block remain white. If the block has only one or two pixels, it remains unchanged in the output as there are no pixels strictly *between* the first and last.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensions: 1-dimensional (1xN)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: non-white (e.g., azure, red, yellow)
    properties:
      - location: bounded by white pixels or grid edges
      - length: variable (e.g., 7 in train_1, 4 in train_2, 3 in train_3)
      - composed_of: single non-white color
actions:
  - identify: the contiguous block of non-white pixels
  - locate: the start index and end index of the block
  - modify: pixels within the block
    - condition: pixels located strictly between the start and end indices
    - change: set color to white (0)
  - preserve:
    - pixels at the start index of the block
    - pixels at the end index of the block
    - all white pixels outside the block
relationships:
  - input_output_correspondence: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - preservation_of_endpoints: The color and position of the first and last pixels of the non-white block in the input are preserved in the output.
  - modification_of_interior: The pixels *between* the endpoints of the non-white block are changed to white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input grid.
3.  Determine the starting index and the ending index of this block.
4.  If the length of the block is greater than 2 (i.e., end index - start index > 1):
    a.  Iterate through the indices from `start index + 1` up to, but not including, `end index`.
    b.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
