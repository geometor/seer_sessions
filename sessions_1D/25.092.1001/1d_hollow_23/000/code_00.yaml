task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensions: 1-dimensional (1xN)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: non-white (e.g., azure, red, yellow)
    properties:
      - location: bounded by white pixels or grid edges
      - length: variable (e.g., 7 in train_1, 4 in train_2, 3 in train_3)
      - composed_of: single non-white color
actions:
  - identify: the contiguous block of non-white pixels
  - locate: the start index and end index of the block
  - modify: pixels within the block
    - condition: pixels located strictly between the start and end indices
    - change: set color to white (0)
  - preserve:
    - pixels at the start index of the block
    - pixels at the end index of the block
    - all white pixels outside the block
relationships:
  - input_output_correspondence: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - preservation_of_endpoints: The color and position of the first and last pixels of the non-white block in the input are preserved in the output.
  - modification_of_interior: The pixels *between* the endpoints of the non-white block are changed to white.
