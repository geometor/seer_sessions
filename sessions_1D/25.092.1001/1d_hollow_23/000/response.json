Each input contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color (azure, red, yellow).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation operates specifically on the non-white colored block within the input grid.\n4.  **Pattern:** In the output grid, only the first and the last pixels of the original colored block retain their color. All the pixels *between* the first and last pixels of the block are changed to white (0). Pixels outside the original block remain white. If the block has only one or two pixels, it remains unchanged in the output as there are no pixels strictly *between* the first and last.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
