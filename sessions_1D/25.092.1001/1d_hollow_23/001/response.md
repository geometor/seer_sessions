Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input grid (which is always 1xN).
2. Determine the start and end indices of this block.
3. If the block has a length greater than 2 pixels:
    a. Keep the pixel at the start index unchanged.
    b. Keep the pixel at the end index unchanged.
    c. Change all pixels strictly between the start and end indices to white (0).
4. If the block has a length of 1 or 2 pixels, or if there is no non-white block, the grid remains unchanged.
5. All white pixels outside the original block also remain unchanged.
