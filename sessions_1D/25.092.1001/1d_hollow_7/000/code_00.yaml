task_description: Keep only the endpoints of a horizontal contiguous segment of non-white color, turning the interior points white.

objects:
  - name: background
    pixels:
      - color: white (0)
        role: fills most of the grid
  - name: colored_segment
    pixels:
      - color: non-white (varies: gray(5), blue(1), orange(7))
        role: forms a single contiguous horizontal line in the input
        properties:
          - start_index: the column index of the first pixel in the segment
          - end_index: the column index of the last pixel in the segment
          - length: the number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1)
          - color: the specific non-white color of the segment

actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: colored_segment object (with properties: color, start_index, end_index)
  - name: generate_output
    inputs:
      - input_grid_dimensions
      - colored_segment (color, start_index, end_index)
    process:
      - Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white/0).
      - Set the pixel at the start_index in the new grid to the segment's color.
      - Set the pixel at the end_index in the new grid to the segment's color.
    outputs: output_grid

relationships:
  - The colored_segment is embedded within the background.
  - The output grid preserves the start_index and end_index locations of the original segment's color.
  - Pixels within the original segment's range, but not at the start or end indices, are replaced by the background color in the output.
