Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input consists of a single row (or a 1xN grid) containing mostly white pixels (0) and a single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color. The non-white color varies between examples (gray, blue, orange). The position and length of the colored segment also vary.

The output retains the same dimensions as the input. The background white pixels remain white. Within the segment that was previously colored, only the very first and the very last pixels retain their original color. All the pixels that were *between* the first and last pixels of the colored segment are changed to white (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Keep only the endpoints of a horizontal contiguous segment of non-white color, turning the interior points white.

objects:
  - name: background
    pixels:
      - color: white (0)
        role: fills most of the grid
  - name: colored_segment
    pixels:
      - color: non-white (varies: gray(5), blue(1), orange(7))
        role: forms a single contiguous horizontal line in the input
        properties:
          - start_index: the column index of the first pixel in the segment
          - end_index: the column index of the last pixel in the segment
          - length: the number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1)
          - color: the specific non-white color of the segment

actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: colored_segment object (with properties: color, start_index, end_index)
  - name: generate_output
    inputs:
      - input_grid_dimensions
      - colored_segment (color, start_index, end_index)
    process:
      - Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white/0).
      - Set the pixel at the start_index in the new grid to the segment's color.
      - Set the pixel at the end_index in the new grid to the segment's color.
    outputs: output_grid

relationships:
  - The colored_segment is embedded within the background.
  - The output grid preserves the start_index and end_index locations of the original segment's color.
  - Pixels within the original segment's range, but not at the start or end indices, are replaced by the background color in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input row to find the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (the colored segment).
2.  Determine the color of this segment.
3.  Record the column index of the first pixel of the segment (start index).
4.  Record the column index of the last pixel of the segment (end index).
5.  Create a new output row with the same length as the input row, and fill it completely with white pixels (0).
6.  In the output row, place the recorded segment color at the recorded start index.
7.  In the output row, place the recorded segment color at the recorded end index.
8.  Return the modified output row.
