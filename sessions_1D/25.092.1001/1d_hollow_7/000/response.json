The non-white color varies between examples (gray, blue, orange). The position and length of the colored segment also vary.\n\nThe output retains the same dimensions as the input. The background white pixels remain white. Within the segment that was previously colored, only the very first and the very last pixels retain their original color. All the pixels that were *between* the first and last pixels of the colored segment are changed to white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
