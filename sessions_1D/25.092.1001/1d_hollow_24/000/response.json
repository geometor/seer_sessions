            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples consist of a single row (1xN grid). The width varies slightly but seems consistent within each input/output pair.\n2.  **Input Content:** Each input row contains a single, contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color (magenta in examples 1 and 3, red in example 2). This colored segment is surrounded by white pixels (color 0).\n3.  **Output Content:** The output row is largely similar to the input row. The key difference lies within the colored segment.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation specifically modifies the *interior* of the colored segment. The first pixel and the last pixel of the colored segment remain unchanged. All pixels *between* the first and last pixels of the segment are changed to white (0). The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Segment Length:** The transformation applies regardless of the original length of the colored segment, as long as it's greater than 2.\n    *   Length 3 (`6 6 6`) becomes `6 0 6`.\n    *   Length 16 (`2...2`) becomes `2 0...0 2`.\n    *   Length 4 (`6 6 6 6`) becomes `6 0 0 6`.\n    If the segment length were 1 or 2, there would be no interior pixels to change, and the output would likely be identical to the input in that segment.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

If no non-white pixels are found, or if `start_col` is the same as `end_col`, or if `start_col` and `end_col` are adjacent (`end_col == start_col + 1`), the transformation results in no change, so return the initial output grid copy.\n4.  Iterate through the column indices `c` from `start_col + 1` up to (but not including) `end_col`.\n5.  For each index `c` in this range, set the pixel value in the output grid at `(0, c)` to white (0).\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
