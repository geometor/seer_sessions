task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  input_dimensions: 1xN
  output_dimensions: 1xN (same as input)
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      color: Variable (non-white, e.g., magenta, red)
      length: Variable (at least 3 in examples)
      position: Variable within the row
  - type: background
    description: White pixels surrounding the segment.
    properties:
      color: White (0)
actions:
  - action: identify_segment
    target: input grid
    details: Find the start and end indices of the non-white segment.
  - action: preserve_endpoints
    target: segment
    details: The pixel values at the start and end indices of the segment are copied to the output grid.
  - action: hollow_segment
    target: segment
    details: All pixel values at indices strictly between the start and end index are changed to white (0) in the output grid.
  - action: preserve_background
    target: background
    details: All white pixels outside the segment in the input grid are copied unchanged to the output grid.
relationships:
  - The transformation focuses solely on modifying the interior of the identified non-white segment.
  - The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.
  - Only one such segment exists per input grid.
