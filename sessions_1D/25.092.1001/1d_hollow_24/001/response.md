Identifies a single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color in a 
single-row input grid. It preserves the first and last pixels of this segment 
and changes all the pixels strictly between them to white (0). White pixels 
outside the segment remain unchanged. If the segment length is less than 3, 
no changes are made.
