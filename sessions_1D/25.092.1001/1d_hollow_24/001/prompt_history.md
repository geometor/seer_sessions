Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples consist of a single row (1xN grid). The width varies slightly but seems consistent within each input/output pair.
2.  **Input Content:** Each input row contains a single, contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color (magenta in examples 1 and 3, red in example 2). This colored segment is surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
3.  **Output Content:** The output row is largely similar to the input row. The key difference lies within the colored segment.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation specifically modifies the *interior* of the colored segment. The first pixel and the last pixel of the colored segment remain unchanged. All pixels *between* the first and last pixels of the segment are changed to white (0). The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
5.  **Segment Length:** The transformation applies regardless of the original length of the colored segment, as long as it's greater than 2.
    *   Length 3 (`6 6 6`) becomes `6 0 6`.
    *   Length 16 (`2...2`) becomes `2 0...0 2`.
    *   Length 4 (`6 6 6 6`) becomes `6 0 0 6`.
    If the segment length were 1 or 2, there would be no interior pixels to change, and the output would likely be identical to the input in that segment.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  input_dimensions: 1xN
  output_dimensions: 1xN (same as input)
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      color: Variable (non-white, e.g., magenta, red)
      length: Variable (at least 3 in examples)
      position: Variable within the row
  - type: background
    description: White pixels surrounding the segment.
    properties:
      color: White (0)
actions:
  - action: identify_segment
    target: input grid
    details: Find the start and end indices of the non-white segment.
  - action: preserve_endpoints
    target: segment
    details: The pixel values at the start and end indices of the segment are copied to the output grid.
  - action: hollow_segment
    target: segment
    details: All pixel values at indices strictly between the start and end index are changed to white (0) in the output grid.
  - action: preserve_background
    target: background
    details: All white pixels outside the segment in the input grid are copied unchanged to the output grid.
relationships:
  - The transformation focuses solely on modifying the interior of the identified non-white segment.
  - The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.
  - Only one such segment exists per input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input row to find the column index of the first non-white pixel (`start_col`) and the column index of the last non-white pixel (`end_col`).
3.  If no non-white pixels are found, or if `start_col` is the same as `end_col`, or if `start_col` and `end_col` are adjacent (`end_col == start_col + 1`), the transformation results in no change, so return the initial output grid copy.
4.  Iterate through the column indices `c` from `start_col + 1` up to (but not including) `end_col`.
5.  For each index `c` in this range, set the pixel value in the output grid at `(0, c)` to white (0).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
