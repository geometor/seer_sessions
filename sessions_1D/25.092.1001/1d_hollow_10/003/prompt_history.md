*   **Perception:** The input is a 1-dimensional grid (a single row) containing a contiguous segment of a single non-white color. This colored segment might be preceded or followed by white pixels (color 0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. The transformation identifies the first and last pixel of the non-white segment in the input. In the output grid, these two pixels retain their original color and position. All other pixels in the output grid are set to white (color 0).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN
    input_characteristics:
      - Contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (object).
      - May contain leading or trailing white pixels (color 0).
      - The non-white block has a start position and an end position.
    output_characteristics:
      - Same dimensions as the input.
      - Contains only two non-white pixels (unless the input block has length 1 or 2).
      - The first non-white pixel corresponds to the start position and color of the input block.
      - The second non-white pixel corresponds to the end position and color of the input block.
      - All other pixels are white (color 0).
    transformation:
      - Identify the indices and color of the first and last non-white pixels in the input row.
      - Create an output row of the same length, initialized with white pixels.
      - Place the color of the first non-white pixel at its original index in the output row.
      - Place the color of the last non-white pixel at its original index in the output row.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
    2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right to find the index and color of the first non-white pixel. If found, store this index and color.
    3.  Iterate through the input grid from right to left to find the index and color of the last non-white pixel. If found, store this index and color. (Note: This will be the same color as the first non-white pixel found).
    4.  If a first non-white pixel was found, set the pixel at the corresponding index in the output grid to its color.
    5.  If a last non-white pixel was found, set the pixel at the corresponding index in the output grid to its color. (If the first and last non-white pixel are the same, this step overwrites the same pixel if the segment length is 1, which is acceptable).
    6.  Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The provided results indicate that the `transform` function, as executed, failed to produce the expected outputs for all training examples. Specifically, the `Transformed Output` shown in the results is identical to the original `Input`, suggesting that the intended transformation logic (keeping only the first and last non-white pixels and setting others to white) was not applied correctly during that execution run.

However, the `Perception`, `Facts`, and `Natural Language Program` provided in the initial analysis *accurately* describe the transformation required to get from the input to the *expected* output for all three examples. The logic involves identifying the start and end of the contiguous non-white segment and preserving only those two pixels (or one, if the segment length is 1).

The strategy is to reaffirm the correctness of the natural language program based on all examples, assuming the execution results shown were due to an implementation error or an issue in the testing environment, rather than a misunderstanding of the task's core logic. The python code provided seems logically sound for the described transformation, further suggesting the reported execution results might be misleading or based on a different version of the code.

**Metrics:**

| Example | Input Length | Input Non-White Color | Input Non-White Start Index | Input Non-White End Index | Expected Output Non-White Count | Expected Output Non-White Indices |
| :------ | :----------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |

| 2       | 25           | 7 (orange)            | 0                           | 17                        | 2                               | 0, 17                           |

**Observations:**

*   All examples use a 1x25 grid.
*   Each input has exactly one contiguous segment (object) of a single non-white color.
*   The transformation consistently identifies the first and last pixel of this segment.
*   The output grid is the same size as the input.
*   The output grid contains only the first and last pixels of the input segment, preserving their original color and position.
*   All other pixels in the output grid are set to white (0).

```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
input_characteristics:
  - type: list of integers (representing a single row)
  - size: Variable length (all examples are 1x25)
  - content:
      - Contains background pixels: white (0)
      - Contains exactly one object: A contiguous horizontal segment of a single non-white color.
      - The object has a start index and an end index.
output_characteristics:
  - type: list of integers (representing a single row)
  - size: Same length as the input grid.
  - content:
      - Contains background pixels: white (0)
      - Contains exactly two pixels (or one if input segment length is 1) of the same non-white color as the input object.
      - The positions of these non-white pixels correspond to the start and end indices of the input object.
transformation_description:
  - Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input row.
  - Determine the color of this segment.
  - Determine the index of the first pixel of the segment.
  - Determine the index of the last pixel of the segment.
  - Create a new row of the same length, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
  - Set the pixel at the start index in the new row to the segment's color.
  - Set the pixel at the end index in the new row to the segment's color.
edge_cases:
  - If the input segment has length 1, the start and end indices are the same. The output will have only one non-white pixel.
  - If the input contains only white pixels (no segment), the output will also be all white pixels. (Implicit from the logic).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a list of integers representing a single row).
2.  Create an output grid of the same length as the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Find the indices of all non-white pixels in the input grid.
4.  If any non-white pixels are found:
    a.  Determine the index of the first non-white pixel (the minimum index found).
    b.  Determine the index of the last non-white pixel (the maximum index found).
    c.  Get the color of the non-white pixels (e.g., from the pixel at the first index).
    d.  In the output grid, set the pixel at the first index to this color.
    e.  In the output grid, set the pixel at the last index to this color.
5.  Return the output grid.
