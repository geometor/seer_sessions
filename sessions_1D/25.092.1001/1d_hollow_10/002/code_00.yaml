task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
input_characteristics:
  - type: list of integers (representing a single row)
  - size: Variable length (all examples are 1x25)
  - content:
      - Contains background pixels: white (0)
      - Contains exactly one object: A contiguous horizontal segment of a single non-white color.
      - The object has a start index and an end index.
output_characteristics:
  - type: list of integers (representing a single row)
  - size: Same length as the input grid.
  - content:
      - Contains background pixels: white (0)
      - Contains exactly two pixels (or one if input segment length is 1) of the same non-white color as the input object.
      - The positions of these non-white pixels correspond to the start and end indices of the input object.
transformation_description:
  - Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input row.
  - Determine the color of this segment.
  - Determine the index of the first pixel of the segment.
  - Determine the index of the last pixel of the segment.
  - Create a new row of the same length, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
  - Set the pixel at the start index in the new row to the segment's color.
  - Set the pixel at the end index in the new row to the segment's color.
edge_cases:
  - If the input segment has length 1, the start and end indices are the same. The output will have only one non-white pixel.
  - If the input contains only white pixels (no segment), the output will also be all white pixels. (Implicit from the logic).
