Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.

**General Assessment**

The provided code execution results indicate that the transformation function failed for all three training examples. The `Transformed Output` in each case is identical to the `Input`, suggesting the function simply returned the input array without applying the intended transformation. However, the Python code presented *before* the results *does* seem to implement the logic described in the initial perception and natural language program (identify first/last non-white pixels, create a white grid, place the color at those positions).

This discrepancy implies either:
1.  The code executed was different from the code presented.
2.  There was a fundamental flaw in the implementation within the presented code that caused it to effectively return the input (e.g., modifying the input array inadvertently or returning the wrong variable).

Assuming the presented Python code *intended* to implement the logic described, and that the logic itself needs verification against all examples, the strategy is:
1.  Re-examine the input/output pairs for all examples.
2.  Verify if the rule "keep only the first and last pixels of the contiguous non-white block, making everything else white" holds true for all examples.
3.  If the rule holds, refine the description and natural language program for clarity and confirm the Python code accurately reflects this rule. If the rule doesn't hold, identify the correct rule.

```
The metrics confirm that for all three examples, the transformation rule is consistently applied:
1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input.
2.  Find the starting index and ending index of this block.
3.  Create an output grid of the same size, filled with white (0).
4.  Place the color of the input block at the starting index in the output grid.
5.  Place the color of the input block at the ending index in the output grid.

The rule holds perfectly for all provided training cases. The initial perception and natural language program were correct. The execution failure was likely due to an issue separate from the core logic understanding.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a list or 1xN array
input_characteristics:
  - Grid is a single row.
  - Contains at most one contiguous block (object) of a single non-white color.
  - May contain leading and/or trailing white pixels (color 0).
  - If a non-white block exists, it has a specific color, a start index, and an end index.
output_characteristics:
  - Same dimensions (length) as the input grid.
  - If the input contains a non-white block:
    - Contains exactly two pixels of the non-white color from the input block (unless the input block length is 1, then only one pixel).
    - One non-white pixel is located at the start index of the original block.
    - The other non-white pixel is located at the end index of the original block.
    - All other pixels are white (color 0).
  - If the input contains only white pixels, the output is also all white pixels.
transformation:
  - Identify the non-white object in the input row.
  - Determine its color, start index, and end index.
  - Create a new row of the same length, initialized to white (0).
  - Copy the color of the object to the start index position in the new row.
  - Copy the color of the object to the end index position in the new row.
special_cases:
  - If the input row is all white, the output row is all white.
  - If the non-white object has length 1, the start and end indices are the same, resulting in only one non-white pixel in the output at that index.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row represented as a list of integers).
2.  Create a new output grid of the same length as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Scan the input grid to find all indices containing non-white pixels.
4.  If no non-white pixels are found, return the all-white output grid.
5.  If non-white pixels are found:
    a.  Determine the index of the first non-white pixel (minimum index).
    b.  Determine the index of the last non-white pixel (maximum index).
    c.  Get the color value from the first non-white pixel found (assuming all pixels in the block share the same color, as per examples).
    d.  Set the pixel at the first non-white index in the output grid to this color.
    e.  Set the pixel at the last non-white index in the output grid to this same color.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
