task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a list or 1xN array
input_characteristics:
  - Grid is a single row.
  - Contains at most one contiguous block (object) of a single non-white color.
  - May contain leading and/or trailing white pixels (color 0).
  - If a non-white block exists, it has a specific color, a start index, and an end index.
output_characteristics:
  - Same dimensions (length) as the input grid.
  - If the input contains a non-white block:
    - Contains exactly two pixels of the non-white color from the input block (unless the input block length is 1, then only one pixel).
    - One non-white pixel is located at the start index of the original block.
    - The other non-white pixel is located at the end index of the original block.
    - All other pixels are white (color 0).
  - If the input contains only white pixels, the output is also all white pixels.
transformation:
  - Identify the non-white object in the input row.
  - Determine its color, start index, and end index.
  - Create a new row of the same length, initialized to white (0).
  - Copy the color of the object to the start index position in the new row.
  - Copy the color of the object to the end index position in the new row.
special_cases:
  - If the input row is all white, the output row is all white.
  - If the non-white object has length 1, the start and end indices are the same, resulting in only one non-white pixel in the output at that index.
