*   **Perception:** The input is a 1-dimensional grid (a single row) containing a contiguous segment of a single non-white color. This colored segment might be preceded or followed by white pixels (color 0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. The transformation identifies the first and last pixel of the non-white segment in the input. In the output grid, these two pixels retain their original color and position. All other pixels in the output grid are set to white (color 0).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN
    input_characteristics:
      - Contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (object).
      - May contain leading or trailing white pixels (color 0).
      - The non-white block has a start position and an end position.
    output_characteristics:
      - Same dimensions as the input.
      - Contains only two non-white pixels (unless the input block has length 1 or 2).
      - The first non-white pixel corresponds to the start position and color of the input block.
      - The second non-white pixel corresponds to the end position and color of the input block.
      - All other pixels are white (color 0).
    transformation:
      - Identify the indices and color of the first and last non-white pixels in the input row.
      - Create an output row of the same length, initialized with white pixels.
      - Place the color of the first non-white pixel at its original index in the output row.
      - Place the color of the last non-white pixel at its original index in the output row.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
    2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right to find the index and color of the first non-white pixel. If found, store this index and color.
    3.  Iterate through the input grid from right to left to find the index and color of the last non-white pixel. If found, store this index and color. (Note: This will be the same color as the first non-white pixel found).
    4.  If a first non-white pixel was found, set the pixel at the corresponding index in the output grid to its color.
    5.  If a last non-white pixel was found, set the pixel at the corresponding index in the output grid to its color. (If the first and last non-white pixel are the same, this step overwrites the same pixel if the segment length is 1, which is acceptable).
    6.  Return the modified output grid.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: locate the contiguous block of non-white color, find its start and end points, and create an output grid of the same size containing only those start and end points in their original positions and color, with all other pixels being white. However, the provided Python code failed to implement this logic correctly, returning the input grid unmodified in all cases. The strategy is to re-implement the Python code to accurately reflect the previously derived natural language program, ensuring it correctly identifies the start/end indices and constructs the output grid as intended.
