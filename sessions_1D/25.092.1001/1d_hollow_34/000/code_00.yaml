task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # Based on examples, potentially generalizes to 2D per row
objects:
  - type: grid
    role: input
  - type: grid
    role: output
    relationship: same_dimensions_as_input
  - type: contiguous_block
    role: primary_feature
    properties:
      - color: non-white (variable per example, e.g., gray, orange, red)
      - location: horizontal segment within the input grid
      - extent: defined by start_column_index and end_column_index
actions:
  - name: identify_non_white_block
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: block_color, start_column_index, end_column_index
  - name: create_output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same_as_input
      - initial_fill: white (0)
  - name: preserve_block_endpoints
    inputs: output_grid, block_color, start_column_index, end_column_index
    outputs: modified_output_grid
    details: Sets the pixel at start_column_index and end_column_index in the output_grid to the block_color.
relationships:
  - The output grid's content is derived solely from the location and color of the non-white block's endpoints in the input grid.
  - Pixels between the endpoints of the original block become white in the output.
  - Pixels outside the original block's extent remain white.
constraints:
  - Assumes only one contiguous non-white block per row (based on examples).
  - Assumes blocks have a length of at least 1. If length is 1 or 2, the operation effectively preserves the block as is.
