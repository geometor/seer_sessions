Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All examples consist of a single row (1D grid). The dimensions (1x14) remain constant from input to output.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (gray-5, orange-7, red-2). White acts as the background.
3.  **Key Feature:** The input contains a single, contiguous horizontal block (or segment) of a non-white color. This block is surrounded by or adjacent to white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation focuses on this non-white block. The core action is to retain only the endpoints (the first and last pixels) of the original block. All the pixels *inside* the original block are changed to white (0). Pixels outside the original block remain white.
5.  **Object:** The contiguous block of non-white color can be considered the primary object being manipulated.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D # Based on examples, potentially generalizes to 2D per row
objects:
  - type: grid
    role: input
  - type: grid
    role: output
    relationship: same_dimensions_as_input
  - type: contiguous_block
    role: primary_feature
    properties:
      - color: non-white (variable per example, e.g., gray, orange, red)
      - location: horizontal segment within the input grid
      - extent: defined by start_column_index and end_column_index
actions:
  - name: identify_non_white_block
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: block_color, start_column_index, end_column_index
  - name: create_output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same_as_input
      - initial_fill: white (0)
  - name: preserve_block_endpoints
    inputs: output_grid, block_color, start_column_index, end_column_index
    outputs: modified_output_grid
    details: Sets the pixel at start_column_index and end_column_index in the output_grid to the block_color.
relationships:
  - The output grid's content is derived solely from the location and color of the non-white block's endpoints in the input grid.
  - Pixels between the endpoints of the original block become white in the output.
  - Pixels outside the original block's extent remain white.
constraints:
  - Assumes only one contiguous non-white block per row (based on examples).
  - Assumes blocks have a length of at least 1. If length is 1 or 2, the operation effectively preserves the block as is.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
2.  For each row in the input grid (though examples only show one row):
    a.  Scan the row to find the column index of the first non-white pixel (`start_col`) and the column index of the last non-white pixel (`end_col`).
    b.  If no non-white pixels are found in the row, proceed to the next row.
    c.  If non-white pixels are found:
        i.  Determine the color (`block_color`) of the pixel at `start_col` in the input row.
        ii. In the corresponding row of the output grid, set the pixel at column `start_col` to `block_color`.
        iii. In the corresponding row of the output grid, set the pixel at column `end_col` to `block_color`.
3.  Return the completed output grid.
