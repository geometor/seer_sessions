The dimensions (1x14) remain constant from input to output.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (gray-5, orange-7, red-2). White acts as the background.\n3.  **Key Feature:** The input contains a single, contiguous horizontal block (or segment) of a non-white color. This block is surrounded by or adjacent to white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation focuses on this non-white block. The core action is to retain only the endpoints (the first and last pixels) of the original block. All the pixels *inside* the original block are changed to white (0). Pixels outside the original block remain white.\n5.  **Object:** The contiguous block of non-white color can be considered the primary object being manipulated.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
