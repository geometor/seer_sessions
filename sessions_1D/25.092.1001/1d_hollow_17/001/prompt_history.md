Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements**

The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (or single rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output grid retains the surrounding white pixels and modifies the non-white block. Specifically, only the first and the last pixel of the original non-white block remain in their positions in the output; all pixels *between* these two endpoints are changed to white. The color of the endpoints remains the same as the original block's color. If the block has only one or two pixels, it remains unchanged (although this isn't explicitly shown, it's implied by the transformation rule).

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Modifies a contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels by keeping only its endpoints and changing the interior pixels to white.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 (effectively 1xN)
  background_color: 0 (white)

objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., 3-green, 2-red, 5-gray)
      location: surrounded by white pixels
      shape: horizontal line segment
      length: variable (>= 1)

transformation:
  action: identify_endpoints
  input_object: contiguous_block
  output_changes:
    - description: Keep the first pixel of the block.
      condition: Block length >= 1
    - description: Keep the last pixel of the block.
      condition: Block length >= 2
    - description: Change all pixels between the first and last pixel to white (0).
      condition: Block length >= 3
  unchanged_elements:
    - All white pixels outside the block remain white.
    - The color of the endpoint pixels is preserved.

relationships:
  - The non-white block is defined by its start and end indices within the grid row.
  - The transformation focuses solely on the segment between the start and end indices of the non-white block.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all pixels that are not white (color 0).
3.  If no non-white pixels are found, or only one non-white pixel is found, return the output grid without changes.
4.  If two or more non-white pixels are found, determine the index of the first non-white pixel (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-white pixel (`end_index`).
5.  Iterate through the grid positions from `start_index + 1` up to, but not including, `end_index`.
6.  For each position `i` in this range, set the value of the pixel at `output_grid[i]` to white (0).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
