task_description: Modifies a contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels by keeping only its endpoints and changing the interior pixels to white.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 (effectively 1xN)
  background_color: 0 (white)

objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., 3-green, 2-red, 5-gray)
      location: surrounded by white pixels
      shape: horizontal line segment
      length: variable (>= 1)

transformation:
  action: identify_endpoints
  input_object: contiguous_block
  output_changes:
    - description: Keep the first pixel of the block.
      condition: Block length >= 1
    - description: Keep the last pixel of the block.
      condition: Block length >= 2
    - description: Change all pixels between the first and last pixel to white (0).
      condition: Block length >= 3
  unchanged_elements:
    - All white pixels outside the block remain white.
    - The color of the endpoint pixels is preserved.

relationships:
  - The non-white block is defined by its start and end indices within the grid row.
  - The transformation focuses solely on the segment between the start and end indices of the non-white block.
