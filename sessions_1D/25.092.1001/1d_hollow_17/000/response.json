Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The output grid retains the surrounding white pixels and modifies the non-white block. Specifically, only the first and the last pixel of the original non-white block remain in their positions in the output; all pixels *between* these two endpoints are changed to white. The color of the endpoints remains the same as the original block's color. If the block has only one or two pixels, it remains unchanged (although this isn't explicitly shown, it's implied by the transformation rule).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
