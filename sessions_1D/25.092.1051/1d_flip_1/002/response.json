            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous code failed on all examples with the same error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.\" This strongly suggests the input `input_grid` is being passed as a NumPy array, not a standard Python list of lists as the code assumed. Operations like direct comparison (`pixel != 0`) or using array segments in boolean contexts (`if segment:`) can lead to this error when applied to NumPy arrays without explicit methods like `.any()` or `.all()`. The core logic identified (finding a non-white segment, identifying a singleton and a block within it, and swapping their relative positions) appears consistent across all training examples. The strategy is to adapt the logic to handle NumPy arrays correctly or convert relevant parts to lists for processing.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Grid Dimensions:** All examples (input and output) are 1x10.\n    *   **Data Structure:** The error indicates the input is likely a NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[6, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])`).\n    *   **Content Pattern:**\n        *   Each input has a single contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels.\n        *   The remaining pixels are white (0).\n        *   Within the non-white segment, there are exactly two distinct colors.\n        *   One color appears exactly once (the \"singleton\").\n        *   The other color appears multiple times contiguously (the \"block\").\n        *   The singleton and the block are always adjacent.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   The white pixels remain unchanged.\n        *   The non-white segment is modified.\n        *   The relative positions of the singleton pixel and the block of pixels are swapped within the bounds of the original segment. If the singleton was on the left, it moves to the right end of the segment, and the block shifts left. If the singleton was on the right, it moves to the left end, and the block shifts right.\n\n    *   **Example Breakdown:**\n        *   **Example 1:**\n            *   Input Segment: `[6, 7, 7, 7]` (indices 0-3)\n            *   Singleton: 6 (at index 0), Block: `[7, 7, 7]`\n            *   Output Segment: `[7, 7, 7, 6]` (indices 0-3)\n        *   **Example 2:**\n            *   Input Segment: `[1, 8, 8, 8, 8]` (indices 2-6)\n            *   Singleton: 1 (at index 2), Block: `[8, 8, 8, 8]`\n            *   Output Segment: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 1]` (indices 2-6)\n        *   **Example 3:**\n            *   Input Segment: `[7, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (indices 0-4)\n            *   Singleton: 7 (at index 0), Block: `[2, 2, 2, 2]`\n            *   Output Segment: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 7]` (indices 0-4)\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
