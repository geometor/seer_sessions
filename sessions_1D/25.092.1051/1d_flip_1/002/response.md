*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed on all examples with the same error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous." This strongly suggests the input `input_grid` is being passed as a NumPy array, not a standard Python list of lists as the code assumed. Operations like direct comparison (`pixel != 0`) or using array segments in boolean contexts (`if segment:`) can lead to this error when applied to NumPy arrays without explicit methods like `.any()` or `.all()`. The core logic identified (finding a non-white segment, identifying a singleton and a block within it, and swapping their relative positions) appears consistent across all training examples. The strategy is to adapt the logic to handle NumPy arrays correctly or convert relevant parts to lists for processing.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Grid Dimensions:** All examples (input and output) are 1x10.
    *   **Data Structure:** The error indicates the input is likely a NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[6, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])`).
    *   **Content Pattern:**
        *   Each input has a single contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
        *   The remaining pixels are white (0).
        *   Within the non-white segment, there are exactly two distinct colors.
        *   One color appears exactly once (the "singleton").
        *   The other color appears multiple times contiguously (the "block").
        *   The singleton and the block are always adjacent.
    *   **Transformation:**
        *   The white pixels remain unchanged.
        *   The non-white segment is modified.
        *   The relative positions of the singleton pixel and the block of pixels are swapped within the bounds of the original segment. If the singleton was on the left, it moves to the right end of the segment, and the block shifts left. If the singleton was on the right, it moves to the left end, and the block shifts right.

    *   **Example Breakdown:**
        *   **Example 1:**
            *   Input Segment: `[6, 7, 7, 7]` (indices 0-3)
            *   Singleton: 6 (at index 0), Block: `[7, 7, 7]`
            *   Output Segment: `[7, 7, 7, 6]` (indices 0-3)
        *   **Example 2:**
            *   Input Segment: `[1, 8, 8, 8, 8]` (indices 2-6)
            *   Singleton: 1 (at index 2), Block: `[8, 8, 8, 8]`
            *   Output Segment: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 1]` (indices 2-6)
        *   **Example 3:**
            *   Input Segment: `[7, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (indices 0-4)
            *   Singleton: 7 (at index 0), Block: `[2, 2, 2, 2]`
            *   Output Segment: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 7]` (indices 0-4)

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Assume the input is a single row (or treat the first row of a 2D grid if applicable).
    2.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
    3.  Find the start and end indices of the contiguous segment containing non-white pixels (values > 0). If no such segment exists, return the copied input row unchanged.
    4.  Extract this non-white segment.
    5.  Analyze the colors within the segment: Count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color. Identify the color that appears only once (the "singleton color") and the color that appears multiple times (the "block color"). Determine the length of the block (which is the total segment length minus 1).
    6.  Determine the position of the singleton within the segment (is it the first element or the last element?).
    7.  Construct the new segment:
        a.  If the singleton was the first element in the original segment, create the new segment by placing the block (repeating the block color for its length) first, followed by the singleton pixel.
        b.  If the singleton was the last element in the original segment, create the new segment by placing the singleton pixel first, followed by the block (repeating the block color for its length).
    8.  Replace the portion of the output row corresponding to the original segment's start and end indices with the newly constructed segment.
    9.  Return the modified output row (potentially wrapped in a list if the required output format is 2D).
