"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying a contiguous non-white segment, 
finding a single 'singleton' pixel and a contiguous 'block' of another color 
within that segment, and then swapping their relative positions. 
Background pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.

The transformation logic assumes the input is a 1xN grid and the non-white 
segment contains exactly one singleton pixel and one block of pixels of another 
color, positioned adjacently.
