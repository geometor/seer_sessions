The white pixels remain unchanged in their positions.\n    *   Within the non-white segment, there is always one pixel of a unique color (let's call it the \"singleton\") and a contiguous block of pixels of another color (let's call it the \"block\").\n    *   The singleton and the block are always adjacent to each other.\n    *   The transformation involves swapping the positions of the singleton and the block within the non-white segment. The singleton moves to the opposite end of the combined region initially occupied by both objects, and the block shifts to fill the remaining space, starting where the singleton was.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
