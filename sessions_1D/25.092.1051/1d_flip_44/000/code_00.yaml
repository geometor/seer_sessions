task_type: array_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN 2D array)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: non_white_sequence
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels with colors other than white (0).
    location: Embedded within the white background.
    structure:
      - component: head
        description: A single pixel of a specific color.
        position: Always at the beginning of the non_white_sequence in the input.
      - component: body
        description: A contiguous block of pixels of a single color, different from the head color.
        position: Immediately follows the head pixel in the input.
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: non_white_sequence
    details: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - action: identify
    target: head
    details: The first pixel within the non_white_sequence.
  - action: identify
    target: body
    details: The remaining pixels within the non_white_sequence after the head pixel.
  - action: rearrange
    target: non_white_sequence
    details: Reorder the components within the sequence's original location so the body block comes first, followed by the head pixel.
    constraints:
      - The relative positions of pixels within the body block remain unchanged.
      - The position of the overall sequence within the grid remains unchanged.
      - Pixels outside the non_white_sequence (the white background) remain unchanged.
