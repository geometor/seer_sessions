Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements**

The input and output are both 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of colored pixels.
The background is consistently white (0).
In each input, there is a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
This sequence always starts with a single pixel of one color (let's call this the "leader" pixel) followed by a contiguous block of pixels of a second, different color (let's call this the "body" block).
The transformation involves moving the "leader" pixel from the beginning of the sequence to the end of the "body" block. The pixels in the "body" block remain in their relative positions but shift one position to the left to accommodate the moved leader pixel.
The surrounding white background pixels remain unchanged in their positions.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: "Move the first pixel of a contiguous non-background sequence to the end of that sequence."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - id: non_white_sequence
    description: "A contiguous block of pixels with colors other than white."
    properties:
      - composition: Consists of two adjacent parts.
      - part_1:
          id: leader_pixel
          description: "The single, first pixel of the non_white_sequence."
          properties:
            - count: 1
            - color: variable (azure, red, magenta in examples)
            - position: Start of the non_white_sequence
      - part_2:
          id: body_block
          description: "The contiguous block of pixels following the leader_pixel."
          properties:
            - count: variable (12, 13, 12 in examples)
            - color: variable, consistent within the block (yellow, gray, orange in examples), different from leader_pixel color.
            - position: Immediately follows the leader_pixel.
  - id: background
    description: "White pixels surrounding the non_white_sequence."
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - position: Before and after the non_white_sequence.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [leader_pixel, body_block]
    details: "Leader pixel is immediately to the left of the body block in the input."
actions:
  - action: move
    object: leader_pixel
    from: Start of the non_white_sequence
    to: End of the non_white_sequence (immediately after the body_block)
  - action: shift
    object: body_block
    direction: left
    amount: 1 position (implicitly, by placing it before the moved leader pixel)
  - action: maintain
    object: background
    details: "Background pixels remain in their original positions."
output_state:
  - object: non_white_sequence
    properties:
      - composition: Consists of two adjacent parts, order reversed.
      - part_1: body_block (now at the start of the sequence)
      - part_2: leader_pixel (now at the end of the sequence)
  - object: background
    properties:
      - Unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input grid.
2.  Determine the color and position of the first pixel in this sequence (the "leader" pixel).
3.  Determine the color and extent (start and end positions) of the block of pixels immediately following the leader pixel (the "body" block).
4.  Construct the output grid:
    a.  Copy all white pixels from the input to the output in their original positions.
    b.  Place the "body" block in the output grid, starting at the original position of the "leader" pixel.
    c.  Place the "leader" pixel in the output grid immediately following the end of the "body" block.
