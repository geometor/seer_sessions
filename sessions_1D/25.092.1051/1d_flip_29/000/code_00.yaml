task_description: "Move the first pixel of a contiguous non-background sequence to the end of that sequence."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - id: non_white_sequence
    description: "A contiguous block of pixels with colors other than white."
    properties:
      - composition: Consists of two adjacent parts.
      - part_1:
          id: leader_pixel
          description: "The single, first pixel of the non_white_sequence."
          properties:
            - count: 1
            - color: variable (azure, red, magenta in examples)
            - position: Start of the non_white_sequence
      - part_2:
          id: body_block
          description: "The contiguous block of pixels following the leader_pixel."
          properties:
            - count: variable (12, 13, 12 in examples)
            - color: variable, consistent within the block (yellow, gray, orange in examples), different from leader_pixel color.
            - position: Immediately follows the leader_pixel.
  - id: background
    description: "White pixels surrounding the non_white_sequence."
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - position: Before and after the non_white_sequence.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [leader_pixel, body_block]
    details: "Leader pixel is immediately to the left of the body block in the input."
actions:
  - action: move
    object: leader_pixel
    from: Start of the non_white_sequence
    to: End of the non_white_sequence (immediately after the body_block)
  - action: shift
    object: body_block
    direction: left
    amount: 1 position (implicitly, by placing it before the moved leader pixel)
  - action: maintain
    object: background
    details: "Background pixels remain in their original positions."
output_state:
  - object: non_white_sequence
    properties:
      - composition: Consists of two adjacent parts, order reversed.
      - part_1: body_block (now at the start of the sequence)
      - part_2: leader_pixel (now at the end of the sequence)
  - object: background
    properties:
      - Unchanged.
