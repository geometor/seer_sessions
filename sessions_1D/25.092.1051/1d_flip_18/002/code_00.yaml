grid_properties:
  structure: 2D NumPy array
  shape: Always 1xN (single row, variable columns)
  background_color: 0 (white)

object_properties:
  count: Exactly 2 non-background objects per grid.
  location: Located within the single row of the grid.
  contiguity: Each object is a horizontally contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
  adjacency: The two objects are always immediately adjacent to each other horizontally.
  colors: Objects have non-zero colors. Colors can vary between examples.
  size_constraint: One object always consists of a single pixel (length 1), the other can have length >= 1.

transformation:
  type: Object rearrangement (swap)
  scope: Affects only the two non-background objects and their positions.
  background_preservation: Background (white) pixels remain unchanged.
  rule: The positions of the two adjacent non-background objects are swapped within the row. The object that was originally on the left moves to the rightmost position of the combined space, and the object originally on the right moves to the leftmost position of the combined space.
