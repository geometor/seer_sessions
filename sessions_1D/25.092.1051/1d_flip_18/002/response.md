*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input data structure was a 1D Python list (`List[int]`) instead of the actual 2D NumPy array (1xN) provided by the testing environment. This led to a `ValueError` when performing boolean checks on array slices. The core logic identified – finding two adjacent non-background objects in the row and swapping their positions – appears fundamentally correct based on the examples and simulation. The strategy is to adapt the code to correctly handle the 1xN NumPy array input by operating on its single row.

*   **Metrics:**

```
*   **Facts:**


```yaml
grid_properties:
  structure: 2D NumPy array
  shape: Always 1xN (single row, variable columns)
  background_color: 0 (white)

object_properties:
  count: Exactly 2 non-background objects per grid.
  location: Located within the single row of the grid.
  contiguity: Each object is a horizontally contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
  adjacency: The two objects are always immediately adjacent to each other horizontally.
  colors: Objects have non-zero colors. Colors can vary between examples.
  size_constraint: One object always consists of a single pixel (length 1), the other can have length >= 1.

transformation:
  type: Object rearrangement (swap)
  scope: Affects only the two non-background objects and their positions.
  background_preservation: Background (white) pixels remain unchanged.
  rule: The positions of the two adjacent non-background objects are swapped within the row. The object that was originally on the left moves to the rightmost position of the combined space, and the object originally on the right moves to the leftmost position of the combined space.
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
4.  Scan this row to identify all contiguous sequences (blocks) of non-zero pixels. Record the color, starting index (column), and length (number of pixels) for each block. Expect to find exactly two such blocks.
5.  Identify the two blocks found. Let Block L be the block with the smaller starting index (left block) and Block R be the block with the larger starting index (right block). Record the color (`color_L`, `color_R`), starting index (`start_L`, `start_R`), and length (`len_L`, `len_R`) for each. Note that `start_R` will equal `start_L + len_L`.
6.  Modify the single row of the output grid:
    a.  Starting at column index `start_L`, write `len_R` pixels using `color_R`.
    b.  Starting at column index `start_L + len_R`, write `len_L` pixels using `color_L`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
