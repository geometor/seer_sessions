"""
Identifies two adjacent, horizontally contiguous blocks of non-background 
(non-zero) colors within a single-row (1xN) input grid. One block is always a 
single pixel, and the other can be one or more pixels. The transformation swaps 
the positions of these two blocks within the row, preserving the background pixels.
