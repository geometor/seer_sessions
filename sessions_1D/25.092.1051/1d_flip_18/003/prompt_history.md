*   **Perception:**
    The input and output are 1D grids (or 1xN arrays). Each input contains a sequence of pixels, mostly white (0), but also includes two distinct non-white objects placed adjacent to each other. One object is always a single pixel of one color, and the other object is a contiguous block of pixels of another color. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that the positions of the single non-white pixel and the adjacent block of non-white pixels are swapped. The white background pixels remain unchanged.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.

    3.  Identify the two adjacent non-white blocks. Let Block A be the block that appears first (leftmost) and Block B be the block that appears second (rightmost).
    4.  Determine the pixel indices occupied by Block A and Block B.
    5.  In the output grid, place the pixels corresponding to Block B into the indices originally occupied by Block A.
    6.  In the output grid, place the pixels corresponding to Block A into the indices originally occupied by Block B.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input data structure was a 1D Python list (`List[int]`) instead of the actual 2D NumPy array (1xN) provided by the testing environment. This led to a `ValueError` when performing boolean checks on array slices. The core logic identified – finding two adjacent non-background objects in the row and swapping their positions – appears fundamentally correct based on the examples and simulation. The strategy is to adapt the code to correctly handle the 1xN NumPy array input by operating on its single row.

*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
4.  Scan this row to identify all contiguous sequences (blocks) of non-zero pixels. Record the color, starting index (column), and length (number of pixels) for each block. Expect to find exactly two such blocks.
5.  Identify the two blocks found. Let Block L be the block with the smaller starting index (left block) and Block R be the block with the larger starting index (right block). Record the color (`color_L`, `color_R`), starting index (`start_L`, `start_R`), and length (`len_L`, `len_R`) for each. Note that `start_R` will equal `start_L + len_L`.
6.  Modify the single row of the output grid:
    a.  Starting at column index `start_L`, write `len_R` pixels using `color_R`.
    b.  Starting at column index `start_L + len_R`, write `len_L` pixels using `color_L`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
