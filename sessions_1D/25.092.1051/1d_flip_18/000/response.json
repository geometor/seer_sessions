Each input contains a sequence of pixels, mostly white (0), but also includes two distinct non-white objects placed adjacent to each other. One object is always a single pixel of one color, and the other object is a contiguous block of pixels of another color. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that the positions of the single non-white pixel and the adjacent block of non-white pixels are swapped. The white background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
