The primary colors involved are white (0), used as a background, and other colors like green (3), orange (7), and magenta (6) forming a central \"figure\". This figure is always a contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n\nObserving the examples:\n1.  `train_1`: The figure is `7 3 3 3 3 3 3 3`. It transforms to `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 7`. The single orange pixel swaps places with the block of green pixels.\n2.  `train_2`: The figure is `3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7`. It transforms to `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 3`. The single green pixel swaps places with the block of orange pixels.\n3.  `train_3`: The figure is `6 7 7 7 7 7 7 7`. It transforms to `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 6`. The single magenta pixel swaps places with the block of orange pixels.\n\nThe core transformation appears to be identifying the non-white sequence (the figure) and within that sequence, swapping the position of a single pixel of one color with the adjacent contiguous block of pixels of another color. The background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Note its starting and ending positions.\n2.  Within the figure, identify the single pixel that has a different color from its neighbors (let's call this the \"unique pixel\").\n3.  Identify the remaining block of pixels within the figure, which all share the same color (let's call this the \"color block\").\n4.  Determine the relative order of the unique pixel and the color block in the input figure (e.g., unique pixel followed by color block, or vice-versa).\n5.  Create a new sequence by reversing the order of the unique pixel and the color block.\n6.  Construct the output grid by replacing the original figure sequence (at its original start/end positions) with the newly created sequence. Keep all white background pixels in their original positions."
