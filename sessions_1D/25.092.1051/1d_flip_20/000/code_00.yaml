task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: Surrounds the main figure. Remains static.
  - type: figure
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
    composition:
      - part_a:
          description: A single pixel of a specific non-white color.
          quantity: 1
      - part_b:
          description: A contiguous block of one or more pixels of another specific non-white color.
          quantity: variable (>= 1)
    relationship: part_a and part_b are adjacent within the figure.
transformation:
  action: swap_elements
  target: figure
  details: The position of part_a (single pixel) and part_b (block of pixels) within the figure are swapped. The rest of the grid (background) remains unchanged.
