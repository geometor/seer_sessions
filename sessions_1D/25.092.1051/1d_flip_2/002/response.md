**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed because it treated the input grid as a 1D list (`[0, 4, 5,...]`) while the standard ARC representation is a list of lists (even for a single row, e.g., `[[0, 4, 5,...]]`). This caused the numpy operations, particularly `np.where` and indexing, to work incorrectly on the 2D array representation, leading to the transformation logic not being applied. The core logic of identifying the non-white segment and swapping the first element with the rest appears correct conceptually but needs to be applied to the actual row data (the first element of the input list).

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the code to explicitly access the first row of the input grid (e.g., `input_grid[0]`).
2.  Apply the segment finding and swapping logic to this extracted 1D row.
3.  Ensure the output format is also a list of lists, containing the single transformed row.
4.  Verify this approach by re-running the logic mentally or with code execution on the examples.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's confirm the structure and the segment finding logic on the first example, assuming the input is `[[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, ...]]`.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 1 Input (as list of lists)
input_grid_1 = [[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

# Convert to numpy array
input_array = np.array(input_grid_1)
print(f"Input Array Shape: {input_array.shape}")

# --- Original Code Logic Applied ---
# non_white_indices_orig = np.where(input_array != 0)[0] # This would fail or give wrong results
# print(f"Original non_white_indices attempt (likely error): {np.where(input_array != 0)}")

# --- Corrected Logic ---
# Access the first row
row_array = input_array[0]
print(f"Row Array Shape: {row_array.shape}")

# Find non-white indices in the row
non_white_indices = np.where(row_array != 0)[0]
print(f"Non-white indices: {non_white_indices}")

if len(non_white_indices) >= 2:
    start_index = np.min(non_white_indices)
    end_index = np.max(non_white_indices)
    print(f"Start Index: {start_index}")
    print(f"End Index: {end_index}")

    # Check contiguity
    is_contiguous = len(non_white_indices) == (end_index - start_index + 1)
    print(f"Is Contiguous: {is_contiguous}")

    if is_contiguous:
        # Perform the swap logic (demonstration)
        output_row = np.copy(row_array)
        single_pixel_color = row_array[start_index]
        block_pixels = row_array[start_index + 1 : end_index + 1]
        output_row[start_index : end_index] = block_pixels
        output_row[end_index] = single_pixel_color
        print(f"Original Row: {row_array.tolist()}")
        print(f"Transformed Row: {output_row.tolist()}")
else:
    print("Not enough non-white pixels found.")
```
```
Input Array Shape: (1, 30)
Row Array Shape: (30,)
Non-white indices: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
Start Index: 1
End Index: 9
Is Contiguous: True
Original Row: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Transformed Row: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```
The code execution confirms:
1.  The input is indeed a 2D array (1xN).
2.  Accessing the first row (`input_array[0]`) is necessary.
3.  The segment finding logic (`np.where`, `min`, `max`, contiguity check) works correctly on the extracted 1D row.
4.  The swap logic correctly transforms the row as intended when applied to the 1D array.

**Updated YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D, but effectively 1D as all examples have only one row.
  input_format: List of lists (e.g., [[...row data...]])
  output_format: List of lists (e.g., [[...transformed row data...]])
  background_color: white (0)

input_characteristics:
  - description: Contains a single row.
  - row_content:
    - Primarily white pixels (0).
    - A single contiguous segment of non-white pixels exists within the row.
    - non_white_segment_composition:
        - object_1:
            type: single_pixel
            color: variable (e.g., yellow=4, red=2, magenta=6)
            location: leftmost pixel of the non_white_segment
        - object_2:
            type: block_of_pixels
            color: variable (e.g., gray=5, orange=7, green=3), different from object_1 color
            length: variable (>= 1 pixel)
            location: immediately right of object_1, composing the rest of the non_white_segment

output_characteristics:
  - description: Contains a single row, mirroring the input structure.
  - row_content:
    - Identical white pixels as the input row in the same positions.
    - A single contiguous segment of non-white pixels, occupying the same span as in the input.
    - non_white_segment_composition:
        - object_1 (from input):
            location: rightmost pixel of the non_white_segment
        - object_2 (from input):
            location: occupies the leftmost part of the segment, shifted one position left from its original relative position within the segment.

transformation:
  - description: Rearranges pixels within the identified non-white segment of the single row.
  - focus: The single row within the 2D input grid.
  - action: Finds the contiguous non-white segment.
  - condition: The segment must contain at least two pixels.
  - steps:
      1. Identify the leftmost pixel (object_1) and the remaining block (object_2) within the segment.
      2. Shift the block (object_2) one position to the left, placing it at the original start position of the segment.
      3. Place the leftmost pixel (object_1) immediately after the shifted block, at the original end position of the segment.
  - invariant: Background white pixels remain unchanged.
  - invariant: The colors and total number of non-white pixels remain unchanged.
  - invariant: The overall start and end indices of the non-white segment remain unchanged.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a grid containing exactly one row.
2.  Extract this single row of pixel data.
3.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within this row. Determine its start and end indices.
4.  If such a sequence exists and contains at least two pixels:
    a.  Store the color of the first pixel in the sequence (the "single pixel").
    b.  Store the sequence of colors of the remaining pixels in the sequence (the "block").
    c.  Create a new row, initially identical to the input row.
    d.  Modify the new row: Place the "block" pixels starting at the original start index of the sequence.
    e.  Modify the new row: Place the "single pixel" color at the original end index of the sequence.
    f.  Return the new row, formatted as a single-element list (to match the required output format, e.g., `[[...transformed row...]]`).
5.  If no such sequence exists (e.g., all white, or only one non-white pixel), return the original input grid unchanged.
