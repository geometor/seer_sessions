            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it treated the input grid as a 1D list (`[0, 4, 5,...]`) while the standard ARC representation is a list of lists (even for a single row, e.g., `[[0, 4, 5,...]]`). This caused the numpy operations, particularly `np.where` and indexing, to work incorrectly on the 2D array representation, leading to the transformation logic not being applied. The core logic of identifying the non-white segment and swapping the first element with the rest appears correct conceptually but needs to be applied to the actual row data (the first element of the input list).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the code to explicitly access the first row of the input grid (e.g., `input_grid[0]`).\n2.  Apply the segment finding and swapping logic to this extracted 1D row.\n3.  Ensure the output format is also a list of lists, containing the single transformed row.\n4.  Verify this approach by re-running the logic mentally or with code execution on the examples.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's confirm the structure and the segment finding logic on the first example, assuming the input is `[[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, ...]]`.\n\n"
