task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D, but effectively 1D as all examples have only one row.
  input_format: List of lists (e.g., [[...row data...]])
  output_format: List of lists (e.g., [[...transformed row data...]])
  background_color: white (0)

input_characteristics:
  - description: Contains a single row.
  - row_content:
    - Primarily white pixels (0).
    - A single contiguous segment of non-white pixels exists within the row.
    - non_white_segment_composition:
        - object_1:
            type: single_pixel
            color: variable (e.g., yellow=4, red=2, magenta=6)
            location: leftmost pixel of the non_white_segment
        - object_2:
            type: block_of_pixels
            color: variable (e.g., gray=5, orange=7, green=3), different from object_1 color
            length: variable (>= 1 pixel)
            location: immediately right of object_1, composing the rest of the non_white_segment

output_characteristics:
  - description: Contains a single row, mirroring the input structure.
  - row_content:
    - Identical white pixels as the input row in the same positions.
    - A single contiguous segment of non-white pixels, occupying the same span as in the input.
    - non_white_segment_composition:
        - object_1 (from input):
            location: rightmost pixel of the non_white_segment
        - object_2 (from input):
            location: occupies the leftmost part of the segment, shifted one position left from its original relative position within the segment.

transformation:
  - description: Rearranges pixels within the identified non-white segment of the single row.
  - focus: The single row within the 2D input grid.
  - action: Finds the contiguous non-white segment.
  - condition: The segment must contain at least two pixels.
  - steps:
      1. Identify the leftmost pixel (object_1) and the remaining block (object_2) within the segment.
      2. Shift the block (object_2) one position to the left, placing it at the original start position of the segment.
      3. Place the leftmost pixel (object_1) immediately after the shifted block, at the original end position of the segment.
  - invariant: Background white pixels remain unchanged.
  - invariant: The colors and total number of non-white pixels remain unchanged.
  - invariant: The overall start and end indices of the non-white segment remain unchanged.
