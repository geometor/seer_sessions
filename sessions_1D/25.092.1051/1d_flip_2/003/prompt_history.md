Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input and output are single rows (1D grids) containing mostly white pixels (0) and a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels. This non-white segment consists of two parts: a single pixel of one color and a block of one or more pixels of another, immediately adjacent color. In all examples, the single pixel appears at the beginning (left side) of the non-white segment. The transformation involves moving the single pixel from the beginning to the end of the non-white segment, effectively swapping its position with the adjacent block. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Locate the starting index and ending index of this non-white sequence.
3.  Isolate the first pixel (the "single pixel") of this sequence.
4.  Isolate the remaining pixels (the "block") of this sequence.
5.  Construct the output row by:
    a.  Copying the white pixels from the beginning of the input row up to the start of the non-white sequence.
    b.  Appending the "block" pixels.
    c.  Appending the "single pixel".
    d.  Copying the remaining white pixels from the end of the input row after the non-white sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed because it treated the input grid as a 1D list (`[0, 4, 5,...]`) while the standard ARC representation is a list of lists (even for a single row, e.g., `[[0, 4, 5,...]]`). This caused the numpy operations, particularly `np.where` and indexing, to work incorrectly on the 2D array representation, leading to the transformation logic not being applied. The core logic of identifying the non-white segment and swapping the first element with the rest appears correct conceptually but needs to be applied to the actual row data (the first element of the input list).

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the code to explicitly access the first row of the input grid (e.g., `input_grid[0]`).
2.  Apply the segment finding and swapping logic to this extracted 1D row.
3.  Ensure the output format is also a list of lists, containing the single transformed row.
4.  Verify this approach by re-running the logic mentally or with code execution on the examples.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's confirm the structure and the segment finding logic on the first example, assuming the input is `[[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, ...]]`.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1 Input (as list of lists)
input_grid_1 = [[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

# Convert to numpy array
input_array = np.array(input_grid_1)
print(f"Input Array Shape: {input_array.shape}")

# --- Original Code Logic Applied ---
# non_white_indices_orig = np.where(input_array != 0)[0] # This would fail or give wrong results
# print(f"Original non_white_indices attempt (likely error): {np.where(input_array != 0)}")

# --- Corrected Logic ---
# Access the first row
row_array = input_array[0]
print(f"Row Array Shape: {row_array.shape}")

# Find non-white indices in the row
non_white_indices = np.where(row_array != 0)[0]
print(f"Non-white indices: {non_white_indices}")

if len(non_white_indices) >= 2:
    start_index = np.min(non_white_indices)
    end_index = np.max(non_white_indices)
    print(f"Start Index: {start_index}")
    print(f"End Index: {end_index}")

    # Check contiguity
    is_contiguous = len(non_white_indices) == (end_index - start_index + 1)
    print(f"Is Contiguous: {is_contiguous}")

    if is_contiguous:
        # Perform the swap logic (demonstration)
        output_row = np.copy(row_array)
        single_pixel_color = row_array[start_index]
        block_pixels = row_array[start_index + 1 : end_index + 1]
        output_row[start_index : end_index] = block_pixels
        output_row[end_index] = single_pixel_color
        print(f"Original Row: {row_array.tolist()}")
        print(f"Transformed Row: {output_row.tolist()}")
else:
    print("Not enough non-white pixels found.")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Input Array Shape: (1, 30)
Row Array Shape: (30,)
Non-white indices: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
Start Index: 1
End Index: 9
Is Contiguous: True
Original Row: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Transformed Row: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```
The code execution confirms:
1.  The input is indeed a 2D array (1xN).
2.  Accessing the first row (`input_array[0]`) is necessary.
3.  The segment finding logic (`np.where`, `min`, `max`, contiguity check) works correctly on the extracted 1D row.
4.  The swap logic correctly transforms the row as intended when applied to the 1D array.

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a grid containing exactly one row.
2.  Extract this single row of pixel data.
3.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within this row. Determine its start and end indices.
4.  If such a sequence exists and contains at least two pixels:
    a.  Store the color of the first pixel in the sequence (the "single pixel").
    b.  Store the sequence of colors of the remaining pixels in the sequence (the "block").
    c.  Create a new row, initially identical to the input row.
    d.  Modify the new row: Place the "block" pixels starting at the original start index of the sequence.
    e.  Modify the new row: Place the "single pixel" color at the original end index of the sequence.
    f.  Return the new row, formatted as a single-element list (to match the required output format, e.g., `[[...transformed row...]]`).
5.  If no such sequence exists (e.g., all white, or only one non-white pixel), return the original input grid unchanged.
