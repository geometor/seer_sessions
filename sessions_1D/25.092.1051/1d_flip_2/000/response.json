This non-white segment consists of two parts: a single pixel of one color and a block of one or more pixels of another, immediately adjacent color. In all examples, the single pixel appears at the beginning (left side) of the non-white segment. The transformation involves moving the single pixel from the beginning to the end of the non-white segment, effectively swapping its position with the adjacent block. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
