task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)

input_characteristics:
  - contains_a_single_contiguous_segment_of_non_white_pixels: True
  - non_white_segment_composition:
      - type: single_pixel
        color: variable (e.g., yellow, red, magenta)
        position: start of the non_white_segment
      - type: block
        color: variable (e.g., gray, orange, green)
        length: variable (>= 1 pixel)
        position: immediately follows the single_pixel

output_characteristics:
  - contains_a_single_contiguous_segment_of_non_white_pixels: True
  - non_white_segment_composition:
      - type: block
        color: same as input block color
        length: same as input block length
        position: start of the non_white_segment
      - type: single_pixel
        color: same as input single_pixel color
        position: immediately follows the block

transformation:
  - description: Positional swap within the non-white segment.
  - element_moved: The single pixel at the start of the non_white_segment.
  - destination: The end of the non_white_segment.
  - effect: The block shifts one position to the left, and the single pixel occupies the position immediately after the shifted block.
  - invariant: Surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
  - invariant: The colors and total length of the non-white segment remain unchanged.
