```python
"""
Transforms a grid containing a single row by finding a contiguous segment of
non-white pixels (colors != 0). Within this segment, it moves the first pixel
to the end of the segment, shifting the remaining pixels in the segment one
position to the left. White pixels (color 0) outside the segment remain unchanged.
The input and output are expected to be lists of lists, even for a single row.
If no valid segment (contiguous, length >= 2) is found, the input is returned unchanged.
