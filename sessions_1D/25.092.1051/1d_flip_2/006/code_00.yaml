task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row, presented as list of lists)
  background_color: white (0)

input_characteristics:
  - contains_a_single_contiguous_segment_of_non_white_pixels: True # The primary object of interest
  - non_white_segment_constraints:
      - minimum_length: 2 pixels # Necessary for the swap operation
  - non_white_segment_composition: # Defining sub-parts of the object
      - type: single_pixel # The first element
        color: variable
        position: start_index (i) of the segment
      - type: block # The remaining elements
        color: variable (can be same or different from single_pixel)
        length: variable (>= 1 pixel)
        position: indices i+1 to end_index (j) of the segment

output_characteristics:
  - identical_dimensions_to_input: True
  - background_pixels_unchanged: True
  - contains_a_single_contiguous_segment_of_non_white_pixels: True # The object persists
  - non_white_segment_composition: # Rearranged sub-parts
      - type: block
        color: same as input block color
        length: same as input block length
        position: indices i to j-1
      - type: single_pixel
        color: same as input single_pixel color
        position: index j

transformation:
  - description: Cyclic permutation (rotation) of elements within the non-white segment.
  - target_object: The contiguous block of non-white pixels (length >= 2).
  - action_1: Identify the segment's start (i) and end (j) indices.
  - action_2: Isolate the first pixel (at index i).
  - action_3: Isolate the remaining pixels (block from i+1 to j).
  - action_4: Shift the block one position left (place it starting at index i).
  - action_5: Place the isolated first pixel at the original end position (index j).
  - invariant: Pixels outside the segment (background) are unchanged.
  - invariant: Colors and count of pixels within the segment are preserved.
