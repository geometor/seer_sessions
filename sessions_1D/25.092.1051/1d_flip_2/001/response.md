"""
Identifies a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid.
Within this segment, swaps the first pixel with the rest of the segment.
Specifically, the first pixel moves to the end of the segment, and the remaining
pixels shift one position to the left to fill the gap.
White pixels outside this segment remain unchanged.
