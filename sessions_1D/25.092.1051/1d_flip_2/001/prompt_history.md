Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input and output are single rows (1D grids) containing mostly white pixels (0) and a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels. This non-white segment consists of two parts: a single pixel of one color and a block of one or more pixels of another, immediately adjacent color. In all examples, the single pixel appears at the beginning (left side) of the non-white segment. The transformation involves moving the single pixel from the beginning to the end of the non-white segment, effectively swapping its position with the adjacent block. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)

input_characteristics:
  - contains_a_single_contiguous_segment_of_non_white_pixels: True
  - non_white_segment_composition:
      - type: single_pixel
        color: variable (e.g., yellow, red, magenta)
        position: start of the non_white_segment
      - type: block
        color: variable (e.g., gray, orange, green)
        length: variable (>= 1 pixel)
        position: immediately follows the single_pixel

output_characteristics:
  - contains_a_single_contiguous_segment_of_non_white_pixels: True
  - non_white_segment_composition:
      - type: block
        color: same as input block color
        length: same as input block length
        position: start of the non_white_segment
      - type: single_pixel
        color: same as input single_pixel color
        position: immediately follows the block

transformation:
  - description: Positional swap within the non-white segment.
  - element_moved: The single pixel at the start of the non_white_segment.
  - destination: The end of the non_white_segment.
  - effect: The block shifts one position to the left, and the single pixel occupies the position immediately after the shifted block.
  - invariant: Surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
  - invariant: The colors and total length of the non-white segment remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Locate the starting index and ending index of this non-white sequence.
3.  Isolate the first pixel (the "single pixel") of this sequence.
4.  Isolate the remaining pixels (the "block") of this sequence.
5.  Construct the output row by:
    a.  Copying the white pixels from the beginning of the input row up to the start of the non-white sequence.
    b.  Appending the "block" pixels.
    c.  Appending the "single pixel".
    d.  Copying the remaining white pixels from the end of the input row after the non-white sequence.
