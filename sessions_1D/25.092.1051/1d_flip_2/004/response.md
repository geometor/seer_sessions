## General Assessment

The initial code failed to transform any of the training examples, consistently outputting the original input. Subsequent analysis using `tool_code` confirmed that the core logic for identifying the non-white segment (`find_non_white_segment`) and manipulating the NumPy array to perform the swap was correct. Executing the full transformation function within the `tool_code` environment successfully produced the expected outputs for all examples.

This indicates the discrepancy likely stemmed from an execution artifact or a subtle difference in the previously tested code version, rather than a flaw in the fundamental understanding or the core logic derived from the observations. The strategy is to proceed with the validated logic and the initial natural language program, which accurately reflects the transformation seen in the examples.

## Metrics

Code execution (`tool_code`) analysis confirms:
*   **Input Structure:** Each input grid is a list containing a single list (representing a 1D row).
*   **Object Identification:** Each input row contains exactly one contiguous segment of non-white pixels (color > 0). This segment acts as the primary object of interest.
*   **Object Properties:** The non-white segment always consists of at least two pixels. It starts with a single pixel of one color, immediately followed by one or more pixels of a second, different color.
    *   Example 1: Yellow pixel (4) followed by Gray block (5). Segment indices: 1 to 9.
    *   Example 2: Red pixel (2) followed by Orange block (7). Segment indices: 7 to 15.
    *   Example 3: Magenta pixel (6) followed by Green block (3). Segment indices: 14 to 25.
*   **Transformation Validation:** The `find_non_white_segment` function correctly returns the start and end indices for the non-white segment in all examples. The array manipulation logic (extracting the first pixel, extracting the block, reassigning them in swapped order) correctly transforms the input segment to the output segment format.
*   **Output Structure:** The output grid matches the input grid's structure (list containing a single list). The non-white segment in the output has the block pixels shifted left by one position, and the original first pixel moved to the end of the segment. White pixels remain unchanged.
*   **Code Correctness:** The `transform_corrected` function tested via `tool_code` produced outputs matching the expected outputs for all three training examples.

        position: end_index (j)
  properties:
    - colors: same two distinct non-zero colors as input
    - length: same total length as input segment

action:
  - name: identify_segment
    target: input row
    output: start_index (i), end_index (j) of the non-white segment
  - name: conditional_check
    condition: segment must exist and have length >= 2
  - name: rearrange_segment
    input_elements: pixel at index i, block from i+1 to j
    output_placement: block placed at i to j-1, pixel placed at j
    effect: The first element of the segment is moved to the last position within the segment's original span.

invariants:
  - Grid dimensions (always 1 row in examples)
  - Background (white) pixels' positions and color
  - The set of colors present in the non-white segment
  - The total length of the non-white segment
  - The start index (i) and end index (j) defining the segment's span

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single row within the input grid.
2.  Scan the row to find the contiguous sequence (segment) of non-white pixels (colors other than 0).
3.  Determine the starting index (`i`) and ending index (`j`) of this segment.
4.  Check if such a segment exists and if its length (`j - i + 1`) is at least 2. If not, return the original input grid.
5.  Make a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
6.  Get the color of the pixel at the starting index `i` of the input row (this is the "single pixel").
7.  Get the sequence of colors from index `i + 1` to `j` of the input row (this is the "block").
8.  In the output row, place the "block" sequence into the indices `i` through `j - 1`.
9.  In the output row, place the color of the "single pixel" at index `j`.
10. Return the modified output row, formatted as a grid (a list containing the single modified row).
