task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row within a list of lists format)
  background_color: white (0)

input_object:
  type: contiguous_segment
  location: within the single row, surrounded by background pixels
  composition:
    - part_1:
        type: single_pixel
        color: variable (non-zero)
        position: start_index (i)
    - part_2:
        type: block
        color: variable (non-zero, different from part_1 color in examples)
        length: >= 1 pixel
        position: spans indices i+1 to end_index (j)
  properties:
    - colors: two distinct non-zero colors present
    - length: total number of non-white pixels (j - i + 1), guaranteed >= 2

output_object:
  type: contiguous_segment
  location: same start_index (i) as input segment
  composition:
    - part_1: (derived from input part_2)
        type: block
        color: same as input block color
        length: same as input block length
        position: spans indices i to j-1
    - part_2: (derived from input part_1)
        type: single_pixel
        color: same as input single_pixel color
        position: end_index (j)
  properties:
    - colors: same two distinct non-zero colors as input
    - length: same total length as input segment

action:
  - name: identify_segment
    target: input row
    output: start_index (i), end_index (j) of the non-white segment
  - name: conditional_check
    condition: segment must exist and have length >= 2
  - name: rearrange_segment
    input_elements: pixel at index i, block from i+1 to j
    output_placement: block placed at i to j-1, pixel placed at j
    effect: The first element of the segment is moved to the last position within the segment's original span.

invariants:
  - Grid dimensions (always 1 row in examples)
  - Background (white) pixels' positions and color
  - The set of colors present in the non-white segment
  - The total length of the non-white segment
  - The start index (i) and end index (j) defining the segment's span
