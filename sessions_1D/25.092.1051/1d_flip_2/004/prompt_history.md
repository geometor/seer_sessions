Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input and output are single rows (1D grids) containing mostly white pixels (0) and a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels. This non-white segment consists of two parts: a single pixel of one color and a block of one or more pixels of another, immediately adjacent color. In all examples, the single pixel appears at the beginning (left side) of the non-white segment. The transformation involves moving the single pixel from the beginning to the end of the non-white segment, effectively swapping its position with the adjacent block. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)

input_characteristics:
  - contains_a_single_contiguous_segment_of_non_white_pixels: True
  - non_white_segment_composition:
      - type: single_pixel
        color: variable (e.g., yellow, red, magenta)
        position: start of the non_white_segment
      - type: block
        color: variable (e.g., gray, orange, green)
        length: variable (>= 1 pixel)
        position: immediately follows the single_pixel

output_characteristics:
  - contains_a_single_contiguous_segment_of_non_white_pixels: True
  - non_white_segment_composition:
      - type: block
        color: same as input block color
        length: same as input block length
        position: start of the non_white_segment
      - type: single_pixel
        color: same as input single_pixel color
        position: immediately follows the block

transformation:
  - description: Positional swap within the non-white segment.
  - element_moved: The single pixel at the start of the non_white_segment.
  - destination: The end of the non_white_segment.
  - effect: The block shifts one position to the left, and the single pixel occupies the position immediately after the shifted block.
  - invariant: Surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
  - invariant: The colors and total length of the non-white segment remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Locate the starting index and ending index of this non-white sequence.
3.  Isolate the first pixel (the "single pixel") of this sequence.
4.  Isolate the remaining pixels (the "block") of this sequence.
5.  Construct the output row by:
    a.  Copying the white pixels from the beginning of the input row up to the start of the non-white sequence.
    b.  Appending the "block" pixels.
    c.  Appending the "single pixel".
    d.  Copying the remaining white pixels from the end of the input row after the non-white sequence.
```python
"""
Identifies a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid.
Within this segment, swaps the first pixel with the rest of the segment.
Specifically, the first pixel moves to the end of the segment, and the remaining
pixels shift one position to the left to fill the gap.
White pixels outside this segment remain unchanged.
