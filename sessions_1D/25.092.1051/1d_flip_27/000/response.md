Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (single rows).
*   **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) as a background color. Within this background, there's a sequence of non-white pixels.
*   **Objects:**
    *   **Background:** White pixels (0) frame the active area.
    *   **Marker Pixel:** A single pixel of one non-white color.
    *   **Block Object:** A contiguous sequence of pixels of a second, distinct non-white color.
*   **Arrangement (Input):** The non-white pixels appear as a sequence: `[Marker Pixel] [Block Object]`. This sequence is surrounded by background pixels.
*   **Transformation:** The core action appears to be a swap of the positions of the Marker Pixel and the Block Object. The background pixels remain unchanged relative to the grid boundaries.
*   **Arrangement (Output):** The sequence becomes `[Block Object] [Marker Pixel]`, still surrounded by the same background pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 1-dimensional array (row)
      - background_color: white (0)
  - element: Marker Pixel
    properties:
      - count: 1
      - color: non-white
      - role: identifies the start of the sequence to be modified
      - position: immediately precedes the Block Object in the input
  - element: Block Object
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of pixels
      - color: non-white, uniform within the block, different from the Marker Pixel
      - role: the object to be swapped with the Marker Pixel
      - position: immediately follows the Marker Pixel in the input
actions:
  - action: Identify
    target: Marker Pixel
    details: Locate the first non-background pixel.
  - action: Identify
    target: Block Object
    details: Locate the contiguous sequence of identical pixels immediately following the Marker Pixel.
  - action: Swap
    objects:
      - Marker Pixel
      - Block Object
    details: Exchange the grid positions occupied by the Marker Pixel and the Block Object. The relative order within the Block Object is maintained.
relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    between: [Marker Pixel, Block Object]
    details: In the input, the Marker Pixel is immediately to the left of the Block Object.
  - type: Containment
    container: Grid
    contains: [Background, Marker Pixel, Block Object]
  - type: Invariance
    element: Background Pixels
    details: The positions and color of the background pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid identical to the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first non-white pixel. This is the 'Marker Pixel'. Record its color (`marker_color`) and its index (`marker_index`).
3.  Continue scanning from the position immediately after the 'Marker Pixel' (`marker_index + 1`). Identify the contiguous sequence of pixels that all share the same color, which is different from `marker_color`. This is the 'Block Object'. Record the color of the block (`block_color`), its starting index (`block_start_index`, which equals `marker_index + 1`), its ending index (`block_end_index`), and its length (`block_length = block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).
4.  Modify the output grid:
    a.  Place the pixels of the 'Block Object' (color `block_color`) into the output grid starting at the original `marker_index` and extending for `block_length` positions.
    b.  Place the 'Marker Pixel' (color `marker_color`) into the output grid at the index immediately following the newly placed 'Block Object' (index `marker_index + block_length`).
5.  The background pixels (white, 0) remain in their original positions in the output grid where they do not conflict with the repositioned Marker and Block.
