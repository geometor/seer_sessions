Within this background, there's a sequence of non-white pixels.\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** White pixels (0) frame the active area.\n    *   **Marker Pixel:** A single pixel of one non-white color.\n    *   **Block Object:** A contiguous sequence of pixels of a second, distinct non-white color.\n*   **Arrangement (Input):** The non-white pixels appear as a sequence: `[Marker Pixel] [Block Object]`. This sequence is surrounded by background pixels.\n*   **Transformation:** The core action appears to be a swap of the positions of the Marker Pixel and the Block Object. The background pixels remain unchanged relative to the grid boundaries.\n*   **Arrangement (Output):** The sequence becomes `[Block Object] [Marker Pixel]`, still surrounded by the same background pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

This is the 'Marker Pixel'. Record its color (`marker_color`) and its index (`marker_index`).\n3.  Continue scanning from the position immediately after the 'Marker Pixel' (`marker_index + 1`). Identify the contiguous sequence of pixels that all share the same color, which is different from `marker_color`. This is the 'Block Object'. Record the color of the block (`block_color`), its starting index (`block_start_index`, which equals `marker_index + 1`), its ending index (`block_end_index`), and its length (`block_length = block_end_index - block_start_index + 1`).\n4.  Modify the output grid:\n    a.  Place the pixels of the 'Block Object' (color `block_color`) into the output grid starting at the original `marker_index` and extending for `block_length` positions.\n    b.  Place the 'Marker Pixel' (color `marker_color`) into the output grid at the index immediately following the newly placed 'Block Object' (index `marker_index + block_length`).\n5.  The background pixels (white, 0) remain in their original positions in the output grid where they do not conflict with the repositioned Marker and Block."
