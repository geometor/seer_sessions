task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 1-dimensional array (row)
      - background_color: white (0)
  - element: Marker Pixel
    properties:
      - count: 1
      - color: non-white
      - role: identifies the start of the sequence to be modified
      - position: immediately precedes the Block Object in the input
  - element: Block Object
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of pixels
      - color: non-white, uniform within the block, different from the Marker Pixel
      - role: the object to be swapped with the Marker Pixel
      - position: immediately follows the Marker Pixel in the input
actions:
  - action: Identify
    target: Marker Pixel
    details: Locate the first non-background pixel.
  - action: Identify
    target: Block Object
    details: Locate the contiguous sequence of identical pixels immediately following the Marker Pixel.
  - action: Swap
    objects:
      - Marker Pixel
      - Block Object
    details: Exchange the grid positions occupied by the Marker Pixel and the Block Object. The relative order within the Block Object is maintained.

  - type: Adjacency
    between: [Marker Pixel, Block Object]
    details: In the input, the Marker Pixel is immediately to the left of the Block Object.
  - type: Containment
    container: Grid
    contains: [Background, Marker Pixel, Block Object]
  - type: Invariance
    element: Background Pixels
    details: The positions and color of the background pixels remain unchanged.
