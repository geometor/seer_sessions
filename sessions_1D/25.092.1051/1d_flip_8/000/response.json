The core transformation seems to involve rearranging a contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the row, while leaving the white (zero) pixels untouched in their positions. Specifically, the first pixel in the non-white sequence is moved to the end of that sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n"
