task_description: Modify a sequence of non-background pixels within a 1D grid.
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1xN
  output: 1xN
pixel_colors:
  - 0: white (background)
  - 2: red
  - 3: green
  - 4: yellow
  - 5: gray
objects:
  - type: background
    color: 0
    description: Stationary pixels defining the boundaries or padding.
  - type: sequence
    color: non-zero
    description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
relationships:
  - The non-white sequence is embedded within the white background pixels (or positioned at the start/end of the row).
actions:
  - identify: Locate the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
  - extract: Isolate this sequence.
  - transform: Perform a left cyclic shift on the extracted sequence (move the first element to the end).
  - replace: Place the transformed sequence back into the original positions occupied by the non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - preserve: Keep the white background pixels in their original positions.
