Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception:**
The input and output are both single rows (1D grids). The core transformation seems to involve rearranging a contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the row, while leaving the white (zero) pixels untouched in their positions. Specifically, the first pixel in the non-white sequence is moved to the end of that sequence.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_description: Modify a sequence of non-background pixels within a 1D grid.
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1xN
  output: 1xN
pixel_colors:
  - 0: white (background)
  - 2: red
  - 3: green
  - 4: yellow
  - 5: gray
objects:
  - type: background
    color: 0
    description: Stationary pixels defining the boundaries or padding.
  - type: sequence
    color: non-zero
    description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
relationships:
  - The non-white sequence is embedded within the white background pixels (or positioned at the start/end of the row).
actions:
  - identify: Locate the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
  - extract: Isolate this sequence.
  - transform: Perform a left cyclic shift on the extracted sequence (move the first element to the end).
  - replace: Place the transformed sequence back into the original positions occupied by the non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - preserve: Keep the white background pixels in their original positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**
1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Extract this sequence.
3.  Modify the extracted sequence by moving its first element (pixel) to the end of the sequence.
4.  Create the output row by placing the modified sequence back into the same positions it occupied in the input row, keeping all white pixels in their original locations.
