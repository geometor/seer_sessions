"""
Identifies a contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels in a 1D input grid.
Performs a left cyclic shift on this sequence: the first pixel moves to the end, 
and all other pixels shift one position left. White (zero) pixels remain unchanged.
If no non-white sequence exists, the grid is returned unmodified.
