task_type: array_manipulation_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: A single contiguous sequence of one or more adjacent non-white pixels (colors 1-9). Assumed to be unique per grid.
    properties:
      - colors: The sequence of colors in the block.
      - location: Start and end indices within the 1D grid.
      - length: Number of pixels in the block.
actions:
  - name: find_non_white_block
    description: Identify the start and end indices of the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
  - name: extract_block_segment
    description: Extract the sub-array corresponding to the non-white block from the input grid.
  - name: left_cyclic_shift_segment
    description: Apply a left cyclic shift to the extracted block segment (first element moves to the last position). If the segment has 0 or 1 elements, it remains unchanged.
  - name: replace_segment
    description: Place the shifted (or unchanged) segment back into the original grid positions.
constraints:
  - White pixels (0) outside the block remain unchanged.
  - Only the identified non-white block is potentially modified.
  - There is exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels in each input grid.
