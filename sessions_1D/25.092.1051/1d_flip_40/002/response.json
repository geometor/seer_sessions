            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: a left cyclic shift applied exclusively to the contiguous block of non-white pixels within a 1D grid. However, the provided Python code failed to implement this transformation correctly, returning the input grid unchanged for all training examples. The results show 2 pixels off in each case, corresponding precisely to the first and last elements of the non-white block that should have been swapped during the cyclic shift.\n\nThe failure likely stems from the `find_contiguous_non_white_block` function not correctly identifying the start and end indices of the block, or potentially an issue in how the `transform` function uses these indices or applies the `np.roll` operation. The core logic of the natural language program appears sound, but its translation into code was flawed.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the output of the `find_contiguous_non_white_block` function using the training inputs to confirm if it correctly identifies the block boundaries.\n2.  Simplify the block identification logic if necessary.\n3.  Ensure the identified block is correctly extracted, shifted, and replaced in the `transform` function.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\nLet's use code execution to test the `find_contiguous_non_white_block` function from the previous attempt.\n"
