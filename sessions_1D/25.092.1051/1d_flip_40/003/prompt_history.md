*   **Perception:** The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (single rows). Each grid contains a sequence of pixels, primarily white (0), interspersed with a contiguous block of non-white pixels (colors 1-9). The transformation specifically targets this contiguous block of non-white pixels, leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged. Within the non-white block, the first pixel is moved to the end of the block, and all subsequent pixels in the block shift one position to the left to fill the vacated space. This is effectively a left cyclic shift applied only to the sequence of non-white pixels.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: a left cyclic shift applied exclusively to the contiguous block of non-white pixels within a 1D grid. However, the provided Python code failed to implement this transformation correctly, returning the input grid unchanged for all training examples. The results show 2 pixels off in each case, corresponding precisely to the first and last elements of the non-white block that should have been swapped during the cyclic shift.

The failure likely stems from the `find_contiguous_non_white_block` function not correctly identifying the start and end indices of the block, or potentially an issue in how the `transform` function uses these indices or applies the `np.roll` operation. The core logic of the natural language program appears sound, but its translation into code was flawed.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the output of the `find_contiguous_non_white_block` function using the training inputs to confirm if it correctly identifies the block boundaries.
2.  Simplify the block identification logic if necessary.
3.  Ensure the identified block is correctly extracted, shifted, and replaced in the `transform` function.

**Metrics Gathering:**
Let's use code execution to test the `find_contiguous_non_white_block` function from the previous attempt.

    start_index = non_white_indices[0]
    end_index = non_white_indices[0]

    for i in range(1, len(non_white_indices)):
        if non_white_indices[i] == non_white_indices[i-1] + 1:
            end_index = non_white_indices[i]
        else:
            break 
            
    # Verification logic (potentially flawed)
    # Check if the length of the identified segment matches the count of non-zero elements within that segment
    # This check seems unnecessarily complex and might be the source of error if the segment isn't perfectly contiguous
    # according to this specific check, even if visually it is.
    
    # Simplified check: If we found non-white pixels, the loop above should correctly find the end of the *first* contiguous block.
    if len(non_white_indices) > 0:
         return start_index, end_index
             
    return None, None # Fallback

Example 3: Input=[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 0], Found Block Indices=(7, 9)

```
**Analysis of Metrics:**

The `find_contiguous_non_white_block` function *correctly* identifies the start and end indices for all training examples. This means the error is not in identifying the block, but in the subsequent logic within the `transform` function.

Looking back at the `transform` function:

```python
    # ... (block identification) ...
    
    # Check if the block has more than one element to shift
    if start_index == end_index: #<<< THIS CONDITION IS THE PROBLEM
        # Single element block, no shift needed
        return output_grid 
        
    # ... (extraction, shift, replacement) ...
```

The condition `if start_index == end_index:` was intended to skip the shift for single-element blocks. However, it was incorrectly placed *before* the block extraction and shifting logic, causing the function to *always* return the original grid if the start and end indices were different (i.e., for blocks longer than one element). The check should happen *after* extraction or be integrated differently. The simplest fix is to remove this premature return, as `np.roll` handles single-element arrays correctly (it returns them unchanged).

**Updated YAML Facts:**

constraints:

```


**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the 1D input grid.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Identify the start and end indices of the contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
4.  If no non-white pixels are found (start index is None), return the unchanged output grid copy.
5.  Extract the sub-array (the block) from the input grid using the identified start and end indices.
6.  Perform a left cyclic shift on the extracted block sub-array (using `np.roll(block, -1)` or equivalent logic: move the first element to the end, shift others left). Note: If the block has only one element, this operation effectively does nothing.
7.  Place the shifted block sub-array back into the output grid copy at the original start and end indices.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
