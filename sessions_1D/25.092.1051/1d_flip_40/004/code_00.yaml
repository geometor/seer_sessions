task_type: array_manipulation_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_non_white_block
    description: The single contiguous sequence of adjacent non-white pixels (values 1-9) within the 1D grid. Assumes exactly one such block exists if any non-white pixels are present.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by start_index and end_index.
      - values: An ordered list of the color values within the block.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
actions:
  - name: find_block
    description: Identify the start and end indices of the contiguous non-white block.
  - name: check_block_length
    description: Determine if the block contains more than one pixel.
  - name: extract_block_values
    description: Get the sequence of color values from the identified block.
  - name: left_cyclic_shift_values
    description: Modify the extracted sequence by moving the first value to the end and shifting all other values one position to the left. This action only applies if the block length is greater than 1.
  - name: replace_block_values
    description: Update the grid by replacing the original block values with the shifted values at the original block location (start_index to end_index).
constraints:
  - Only one contiguous block of non-white pixels is expected per input grid.
  - White pixels (0) remain unchanged.
  - If no non-white block exists, or the block has only one pixel, the grid remains unchanged.
  - The transformation only modifies the *values* within the block, not the block's position or the grid size.
