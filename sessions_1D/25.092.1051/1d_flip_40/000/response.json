Each grid contains a sequence of pixels, primarily white (0), interspersed with a contiguous block of non-white pixels (colors 1-9). The transformation specifically targets this contiguous block of non-white pixels, leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged. Within the non-white block, the first pixel is moved to the end of the block, and all subsequent pixels in the block shift one position to the left to fill the vacated space. This is effectively a left cyclic shift applied only to the sequence of non-white pixels.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
