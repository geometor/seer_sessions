*   **Perception:** The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (single rows). Each grid contains a sequence of pixels, primarily white (0), interspersed with a contiguous block of non-white pixels (colors 1-9). The transformation specifically targets this contiguous block of non-white pixels, leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged. Within the non-white block, the first pixel is moved to the end of the block, and all subsequent pixels in the block shift one position to the left to fill the vacated space. This is effectively a left cyclic shift applied only to the sequence of non-white pixels.

```yaml
    task_type: array_manipulation_1d
    grid_dimensionality: 1
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        description: A sequence of one or more adjacent non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - colors: A list of colors (values 1-9) in the sequence.
          - location: Start and end indices within the 1D grid.
          - length: Number of pixels in the block.
    actions:
      - name: identify_non_white_block
        description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
      - name: extract_block
        description: Isolate the sequence of non-white pixels.
      - name: left_cyclic_shift
        description: Move the first element of the extracted sequence to the end, shifting all other elements one position to the left.
        target: extracted_non_white_block
      - name: replace_block
        description: Place the shifted sequence back into the original grid positions occupied by the non-white block.
    constraints:
      - White pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions.
      - Only the non-white block is modified.
      - There is exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels in each input.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row. Determine the start and end indices of this sequence.
    2.  If no non-white sequence exists, the output is identical to the input.
    3.  If a non-white sequence exists:
        a.  Extract the sequence of colors from this block.
        b.  Store the color of the first pixel in the sequence.
        c.  Shift all subsequent pixels in the sequence one position to the left.
        d.  Place the stored first pixel's color into the last position of the sequence.
        e.  Create the output row by keeping the white pixels in their original positions and placing the modified non-white sequence back into its original index range.
