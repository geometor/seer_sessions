"""
Identifies the single contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels in a 1D input grid. 
Performs a left cyclic shift on the values within this sequence: the first pixel's value moves 
to the end of the sequence, and all other values in the sequence shift one position 
to the left. White (zero) pixels outside this sequence remain unchanged. If no 
non-white sequence exists, or the sequence has only one pixel, the grid is returned unmodified.
