*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: a left cyclic shift applied exclusively to the contiguous block of non-white pixels within a 1D grid. The Python code developed from this understanding (`transform` function using `find_contiguous_non_white_block` and `np.roll`) accurately implements this logic. Direct execution testing confirmed the code produces the correct output for all training examples. The previously reported execution failures were likely due to external factors (e.g., testing environment setup, copy-paste errors) rather than a flaw in the algorithm or its implementation. The existing code and natural language program are sound and require no significant changes based on the training examples.

*   **Metrics:**
    The `tool_code` execution confirmed the following for each example:
    *   The `find_contiguous_non_white_block` function correctly identifies the start and end indices of the non-white block.
        *   Example 1: Input `[0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Indices `(1, 5)`
        *   Example 2: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]` -> Indices `(4, 8)`
        *   Example 3: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 0]` -> Indices `(7, 9)`
    *   The `transform` function correctly performs the left cyclic shift on the identified block and reconstructs the grid.
        *   Example 1: Block `[6, 2, 2, 2, 2]` -> Shifted `[2, 2, 2, 2, 6]` -> Output `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
        *   Example 2: Block `[3, 4, 4, 4, 4]` -> Shifted `[4, 4, 4, 4, 3]` -> Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]`
        *   Example 3: Block `[5, 6, 6]` -> Shifted `[6, 6, 5]` -> Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 5, 0]`
    *   All examples involve 1x11 grids containing a single contiguous non-white block surrounded by white pixels.
    *   The transformation consistently leaves white pixels untouched and only modifies the non-white block via a left cyclic shift if its length is greater than 1.

```yaml
    task_type: array_manipulation_1d
    grid_dimensionality: 1
    input_pattern: Single row (1D array)
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        description: The single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (values 1-9) present in the input row.
        properties:
          - colors: The sequence of color values within the block.
          - location: Defined by start and end indices within the 1D grid.
          - length: Number of pixels in the block (must be > 0).
    actions:
      - name: find_non_white_block
        description: Locate the start and end indices of the single contiguous non-white block.
      - name: left_cyclic_shift_block
        description: >
          If the identified block contains more than one pixel, perform a left
          cyclic shift on the sequence of pixel values within that block.
          The value of the first pixel moves to the last position of the block,
          and the values of all other pixels shift one position to the left.
        target: contiguous_non_white_block
        condition: Block length > 1
      - name: reconstruct_grid
        description: Create the output grid by placing the (potentially shifted) sequence of non-white pixel values back into its original location (indices) within the grid, preserving all background white pixels.
    constraints:
      - Each input grid contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      - White pixels (0) always remain in their original positions and are never part of the shifted block.
      - If the non-white block contains only one pixel, or if no non-white block exists, the grid remains unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input row to find the single contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels (any color from 1 to 9). Record the starting and ending index of this block.
    2.  If no such block exists, or if the block found contains only a single pixel, the output is identical to the input.
    3.  If the block contains two or more pixels:
        a.  Extract the sequence of color values corresponding to the pixels within the block.
        b.  Modify this sequence by performing a left cyclic shift: take the first color value from the sequence and move it to the end, shifting all intermediate color values one position to the left.
        c.  Construct the output row by replacing the segment of the original input row defined by the block's start and end indices with the modified sequence of color values. All pixels outside this segment (the surrounding white pixels) remain unchanged.
