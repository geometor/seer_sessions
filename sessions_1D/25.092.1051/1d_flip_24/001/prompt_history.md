*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (single rows).
    *   Each input grid contains a sequence of white pixels (0) and a single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    *   This non-white block always consists of exactly two distinct colors.
    *   One of these colors appears exactly once (singleton color), and the other color appears multiple times consecutively (repeated color block).
    *   The transformation involves swapping the position of the singleton color pixel with the entire block of the repeated color pixels, within the bounds of the non-white segment.
    *   The white pixels surrounding the non-white block remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_manipulation
    input_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    output_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    grid_elements:
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)
        role: background/padding
      - type: pixel_sequence
        color: non-white
        role: foreground_object
        properties:
          - contiguity: contiguous
          - composition: exactly two distinct non-white colors
          - structure: one color appears once (singleton), the other appears multiple times consecutively (repeated_block)
    actions:
      - identify: locate the start and end of the non-white sequence
      - analyze: determine the singleton color and the repeated color within the sequence
      - swap: exchange the position of the singleton pixel with the entire repeated_block
      - reconstruct: place the modified sequence back into the original grid structure, keeping background pixels fixed
    relationships:
      - the non-white sequence is bounded by white pixels or grid edges
      - the singleton pixel is adjacent to one end of the repeated_block within the sequence
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels in the input row. Define its start and end indices.
    2.  Within this segment, identify the two distinct colors present.
    3.  Determine which color is the 'singleton' (appears once) and which forms the 'repeated block' (appears multiple times).
    4.  Create a new segment by swapping the position of the singleton pixel and the entire repeated block. If the singleton was at the start of the original segment, place the repeated block first, followed by the singleton in the new segment. If the singleton was at the end of the original segment, place the singleton first, followed by the repeated block in the new segment.
    5.  Construct the output row by keeping all white pixels (0) in their original positions and replacing the original non-white segment with the newly created segment at the same start and end indices.
