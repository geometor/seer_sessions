Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of a single row (1D grid) as input and a single row as output. The rows have varying lengths but contain sequences of numbers (colors).
2.  **Key Elements:** The inputs feature a contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels surrounded by white (zero) pixels. This non-white block seems to be the focus of the transformation.
3.  **Block Structure:** Within the non-white block, there's a distinct pattern: a single pixel of one color is immediately followed by a sequence of one or more pixels of a *different*, single color.
    *   Example 1: `2` followed by `8`s.
    *   Example 2: `6` followed by `7`s.
    *   Example 3: `3` followed by `6`s.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to modify the order within this non-white block. Specifically, the single starting pixel (the 'marker') is moved to the end of the sequence of the other color pixels. The sequence pixels themselves maintain their relative order (which is trivial since they are all the same color).
5.  **Background:** The white (zero) pixels surrounding the non-white block remain unchanged in their positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    colors: non-zero
    structure:
      - type: pixel
        role: marker
        quantity: 1
        color: variable (e.g., 2, 6, 3)
      - type: sequence
        role: body
        quantity: variable (>= 1)
        color: variable (e.g., 8, 7, 6), must be different from marker color
    relationship: marker immediately precedes body sequence
actions:
  - type: reposition
    target: marker_pixel
    destination: immediately after the end of the body_sequence
invariance:
  - background_pixels (color 0) remain unchanged
  - relative position of the entire modified block within the background remains unchanged
  - color and quantity of pixels within the body_sequence remain unchanged
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Check if this sequence starts with a single pixel of one color (the "marker") followed immediately by one or more pixels of a second, different, uniform color (the "body sequence").
3.  If this structure is found, create the output row by:
    a.  Keeping the white pixels before the sequence unchanged.
    b.  Placing the "body sequence" pixels.
    c.  Placing the "marker" pixel immediately after the body sequence.
    d.  Keeping the white pixels after the original sequence unchanged.
4.  If the specific structure (marker followed by uniform body sequence) is not found in the non-white block, the input is returned unchanged (assumption based on simplicity, though no counter-examples are given).
