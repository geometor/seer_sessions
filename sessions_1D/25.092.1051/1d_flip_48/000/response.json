The rows have varying lengths but contain sequences of numbers (colors).\n2.  **Key Elements:** The inputs feature a contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels surrounded by white (zero) pixels. This non-white block seems to be the focus of the transformation.\n3.  **Block Structure:** Within the non-white block, there's a distinct pattern: a single pixel of one color is immediately followed by a sequence of one or more pixels of a *different*, single color.\n    *   Example 1: `2` followed by `8`s.\n    *   Example 2: `6` followed by `7`s.\n    *   Example 3: `3` followed by `6`s.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to modify the order within this non-white block. Specifically, the single starting pixel (the 'marker') is moved to the end of the sequence of the other color pixels. The sequence pixels themselves maintain their relative order (which is trivial since they are all the same color).\n5.  **Background:** The white (zero) pixels surrounding the non-white block remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
