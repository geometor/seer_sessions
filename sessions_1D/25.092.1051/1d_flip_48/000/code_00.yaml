task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    colors: non-zero
    structure:
      - type: pixel
        role: marker
        quantity: 1
        color: variable (e.g., 2, 6, 3)
      - type: sequence
        role: body
        quantity: variable (>= 1)
        color: variable (e.g., 8, 7, 6), must be different from marker color
    relationship: marker immediately precedes body sequence
actions:
  - type: reposition
    target: marker_pixel
    destination: immediately after the end of the body_sequence
invariance:
  - background_pixels (color 0) remain unchanged
  - relative position of the entire modified block within the background remains unchanged
  - color and quantity of pixels within the body_sequence remain unchanged
