task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D # or 1xN 2D grid
  background_color: white (0)
  relevant_pixels: non-white pixels

identified_objects:
  - object_type: background
    color: white (0)
    action: remains static
  - object_type: segment
    description: a contiguous block of non-white pixels found in the input
    composition: consists of two adjacent sub-objects
    sub_objects:
      - object_A:
          description: a single pixel of a non-white color
          properties:
            - color: variable (e.g., red, yellow)
            - size: 1 pixel
      - object_B:
          description: a contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of another, identical non-white color
          properties:
            - color: variable, different from object_A (e.g., yellow, orange, green)
            - size: variable (>= 1 pixel)
    relationship: object_A and object_B are always adjacent within the segment

transformation:
  action: swap_positions
  operands: [object_A, object_B]
  description: The position occupied by object_A in the input is occupied by object_B in the output, and the position occupied by object_B in the input is occupied by object_A in the output.
  invariants:
    - colors of object_A and object_B
    - sizes of object_A and object_B
    - position and color of background pixels
