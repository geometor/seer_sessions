Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Background:** The grids primarily consist of white pixels (0).
3.  **Foreground Objects:** Each input grid contains a contiguous block of non-white pixels. This block is composed of two distinct, adjacent sub-blocks (objects):
    *   One object is always a single pixel of a specific color (e.g., red in train_1, yellow in train_2, yellow in train_3).
    *   The other object is a sequence (one or more pixels) of another identical color (e.g., yellow in train_1, orange in train_2, green in train_3).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves swapping the positions of these two adjacent, non-white objects. The single pixel object moves to occupy the space previously held by the sequence object, and the sequence object moves to occupy the space previously held by the single pixel object.
5.  **Invariance:** The white background pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color. The colors and sizes (number of pixels) of the two non-white objects are preserved during the swap.

**YAML Facts:**

  grid_dimensionality: 1D # or 1xN 2D grid
  background_color: white (0)
  relevant_pixels: non-white pixels

  - object_type: background

    action: remains static
  - object_type: segment
    description: a contiguous block of non-white pixels found in the input
    composition: consists of two adjacent sub-objects
    sub_objects:
      - object_A:
          description: a single pixel of a non-white color
          properties:
            - color: variable (e.g., red, yellow)
            - size: 1 pixel
      - object_B:
          description: a contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of another, identical non-white color
          properties:
            - color: variable, different from object_A (e.g., yellow, orange, green)
            - size: variable (>= 1 pixel)
    relationship: object_A and object_B are always adjacent within the segment

transformation:
  action: swap_positions
  operands: [object_A, object_B]
  description: The position occupied by object_A in the input is occupied by object_B in the output, and the position occupied by object_B in the input is occupied by object_A in the output.
  invariants:
    - colors of object_A and object_B
    - sizes of object_A and object_B
    - position and color of background pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid identical to the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
3.  Within this block, identify the two adjacent sub-objects: one being a single pixel (Object A) and the other being a sequence of identical pixels (Object B). Determine their colors, sizes (lengths), and their starting positions within the block.
4.  Determine the starting index of the entire non-white block in the grid.
5.  If Object A is positioned before Object B in the input grid:
    *   Place Object B into the output grid starting at the original start index of the non-white block.
    *   Place Object A into the output grid immediately following Object B.
6.  If Object B is positioned before Object A in the input grid:
    *   Place Object A into the output grid starting at the original start index of the non-white block.
    *   Place Object B into the output grid immediately following Object A.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
