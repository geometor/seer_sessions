This block is composed of two distinct, adjacent sub-blocks (objects):\n    *   One object is always a single pixel of a specific color (e.g., red in train_1, yellow in train_2, yellow in train_3).\n    *   The other object is a sequence (one or more pixels) of another identical color (e.g., yellow in train_1, orange in train_2, green in train_3).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves swapping the positions of these two adjacent, non-white objects. The single pixel object moves to occupy the space previously held by the sequence object, and the sequence object moves to occupy the space previously held by the single pixel object.\n5.  **Invariance:** The white background pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color. The colors and sizes (number of pixels) of the two non-white objects are preserved during the swap.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
