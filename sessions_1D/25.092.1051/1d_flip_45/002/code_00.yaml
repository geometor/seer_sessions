task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: Assumed 1D input (single list/array), processed as 1xN 2D grid.
  background_color: white (0)
  relevant_pixels: Non-white pixels (values 1-9).

identified_objects:
  - object_type: background
    color: white (0)
    action: remains static.
  - object_type: segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels found in the input row.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by start and end indices within the row.
      - composition: Consists of exactly two adjacent sub-objects with different non-white colors.
    sub_objects:
      - object_A:
          description: A single pixel of a non-white color.
          properties:
            - color: variable (non-white)
            - size: 1 pixel
      - object_B:
          description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of another, identical non-white color.
          properties:
            - color: variable (non-white, different from object_A)
            - size: variable (>= 1 pixel)
    relationship: object_A and object_B are always adjacent within the segment.

transformation:
  action: swap_adjacent_sub_objects
  operands: [object_A, object_B]
  description: >
    Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels. Verify it consists
    of two adjacent parts: a single pixel (Object A) and a sequence of
    one or more pixels (Object B). Within the bounds defined by the
    original segment's start and end indices in the output grid, place
    the sub-object that appeared second in the input first, followed
    immediately by the sub-object that appeared first in the input.
  invariants:
    - Colors of object_A and object_B.
    - Sizes (lengths) of object_A and object_B.
    - Position and color of background (white) pixels outside the segment.
    - Total length of the combined segment (object_A + object_B).
    - Overall grid dimensions.
