**General Assessment:**

The core issue identified is an input format mismatch. The Python code's validation expected a `list` of `lists` (e.g., `[[0, 0, 2, 4, ...]]`) representing a 1xN grid, while the testing environment likely supplied the input as a flat `list` (e.g., `[0, 0, 2, 4, ...]`) or a 1D NumPy array. This triggered the `ValueError` in all examples before the main transformation logic could execute. The underlying perception of the task (swapping adjacent single-pixel and sequence objects) appears correct based on the examples and the metrics gathered.

**Strategy:**

The primary strategy is to modify the input handling part of the `transform` function. It should accept a flat list or 1D array, convert it internally into a 2D NumPy array (1 row, N columns) for processing using the existing logic, and then format the output correctly (likely back to a list of lists, assuming that's the standard ARC output format).

**Metrics:**

Metrics were gathered by treating the input as a flat list/1D array:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Segment: `[2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` (Indices 7-13)
    *   Object A (Single): color=2 (red), length=1, position=first
    *   Object B (Sequence): color=4 (yellow), length=6, position=second
    *   Expected Output Segment: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Segment: `[4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]` (Indices 9-15)
    *   Object A (Single): color=4 (yellow), length=1, position=first
    *   Object B (Sequence): color=7 (orange), length=6, position=second
    *   Expected Output Segment: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4]`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Segment: `[4, 3, 3, 3, 3]` (Indices 8-12)
    *   Object A (Single): color=4 (yellow), length=1, position=first
    *   Object B (Sequence): color=3 (green), length=4, position=second
    *   Expected Output Segment: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 4]`

The metrics confirm the pattern: identify a single pixel object adjacent to a sequence object within a non-white block and swap their relative positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: Assumed 1D input (single list/array), processed as 1xN 2D grid.
  background_color: white (0)
  relevant_pixels: Non-white pixels (values 1-9).

identified_objects:
  - object_type: background
    color: white (0)
    action: remains static.
  - object_type: segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels found in the input row.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by start and end indices within the row.
      - composition: Consists of exactly two adjacent sub-objects with different non-white colors.
    sub_objects:
      - object_A:
          description: A single pixel of a non-white color.
          properties:
            - color: variable (non-white)
            - size: 1 pixel
      - object_B:
          description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of another, identical non-white color.
          properties:
            - color: variable (non-white, different from object_A)
            - size: variable (>= 1 pixel)
    relationship: object_A and object_B are always adjacent within the segment.

transformation:
  action: swap_adjacent_sub_objects
  operands: [object_A, object_B]
  description: >
    Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels. Verify it consists
    of two adjacent parts: a single pixel (Object A) and a sequence of
    one or more pixels (Object B). Within the bounds defined by the
    original segment's start and end indices in the output grid, place
    the sub-object that appeared second in the input first, followed
    immediately by the sub-object that appeared first in the input.
  invariants:
    - Colors of object_A and object_B.
    - Sizes (lengths) of object_A and object_B.
    - Position and color of background (white) pixels outside the segment.
    - Total length of the combined segment (object_A + object_B).
    - Overall grid dimensions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input, assuming it is a flat list representing a single row of pixels.
2.  Convert the input list into a 1D NumPy array.
3.  Create an output array as a copy of the input array.
4.  Find the indices of all non-white pixels in the input array.
5.  If there are fewer than two non-white pixels, or if they do not form a contiguous block, or if the contiguous block consists of only one color, return the original input list wrapped in another list (e.g., `[[original_list]]`).
6.  Determine the start and end indices (`start_idx`, `end_idx`) of the contiguous non-white segment.
7.  Extract the segment `input_segment = input_array[start_idx : end_idx + 1]`.
8.  Find the index within the `input_segment` where the color changes. If no change occurs (should be caught earlier) or the pattern doesn't match, return the original input formatted as `[[original_list]]`.
9.  Identify the two parts based on the color change: Part 1 (before/at change) and Part 2 (after change). Record their colors and lengths.
10. Check if one part has length 1 (Object A) and the other has length >= 1 (Object B). If not, return the original input formatted as `[[original_list]]`.
11. Determine which object (A or B) came first in the `input_segment`.
12. In the `output_array`, starting at `start_idx`:
    *   If Object A was first in the input, write the pixels for Object B, then write the pixel for Object A immediately after.
    *   If Object B was first in the input, write the pixel for Object A, then write the pixels for Object B immediately after.
13. Convert the final `output_array` back to a standard Python list.
14. Return the result wrapped in a list, forming the `[[...]]` structure.
