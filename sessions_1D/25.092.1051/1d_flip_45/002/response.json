            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe core issue identified is an input format mismatch. The Python code's validation expected a `list` of `lists` (e.g., `[[0, 0, 2, 4, ...]]`) representing a 1xN grid, while the testing environment likely supplied the input as a flat `list` (e.g., `[0, 0, 2, 4, ...]`) or a 1D NumPy array. This triggered the `ValueError` in all examples before the main transformation logic could execute. The underlying perception of the task (swapping adjacent single-pixel and sequence objects) appears correct based on the examples and the metrics gathered.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe primary strategy is to modify the input handling part of the `transform` function. It should accept a flat list or 1D array, convert it internally into a 2D NumPy array (1 row, N columns) for processing using the existing logic, and then format the output correctly (likely back to a list of lists, assuming that's the standard ARC output format).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nMetrics were gathered by treating the input as a flat list/1D array:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Segment: `[2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` (Indices 7-13)\n    *   Object A (Single): color=2 (red), length=1, position=first\n    *   Object B (Sequence): color=4 (yellow), length=6, position=second\n    *   Expected Output Segment: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]`\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Segment: `[4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]` (Indices 9-15)\n    *   Object A (Single): color=4 (yellow), length=1, position=first\n    *   Object B (Sequence): color=7 (orange), length=6, position=second\n    *   Expected Output Segment: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4]`\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Segment: `[4, 3, 3, 3, 3]` (Indices 8-12)\n    *   Object A (Single): color=4 (yellow), length=1, position=first\n    *   Object B (Sequence): color=3 (green), length=4, position=second\n    *   Expected Output Segment: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 4]`\n\nThe metrics confirm the pattern: identify a single pixel object adjacent to a sequence object within a non-white block and swap their relative positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
