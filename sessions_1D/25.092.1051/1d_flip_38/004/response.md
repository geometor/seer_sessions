*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The previous code execution reported that the transformed output was identical to the input for all training examples, despite the code logic appearing to correctly implement the transformation described in the initial natural language program.
    *   This suggests either an error in the execution environment/testing procedure or a very subtle bug in the code that caused it to effectively skip the transformation.
    *   The core logic observed across all examples remains consistent: a single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels exists in a 1D row, where the first pixel ("marker") is moved to the position immediately after the last pixel of the sequence ("body"). The surrounding white pixels and the order of the body pixels are preserved.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Re-affirm the transformation rule based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs.
    *   Assume the code logic described previously *should* work and that the reported execution failure was anomalous.
    *   Refine the Natural Language Program and Facts for clarity and precision, ensuring they accurately describe the consistent pattern observed in all examples.
    *   The coder phase should use the refined program and potentially double-check the implementation details to avoid the previous execution failure.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_manipulation
    grid_properties:
      - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
      - background_color: white (0)
    components:
      - name: active_sequence
        type: object (contiguous non-white pixels)
        properties:
          - location: embedded within the background
          - uniqueness: exactly one sequence per input grid
          - minimum_length: 2 (implied by transformation rule)
          - composition: consists of two parts:
              - marker_pixel: the first pixel in the sequence (unique color relative to body)
              - body_pixels: the subsequent contiguous pixels (all same color, different from marker)
    transformation:
      action: rearrangement
      target: active_sequence
      rule: move the marker_pixel to the position immediately following the last body_pixel
      constraints:
        - background pixels remain unchanged.
        - the internal order of body_pixels remains unchanged.
        - if no active_sequence is found or its length is less than 2, the input is returned unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
    2.  Identify the contiguous subsequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Determine its start and end indices.
    3.  If no such sequence is found, or if the length of the sequence is less than 2, return the original input grid unchanged.
    4.  Isolate the non-white sequence.
    5.  Identify the first pixel of this sequence as the "marker pixel".
    6.  Identify the remaining pixels of the sequence (from the second pixel to the end) as the "body sequence".
    7.  Construct a new sequence, the "transformed sequence", by concatenating the "body sequence" followed by the "marker pixel".
    8.  Construct the final output row by taking the portion of the original input row *before* the start index of the non-white sequence, appending the "transformed sequence", and then appending the portion of the original input row *after* the end index of the non-white sequence.
    9.  Return the constructed output row, formatted as a grid (a list containing the single row).
