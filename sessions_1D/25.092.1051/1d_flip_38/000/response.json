Isolate the remaining pixels of the \"active sequence\" (from the second pixel to the end). This is the \"body sequence\".\n    4.  Create a new sequence by concatenating the \"body sequence\" followed by the \"marker pixel\". This is the \"transformed sequence\".\n    5.  Construct the output row by taking the portion of the input row before the \"active sequence\", appending the \"transformed sequence\", and then appending the portion of the input row after the \"active sequence\"."
