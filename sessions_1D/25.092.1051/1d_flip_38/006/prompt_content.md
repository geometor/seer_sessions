"""
Identifies a contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels in a single 
input row. It then moves the first pixel (marker) of this sequence to the 
position immediately following the last pixel of the sequence, preserving the 
internal order of the rest of the sequence (body). The surrounding white (zero) 
pixels remain unchanged. If the sequence length is less than 2, the input is 
returned unchanged.
