**General Assessment:**

The provided code aims to solve the task by identifying a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels, extracting the first pixel ("marker"), and moving it to the end of the remaining sequence ("body"). The execution results show that for all three training examples, the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input`, indicating the transformation step within the code failed to execute or its result was not correctly returned.

My analysis of the provided Python code suggests the logic for finding the sequence, extracting the marker and body, constructing the transformed sequence, and assembling the final row *should* work correctly based on standard Python list operations and slicing. The failure mode (output matching input exactly) is puzzling, as it implies either the transformation condition (`sequence_len < 2`) was incorrectly met (which doesn't seem to be the case based on the examples) or the final transformed `output_row` was not returned.

Given the discrepancy, the strategy is to:
1.  Re-verify the properties of the input/output pairs to ensure the understanding of the transformation is correct.
2.  Refine the description of the objects and transformation in the `Facts` section for maximum clarity.
3.  Re-state the `Natural Language Program` clearly, ensuring it precisely describes the intended transformation, which appears consistent across all examples. Assume the core logic is correct but potentially needs careful implementation.

**Metrics:**

Let's gather metrics for each example to confirm the structure.

The metrics confirm the structure:
- Each input has a single contiguous non-white sequence.
- The sequence starts with a unique "marker" pixel.
- The rest of the sequence is the "body".
- The output sequence consists of the "body" followed by the "marker".
- The length of the sequence is always >= 2.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_manipulation_1d
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  content: contains background pixels and one active sequence
components:
  - name: background
    type: pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: outside the active sequence
  - name: active_sequence
    type: object (contiguous non-white pixels)
    properties:
      location: embedded within the background
      composition: ordered sequence of non-white pixels
      structure:
        - marker_pixel: the first pixel in the sequence
        - body_pixels: the subsequent pixels in the sequence (from the second to the last)
      constraints:
        - must contain at least two pixels (marker + at least one body pixel)
        - only one such sequence per input row
transformation:
  action: rearrangement
  target: active_sequence
  rule:
    - identify the marker_pixel and the body_pixels within the active_sequence.
    - construct a new sequence by concatenating the body_pixels followed by the marker_pixel.
    - replace the original active_sequence with this new sequence in the output row.
  constraints:
    - the background pixels (white pixels) remain unchanged in number and relative position outside the sequence boundaries.
    - the relative order of pixels within the body_pixels is preserved.
    - if no active_sequence is found or if its length is less than 2, the input row remains unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Scan the row to find the first contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Record the start and end indices of this sequence.
3.  If no such sequence is found, or if the identified sequence contains fewer than two pixels, return the original input row unchanged.
4.  Otherwise (if a sequence of length 2 or more is found):
    a.  Identify the first pixel of the sequence as the "marker pixel".
    b.  Identify the remaining pixels of the sequence (from the second pixel to the end) as the "body sequence".
    c.  Construct a new sequence, called the "transformed sequence", by concatenating the "body sequence" and the "marker pixel" (in that order: body first, marker last).
    d.  Create the output row by taking the segment of the input row *before* the original sequence's start index, appending the "transformed sequence", and then appending the segment of the input row *after* the original sequence's end index.
5.  Return the constructed output row, formatted as a single-row grid.
