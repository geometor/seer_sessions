            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code aims to solve the task by identifying a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels, extracting the first pixel (\"marker\"), and moving it to the end of the remaining sequence (\"body\"). The execution results show that for all three training examples, the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input`, indicating the transformation step within the code failed to execute or its result was not correctly returned.\n\nMy analysis of the provided Python code suggests the logic for finding the sequence, extracting the marker and body, constructing the transformed sequence, and assembling the final row *should* work correctly based on standard Python list operations and slicing. The failure mode (output matching input exactly) is puzzling, as it implies either the transformation condition (`sequence_len < 2`) was incorrectly met (which doesn't seem to be the case based on the examples) or the final transformed `output_row` was not returned.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, the strategy is to:\n1.  Re-verify the properties of the input/output pairs to ensure the understanding of the transformation is correct.\n2.  Refine the description of the objects and transformation in the `Facts` section for maximum clarity.\n3.  Re-state the `Natural Language Program` clearly, ensuring it precisely describes the intended transformation, which appears consistent across all examples. Assume the core logic is correct but potentially needs careful implementation.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's gather metrics for each example to confirm the structure.\n"
