task_type: sequence_manipulation_1d
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  content: contains background pixels and one active sequence
components:
  - name: background
    type: pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: outside the active sequence
  - name: active_sequence
    type: object (contiguous non-white pixels)
    properties:
      location: embedded within the background
      composition: ordered sequence of non-white pixels
      structure:
        - marker_pixel: the first pixel in the sequence
        - body_pixels: the subsequent pixels in the sequence (from the second to the last)
      constraints:
        - must contain at least two pixels (marker + at least one body pixel)
        - only one such sequence per input row
transformation:
  action: rearrangement
  target: active_sequence
  rule:
    - identify the marker_pixel and the body_pixels within the active_sequence.
    - construct a new sequence by concatenating the body_pixels followed by the marker_pixel.
    - replace the original active_sequence with this new sequence in the output row.
  constraints:
    - the background pixels (white pixels) remain unchanged in number and relative position outside the sequence boundaries.
    - the relative order of pixels within the body_pixels is preserved.
    - if no active_sequence is found or if its length is less than 2, the input row remains unchanged.
