task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_components:
  - name: background
    type: pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: contiguous blocks at the start and/or end of the row
      count: 2 (potentially zero length if sequence touches edge)
  - name: active_sequence
    type: object (single contiguous non-white pixel sequence)
    properties:
      location: embedded within the background
      composition: ordered sequence of pixels, where:
        - marker_pixel: the first pixel in the sequence (color C1)
        - body_pixels: the remaining pixels in the sequence (all of the same color C2, where C2 may or may not equal C1)
      count: 1 per input row
output_components:
  - name: background
    type: pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: same indices as the input background relative to the active sequence
      count: 2 (same structure as input)
  - name: transformed_sequence
    type: object (single contiguous non-white pixel sequence)
    properties:
      location: occupies the same index range as the input active_sequence
      composition: rearranged sequence, consisting of:
        - body_pixels: same pixels as input body_pixels, preserving their internal order
        - marker_pixel: same pixel as input marker_pixel, now appended after the body_pixels
      count: 1 per output row
transformation:
  action: rearrangement
  target: active_sequence
  rule: >
    Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
    Move the first pixel (marker_pixel) of this sequence to the position
    immediately following the last pixel of the original sequence (which is the
    last pixel of the body_pixels).
  constraints:
    - The relative order of the body_pixels is preserved.
    - The background pixels (white) remain unchanged in number and position relative to the start/end of the sequence.
    - The overall length of the row remains unchanged.
    - Assumes exactly one contiguous non-white sequence exists in the input row.
    - Assumes the sequence has a length of at least 1. If length is 1, the output is identical to the input.
