"""
Identifies the first contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels in a 
single input row. If the sequence length is 2 or greater, it moves the first 
pixel (marker) of this sequence to the position immediately following the last 
pixel of the sequence, preserving the internal order of the rest of the sequence 
(body). The surrounding white (zero) pixels remain unchanged. If no sequence is 
found or its length is less than 2, the input is returned unchanged.
