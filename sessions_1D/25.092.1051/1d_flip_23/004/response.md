**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt failed due to a `ValueError` related to boolean ambiguity in NumPy arrays. This indicates that the input grids are likely processed as NumPy arrays by the execution environment, and the Python code did not handle this correctly, particularly within conditional statements (`if` conditions trying to evaluate an entire array). The core transformation logic observed—swapping the first and last elements of a specific pattern—appears consistent across the examples. The strategy is to:

1.  Confirm the input data type is indeed NumPy array or similar.
2.  Refactor the pattern detection and transformation logic to be compatible with NumPy array operations, avoiding ambiguous boolean checks.
3.  Gather precise metrics using NumPy to ensure the pattern identification is accurate.
4.  Update the YAML and Natural Language Program based on these refined observations.

**Metrics Gathering:**

We will use NumPy to analyze the structure and content of each example.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: "Swap the colors of the first and last pixels of a specific contiguous horizontal segment within a single-row grid."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1xN grid/array)
  background_color: 0 (white)
  data_type: Likely NumPy array based on execution error.
objects:
  - id: target_segment
    description: "A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-background pixels starting with a unique 'marker' color, followed by one or more pixels of a second, consistent color different from the marker."
    properties:
      location: Found by scanning the row for the first non-background pixel.
      structure: Consists of two parts:
        - marker_pixel: The first pixel of the segment.
        - sequence_pixels: One or more pixels immediately following the marker, all having the same color, which differs from the marker color.
      colors:
        - marker_color: Variable (e.g., red, blue, yellow).
        - sequence_color: Variable (e.g., orange, magenta), consistent within the sequence.
    identification_rule:
      1. Find the index `marker_idx` of the first non-zero pixel.
      2. Check pixel at `marker_idx + 1`. It must exist, be non-zero, and have a different color (`sequence_color`) than the marker.
      3. Find the last index `sequence_end_idx` such that all pixels from `marker_idx + 1` to `sequence_end_idx` have the `sequence_color`.
      4. The segment spans from `marker_idx` to `sequence_end_idx`.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: marker_pixel
    object2: sequence_pixels
    details: The marker_pixel is immediately to the left of the sequence_pixels.
  - type: composition
    parent: target_segment
    children: [marker_pixel, sequence_pixels]
    details: The target_segment is formed by the marker_pixel followed by the sequence_pixels.
actions:
  - action: swap_colors
    object: target_segment
    details: "Swap the color of the pixel at the start index (`marker_idx`) with the color of the pixel at the end index (`sequence_end_idx`) of the identified segment."
    input_indices: [`marker_idx`, `sequence_end_idx`]
    input_colors: [`marker_color`, `sequence_color`] # Note: sequence_color is read from index marker_idx + 1
    output_effect:
      - grid[`marker_idx`] becomes `sequence_color`.
      - grid[`sequence_end_idx`] becomes `marker_color`.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - Background pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.
  - Pixels outside the identified `target_segment` remain unchanged.
  - Pixels within the `target_segment` *between* the first and last pixels retain their original color (`sequence_color`).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, expected to be a single-row NumPy array.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Access the single row from the output grid.
4.  Scan the row to find the index (`marker_idx`) of the first pixel that is not the background color (0).
5.  If no non-background pixel is found, return the unmodified output grid.
6.  Check the pixel immediately following the marker at index `marker_idx + 1`.
    *   If this index is out of bounds, or if the pixel at this index is the background color (0), or if it has the same color as the marker pixel, then the required pattern is not present. Return the unmodified output grid.
7.  Store the color of the marker pixel (`marker_color = row[marker_idx]`).
8.  Store the color of the pixel following the marker (`sequence_color = row[marker_idx + 1]`).
9.  Identify the end of the contiguous sequence of `sequence_color`. Initialize `sequence_end_idx = marker_idx + 1`. Iterate from `marker_idx + 2` onwards: if the pixel color equals `sequence_color`, update `sequence_end_idx` to the current index; otherwise, stop searching for the end of the sequence.
10. Perform the color swap on the output row:
    *   Set the pixel at `marker_idx` to `sequence_color`.
    *   Set the pixel at `sequence_end_idx` to `marker_color`.
11. Return the modified output grid.
