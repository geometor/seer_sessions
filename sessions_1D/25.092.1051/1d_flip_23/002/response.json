            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core pattern: a single 'marker' pixel followed by a sequence of identical pixels. The intended transformation was also generally correct \u2013 moving the marker to the end of the sequence. However, the implementation detail seems to have caused an error, likely related to data types (NumPy arrays vs. lists) in the testing environment, specifically during the comparison of the output grid with the expected grid. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" typically arises when a boolean operation (like `if` or `==`) is applied to a NumPy array containing multiple elements, instead of a single boolean value.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the description of the transformation based on a closer look at the examples, ensuring the natural language program is precise. We will assume the core logic of identifying the marker and sequence is sound but clarify the exact modification step. The implementation should strictly adhere to using standard Python lists for the grid representation as specified.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on manual analysis of the examples:\n\n*   **Commonalities:**\n    *   All inputs are 1xN grids (single rows).\n    *   All contain a single contiguous block of non-background (non-white) pixels.\n    *   This block always starts with a pixel of one color (the 'marker') followed immediately by one or more pixels of a second, different color (the 'sequence').\n    *   The background color is consistently white (0).\n    *   The transformation only affects the pixels within the identified 'marker + sequence' block.\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 1x31\n    *   Marker: Color 2 at index 13\n    *   Sequence: Color 7, indices 14-25 (Length 12)\n    *   Affected Segment: Indices 13-25\n    *   Transformation: Swap colors at index 13 (marker) and index 25 (last element of sequence).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 1x31\n    *   Marker: Color 1 at index 8\n    *   Sequence: Color 7, indices 9-18 (Length 10)\n    *   Affected Segment: Indices 8-18\n    *   Transformation: Swap colors at index 8 (marker) and index 18 (last element of sequence).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 1x31\n    *   Marker: Color 4 at index 16\n    *   Sequence: Color 6, indices 17-23 (Length 7)\n    *   Affected Segment: Indices 16-23\n    *   Transformation: Swap colors at index 16 (marker) and index 23 (last element of sequence).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
