**General Assessment:**

The previous code correctly identified the core pattern: a single 'marker' pixel followed by a sequence of identical pixels. The intended transformation was also generally correct â€“ moving the marker to the end of the sequence. However, the implementation detail seems to have caused an error, likely related to data types (NumPy arrays vs. lists) in the testing environment, specifically during the comparison of the output grid with the expected grid. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" typically arises when a boolean operation (like `if` or `==`) is applied to a NumPy array containing multiple elements, instead of a single boolean value.

The strategy is to refine the description of the transformation based on a closer look at the examples, ensuring the natural language program is precise. We will assume the core logic of identifying the marker and sequence is sound but clarify the exact modification step. The implementation should strictly adhere to using standard Python lists for the grid representation as specified.

**Metrics:**

Based on manual analysis of the examples:

*   **Commonalities:**
    *   All inputs are 1xN grids (single rows).
    *   All contain a single contiguous block of non-background (non-white) pixels.
    *   This block always starts with a pixel of one color (the 'marker') followed immediately by one or more pixels of a second, different color (the 'sequence').
    *   The background color is consistently white (0).
    *   The transformation only affects the pixels within the identified 'marker + sequence' block.
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 1x31
    *   Marker: Color 2 at index 13
    *   Sequence: Color 7, indices 14-25 (Length 12)
    *   Affected Segment: Indices 13-25
    *   Transformation: Swap colors at index 13 (marker) and index 25 (last element of sequence).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 1x31
    *   Marker: Color 1 at index 8
    *   Sequence: Color 7, indices 9-18 (Length 10)
    *   Affected Segment: Indices 8-18
    *   Transformation: Swap colors at index 8 (marker) and index 18 (last element of sequence).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 1x31
    *   Marker: Color 4 at index 16
    *   Sequence: Color 6, indices 17-23 (Length 7)
    *   Affected Segment: Indices 16-23
    *   Transformation: Swap colors at index 16 (marker) and index 23 (last element of sequence).

task_description: "Swap the first and last pixels of a contiguous horizontal segment composed of a single 'marker' pixel followed by a sequence of identical pixels."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: "The first non-background pixel found when scanning the row left-to-right."
    properties:
      color: variable (non-zero)
      shape: single pixel
  - id: sequence_pixels
    description: "A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color, immediately following the marker_pixel. The sequence color must differ from the marker color."
    properties:
      color: variable (non-zero, different from marker_pixel color), consistent within the sequence.
      shape: horizontal line segment (1xM, where M >= 1)
      position: Immediately to the right of the marker_pixel.
  - id: combined_segment
    description: "The combined entity formed by the marker_pixel followed immediately by the sequence_pixels."
    properties:
      start_index: index of the marker_pixel
      end_index: index of the last pixel in sequence_pixels
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: marker_pixel
    object2: sequence_pixels
    details: The marker_pixel is immediately to the left of the first pixel of sequence_pixels.
actions:
  - action: swap_colors
    object: combined_segment
    details: The color value at the start_index of the combined_segment is swapped with the color value at the end_index of the combined_segment. All pixels between the start and end indices remain unchanged.
invariants:
  - Background pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - The colors involved (marker color, sequence color) remain the same, only their positions at the segment boundaries are swapped.
  - The pixels within the sequence (excluding the last one) retain their original color (the sequence color).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid (a list of lists, expected to be 1xN).
2.  Create a deep copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Access the first (and only) row of the grid.
4.  Iterate through the row to find the index (`marker_idx`) and color (`marker_color`) of the first pixel that is not the background color (0).
5.  If no such pixel is found, return the unchanged output grid.
6.  Check the pixel immediately following the marker pixel (`marker_idx + 1`). If it doesn't exist, is the background color (0), or has the same color as the marker, the specific pattern is not present; return the unchanged output grid.
7.  Identify the color (`sequence_color`) of the pixel at `marker_idx + 1`.
8.  Continue iterating from `marker_idx + 2` onwards to find the index (`sequence_end_idx`) of the last contiguous pixel with the `sequence_color`. The sequence starts at `marker_idx + 1`. Initialize `sequence_end_idx` to `marker_idx + 1`.
9.  Modify the output grid's row:
    a.  Set the pixel at `marker_idx` to `sequence_color`.
    b.  Set the pixel at `sequence_end_idx` to `marker_color`.
10. Return the modified output grid.
