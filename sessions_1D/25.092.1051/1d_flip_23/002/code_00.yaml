task_description: "Swap the first and last pixels of a contiguous horizontal segment composed of a single 'marker' pixel followed by a sequence of identical pixels."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: "The first non-background pixel found when scanning the row left-to-right."
    properties:
      color: variable (non-zero)
      shape: single pixel
  - id: sequence_pixels
    description: "A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color, immediately following the marker_pixel. The sequence color must differ from the marker color."
    properties:
      color: variable (non-zero, different from marker_pixel color), consistent within the sequence.
      shape: horizontal line segment (1xM, where M >= 1)
      position: Immediately to the right of the marker_pixel.
  - id: combined_segment
    description: "The combined entity formed by the marker_pixel followed immediately by the sequence_pixels."
    properties:
      start_index: index of the marker_pixel
      end_index: index of the last pixel in sequence_pixels
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: marker_pixel
    object2: sequence_pixels
    details: The marker_pixel is immediately to the left of the first pixel of sequence_pixels.
actions:
  - action: swap_colors
    object: combined_segment
    details: The color value at the start_index of the combined_segment is swapped with the color value at the end_index of the combined_segment. All pixels between the start and end indices remain unchanged.
invariants:
  - Background pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - The colors involved (marker color, sequence color) remain the same, only their positions at the segment boundaries are swapped.
  - The pixels within the sequence (excluding the last one) retain their original color (the sequence color).
