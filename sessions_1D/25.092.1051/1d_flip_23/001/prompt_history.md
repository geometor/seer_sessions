Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1xN grids (single rows).
2.  **Colors:** The grids primarily consist of the background color white (0).
3.  **Objects:** Within each row, there's a distinct pattern: a single pixel of one color (e.g., red in train_1, blue in train_2, yellow in train_3) immediately followed by a contiguous sequence of pixels of another, consistent color (e.g., orange in train_1 and train_2, magenta in train_3).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional swap or movement. The single, unique-colored pixel (let's call it the 'marker') moves from the left end of the colored sequence to the right end. The sequence itself seems to shift one position to the left to accommodate this move. The background pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: "Move a single 'marker' pixel from the left side of an adjacent horizontal sequence of identical pixels to its right side."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: "A single pixel with a unique color, different from the background and the sequence color."
    properties:
      color: variable (e.g., red, blue, yellow)
      shape: single pixel
      position: Immediately to the left of the sequence_object.
  - id: sequence_object
    description: "A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color."
    properties:
      color: variable (e.g., orange, magenta), consistent within the sequence, different from background and marker.
      shape: horizontal line segment (1xM)
      position: Immediately to the right of the marker_pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: marker_pixel
    object2: sequence_object
    details: The marker_pixel is immediately adjacent to the left end of the sequence_object.
actions:
  - action: relocate
    object: marker_pixel
    details: The marker_pixel is moved from its initial position to the position immediately following the right end of the sequence_object's original span.
  - action: shift
    object: sequence_object
    details: The sequence_object effectively shifts one position to the left, occupying the original position of the marker_pixel.
invariants:
  - background_color remains unchanged.
  - color and length of the sequence_object remain unchanged.
  - color of the marker_pixel remains unchanged.
  - pixels outside the combined marker+sequence area remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input row to find the first non-background pixel. This is the 'marker' pixel. Store its color and its index (position).
3.  Starting from the position immediately after the 'marker' pixel, identify the contiguous sequence of identical, non-background pixels. This is the 'sequence'. Store its color, its length, and the index of its last pixel.
4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
5.  In the output grid, place the color of the *first pixel of the sequence* at the original index of the 'marker' pixel.
6.  Shift the rest of the sequence one position to the left: for each pixel in the sequence (starting from the second one), place its color at the index one position to its left.
7.  Place the stored color of the 'marker' pixel at the index immediately following the original last index of the sequence.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
