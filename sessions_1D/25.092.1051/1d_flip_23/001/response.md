"""
Move a single 'marker' pixel from the left side of an adjacent horizontal sequence of identical pixels to its right side.

1. Identify the background color (white, 0).
2. Scan the input row to find the first non-background pixel. This is the 'marker' pixel. Store its color and its index.
3. Starting from the position immediately after the 'marker' pixel, identify the contiguous sequence of identical, non-background pixels. This is the 'sequence'. Store its color and the index of its last pixel.
4. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
5. In the output grid:
    a. Place the color of the sequence at the original index of the 'marker' pixel.
    b. Ensure the pixels corresponding to the original sequence (excluding the last one) retain the sequence color.
    c. Place the stored color of the 'marker' pixel at the index corresponding to the original last index of the sequence.
6. Return the modified output grid.
