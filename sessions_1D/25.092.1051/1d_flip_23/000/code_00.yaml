task_description: "Move a single 'marker' pixel from the left side of an adjacent horizontal sequence of identical pixels to its right side."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: "A single pixel with a unique color, different from the background and the sequence color."
    properties:
      color: variable (e.g., red, blue, yellow)
      shape: single pixel
      position: Immediately to the left of the sequence_object.
  - id: sequence_object
    description: "A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color."
    properties:
      color: variable (e.g., orange, magenta), consistent within the sequence, different from background and marker.
      shape: horizontal line segment (1xM)
      position: Immediately to the right of the marker_pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: marker_pixel
    object2: sequence_object
    details: The marker_pixel is immediately adjacent to the left end of the sequence_object.
actions:
  - action: relocate
    object: marker_pixel
    details: The marker_pixel is moved from its initial position to the position immediately following the right end of the sequence_object's original span.
  - action: shift
    object: sequence_object
    details: The sequence_object effectively shifts one position to the left, occupying the original position of the marker_pixel.
invariants:
  - background_color remains unchanged.
  - color and length of the sequence_object remain unchanged.
  - color of the marker_pixel remains unchanged.
  - pixels outside the combined marker+sequence area remain unchanged.
