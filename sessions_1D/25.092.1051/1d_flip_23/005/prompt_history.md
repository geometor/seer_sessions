Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1xN grids (single rows).
2.  **Colors:** The grids primarily consist of the background color white (0).
3.  **Objects:** Within each row, there's a distinct pattern: a single pixel of one color (e.g., red in train_1, blue in train_2, yellow in train_3) immediately followed by a contiguous sequence of pixels of another, consistent color (e.g., orange in train_1 and train_2, magenta in train_3).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional swap or movement. The single, unique-colored pixel (let's call it the 'marker') moves from the left end of the colored sequence to the right end. The sequence itself seems to shift one position to the left to accommodate this move. The background pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: "Move a single 'marker' pixel from the left side of an adjacent horizontal sequence of identical pixels to its right side."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: "A single pixel with a unique color, different from the background and the sequence color."
    properties:
      color: variable (e.g., red, blue, yellow)
      shape: single pixel
      position: Immediately to the left of the sequence_object.
  - id: sequence_object
    description: "A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color."
    properties:
      color: variable (e.g., orange, magenta), consistent within the sequence, different from background and marker.
      shape: horizontal line segment (1xM)
      position: Immediately to the right of the marker_pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: marker_pixel
    object2: sequence_object
    details: The marker_pixel is immediately adjacent to the left end of the sequence_object.
actions:
  - action: relocate
    object: marker_pixel
    details: The marker_pixel is moved from its initial position to the position immediately following the right end of the sequence_object's original span.
  - action: shift
    object: sequence_object
    details: The sequence_object effectively shifts one position to the left, occupying the original position of the marker_pixel.
invariants:
  - background_color remains unchanged.
  - color and length of the sequence_object remain unchanged.
  - color of the marker_pixel remains unchanged.
  - pixels outside the combined marker+sequence area remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input row to find the first non-background pixel. This is the 'marker' pixel. Store its color and its index (position).
3.  Starting from the position immediately after the 'marker' pixel, identify the contiguous sequence of identical, non-background pixels. This is the 'sequence'. Store its color, its length, and the index of its last pixel.
4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
5.  In the output grid, place the color of the *first pixel of the sequence* at the original index of the 'marker' pixel.
6.  Shift the rest of the sequence one position to the left: for each pixel in the sequence (starting from the second one), place its color at the index one position to its left.
7.  Place the stored color of the 'marker' pixel at the index immediately following the original last index of the sequence.
8.  Return the modified output grid.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

## Example 3:

**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt failed due to a `ValueError` related to boolean ambiguity in NumPy arrays. This indicates that the input grids are likely processed as NumPy arrays by the execution environment, and the Python code did not handle this correctly, particularly within conditional statements (`if` conditions trying to evaluate an entire array). The core transformation logic observed—swapping the first and last elements of a specific pattern—appears consistent across the examples. The strategy is to:

1.  Confirm the input data type is indeed NumPy array or similar.
2.  Refactor the pattern detection and transformation logic to be compatible with NumPy array operations, avoiding ambiguous boolean checks.
3.  Gather precise metrics using NumPy to ensure the pattern identification is accurate.
4.  Update the YAML and Natural Language Program based on these refined observations.

**Metrics Gathering:**

We will use NumPy to analyze the structure and content of each example.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: "Swap the colors of the first and last pixels of a specific contiguous horizontal segment within a single-row grid."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1xN grid/array)
  background_color: 0 (white)
  data_type: Likely NumPy array based on execution error.
objects:
  - id: target_segment
    description: "A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-background pixels starting with a unique 'marker' color, followed by one or more pixels of a second, consistent color different from the marker."
    properties:
      location: Found by scanning the row for the first non-background pixel.
      structure: Consists of two parts:
        - marker_pixel: The first pixel of the segment.
        - sequence_pixels: One or more pixels immediately following the marker, all having the same color, which differs from the marker color.
      colors:
        - marker_color: Variable (e.g., red, blue, yellow).
        - sequence_color: Variable (e.g., orange, magenta), consistent within the sequence.
    identification_rule:
      1. Find the index `marker_idx` of the first non-zero pixel.
      2. Check pixel at `marker_idx + 1`. It must exist, be non-zero, and have a different color (`sequence_color`) than the marker.
      3. Find the last index `sequence_end_idx` such that all pixels from `marker_idx + 1` to `sequence_end_idx` have the `sequence_color`.
      4. The segment spans from `marker_idx` to `sequence_end_idx`.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: marker_pixel
    object2: sequence_pixels
    details: The marker_pixel is immediately to the left of the sequence_pixels.
  - type: composition
    parent: target_segment
    children: [marker_pixel, sequence_pixels]
    details: The target_segment is formed by the marker_pixel followed by the sequence_pixels.
actions:
  - action: swap_colors
    object: target_segment
    details: "Swap the color of the pixel at the start index (`marker_idx`) with the color of the pixel at the end index (`sequence_end_idx`) of the identified segment."
    input_indices: [`marker_idx`, `sequence_end_idx`]
    input_colors: [`marker_color`, `sequence_color`] # Note: sequence_color is read from index marker_idx + 1
    output_effect:
      - grid[`marker_idx`] becomes `sequence_color`.
      - grid[`sequence_end_idx`] becomes `marker_color`.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - Background pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.
  - Pixels outside the identified `target_segment` remain unchanged.
  - Pixels within the `target_segment` *between* the first and last pixels retain their original color (`sequence_color`).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, expected to be a single-row NumPy array.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Access the single row from the output grid.
4.  Scan the row to find the index (`marker_idx`) of the first pixel that is not the background color (0).
5.  If no non-background pixel is found, return the unmodified output grid.
6.  Check the pixel immediately following the marker at index `marker_idx + 1`.
    *   If this index is out of bounds, or if the pixel at this index is the background color (0), or if it has the same color as the marker pixel, then the required pattern is not present. Return the unmodified output grid.
7.  Store the color of the marker pixel (`marker_color = row[marker_idx]`).
8.  Store the color of the pixel following the marker (`sequence_color = row[marker_idx + 1]`).
9.  Identify the end of the contiguous sequence of `sequence_color`. Initialize `sequence_end_idx = marker_idx + 1`. Iterate from `marker_idx + 2` onwards: if the pixel color equals `sequence_color`, update `sequence_end_idx` to the current index; otherwise, stop searching for the end of the sequence.
10. Perform the color swap on the output row:
    *   Set the pixel at `marker_idx` to `sequence_color`.
    *   Set the pixel at `sequence_end_idx` to `marker_color`.
11. Return the modified output grid.
