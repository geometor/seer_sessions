Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output data are presented as single rows (or 1-dimensional arrays) of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0), green (3), blue (1), red (2), orange (7), magenta (6), and yellow (4).

In each input example, there's a distinct pattern embedded within the white background pixels:
1.  A single pixel of one color (let's call this the "marker pixel").
2.  Immediately following the marker pixel, there is a contiguous sequence of pixels of another, single color (let's call this the "color sequence").

The transformation consistently involves swapping the positions of the marker pixel and the adjacent color sequence. The color sequence shifts one position to the left, occupying the original position of the marker pixel. The marker pixel moves to the position immediately following the end of the (now shifted) color sequence. The surrounding white background pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Swap a single marker pixel with the adjacent sequence of identical pixels.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1-dimensional array of pixels.
    properties:
      - contains_background: True
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains_pattern: True

  - element: pattern
    description: A specific arrangement of non-background pixels within the grid.
    components:
      - component: marker_pixel
        description: A single pixel of a non-background color.
        properties:
          - color: variable (e.g., green, red, magenta in examples)
          - quantity: 1
      - component: color_sequence
        description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-background pixels.
        properties:
          - color: variable (e.g., blue, orange, yellow in examples), different from marker_pixel color
          - quantity: variable (length > 1)
          - contiguous: True
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: The color_sequence immediately follows the marker_pixel.

actions:
  - action: locate_pattern
    description: Identify the marker_pixel and the adjacent color_sequence within the input grid.
  - action: swap_positions
    description: Exchange the position of the marker_pixel with the entire color_sequence.
    details:
      - The color_sequence moves to the original position of the marker_pixel.
      - The marker_pixel moves to the position immediately following the new position of the color_sequence.

invariants:
  - The background pixels (white) remain in their original positions.
  - The colors and lengths of the marker_pixel and color_sequence remain unchanged.
  - The relative order of pixels within the color_sequence is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first non-white pixel. This is the "marker pixel". Record its color and position.
2.  Examine the pixel immediately following the marker pixel. This pixel marks the beginning of the "color sequence". Record its color.
3.  Continue scanning to determine the full extent (length) of the contiguous color sequence (all pixels must have the same color identified in step 2). Record the length and the end position of this sequence.
4.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
5.  Place the entire color sequence into the output grid, starting at the original position of the marker pixel.
6.  Place the marker pixel into the output grid at the position immediately following the end of the newly placed color sequence.
7.  Ensure all other pixels (the background pixels) in the output grid retain their original values and positions from the input grid.
