task_description: Swap a single marker pixel with the adjacent sequence of identical pixels.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1-dimensional array of pixels.
    properties:
      - contains_background: True
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains_pattern: True

  - element: pattern
    description: A specific arrangement of non-background pixels within the grid.
    components:
      - component: marker_pixel
        description: A single pixel of a non-background color.
        properties:
          - color: variable (e.g., green, red, magenta in examples)
          - quantity: 1
      - component: color_sequence
        description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-background pixels.
        properties:
          - color: variable (e.g., blue, orange, yellow in examples), different from marker_pixel color
          - quantity: variable (length > 1)
          - contiguous: True
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: The color_sequence immediately follows the marker_pixel.

actions:
  - action: locate_pattern
    description: Identify the marker_pixel and the adjacent color_sequence within the input grid.
  - action: swap_positions
    description: Exchange the position of the marker_pixel with the entire color_sequence.
    details:
      - The color_sequence moves to the original position of the marker_pixel.
      - The marker_pixel moves to the position immediately following the new position of the color_sequence.

invariants:
  - The background pixels (white) remain in their original positions.
  - The colors and lengths of the marker_pixel and color_sequence remain unchanged.
  - The relative order of pixels within the color_sequence is preserved.
