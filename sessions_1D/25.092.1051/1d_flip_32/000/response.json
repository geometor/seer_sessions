The primary colors involved are white (0), green (3), blue (1), red (2), orange (7), magenta (6), and yellow (4).\n\nIn each input example, there's a distinct pattern embedded within the white background pixels:\n1.  A single pixel of one color (let's call this the \"marker pixel\").\n2.  Immediately following the marker pixel, there is a contiguous sequence of pixels of another, single color (let's call this the \"color sequence\").\n\nThe transformation consistently involves swapping the positions of the marker pixel and the adjacent color sequence. The color sequence shifts one position to the left, occupying the original position of the marker pixel. The marker pixel moves to the position immediately following the end of the (now shifted) color sequence. The surrounding white background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
