task_description: Modify a 1D grid by swapping the first and last pixels of the contiguous non-white segment.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: 1 row, variable columns (e.g., 1x23)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: segment
    description: A single contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - start_column: The column index of the first non-white pixel.
      - end_column: The column index of the last non-white pixel.
      - first_pixel_color: The color of the pixel at the start_column.
      - last_pixel_color: The color of the pixel at the end_column.
      - length: Greater than or equal to 2 pixels.
relationships:
  - The non-white segment is embedded within a background of white pixels.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the contiguous non-white segment within the input grid.
  - extract: Determine the start and end column indices and the colors of the first and last pixels of the segment.
  - swap: Exchange the positions of the first and last pixels within the identified segment.
  - reconstruct: Create the output grid by placing the modified segment back into its original position relative to the white background pixels.
