The grids consist primarily of white pixels (0) and contain a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels. This non-white segment is composed of at least two different colors. The transformation appears to operate solely on this non-white segment, leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged. Specifically, the first and last pixels of the non-white segment seem to exchange positions.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
