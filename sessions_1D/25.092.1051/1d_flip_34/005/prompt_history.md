Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both single rows (1D grids).
*   Each grid consists of white pixels (0) and a contiguous block of non-white pixels.
*   Within the non-white block, there is exactly one pixel of a unique color (let's call this the 'singular' color) and multiple pixels of another color (let's call this the 'repeated' color).
*   The transformation seems to operate solely within this non-white block.
*   The position of the 'singular' color pixel changes relative to the 'repeated' color pixels between the input and output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Move a unique pixel within a contiguous non-white block in a 1D grid.

Input_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - content:
      - background: white pixels (value 0)
      - object:
          - type: contiguous block
          - composition:
              - one pixel of a 'singular' non-white color
              - multiple pixels of a 'repeated' non-white color
          - location: embedded within the background white pixels

Output_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: same as input
  - content:
      - background: white pixels (value 0), identical positions as input
      - object:
          - type: contiguous block
          - composition: same 'singular' and 'repeated' colors as input block
          - location: same overall position as input block, but internal arrangement changed

Transformation:
  - focus: the contiguous block of non-white pixels
  - identification:
      - identify the 'singular' color pixel (occurs once)
      - identify the 'repeated' color pixels (occur multiple times)
  - action:
      - In all examples, the 'singular' pixel starts at the beginning (left side) of the non-white block.
      - In the output, the 'singular' pixel is moved to the end (right side) of the non-white block.
      - The 'repeated' color pixels shift one position to the left to fill the space vacated by the 'singular' pixel, maintaining their relative order.
  - preservation:
      - The white background pixels remain unchanged.
      - The colors themselves are preserved.
      - The overall length of the grid is preserved.
      - The length of the non-white block is preserved.

Examples_Summary:
  - train_1: Singular=red(2), Repeated=yellow(4). Red moves from start to end.
  - train_2: Singular=magenta(6), Repeated=green(3). Magenta moves from start to end.
  - train_3: Singular=gray(5), Repeated=red(2). Gray moves from start to end.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Within this sequence, find the pixel whose color appears only once (the 'singular' pixel). The remaining pixels in the sequence will all have the same color (the 'repeated' color).
3.  Determine the starting and ending indices of this non-white sequence in the input row.
4.  Create the output row by copying the input row initially.
5.  Remove the 'singular' pixel from its original position within the sequence.
6.  Insert the 'singular' pixel at the end of the sequence.
7.  Adjust the positions of the 'repeated' color pixels within the sequence to fill the gap left by the moved 'singular' pixel, maintaining their original relative order (effectively shifting them one position towards the original location of the singular pixel).
8.  Ensure the white pixels outside the sequence remain unchanged in the output row.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: locating a contiguous block of non-white pixels, identifying a unique ('singular') color and a repeated color within that block, and moving the singular color pixel to the end of the block while shifting the repeated color pixels forward. The natural language program described this logic well.

However, the Python code implementation failed on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This indicates a flaw in the code's conditional logic where a NumPy array is being treated as a single boolean value, rather than using `.any()` or `.all()` to evaluate its elements or checking its size explicitly. The transformation logic itself appears sound based on the examples, so the focus should be on debugging the implementation, particularly how arrays or array comparisons are used in `if` statements or other boolean contexts.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Pinpoint the Error:** Review the code, especially the `analyze_block` and `transform` functions, to find where an array might be used in a boolean check. The error likely occurs when checking conditions related to the identified colors or the block structure.
2.  **Calculate Metrics:** Use `tool_code` to extract detailed information about each example's input and output block (indices, colors, counts) to verify the assumptions made during the initial analysis.
3.  **Refine Implementation:** Correct the faulty boolean check in the code. Ensure all array comparisons or evaluations in conditional statements are handled correctly (e.g., using `array.size > 0`, `np.array_equal()`, `element in array`, `.any()`, `.all()`).
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on the validated metrics and corrected understanding of the implementation requirements.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Rearrange pixels within a specific type of non-white block in a 1D grid.

Input_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: variable width (e.g., 15, 15, 15 in examples)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - properties:
          - contains exactly two distinct non-white colors
          - one color appears exactly once ('singular_color')
          - the other color appears multiple times ('repeated_color')
          - the 'singular_color' pixel is always located at the start (leftmost position) of the block
      - examples:
          - block1: [red(2), yellow(4), yellow(4), yellow(4), yellow(4)] (start=7, end=11)
          - block2: [magenta(6), green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3)] (start=4, end=10)
          - block3: [gray(5), red(2), red(2), red(2)] (start=2, end=5)

Output_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: same as input grid
  - background_color: white (0), preserved from input
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - location: same start and end indices as the input block
      - properties:
          - contains the same 'singular_color' and 'repeated_color' as the input block
          - contains the same number of pixels of each color as the input block
          - arrangement: all instances of the 'repeated_color' appear first, followed by the single instance of the 'singular_color' at the end (rightmost position) of the block.
      - examples (corresponding to input):
          - block1_out: [yellow(4), yellow(4), yellow(4), yellow(4), red(2)]
          - block2_out: [green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3), magenta(6)]
          - block3_out: [red(2), red(2), red(2), gray(5)]

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - Verify the block contains exactly one pixel of a 'singular_color' and multiple pixels of a 'repeated_color'. (If this condition isn't met, the transformation might not apply, though examples always fit).
  - Preserve the block's overall position (start and end indices) and the counts of each color.
  - Rearrange the pixels within the block's boundaries: place all 'repeated_color' pixels first, followed by the single 'singular_color' pixel.
  - Leave all white (0) pixels outside the block unchanged.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scan** the input row to find the start and end indices of the single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
2.  **Extract** this block of pixels.
3.  **Analyze** the extracted block:
    *   Count the occurrences of each color within the block.
    *   Identify the color that appears exactly once (the `singular_color`).
    *   Identify the color that appears more than once (the `repeated_color`). Record its count (`repeated_count`).
4.  **Check** if the block meets the criteria: exactly one `singular_color` and one `repeated_color`. If not, return the input unchanged (based on example structure, this check might be implicitly passed).
5.  **Construct** the new arrangement for the block: Create a new sequence consisting of `repeated_count` instances of the `repeated_color`, followed by one instance of the `singular_color`.
6.  **Create** the output row by copying the input row.
7.  **Replace** the original block segment in the output row (from the start index to the end index found in step 1) with the newly constructed block arrangement from step 5.
8.  **Return** the modified output row.
