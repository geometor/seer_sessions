Task: Rearrange pixels within a specific type of non-white block in a 1D grid.

Input_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: variable width (e.g., 15, 15, 15 in examples)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - properties:
          - contains exactly two distinct non-white colors
          - one color appears exactly once ('singular_color')
          - the other color appears multiple times ('repeated_color')
          - the 'singular_color' pixel is always located at the start (leftmost position) of the block
      - examples:
          - block1: [red(2), yellow(4), yellow(4), yellow(4), yellow(4)] (start=7, end=11)
          - block2: [magenta(6), green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3)] (start=4, end=10)
          - block3: [gray(5), red(2), red(2), red(2)] (start=2, end=5)

Output_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: same as input grid
  - background_color: white (0), preserved from input
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - location: same start and end indices as the input block
      - properties:
          - contains the same 'singular_color' and 'repeated_color' as the input block
          - contains the same number of pixels of each color as the input block
          - arrangement: all instances of the 'repeated_color' appear first, followed by the single instance of the 'singular_color' at the end (rightmost position) of the block.
      - examples (corresponding to input):
          - block1_out: [yellow(4), yellow(4), yellow(4), yellow(4), red(2)]
          - block2_out: [green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3), green(3), magenta(6)]
          - block3_out: [red(2), red(2), red(2), gray(5)]

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - Verify the block contains exactly one pixel of a 'singular_color' and multiple pixels of a 'repeated_color'. (If this condition isn't met, the transformation might not apply, though examples always fit).
  - Preserve the block's overall position (start and end indices) and the counts of each color.
  - Rearrange the pixels within the block's boundaries: place all 'repeated_color' pixels first, followed by the single 'singular_color' pixel.
  - Leave all white (0) pixels outside the block unchanged.
