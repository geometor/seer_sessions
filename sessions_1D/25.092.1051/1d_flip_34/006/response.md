**General Assessment:**

The error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` indicates that a NumPy array was used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement). Reviewing the provided code, this likely occurs in the initial input validation checks within the `transform` function, specifically `if not input_grid[0]`. This check evaluates to `True` for an empty list (`[]`) but raises the error for a non-empty NumPy array. The test harness might be passing NumPy arrays, or lists containing NumPy arrays, triggering this error.

The strategy is to modify the input validation to explicitly check the length of the first row using `len()`, which works correctly for both standard Python lists and NumPy arrays, resolving the ambiguity. The core transformation logic identified (finding the non-white block, identifying singular/repeated colors, moving the singular to the end) appears consistent with the examples and does not need fundamental changes based on this error.

**Metrics:**

Code execution failed due to the input handling error, preventing the collection of runtime metrics or verification of intermediate steps using the provided code. However, analysis of the input/output pairs confirms the following structural properties and transformation characteristics:

*   **Structure:** All examples consist of a single row (1D grid). Each row contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (0).
*   **Block Composition:** Each non-white block contains exactly two distinct colors: one color appearing once ('singular') and another color appearing multiple times ('repeated').
*   **Transformation:** The singular color pixel is moved from its initial position within the block to the very end (rightmost position) of the block. The repeated color pixels shift to fill the vacated space, maintaining their count and relative order.
*   **Sizes:** Input and output rows have the same length. The non-white block retains its original length.
*   **Consistency:** The singular color always starts at the beginning (left) of the block in the input examples and always moves to the end (right) in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Rearrange pixels within a specific block in a 1D grid.

Input_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row represented as list of lists, e.g., `[[...]]`)
  - content:
    - background_pixels: Color white (0).
    - object:
      - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      - quantity: Exactly one per input row.
      - composition:
        - pixels: Two distinct non-white colors.
        - pattern: One color appears exactly once ('singular_color'), the other appears multiple times ('repeated_color').
        - location: The 'singular_color' pixel is observed at the start (leftmost position) of the block in all training examples.
      - context: Embedded within background_pixels.

Output_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: Same as input row length.
  - content:
    - background_pixels: Identical to input background_pixels.
    - object:
      - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      - location: Same start and end indices as the input block.
      - composition:
        - pixels: Same 'singular_color' and 'repeated_color' as the input block.
        - count: Same number of 'singular_color' (1) and 'repeated_color' pixels as input.
        - arrangement: The block is rearranged so that all 'repeated_color' pixels appear first, followed by the single 'singular_color' pixel at the end (rightmost position).

Transformation_Rule:
  - Find the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - Verify the block contains exactly one instance of a 'singular_color' and multiple instances of a 'repeated_color'.
  - If the pattern is met:
      - Create a new block sequence consisting of all 'repeated_color' pixels followed by the 'singular_color' pixel.
      - Replace the original block segment in the row with this new sequence.
  - If the pattern is not met (e.g., no block, only one color, more than two colors): Output the original row unchanged.
  - Preserve the white background pixels.

Assumptions_Based_On_Examples:
  - Input is always a single row.
  - There is at most one contiguous non-white block.
  - If a non-white block exists, it will contain exactly one singular color and one repeated color.
  - The singular color initially appears at the start of the block. (While observed, the core logic should handle other initial positions if the task generalizes).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Check if the input row is empty. If yes, return an empty row.
3.  Identify the start and end indices of the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
4.  If no non-white block is found, return the original input row.
5.  Extract the non-white block.
6.  Analyze the colors within the extracted block: count the occurrences of each distinct color.
7.  Check if the block contains exactly two distinct non-white colors, with one color appearing exactly once (the 'singular_color') and the other appearing multiple times (the 'repeated_color').
8.  If this specific color pattern (one singular, one repeated) is *not* found within the block, return the original input row unchanged.
9.  If the pattern *is* found:
    a.  Determine the 'singular_color', the 'repeated_color', and the count of the 'repeated_color'.
    b.  Construct a new sequence for the block: place the 'repeated_color' pixel count times, followed by the 'singular_color' pixel once at the end.
    c.  Create a copy of the original input row.
    d.  Replace the segment in the copied row corresponding to the original block's indices with the newly constructed sequence.
    e.  Return the modified row.
