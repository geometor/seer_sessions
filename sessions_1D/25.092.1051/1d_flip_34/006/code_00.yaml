Task: Rearrange pixels within a specific block in a 1D grid.

Input_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row represented as list of lists, e.g., `[[...]]`)
  - content:
    - background_pixels: Color white (0).
    - object:
      - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      - quantity: Exactly one per input row.
      - composition:
        - pixels: Two distinct non-white colors.
        - pattern: One color appears exactly once ('singular_color'), the other appears multiple times ('repeated_color').
        - location: The 'singular_color' pixel is observed at the start (leftmost position) of the block in all training examples.
      - context: Embedded within background_pixels.

Output_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: Same as input row length.
  - content:
    - background_pixels: Identical to input background_pixels.
    - object:
      - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      - location: Same start and end indices as the input block.
      - composition:
        - pixels: Same 'singular_color' and 'repeated_color' as the input block.
        - count: Same number of 'singular_color' (1) and 'repeated_color' pixels as input.
        - arrangement: The block is rearranged so that all 'repeated_color' pixels appear first, followed by the single 'singular_color' pixel at the end (rightmost position).

Transformation_Rule:
  - Find the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - Verify the block contains exactly one instance of a 'singular_color' and multiple instances of a 'repeated_color'.
  - If the pattern is met:
      - Create a new block sequence consisting of all 'repeated_color' pixels followed by the 'singular_color' pixel.
      - Replace the original block segment in the row with this new sequence.
  - If the pattern is not met (e.g., no block, only one color, more than two colors): Output the original row unchanged.
  - Preserve the white background pixels.

Assumptions_Based_On_Examples:
  - Input is always a single row.
  - There is at most one contiguous non-white block.
  - If a non-white block exists, it will contain exactly one singular color and one repeated color.
  - The singular color initially appears at the start of the block. (While observed, the core logic should handle other initial positions if the task generalizes).
