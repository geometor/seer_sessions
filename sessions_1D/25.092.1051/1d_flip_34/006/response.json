            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` indicates that a NumPy array was used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement). Reviewing the provided code, this likely occurs in the initial input validation checks within the `transform` function, specifically `if not input_grid[0]`. This check evaluates to `True` for an empty list (`[]`) but raises the error for a non-empty NumPy array. The test harness might be passing NumPy arrays, or lists containing NumPy arrays, triggering this error.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the input validation to explicitly check the length of the first row using `len()`, which works correctly for both standard Python lists and NumPy arrays, resolving the ambiguity. The core transformation logic identified (finding the non-white block, identifying singular/repeated colors, moving the singular to the end) appears consistent with the examples and does not need fundamental changes based on this error.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nCode execution failed due to the input handling error, preventing the collection of runtime metrics or verification of intermediate steps using the provided code. However, analysis of the input/output pairs confirms the following structural properties and transformation characteristics:\n\n*   **Structure:** All examples consist of a single row (1D grid). Each row contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (0).\n*   **Block Composition:** Each non-white block contains exactly two distinct colors: one color appearing once ('singular') and another color appearing multiple times ('repeated').\n*   **Transformation:** The singular color pixel is moved from its initial position within the block to the very end (rightmost position) of the block. The repeated color pixels shift to fill the vacated space, maintaining their count and relative order.\n*   **Sizes:** Input and output rows have the same length. The non-white block retains its original length.\n*   **Consistency:** The singular color always starts at the beginning (left) of the block in the input examples and always moves to the end (right) in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
