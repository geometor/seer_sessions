Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both single rows (1D grids).
*   Each grid consists of white pixels (0) and a contiguous block of non-white pixels.
*   Within the non-white block, there is exactly one pixel of a unique color (let's call this the 'singular' color) and multiple pixels of another color (let's call this the 'repeated' color).
*   The transformation seems to operate solely within this non-white block.
*   The position of the 'singular' color pixel changes relative to the 'repeated' color pixels between the input and output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Move a unique pixel within a contiguous non-white block in a 1D grid.

Input_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - content:
      - background: white pixels (value 0)
      - object:
          - type: contiguous block
          - composition:
              - one pixel of a 'singular' non-white color
              - multiple pixels of a 'repeated' non-white color
          - location: embedded within the background white pixels

Output_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: same as input
  - content:
      - background: white pixels (value 0), identical positions as input
      - object:
          - type: contiguous block
          - composition: same 'singular' and 'repeated' colors as input block
          - location: same overall position as input block, but internal arrangement changed

Transformation:
  - focus: the contiguous block of non-white pixels
  - identification:
      - identify the 'singular' color pixel (occurs once)
      - identify the 'repeated' color pixels (occur multiple times)
  - action:
      - In all examples, the 'singular' pixel starts at the beginning (left side) of the non-white block.
      - In the output, the 'singular' pixel is moved to the end (right side) of the non-white block.
      - The 'repeated' color pixels shift one position to the left to fill the space vacated by the 'singular' pixel, maintaining their relative order.
  - preservation:
      - The white background pixels remain unchanged.
      - The colors themselves are preserved.
      - The overall length of the grid is preserved.
      - The length of the non-white block is preserved.

Examples_Summary:
  - train_1: Singular=red(2), Repeated=yellow(4). Red moves from start to end.
  - train_2: Singular=magenta(6), Repeated=green(3). Magenta moves from start to end.
  - train_3: Singular=gray(5), Repeated=red(2). Gray moves from start to end.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Within this sequence, find the pixel whose color appears only once (the 'singular' pixel). The remaining pixels in the sequence will all have the same color (the 'repeated' color).
3.  Determine the starting and ending indices of this non-white sequence in the input row.
4.  Create the output row by copying the input row initially.
5.  Remove the 'singular' pixel from its original position within the sequence.
6.  Insert the 'singular' pixel at the end of the sequence.
7.  Adjust the positions of the 'repeated' color pixels within the sequence to fill the gap left by the moved 'singular' pixel, maintaining their original relative order (effectively shifting them one position towards the original location of the singular pixel).
8.  Ensure the white pixels outside the sequence remain unchanged in the output row.
