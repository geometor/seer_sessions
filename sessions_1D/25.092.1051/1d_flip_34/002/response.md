**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code attempt failed with a "truth value of an array is ambiguous" error across all training examples. This typically indicates a NumPy array was used in a boolean context (like an `if` statement) where a single `True`/`False` was expected. While a review of the code didn't immediately reveal an obvious culprit in the core logic sections, the error might stem from subtle interactions with NumPy array comparisons or potentially within the `np.where` function under specific conditions, or even how the testing environment interacts with the function.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-verify the core transformation logic against the examples.
2.  Implement the block finding and element identification using more explicit loops, avoiding `np.where` to rule it out as a source of the error.
3.  Use tool code to extract key features (block boundaries, unique/repeated elements) from each example to confirm understanding.
4.  Refine the YAML description and the natural language program based on confirmed observations.

**Analysis of Metrics Error:** The tool code failed because JSON keys must be strings, but NumPy integer types (like `int64` from `start_index`, `end_index`) were used directly. This needs correction by explicitly casting dictionary keys derived from NumPy integers to standard Python `int` or `str` where appropriate. The color counts dictionary keys (the colors themselves) are likely `int64` and causing the failure.

**Metrics Analysis:** The metrics confirm the initial observations: each input row contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels. Within this block, there is exactly one pixel of a 'singular' color and multiple pixels of a single 'repeated' color. The singular color always appears at the start (left) of the block in the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Reorder elements within a contiguous non-white block in a 1D grid.

Input_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - content:
      - background_pixels: color=white(0)
      - object:
          - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
          - properties: contains exactly one pixel of a unique color ('singular_color') and multiple pixels of another single color ('repeated_color').
          - initial_arrangement: The 'singular_color' pixel is always at the leftmost position within the block.
          - location: Embedded within background pixels.

Output_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: same as input row length
  - content:
      - background_pixels: identical to input
      - object:
          - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
          - location: same start and end indices as the input block
          - composition: same 'singular_color' and 'repeated_color' pixels as input, same counts.
          - final_arrangement: All 'repeated_color' pixels are shifted to the left, occupying the initial segment of the block, followed by the single 'singular_color' pixel at the rightmost position within the block.

Transformation:
  - step: 1. Identify the boundaries (start and end indices) of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - step: 2. Within this block, identify the 'singular_color' (appears once) and the 'repeated_color' (appears multiple times). Note the count of the 'repeated_color' pixels.
  - step: 3. Create a new sequence for the block: place all 'repeated_color' pixels first, followed by the single 'singular_color' pixel.
  - step: 4. Replace the original block in the input row (between the identified start and end indices) with this newly created sequence.
  - step: 5. Preserve all white(0) pixels outside the block boundaries.

Examples_Summary:
  - train_1: Block [2, 4, 4, 4, 4] (indices 7-11). Singular=2, Repeated=4. Output block: [4, 4, 4, 4, 2].
  - train_2: Block [6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] (indices 4-10). Singular=6, Repeated=3. Output block: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6].
  - train_3: Block [5, 2, 2, 2] (indices 2-5). Singular=5, Repeated=2. Output block: [2, 2, 2, 5].

Constraint_Verification:
  - Only one contiguous non-white block per row.
  - Block contains exactly one singular color and one repeated color.
  - Singular color starts at the beginning of the block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
2.  Iterate through the input row to find the start and end indices of the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
3.  If no non-white block is found, return the copied input row.
4.  Extract the sequence of pixels corresponding to this block.
5.  Count the occurrences of each color within the extracted block.
6.  Identify the color that appears exactly once (the 'singular' color) and the color that appears multiple times (the 'repeated' color'). Store the count of the 'repeated' color.
7.  Construct a new sequence for the block: create a list containing the 'repeated' color repeated by its count, and append the 'singular' color to the end of this list.
8.  Replace the pixels in the output row, from the start index to the end index of the block, with the elements of the newly constructed sequence.
9.  Return the modified output row.
