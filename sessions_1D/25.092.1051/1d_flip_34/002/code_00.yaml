Task: Reorder elements within a contiguous non-white block in a 1D grid.

Input_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - content:
      - background_pixels: color=white(0)
      - object:
          - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
          - properties: contains exactly one pixel of a unique color ('singular_color') and multiple pixels of another single color ('repeated_color').
          - initial_arrangement: The 'singular_color' pixel is always at the leftmost position within the block.
          - location: Embedded within background pixels.

Output_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: same as input row length
  - content:
      - background_pixels: identical to input
      - object:
          - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
          - location: same start and end indices as the input block
          - composition: same 'singular_color' and 'repeated_color' pixels as input, same counts.
          - final_arrangement: All 'repeated_color' pixels are shifted to the left, occupying the initial segment of the block, followed by the single 'singular_color' pixel at the rightmost position within the block.

Transformation:
  - step: 1. Identify the boundaries (start and end indices) of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - step: 2. Within this block, identify the 'singular_color' (appears once) and the 'repeated_color' (appears multiple times). Note the count of the 'repeated_color' pixels.
  - step: 3. Create a new sequence for the block: place all 'repeated_color' pixels first, followed by the single 'singular_color' pixel.
  - step: 4. Replace the original block in the input row (between the identified start and end indices) with this newly created sequence.
  - step: 5. Preserve all white(0) pixels outside the block boundaries.

Examples_Summary:
  - train_1: Block [2, 4, 4, 4, 4] (indices 7-11). Singular=2, Repeated=4. Output block: [4, 4, 4, 4, 2].
  - train_2: Block [6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] (indices 4-10). Singular=6, Repeated=3. Output block: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6].
  - train_3: Block [5, 2, 2, 2] (indices 2-5). Singular=5, Repeated=2. Output block: [2, 2, 2, 5].

Constraint_Verification:
  - Only one contiguous non-white block per row.
  - Block contains exactly one singular color and one repeated color.
  - Singular color starts at the beginning of the block.
