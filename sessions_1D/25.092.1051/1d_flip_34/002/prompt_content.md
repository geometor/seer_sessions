"""
Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row.
Within this sequence, find the pixel whose color appears only once (the 'singular' pixel) 
and the pixel whose color appears multiple times (the 'repeated' color).
Move the 'singular' pixel to the end (right side) of the sequence, and shift the 
'repeated' color pixels to the beginning of the sequence, maintaining their count.
White pixels outside the sequence remain unchanged.
