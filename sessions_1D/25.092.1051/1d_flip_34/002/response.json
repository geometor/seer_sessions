This typically indicates a NumPy array was used in a boolean context (like an `if` statement) where a single `True`/`False` was expected. While a review of the code didn't immediately reveal an obvious culprit in the core logic sections, the error might stem from subtle interactions with NumPy array comparisons or potentially within the `np.where` function under specific conditions, or even how the testing environment interacts with the function.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-verify the core transformation logic against the examples.\n2.  Implement the block finding and element identification using more explicit loops, avoiding `np.where` to rule it out as a source of the error.\n3.  Use tool code to extract key features (block boundaries, unique/repeated elements) from each example to confirm understanding.\n4.  Refine the YAML description and the natural language program based on confirmed observations.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
