Task: Move a unique pixel within a contiguous non-white block in a 1D grid.

Input_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - content:
      - background: white pixels (value 0)
      - object:
          - type: contiguous block
          - composition:
              - one pixel of a 'singular' non-white color
              - multiple pixels of a 'repeated' non-white color
          - location: embedded within the background white pixels

Output_Structure:
  - type: grid
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size: same as input
  - content:
      - background: white pixels (value 0), identical positions as input
      - object:
          - type: contiguous block
          - composition: same 'singular' and 'repeated' colors as input block
          - location: same overall position as input block, but internal arrangement changed

Transformation:
  - focus: the contiguous block of non-white pixels
  - identification:
      - identify the 'singular' color pixel (occurs once)
      - identify the 'repeated' color pixels (occur multiple times)
  - action:
      - In all examples, the 'singular' pixel starts at the beginning (left side) of the non-white block.
      - In the output, the 'singular' pixel is moved to the end (right side) of the non-white block.
      - The 'repeated' color pixels shift one position to the left to fill the space vacated by the 'singular' pixel, maintaining their relative order.
  - preservation:
      - The white background pixels remain unchanged.
      - The colors themselves are preserved.
      - The overall length of the grid is preserved.
      - The length of the non-white block is preserved.

Examples_Summary:
  - train_1: Singular=red(2), Repeated=yellow(4). Red moves from start to end.
  - train_2: Singular=magenta(6), Repeated=green(3). Magenta moves from start to end.
  - train_3: Singular=gray(5), Repeated=red(2). Gray moves from start to end.
