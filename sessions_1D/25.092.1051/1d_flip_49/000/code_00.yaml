task_description: Move a specific non-white pixel ('marker') from the left end to the right end of an adjacent contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.

elements:
  - element_type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: occupies space not taken by other elements

  - element_type: sequence
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., magenta, orange)
      structure: contiguous 1D block
      pixels: all pixels within the sequence have the same color
      variable: color and length can vary between examples

  - element_type: marker
    properties:
      color: non-white, different from the sequence color (e.g., red, azure)
      structure: single pixel
      position: immediately adjacent to the left of the 'sequence' in the input
      variable: color can vary between examples

relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    from: marker
    to: sequence
    details: marker is immediately to the left of the sequence's start in the input.

transformation:
  - action: move
    target: marker
    from_position: left_adjacent_to_sequence_start
    to_position: right_adjacent_to_sequence_end
    constraints:
      - The sequence pixels remain unchanged in color and relative order.
      - The background pixels remain unchanged.
      - The overall dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.

examples_summary:
  - example: 1
    marker_color: red (2)
    sequence_color: magenta (6)
    action: move red pixel from left to right of magenta sequence.
  - example: 2
    marker_color: red (2)
    sequence_color: orange (7)
    action: move red pixel from left to right of orange sequence.
  - example: 3
    marker_color: azure (8)
    sequence_color: orange (7)
    action: move azure pixel from left to right of orange sequence.
