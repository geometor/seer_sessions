Given the context of ARC tasks usually involving 2D grids, these could represent flattened grids. However, based on the transformation observed, treating them as 1-dimensional sequences seems sufficient and simpler. All examples have the same length (32 elements).\n2.  **Content**: The grids consist mostly of white pixels (0). Each input contains a contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels (magenta in Ex1, orange in Ex2 & Ex3). Immediately to the left of this sequence is a single pixel of a *different* non-white color (red in Ex1 & Ex2, azure in Ex3).\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves the single non-white pixel that precedes the sequence. In the output, this single pixel is moved from the left end of the sequence to the right end of the sequence. The sequence itself and all other pixels (the surrounding white pixels) remain unchanged in color and relative position.\n4.  **Objects**: We can identify three types of objects/regions:\n    *   The \"background\" (white pixels).\n    *   The \"sequence\" (the contiguous block of identical non-white pixels).\n    *   The \"marker\" (the single, different non-white pixel adjacent to the left of the sequence).\n5.  **Action**: The action is a positional shift of the \"marker\" object relative to the \"sequence\" object.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify a pattern where a non-white pixel (the \"marker\") is immediately followed by one or more identical non-white pixels (the \"sequence\"), where the marker's color is different from the sequence's color.\n3.  Determine the start index of the marker, the start index of the sequence, and the end index of the sequence.\n4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n5.  Set the cell at the marker's original position in the output grid to white (0).\n6.  Shift the entire sequence one position to the left in the output grid (occupying the marker's original position and the sequence's original positions except the last).\n7.  Place the marker's color in the cell immediately to the right of the sequence's original end position in the output grid.\n8.  Alternatively, conceptually: Find the marker pixel and the sequence it precedes. In the output, place the sequence first, immediately followed by the marker pixel, maintaining the original positions of all other background pixels."
