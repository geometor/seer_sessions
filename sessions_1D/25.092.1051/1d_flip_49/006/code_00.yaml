task_description: Swap the position of a single non-white 'marker' pixel and an adjacent contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels within a 1D grid.

elements:
  - element_type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: occupies space not taken by other elements; remains unchanged.

  - element_type: marker
    properties:
      color: non-white (value 1-9)
      structure: single pixel
      role: identifies the start of the pattern block.
      variable: color and position can vary.

  - element_type: sequence
    properties:
      color: non-white (value 1-9), different from the marker color.
      structure: contiguous 1D block of one or more pixels.
      pixels: all pixels within the sequence have the same color.
      role: forms the main body of the pattern block.
      variable: color, length, and position can vary.

relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    from: marker
    to: sequence
    details: marker is immediately to the left of the sequence's start in the input.

transformation:
  - action: positional_swap
    target: marker and sequence block
    details: Within the combined indices originally occupied by the marker and the sequence, place the sequence first, followed immediately by the marker.
    constraints:
      - The marker and sequence colors remain unchanged.
      - The relative order of pixels within the sequence remains unchanged (implicitly, as they are all the same color).
      - The total length of the marker + sequence block remains unchanged.
      - Pixels outside the marker + sequence block (background) remain unchanged in color and position.

examples_summary:
  - example: 1
    marker_color: red (2)
    marker_index: 14
    sequence_color: magenta (6)
    sequence_indices: 15-22 (length 8)
    action: Place magenta sequence at indices 14-21, red marker at index 22.
  - example: 2
    marker_color: red (2)
    marker_index: 10
    sequence_color: orange (7)
    sequence_indices: 11-22 (length 12)
    action: Place orange sequence at indices 10-21, red marker at index 22.
  - example: 3
    marker_color: azure (8)
    marker_index: 21
    sequence_color: orange (7)
    sequence_indices: 22-29 (length 8)
    action: Place orange sequence at indices 21-28, azure marker at index 29.
