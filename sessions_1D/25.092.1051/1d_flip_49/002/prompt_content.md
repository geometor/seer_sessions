"""
Identify a specific pattern in the 1D input array: a non-white pixel ('marker') 
immediately followed by a sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels 
('sequence'), where the marker's color differs from the sequence's color. 
The transformation involves moving the marker pixel from the left side of the 
sequence to the right side. Specifically, the sequence shifts one position to 
the left to occupy the original marker's position, and the marker is placed 
immediately to the right of the shifted sequence. All other pixels (background) 
remain unchanged.
