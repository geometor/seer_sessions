Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are presented as 1D arrays (sequences of numbers). Given the context of ARC tasks usually involving 2D grids, these could represent flattened grids. However, based on the transformation observed, treating them as 1-dimensional sequences seems sufficient and simpler. All examples have the same length (32 elements).
2.  **Content**: The grids consist mostly of white pixels (0). Each input contains a contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels (magenta in Ex1, orange in Ex2 & Ex3). Immediately to the left of this sequence is a single pixel of a *different* non-white color (red in Ex1 & Ex2, azure in Ex3).
3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves the single non-white pixel that precedes the sequence. In the output, this single pixel is moved from the left end of the sequence to the right end of the sequence. The sequence itself and all other pixels (the surrounding white pixels) remain unchanged in color and relative position.
4.  **Objects**: We can identify three types of objects/regions:
    *   The "background" (white pixels).
    *   The "sequence" (the contiguous block of identical non-white pixels).
    *   The "marker" (the single, different non-white pixel adjacent to the left of the sequence).
5.  **Action**: The action is a positional shift of the "marker" object relative to the "sequence" object.

## YAML Facts


```yaml

elements:
  - element_type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: occupies space not taken by other elements

  - element_type: sequence
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., magenta, orange)
      structure: contiguous 1D block
      pixels: all pixels within the sequence have the same color
      variable: color and length can vary between examples

  - element_type: marker
    properties:
      color: non-white, different from the sequence color (e.g., red, azure)
      structure: single pixel
      position: immediately adjacent to the left of the 'sequence' in the input
      variable: color can vary between examples

relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    from: marker
    to: sequence
    details: marker is immediately to the left of the sequence's start in the input.

transformation:
  - action: move
    target: marker
    from_position: left_adjacent_to_sequence_start
    to_position: right_adjacent_to_sequence_end
    constraints:
      - The sequence pixels remain unchanged in color and relative order.
      - The background pixels remain unchanged.
      - The overall dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.

examples_summary:
  - example: 1
    marker_color: red (2)
    sequence_color: magenta (6)
    action: move red pixel from left to right of magenta sequence.
  - example: 2
    marker_color: red (2)
    sequence_color: orange (7)
    action: move red pixel from left to right of orange sequence.

    action: move azure pixel from left to right of orange sequence.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid (treating it as a 1D sequence) from left to right.
2.  Identify a pattern where a non-white pixel (the "marker") is immediately followed by one or more identical non-white pixels (the "sequence"), where the marker's color is different from the sequence's color.
3.  Determine the start index of the marker, the start index of the sequence, and the end index of the sequence.
4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5.  Set the cell at the marker's original position in the output grid to white (0).
6.  Shift the entire sequence one position to the left in the output grid (occupying the marker's original position and the sequence's original positions except the last).
7.  Place the marker's color in the cell immediately to the right of the sequence's original end position in the output grid.
8.  Alternatively, conceptually: Find the marker pixel and the sequence it precedes. In the output, place the sequence first, immediately followed by the marker pixel, maintaining the original positions of all other background pixels.
```python
import copy

"""
Identify a specific pattern in the 1D input array: a non-white pixel ('marker') 
immediately followed by a sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels 
('sequence'), where the marker's color differs from the sequence's color. 
The transformation involves moving the marker pixel from the left side of the 
sequence to the right side. Specifically, the sequence shifts one position to 
the left to occupy the original marker's position, and the marker is placed 
immediately to the right of the shifted sequence. All other pixels (background) 
remain unchanged.
