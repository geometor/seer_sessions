"""
Identify a specific pattern in the 1D input array: a non-white pixel ('marker') 
immediately followed by a sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels 
('sequence'), where the marker's color differs from the sequence's color. 
The transformation involves swapping their order: the sequence is placed first, 
followed immediately by the marker, starting at the original marker's position. 
All other pixels (background) remain unchanged.
