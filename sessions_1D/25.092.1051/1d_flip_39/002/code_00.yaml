task_dimensionality: 2D grid (specifically 1xN)
input_output_types: NumPy arrays (int64 dtype)
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - Contains a single row.
      - Contains a background of white (0) pixels.
      - Contains one contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels within the row.
  - type: block (non-white sequence within the row)
    properties:
      - Always starts with a single magenta (6) pixel.
      - The remaining pixels in the block are either all azure (8) or all orange (7).
      - Contiguous.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - Colors used: white (0), magenta (6), azure (8), orange (7).
actions:
  - identify: Locate the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the single row of the input grid.
  - extract: Isolate the sequence of pixels forming this block.
  - decompose: Separate the first pixel (magenta) from the rest of the pixels in the block.
  - reconstruct_block: Form a new block by appending the magenta pixel to the end of the sequence of the *other* pixels from the original block.
  - replace: Substitute the original block sequence in the row with the newly reconstructed block sequence.
  - return: Output the modified grid (which still has 1 row).
relationships:
  - The non-white block is embedded within the white background pixels in the row.
invariance:
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged (1xN).
  - The pixels outside the identified non-white block remain unchanged.
  - The colors and the count of non-magenta pixels within the block remain the same; only their relative order changes (they shift left).
  - The magenta pixel's color remains the same, but its position moves from the start to the end of the block.
