*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of pixels.
    *   The primary colors involved are white (0), magenta (6), azure (8), and orange (7).
    *   Each input contains a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels, always starting with a single magenta (6) pixel followed by a sequence of either azure (8) or orange (7) pixels. This sequence is surrounded by white (0) pixels.
    *   The transformation involves manipulating only this contiguous non-white sequence.
    *   Specifically, the magenta (6) pixel is moved from the beginning to the end of the non-white sequence. The subsequent pixels (azure or orange) are shifted one position to the left to fill the original position of the magenta pixel.
    *   The surrounding white (0) pixels remain unchanged in their positions.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_dimensionality: 1D array (or 1xN grid)
    objects:
      - type: sequence
        color: non-white (magenta followed by azure or orange)
        properties:
          - contiguous
          - contains exactly one magenta (6) pixel
          - the magenta pixel is always at the start of the sequence
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)
        properties:
          - acts as background/padding
    actions:
      - identify: locate the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
      - find: locate the magenta (6) pixel within this sequence.
      - move: relocate the magenta (6) pixel to the end of the sequence.
      - shift: move the other pixels within the sequence one position towards the start to fill the gap.
    relationships:
      - the non-white sequence is embedded within a background of white pixels.
      - the magenta pixel is initially positioned at the start of the non-white sequence.
    invariance:
      - the surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
      - the colors and count of the non-magenta pixels within the sequence remain unchanged, only their position shifts.
      - the overall length of the array remains unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input array.
    2.  Find the magenta (6) pixel within this block (it will be the first pixel of the block).
    3.  Find the sequence of non-magenta pixels following the magenta pixel within the block.
    4.  Construct the output block by placing the sequence of non-magenta pixels first, followed immediately by the magenta (6) pixel.
    5.  Reconstruct the full output array by placing the modified block back into its original position, surrounded by the unchanged white (0) pixels.
