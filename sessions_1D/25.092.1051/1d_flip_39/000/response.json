This sequence is surrounded by white (0) pixels.\n    *   The transformation involves manipulating only this contiguous non-white sequence.\n    *   Specifically, the magenta (6) pixel is moved from the beginning to the end of the non-white sequence. The subsequent pixels (azure or orange) are shifted one position to the left to fill the original position of the magenta pixel.\n    *   The surrounding white (0) pixels remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
