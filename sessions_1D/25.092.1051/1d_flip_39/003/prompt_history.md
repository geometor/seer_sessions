*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of pixels.
    *   The primary colors involved are white (0), magenta (6), azure (8), and orange (7).
    *   Each input contains a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels, always starting with a single magenta (6) pixel followed by a sequence of either azure (8) or orange (7) pixels. This sequence is surrounded by white (0) pixels.
    *   The transformation involves manipulating only this contiguous non-white sequence.
    *   Specifically, the magenta (6) pixel is moved from the beginning to the end of the non-white sequence. The subsequent pixels (azure or orange) are shifted one position to the left to fill the original position of the magenta pixel.
    *   The surrounding white (0) pixels remain unchanged in their positions.

*   **Facts:**

      - shift: move the other pixels within the sequence one position towards the start to fill the gap.
    relationships:
      - the non-white sequence is embedded within a background of white pixels.
      - the magenta pixel is initially positioned at the start of the non-white sequence.

## General Assessment

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation: moving the first element (magenta) of a contiguous non-white block to the end of that block. However, it incorrectly assumed the input was a 1D list instead of a 1xN 2D NumPy array, leading to the `ValueError` during execution. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" typically occurs in NumPy when a boolean operation is expected on a single boolean value, but it receives an array of booleans (often resulting from element-wise comparisons on arrays). This confirms the input is likely a multi-dimensional array.

The strategy is to adjust the approach to explicitly handle a 2D NumPy array input, specifically extracting the single row, performing the transformation logic on that row (treated as a 1D sequence), and then reconstructing the output as a 2D array.

## Facts


```yaml
task_dimensionality: 2D grid (specifically 1xN)
input_output_types: NumPy arrays (int64 dtype)
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - Contains a single row.
      - Contains a background of white (0) pixels.
      - Contains one contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels within the row.
  - type: block (non-white sequence within the row)
    properties:
      - Always starts with a single magenta (6) pixel.
      - The remaining pixels in the block are either all azure (8) or all orange (7).
      - Contiguous.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - Colors used: white (0), magenta (6), azure (8), orange (7).
actions:
  - identify: Locate the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the single row of the input grid.
  - extract: Isolate the sequence of pixels forming this block.
  - decompose: Separate the first pixel (magenta) from the rest of the pixels in the block.
  - reconstruct_block: Form a new block by appending the magenta pixel to the end of the sequence of the *other* pixels from the original block.
  - replace: Substitute the original block sequence in the row with the newly reconstructed block sequence.
  - return: Output the modified grid (which still has 1 row).
relationships:
  - The non-white block is embedded within the white background pixels in the row.
invariance:
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged (1xN).
  - The pixels outside the identified non-white block remain unchanged.
  - The colors and the count of non-magenta pixels within the block remain the same; only their relative order changes (they shift left).
  - The magenta pixel's color remains the same, but its position moves from the start to the end of the block.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array with a single row.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Extract the single row from the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the row to find the start and end indices of the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
5.  If a non-white block is found:
    a.  Extract the sequence of pixels corresponding to this block from the input row.
    b.  Verify that the block is not empty and that the first pixel in the block is magenta (6).
    c.  If the conditions in (b) are met:
        i.  Store the first pixel (magenta).
        ii. Store the sequence of the remaining pixels in the block.
        iii. Create a new sequence by concatenating the sequence from step (c.ii) followed by the magenta pixel from step (c.i).
        iv. Replace the segment in the output grid's row corresponding to the original block's indices with this new sequence.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
