Each example contains a sequence of white pixels (0) surrounding a contiguous block of non-white pixels. This non-white block consistently consists of two distinct colors: one color appears as a single pixel, and the other color appears as a contiguous block of multiple pixels. The transformation involves swapping the positions of the single pixel and the block of pixels within this non-white sequence, leaving the surrounding white pixels unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Note the start and end indices of this region.\n2.  **Identify Objects within the Active Region:** Within the active region, identify the single pixel of one color and the contiguous block of pixels of the other color.\n3.  **Determine Order:** Observe the order in which the single pixel and the block appear within the input's active region.\n4.  **Perform Swap:** Create the output's active region by placing the block of pixels first, followed by the single pixel, if the single pixel was first in the input, OR by placing the single pixel first, followed by the block of pixels, if the block was first in the input (i.e., reverse their order).\n5.  **Construct Output Array:** Reconstruct the full output array by keeping the white pixels before the active region, inserting the swapped active region, and keeping the white pixels after the active region, maintaining the original array length."
