task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: 0 # white
    role: static frame surrounding the active region
  - type: active_region
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels within the input array.
    composition: Contains exactly two distinct non-zero colors.
    structure:
      - type: object
        description: A single pixel of one non-zero color.
        properties:
          - count: 1
      - type: object
        description: A contiguous block of pixels of a second non-zero color.
        properties:
          - count: >1
          - contiguous: true
    relationship: The two objects are adjacent within the active region.
transformation:
  action: swap_positions
  target: The two objects (single pixel and color block) within the active region.
  effect: The relative order of the single pixel and the color block is reversed in the output array.
  context: The background pixels remain unchanged and maintain their positions relative to the modified active region.
