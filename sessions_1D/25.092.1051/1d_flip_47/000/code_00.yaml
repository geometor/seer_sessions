task_description: Swap a single non-white pixel with the pixel at the opposite end of an adjacent non-white block.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row in the examples)
objects:
  - type: block
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., yellow(4), gray(5), azure(8))
    shape: contiguous horizontal line segment
    identifier: Block A
  - type: pixel
    color: non-white (variable, different from Block A, e.g., red(2), blue(1), green(3))
    shape: single pixel
    identifier: Pixel B
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills remaining space
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: Pixel B
    object2: Block A
    details: Pixel B is always immediately adjacent (left or right) to one end of Block A.
transformation:
  action: swap_pixels
  target1: Pixel B
  target2: The pixel at the end of Block A that is *not* adjacent to Pixel B.
  effect: The colors (values) at the original index of Pixel B and the index of the opposite end of Block A are exchanged.
invariants:
  - The color and length of the main body of Block A.
  - The position of the main body of Block A.
  - The color and position of all white background pixels.
