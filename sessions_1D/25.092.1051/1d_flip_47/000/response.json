            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format**: The inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (single rows) of colored pixels, represented by integers 0-9. White (0) acts as a background color.\n2.  **Key Objects**: In each input, there are two distinct non-white colored objects:\n    *   A contiguous block of pixels of one color (let's call this Block A).\n    *   A single pixel of a different non-white color (let's call this Pixel B).\n3.  **Relationships**: Pixel B is always located immediately adjacent (horizontally) to one end of Block A. The rest of the grid pixels are white.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves changing the positions of two pixels: Pixel B and the pixel at the end of Block A *opposite* to Pixel B. Specifically, these two pixels swap their colors (and effectively their positions).\n5.  **Invariants**: The color and length of Block A remain the same. The position of Block A (excluding the swapped end pixel) remains the same. The positions of all white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (train_1)**\n*   Input: `2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 ...`\n*   Block A: Color yellow (4), indices 1 through 8.\n*   Pixel B: Color red (2), index 0.\n*   Pixel B is adjacent to the start (index 1) of Block A.\n*   The opposite end of Block A is at index 8 (value 4).\n*   Swap the values at index 0 (red 2) and index 8 (yellow 4).\n*   Output: `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 2 0 ...`\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Determine its color (`color_B`) and index (`index_B`).\n3.  Check if `index_B` is equal to `start_A - 1` (Pixel B is to the left of Block A).\n    *   If true, the index of the pixel at the opposite end of Block A is `end_A`. Store this as `swap_index`.\n4.

Store this as `swap_index`.\n5.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output array.\n6.  In the output array, set the value at `index_B` to the value originally at `swap_index` in the input array (which is `color_A`).\n7.  In the output array, set the value at `swap_index` to `color_B`.\n8.  Return the modified output array."
