Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Format**: The inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (single rows) of colored pixels, represented by integers 0-9. White (0) acts as a background color.
2.  **Key Objects**: In each input, there are two distinct non-white colored objects:
    *   A contiguous block of pixels of one color (let's call this Block A).
    *   A single pixel of a different non-white color (let's call this Pixel B).
3.  **Relationships**: Pixel B is always located immediately adjacent (horizontally) to one end of Block A. The rest of the grid pixels are white.
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves changing the positions of two pixels: Pixel B and the pixel at the end of Block A *opposite* to Pixel B. Specifically, these two pixels swap their colors (and effectively their positions).
5.  **Invariants**: The color and length of Block A remain the same. The position of Block A (excluding the swapped end pixel) remains the same. The positions of all white pixels remain unchanged.

**Example Walkthrough (train_1)**
*   Input: `2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 ...`
*   Block A: Color yellow (4), indices 1 through 8.
*   Pixel B: Color red (2), index 0.
*   Pixel B is adjacent to the start (index 1) of Block A.
*   The opposite end of Block A is at index 8 (value 4).
*   Swap the values at index 0 (red 2) and index 8 (yellow 4).
*   Output: `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 2 0 ...`

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Swap a single non-white pixel with the pixel at the opposite end of an adjacent non-white block.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row in the examples)
objects:
  - type: block
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., yellow(4), gray(5), azure(8))
    shape: contiguous horizontal line segment
    identifier: Block A
  - type: pixel
    color: non-white (variable, different from Block A, e.g., red(2), blue(1), green(3))
    shape: single pixel
    identifier: Pixel B
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills remaining space
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: Pixel B
    object2: Block A
    details: Pixel B is always immediately adjacent (left or right) to one end of Block A.
transformation:
  action: swap_pixels
  target1: Pixel B
  target2: The pixel at the end of Block A that is *not* adjacent to Pixel B.
  effect: The colors (values) at the original index of Pixel B and the index of the opposite end of Block A are exchanged.
invariants:
  - The color and length of the main body of Block A.
  - The position of the main body of Block A.
  - The color and position of all white background pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white color (Block A). Determine its color (`color_A`), start index (`start_A`), and end index (`end_A`).
2.  Identify the single pixel of a different non-white color (Pixel B). Determine its color (`color_B`) and index (`index_B`).
3.  Check if `index_B` is equal to `start_A - 1` (Pixel B is to the left of Block A).
    *   If true, the index of the pixel at the opposite end of Block A is `end_A`. Store this as `swap_index`.
4.  Else (if `index_B` is not `start_A - 1`), assume `index_B` is equal to `end_A + 1` (Pixel B is to the right of Block A).
    *   The index of the pixel at the opposite end of Block A is `start_A`. Store this as `swap_index`.
5.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output array.
6.  In the output array, set the value at `index_B` to the value originally at `swap_index` in the input array (which is `color_A`).
7.  In the output array, set the value at `swap_index` to `color_B`.
8.  Return the modified output array.
