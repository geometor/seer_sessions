task_type: array_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are 1xN grids
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white # Any color other than white (0)
    count: 1 # Exactly one block per input
    properties:
      - location: embedded within white pixels
      - content: sequence of colors
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates and color sequence of the non-white block
  - name: reverse_sequence
    input: color sequence of the non-white block
    output: reversed color sequence
  - name: replace_block
    input:
      - input_grid
      - coordinates of the block
      - reversed color sequence
    output: output_grid
relationship: The output grid is identical to the input grid except for the segment corresponding to the non-white block, where the sequence of colors is reversed.
