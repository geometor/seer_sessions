Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white (0) pixels. The transformation modifies only the non-white block, leaving the surrounding white pixels untouched. The core operation is reversing the order of the colors within the identified non-white block.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
