The mover pixel moves to the right end of the combined mover+block sequence, and the block shifts left to occupy the original mover position and the initial part of the block's original position.\n    *   The colors and the length of the block remain unchanged. The background pixels also remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
