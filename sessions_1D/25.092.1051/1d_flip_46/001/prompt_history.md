Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
*   **Content:** Each grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
*   **Non-White Sequence:** This sequence consists of exactly two distinct non-white colors.
*   **Pattern:** In the input, the non-white sequence always starts with a single pixel of one color (let's call it `color A`), immediately followed by a block of one or more pixels of a second color (let's call it `color B`).
*   **Transformation:** In the output, the positions of the single pixel of `color A` and the block of `color B` are swapped. The block of `color B` now appears first, immediately followed by the single pixel of `color A`.
*   **Invariant:** The surrounding white pixels remain in their original positions. The colors and the number of pixels in the block of `color B` are preserved.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: Swap the position of a single pixel object with the adjacent block object that follows it.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - id: object_1
    description: A single pixel of a non-white color.
    properties:
      size: 1 pixel
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., azure, orange)
  - id: object_2
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color, different from object_1's color.
    properties:
      size: variable (>= 1 pixel)
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., red, gray, maroon), different from object_1's color
      contiguity: horizontally adjacent pixels
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object_ids: [object_1, object_2]
    details: object_1 is immediately to the left of object_2.
  - type: location
    object_ids: [object_1, object_2]
    details: The combined sequence [object_1, object_2] is embedded within a background of white pixels.
transformation:
  action: swap_objects
  objects_involved: [object_1, object_2]
  details: The relative order of object_1 and object_2 within the non-white sequence is reversed. The sequence becomes [object_2, object_1].
invariants:
  - background pixels remain unchanged.
  - colors of object_1 and object_2 remain unchanged.
  - size of object_2 remains unchanged.
  - the overall position of the combined non-white sequence within the grid is maintained.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Observe that this sequence consists of a single pixel of color `A` followed immediately by a block of one or more pixels of color `B`.
3.  Construct the output sequence by placing the block of pixels of color `B` first, followed immediately by the single pixel of color `A`.
4.  Replace the original non-white sequence in the input row with this newly constructed sequence, keeping all white pixels in their original positions.
