task_description: Swap the position of a single pixel object with the adjacent block object that follows it.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - id: object_1
    description: A single pixel of a non-white color.
    properties:
      size: 1 pixel
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., azure, orange)
  - id: object_2
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color, different from object_1's color.
    properties:
      size: variable (>= 1 pixel)
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., red, gray, maroon), different from object_1's color
      contiguity: horizontally adjacent pixels
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object_ids: [object_1, object_2]
    details: object_1 is immediately to the left of object_2.
  - type: location
    object_ids: [object_1, object_2]
    details: The combined sequence [object_1, object_2] is embedded within a background of white pixels.
transformation:
  action: swap_objects
  objects_involved: [object_1, object_2]
  details: The relative order of object_1 and object_2 within the non-white sequence is reversed. The sequence becomes [object_2, object_1].
invariants:
  - background pixels remain unchanged.
  - colors of object_1 and object_2 remain unchanged.
  - size of object_2 remains unchanged.
  - the overall position of the combined non-white sequence within the grid is maintained.
