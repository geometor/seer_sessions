The surrounding white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions relative to the grid boundaries.\n3.  **Object Identification**: Within each input grid, there's a single contiguous block of colored pixels. This block appears to be treated as the primary object of interest.\n4.  **Transformation**: The transformation occurs *within* this colored block. Specifically, the leftmost pixel of the colored block moves to the rightmost position *within that block's original span*, and all other pixels within the block shift one position to the left to fill the gap.\n5.  **Consistency**: This pattern holds across all three examples:\n    *   Example 1: `2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8` becomes `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2`.\n    *   Example 2: `1 6 6 6 6` becomes `6 6 6 6 1`.\n    *   Example 3: `1 2 2 2 2 2` becomes `2 2 2 2 2 1`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
