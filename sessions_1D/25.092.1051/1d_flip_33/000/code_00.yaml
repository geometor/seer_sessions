task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: grid
    description: Input is a 1-dimensional array of integers (colors).
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the grid.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by start and end indices.
      - elements: The sequence of colors within the segment.
  - type: background
    description: White pixels (value 0) surrounding the non-white segment.
    properties:
      - location: Indices outside the non-white segment.
      - state: Remains unchanged in the output.
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - name: partition_segment
    description: Separate the segment into its first element and the remaining sequence of elements.
    inputs:
      - segment
    outputs:
      - first_element
      - remaining_elements
  - name: rearrange_segment
    description: Create a new sequence by appending the first_element to the end of the remaining_elements.
    inputs:
      - first_element
      - remaining_elements
    outputs:
      - rearranged_segment
  - name: update_grid
    description: Replace the original segment in the grid with the rearranged_segment at the same location.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - original_segment_location
      - rearranged_segment
    outputs:
      - output_grid
relationships:
  - The non-white segment is the focus of the transformation.
  - The background pixels maintain their positions relative to the grid edges.
  - The rearrangement happens only within the bounds of the original non-white segment.
