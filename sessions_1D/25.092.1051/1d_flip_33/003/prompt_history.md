Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Color Focus**: The transformation seems to operate on a contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels. The surrounding white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions relative to the grid boundaries.
3.  **Object Identification**: Within each input grid, there's a single contiguous block of colored pixels. This block appears to be treated as the primary object of interest.
4.  **Transformation**: The transformation occurs *within* this colored block. Specifically, the leftmost pixel of the colored block moves to the rightmost position *within that block's original span*, and all other pixels within the block shift one position to the left to fill the gap.
5.  **Consistency**: This pattern holds across all three examples:
    *   Example 1: `2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8` becomes `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2`.
    *   Example 2: `1 6 6 6 6` becomes `6 6 6 6 1`.
    *   Example 3: `1 2 2 2 2 2` becomes `2 2 2 2 2 1`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine its start and end positions.
2.  If no non-white sequence exists or if it contains only one pixel, the output is identical to the input.
3.  If a non-white sequence exists and has more than one pixel:
    a.  Extract the first pixel (the leftmost one) from this sequence.
    b.  Extract the remaining pixels from the sequence (from the second pixel to the last one).
    c.  Create a new sequence by first placing the remaining pixels and then appending the first pixel to the end.
    d.  Replace the original non-white sequence in the grid with this newly created sequence, maintaining the original start and end positions.
4.  The white pixels surrounding the sequence remain unchanged.
5.  Return the modified grid as the output.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: finding a contiguous block of non-white pixels in a 1D grid and rotating the first element of that block to the end. The provided examples consistently follow this pattern.

The error reported during testing ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()") strongly suggests an issue with how the Python code handles the input data type or performs boolean checks on NumPy arrays. Specifically, a multi-element NumPy array might have been used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`).

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the code to robustly handle the input, ensuring it's converted to a NumPy array correctly at the beginning.
2.  Review conditional statements (`if`) to ensure they are not evaluating the truthiness of multi-element arrays directly. Ensure checks like emptiness are done via methods like `.size` or `len()`.
3.  Confirm the identified transformation logic remains valid.

## Metrics

Metrics gathered confirm the initial perception:

*   **All Examples:**
    *   Input Grid Dimensions: 1x16
    *   Output Grid Dimensions: 1x16
    *   Transformation Type: In-place modification of a sub-sequence.
    *   Background Pixels (0): Remain unchanged in position and value.
    *   Object: A single contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Segment: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]` (Indices 4-11, Length 8)
    *   Output Segment: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]` (Indices 4-11)
    *   Action: Rotate `2` from start to end.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Segment: `[1, 6, 6, 6, 6]` (Indices 8-12, Length 5)
    *   Output Segment: `[6, 6, 6, 6, 1]` (Indices 8-12)
    *   Action: Rotate `1` from start to end.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Segment: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (Indices 1-6, Length 6)
    *   Output Segment: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]` (Indices 1-6)
    *   Action: Rotate `1` from start to end.

The core logic of rotating the first element of the non-white segment to its end is consistent across all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a list containing a single list of integers (representing a 1xN grid).
2.  Identify the contiguous sequence (segment) of non-white (non-zero value) pixels within this row. Determine the start index and end index of this segment.
3.  If no non-white pixels are found, or if the identified segment contains only one pixel (start index equals end index), return the original input grid unchanged.
4.  If a segment with more than one pixel is found:
    a.  Extract the sequence of pixel values from this segment.
    b.  Take the first pixel value from this sequence.
    c.  Create a new sequence consisting of the pixels from the second position to the end of the original sequence.
    d.  Append the first pixel value (saved in step 4b) to the end of the new sequence created in step 4c. This is the rotated segment.
    e.  Create a copy of the original input grid row.
    f.  Replace the pixels in the copied row, from the start index to the end index of the segment, with the pixel values from the rotated segment.
    g.  Return the modified grid (as a list containing the single modified row).
5.  Ensure all white pixels (value 0) outside the identified segment remain in their original positions.
