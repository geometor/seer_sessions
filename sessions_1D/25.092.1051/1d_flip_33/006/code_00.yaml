task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: grid
    description: Input is a 1-dimensional array (1xN grid) of integers (colors).
    properties:
      - width: Variable (e.g., 16 in examples).
      - height: Always 1.
  - type: segment
    description: The first contiguous block of non-white (value != 0) pixels encountered scanning left-to-right.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by start and end indices (inclusive). Varies between examples.
      - elements: The sequence of colors within the segment.
      - length: Number of pixels in the segment (must be > 1 for transformation). Lengths observed: 8, 5, 6.
  - type: background
    description: White pixels (value 0).
    properties:
      - location: Indices outside the identified non-white segment.
      - state: Remains unchanged in the output; positions are preserved relative to the grid boundaries. Verified by `background_indices_match: True`.
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    description: Find the start and end indices of the first contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row
    outputs:
      - start_index
      - end_index
  - name: extract_segment_elements
    description: Get the sequence of pixel values within the identified segment.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row
      - start_index
      - end_index
    outputs:
      - segment_elements
  - name: perform_left_circular_shift
    description: Rearrange the segment elements by moving the first element to the end. This applies only if segment length > 1.
    inputs:
      - segment_elements
    outputs:
      - rearranged_segment_elements
  - name: update_grid
    description: Replace the original segment in the grid with the rearranged segment at the same location (start_index to end_index). Background pixels remain untouched.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row (or a copy)
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - rearranged_segment_elements
    outputs:
      - output_grid_row
relationships:
  - The transformation targets only the first contiguous non-white segment found.
  - The transformation is a left circular shift applied to the elements *within* that segment.
  - The background (white pixels) is static and defines the boundaries within which the segment exists.
  - The transformation only occurs if the identified segment has a length greater than 1.
