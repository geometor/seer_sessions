task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: grid
    description: Input is a 1-dimensional array (represented as a 1xN list of lists) of integers (colors).
    properties:
      - shape: 1xN (variable N)
  - type: segment
    description: A single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the grid row.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by start and end indices within the row.
      - elements: The sequence of non-zero colors within the segment.
      - contiguity: All elements are adjacent.
      - uniqueness: Assumed to be only one such segment per grid based on examples.
  - type: background
    description: White pixels (value 0) potentially surrounding the non-white segment.
    properties:
      - location: Indices outside the non-white segment.
      - state: Remains unchanged in the output.
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    description: Locate the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the single row of the grid.
  - name: extract_elements
    description: Get the sequence of pixel values within the identified segment.
  - name: rotate_segment
    description: >
      If the segment contains more than one pixel, move the first pixel value
      to the end of the sequence, shifting all other pixels one position to the left.
    inputs:
      - segment_elements
    outputs:
      - rotated_segment_elements
  - name: update_grid
    description: >
      Replace the pixel values in the original grid row at the segment's location
      with the rotated_segment_elements.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row
      - segment_location (start_index, end_index)
      - rotated_segment_elements
    outputs:
      - output_grid_row
relationships:
  - The transformation is confined to the identified non-white segment.
  - The length and location of the segment remain the same in the output grid.
  - Background pixels are unaffected.
edge_cases:
  - If no non-white segment exists, the grid is unchanged.
  - If the non-white segment contains only one pixel, the grid is unchanged.
