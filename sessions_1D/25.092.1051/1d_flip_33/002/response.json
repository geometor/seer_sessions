            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: finding a contiguous block of non-white pixels in a 1D grid and rotating the first element of that block to the end. The provided examples consistently follow this pattern.\n\nThe error reported during testing (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\") strongly suggests an issue with how the Python code handles the input data type or performs boolean checks on NumPy arrays. Specifically, a multi-element NumPy array might have been used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the code to robustly handle the input, ensuring it's converted to a NumPy array correctly at the beginning.\n2.  Review conditional statements (`if`) to ensure they are not evaluating the truthiness of multi-element arrays directly. Ensure checks like emptiness are done via methods like `.size` or `len()`.\n3.  Confirm the identified transformation logic remains valid.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered confirm the initial perception:\n\n*   **All Examples:**\n    *   Input Grid Dimensions: 1x16\n    *   Output Grid Dimensions: 1x16\n    *   Transformation Type: In-place modification of a sub-sequence.\n    *   Background Pixels (0): Remain unchanged in position and value.\n    *   Object: A single contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Segment: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]` (Indices 4-11, Length 8)\n    *   Output Segment: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]` (Indices 4-11)\n    *   Action: Rotate `2` from start to end.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Segment: `[1, 6, 6, 6, 6]` (Indices 8-12, Length 5)\n    *   Output Segment: `[6, 6, 6, 6, 1]` (Indices 8-12)\n    *   Action: Rotate `1` from start to end.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Segment: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (Indices 1-6, Length 6)\n    *   Output Segment: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]` (Indices 1-6)\n    *   Action: Rotate `1` from start to end.\n\nThe core logic of rotating the first element of the non-white segment to its end is consistent across all examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
