            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code attempt failed to produce the correct output for any training example. The transformed output was identical to the input, suggesting that the core transformation logic (rotating the segment) was either not executed or incorrectly implemented/applied.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Rule Confirmation:** The observed rule is a left circular shift (rotation) applied to the *first* contiguous segment of non-white pixels found in the 1D input grid. The first element of the segment moves to the last position within the segment's original boundaries. White pixels (0) and pixels outside this segment remain untouched.\n2.  **Code Logic Review:** The Python code aimed to implement this by:\n    *   Finding the start and end indices of the segment.\n    *   Checking if the segment length is greater than 1.\n    *   Extracting the segment.\n    *   Rearranging the segment (tried manual concatenation and `np.roll`).\n    *   Replacing the original segment slice in a copy of the grid row with the rearranged segment.\n3.  **Failure Point:** The identical input/output in the test results strongly indicates the transformation code block was skipped. This happens if the condition `start_index is None or start_index == end_index` evaluated to `True`. However, manual tracing suggests the `find_non_white_segment` function *should* return valid start/end indices for segments longer than one pixel in all examples. This contradiction implies a potential subtle bug in the implementation, state handling, or interaction with the execution environment, rather than a misunderstanding of the core transformation rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Reaffirm the Logic:** Maintain the core understanding: identify the first contiguous non-white segment and rotate it left by one position.\n2.  **Refine Implementation:** Revert to the manual concatenation method for rearranging the segment, as it's more explicit than `np.roll` and might avoid potential subtleties with that function. Ensure all steps (copying, slicing, concatenation, assignment) are correctly implemented.\n3.  **Verify Assumptions:** Use `tool_code` to explicitly calculate segment properties for each example to confirm the `find_non_white_segment` logic behaves as expected on the provided inputs.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for maximum clarity based on this analysis.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the segment identification and expected rearrangement for each training example.\n"
