task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: grid
    description: Input is a 1-dimensional array (list) of integers (colors), conceptually a 1xN grid.
  - type: segment
    description: The first contiguous block of non-white (value != 0) pixels found when scanning from left to right.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by start and end indices (inclusive).
      - elements: The sequence of colors within the segment.
      - length: Number of pixels in the segment.
  - type: background
    description: White pixels (value 0).
    properties:
      - location: Indices outside the identified non-white segment.
      - state: Remains unchanged in the output.
actions:
  - name: find_first_non_white_segment
    description: Scan the input grid row from left to right and identify the start and end indices of the first sequence of one or more contiguous non-white pixels.
    outputs:
      - start_index: Starting index of the segment (inclusive).
      - end_index: Ending index of the segment (inclusive).
      - segment_found: Boolean indicating if a non-white segment was found.
  - name: check_segment_length
    description: Determine if the found segment contains more than one pixel.
    inputs:
      - start_index
      - end_index
    outputs:
      - needs_rotation: Boolean indicating if length > 1.
  - name: rotate_segment_left
    description: If the segment needs rotation, create a new sequence by moving the first element of the segment to the end of the sequence.
    inputs:
      - segment_elements
    outputs:
      - rotated_segment_elements
  - name: update_grid
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. If the segment was rotated, replace the pixels within the original segment's boundaries (start_index to end_index) in the copy with the rotated_segment_elements. Otherwise, the copy remains unchanged.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - rotated_segment_elements (if applicable)
      - needs_rotation
    outputs:
      - output_grid
relationships:
  - The transformation targets only the first contiguous non-white segment encountered.
  - The transformation (left rotation) only occurs if the segment length is greater than 1.
  - Background pixels (value 0) and any pixels outside the identified segment's boundaries are preserved in their original positions.
