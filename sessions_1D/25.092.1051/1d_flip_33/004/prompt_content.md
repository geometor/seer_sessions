"""
Transformation Rule:
Identifies a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (value != 0) in the 1-dimensional 
input grid (represented as a 1xN grid). Moves the leftmost pixel of this sequence 
to the rightmost position within that sequence's original span. All other pixels 
within the identified sequence shift one position to the left to fill the gap 
created by moving the first pixel. Pixels with value 0 (white) remain unchanged 
in their positions. If no non-white sequence exists or the sequence has only one 
pixel, the grid remains unchanged.
