Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Color Focus**: The transformation seems to operate on a contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels. The surrounding white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions relative to the grid boundaries.
3.  **Object Identification**: Within each input grid, there's a single contiguous block of colored pixels. This block appears to be treated as the primary object of interest.
4.  **Transformation**: The transformation occurs *within* this colored block. Specifically, the leftmost pixel of the colored block moves to the rightmost position *within that block's original span*, and all other pixels within the block shift one position to the left to fill the gap.
5.  **Consistency**: This pattern holds across all three examples:
    *   Example 1: `2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8` becomes `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2`.
    *   Example 2: `1 6 6 6 6` becomes `6 6 6 6 1`.
    *   Example 3: `1 2 2 2 2 2` becomes `2 2 2 2 2 1`.

## Facts

task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: grid
    description: Input is a 1-dimensional array of integers (colors).
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the grid.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by start and end indices.
      - elements: The sequence of colors within the segment.
  - type: background
    description: White pixels (value 0) surrounding the non-white segment.
    properties:
      - location: Indices outside the non-white segment.
      - state: Remains unchanged in the output.
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - name: partition_segment
    description: Separate the segment into its first element and the remaining sequence of elements.
    inputs:
      - segment
    outputs:
      - first_element
      - remaining_elements
  - name: rearrange_segment
    description: Create a new sequence by appending the first_element to the end of the remaining_elements.
    inputs:
      - first_element
      - remaining_elements
    outputs:
      - rearranged_segment
  - name: update_grid
    description: Replace the original segment in the grid with the rearranged_segment at the same location.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - original_segment_location
      - rearranged_segment
    outputs:
      - output_grid
relationships:
  - The non-white segment is the focus of the transformation.
  - The background pixels maintain their positions relative to the grid edges.
  - The rearrangement happens only within the bounds of the original non-white segment.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine its start and end positions.
2.  If no non-white sequence exists or if it contains only one pixel, the output is identical to the input.
3.  If a non-white sequence exists and has more than one pixel:
    a.  Extract the first pixel (the leftmost one) from this sequence.
    b.  Extract the remaining pixels from the sequence (from the second pixel to the last one).
    c.  Create a new sequence by first placing the remaining pixels and then appending the first pixel to the end.
    d.  Replace the original non-white sequence in the grid with this newly created sequence, maintaining the original start and end positions.
4.  The white pixels surrounding the sequence remain unchanged.
5.  Return the modified grid as the output.

Transformation Rule:
Identifies a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (value != 0) in the 1-dimensional input grid (represented as a 1xN grid).
Moves the leftmost pixel of this sequence to the rightmost position within that sequence's original span.
All other pixels within the identified sequence shift one position to the left to fill the gap created by moving the first pixel.
Pixels with value 0 (white) remain unchanged in their positions.
If no non-white sequence exists or the sequence has only one pixel, the grid remains unchanged.
