"""
Transformation Rule:
Identifies the first contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (value != 0) 
encountered when scanning the 1-dimensional input grid (represented as a 1xN grid) 
from left to right. If this sequence contains more than one pixel, it performs 
a left circular shift (rotation) on the pixels within that sequence: the leftmost 
pixel moves to the rightmost position of the sequence, and all other pixels in 
the sequence shift one position to the left. Pixels with value 0 (white) and 
any pixels outside the identified segment remain unchanged in their positions. 
If no non-white sequence is found, or if the found sequence contains only one 
pixel, the grid remains unchanged.
