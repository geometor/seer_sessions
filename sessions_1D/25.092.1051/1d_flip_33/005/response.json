Pixels with value 0 (white) and \nany pixels outside the identified segment remain unchanged in their positions. \nIf no non-white sequence is found, or if the found sequence contains only one \npixel, the grid remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_first_non_white_segment(grid_row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start and end indices (inclusive) of the first contiguous non-white segment.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_row (np.array): A 1D numpy array representing the row of the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the start index and end index (inclusive)\n               of the segment.
