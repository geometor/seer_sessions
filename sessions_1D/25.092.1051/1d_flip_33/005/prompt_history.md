Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Color Focus**: The transformation seems to operate on a contiguous sequence of non-white (non-zero) pixels. The surrounding white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions relative to the grid boundaries.
3.  **Object Identification**: Within each input grid, there's a single contiguous block of colored pixels. This block appears to be treated as the primary object of interest.
4.  **Transformation**: The transformation occurs *within* this colored block. Specifically, the leftmost pixel of the colored block moves to the rightmost position *within that block's original span*, and all other pixels within the block shift one position to the left to fill the gap.
5.  **Consistency**: This pattern holds across all three examples:
    *   Example 1: `2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8` becomes `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2`.
    *   Example 2: `1 6 6 6 6` becomes `6 6 6 6 1`.
    *   Example 3: `1 2 2 2 2 2` becomes `2 2 2 2 2 1`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine its start and end positions.
2.  If no non-white sequence exists or if it contains only one pixel, the output is identical to the input.
3.  If a non-white sequence exists and has more than one pixel:
    a.  Extract the first pixel (the leftmost one) from this sequence.
    b.  Extract the remaining pixels from the sequence (from the second pixel to the last one).
    c.  Create a new sequence by first placing the remaining pixels and then appending the first pixel to the end.
    d.  Replace the original non-white sequence in the grid with this newly created sequence, maintaining the original start and end positions.
4.  The white pixels surrounding the sequence remain unchanged.
5.  Return the modified grid as the output.

## Assessment and Strategy

The previous code attempt failed to produce the correct output for any training example. The transformed output was identical to the input, suggesting that the core transformation logic (rotating the segment) was either not executed or incorrectly implemented/applied.

**Analysis:**
1.  **Rule Confirmation:** The observed rule is a left circular shift (rotation) applied to the *first* contiguous segment of non-white pixels found in the 1D input grid. The first element of the segment moves to the last position within the segment's original boundaries. White pixels (0) and pixels outside this segment remain untouched.
2.  **Code Logic Review:** The Python code aimed to implement this by:
    *   Finding the start and end indices of the segment.
    *   Checking if the segment length is greater than 1.
    *   Extracting the segment.
    *   Rearranging the segment (tried manual concatenation and `np.roll`).
    *   Replacing the original segment slice in a copy of the grid row with the rearranged segment.
3.  **Failure Point:** The identical input/output in the test results strongly indicates the transformation code block was skipped. This happens if the condition `start_index is None or start_index == end_index` evaluated to `True`. However, manual tracing suggests the `find_non_white_segment` function *should* return valid start/end indices for segments longer than one pixel in all examples. This contradiction implies a potential subtle bug in the implementation, state handling, or interaction with the execution environment, rather than a misunderstanding of the core transformation rule.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Reaffirm the Logic:** Maintain the core understanding: identify the first contiguous non-white segment and rotate it left by one position.
2.  **Refine Implementation:** Revert to the manual concatenation method for rearranging the segment, as it's more explicit than `np.roll` and might avoid potential subtleties with that function. Ensure all steps (copying, slicing, concatenation, assignment) are correctly implemented.
3.  **Verify Assumptions:** Use `tool_code` to explicitly calculate segment properties for each example to confirm the `find_non_white_segment` logic behaves as expected on the provided inputs.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for maximum clarity based on this analysis.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the segment identification and expected rearrangement for each training example.

The metrics confirm that the `find_non_white_segment` function correctly identifies the segments and their boundaries, and the manual rearrangement logic produces the expected rotated segments for all examples. The issue must lie in how these results are applied back to the main grid array within the `transform` function of the previous attempt.

      - start_index: Starting index of the segment (inclusive).
      - end_index: Ending index of the segment (inclusive).
      - segment_found: Boolean indicating if a non-white segment was found.
  - name: check_segment_length
    description: Determine if the found segment contains more than one pixel.
    inputs:
      - start_index
      - end_index
    outputs:
      - needs_rotation: Boolean indicating if length > 1.
  - name: rotate_segment_left
    description: If the segment needs rotation, create a new sequence by moving the first element of the segment to the end of the sequence.
    inputs:
      - segment_elements
    outputs:
      - rotated_segment_elements
  - name: update_grid
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. If the segment was rotated, replace the pixels within the original segment's boundaries (start_index to end_index) in the copy with the rotated_segment_elements. Otherwise, the copy remains unchanged.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - rotated_segment_elements (if applicable)
      - needs_rotation
    outputs:
      - output_grid
relationships:
  - The transformation targets only the first contiguous non-white segment encountered.
  - The transformation (left rotation) only occurs if the segment length is greater than 1.
  - Background pixels (value 0) and any pixels outside the identified segment's boundaries are preserved in their original positions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a single row (a list of integers).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid row to store the result.
3.  Scan the input grid row from left to right to find the start and end indices of the *first* contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (pixels with values other than 0).
4.  If no non-white pixels are found, or if the identified sequence contains only one pixel (start index equals end index), return the unmodified copy of the input grid.
5.  If a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels with a length greater than one is found:
    a.  Extract the sequence of pixels from the input grid row corresponding to the found start and end indices.
    b.  Take the first pixel from this extracted sequence.
    c.  Take the remaining pixels (from the second to the last) from the extracted sequence.
    d.  Construct a new sequence by concatenating the remaining pixels followed by the first pixel.
    e.  Replace the pixels in the copied grid row, from the start index to the end index (inclusive), with the pixels from the newly constructed sequence.
6.  Return the modified copy of the grid row as the output.
