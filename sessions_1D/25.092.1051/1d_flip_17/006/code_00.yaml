Grid_Properties:
  - Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)

Pattern_Elements:
  - Element: Pixel_A
    Role: First element in swap
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (Value != 0)
      - Size: 1 pixel
      - Context: Must be preceded by white (0) OR be at the start of the grid (index 0).
  - Element: Block_B
    Role: Second element in swap
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (Value != 0)
      - Color_Constraint: Must be different from Pixel_A's color.
      - Size: 1 or more contiguous pixels.
      - Structure: All pixels in the block have the same color.

Pattern_Configuration:
  - Type: Adjacency
    Details: Pixel_A must be immediately followed by the first pixel of Block_B.
    Structure: [... 0, A, B, B, ..., B, ...] OR [A, B, B, ..., B, ...]

Action:
  - Type: Positional_Swap
    Trigger: Finding the first occurrence (left-to-right) of the Pattern_Configuration.
    Actors: Pixel_A, Block_B
    Rule:
      1. Block_B moves left by one position, starting at the original index of Pixel_A.
      2. Pixel_A moves to the position immediately following the original end index of Block_B.
    Output_State:
      - Original position of A is occupied by the start of B.
      - Positions originally occupied by B (except the first) are occupied by the rest of B.
      - Position immediately after the original end of B is occupied by A.
    Invariant:
      - All other pixels (background 0s, pixels not part of the first matched pattern) remain unchanged.
      - If the pattern is not found, the grid remains unchanged.
