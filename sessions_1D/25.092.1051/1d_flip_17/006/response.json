            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code aimed to implement the observed transformation rule: swapping a single non-white pixel (A) with an adjacent block of different non-white pixels (B), where A precedes B and A is either at the start or preceded by white (0). The manual trace of the code logic suggests it correctly identifies the pattern and performs the swap as intended for the given examples.\n\nHowever, the execution results indicate that the `transform` function returned the input grid unchanged for all three training examples. This implies that the pattern-finding condition (`if pattern_indices:`) evaluated to false during execution. This discrepancy could stem from:\n\n1.  A subtle bug in the `find_pattern_indices` function or the `transform` function that wasn't caught in the manual trace.\n2.  An issue related to the execution environment or data types passed to the function (e.g., numpy array vs. list, although the code uses `deepcopy` which should handle lists).\n3.  The code executed was not exactly the `Previous Code` provided.\n\nGiven the direct contradiction between the logical trace and the reported results, the most productive strategy is to reaffirm the observed transformation rule, refine its description, and ensure the core logic is clearly stated for the next coding phase. We will assume the visual interpretation of the examples is correct and the goal is to implement that swap.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the provided execution results:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Failed. `find_pattern_indices` likely returned `None`. Expected swap of `8` (index 2) and `555555` (indices 3-8) did not occur.\n*   **Example 2:** Failed. `find_pattern_indices` likely returned `None`. Expected swap of `1` (index 8) and `55555555` (indices 9-16) did not occur.\n*   **Example 3:** Failed. `find_pattern_indices` likely returned `None`. Expected swap of `5` (index 2) and `2222` (indices 3-6) did not occur.\n\nIn all cases, the function returned the original input, indicating the conditional block performing the transformation was not entered.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through the input grid using an index `i`, starting from the second position (index 1) up to the end.\n3.  At each index `i`, examine the pixel at `i-1` (let's call its color `Color_A`) and the pixel at `i` (let's call its color `Color_B`).\n4.  Check if the start of the target pattern is found at this position:\n    a.  Is `Color_A` non-white (`!= 0`)?\n    b.  Is `Color_B` non-white (`!= 0`)?\n    c.  Is `Color_A` different from `Color_B`?\n    d.  Is the pixel at `i-1` a \"single\" pixel, meaning is it either at the very beginning of the grid (`i-1 == 0`) or is the pixel at `i-2` white (`grid[i-2] == 0`)?\n5.  If all conditions in step 4 are true, then we have found the pattern:\n    a.  Record the index of Pixel_A: `idx_A = i-1`.\n    b.  Record the starting index of Block_B: `idx_B_start = i`.\n    c.  Determine the end index of Block_B (`idx_B_end`) by continuing from `idx_B_start` as long as the pixels have `Color_B` and stay within the grid bounds.\n    d.  Calculate the length of Block_B: `len_B = idx_B_end - idx_B_start + 1`.\n    e.  Perform the transformation on the *output* grid:\n        i.  Place the entire Block_B (all pixels of `Color_B`) into the output grid starting at index `idx_A` and continuing for `len_B` positions.\n        ii. Place Pixel_A (color `Color_A`) into the output grid at the position immediately following the *new* position of Block_B, which is index `idx_A + len_B`.\n    f.  Since only the first occurrence of the pattern should be transformed, stop searching and proceed to return the modified output grid.\n6.  If the loop finishes without finding the pattern (i.e., the conditions in step 4 were never all true simultaneously), return the unmodified output grid (the copy created in step 1)."
