Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Each example consists of a single input row and a corresponding single output row. These rows are 1D grids of colored pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Key Colors:** The examples use white (0) as a background color. Other colors like azure (8), gray (5), blue (1), and red (2) form distinct objects or blocks within the row.
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form two distinct adjacent entities:
    *   A single pixel of one color (e.g., azure `8` in Ex 1, blue `1` in Ex 2, gray `5` in Ex 3).
    *   A contiguous block (one or more pixels) of a *different* single color (e.g., gray `5` in Ex 1 & 2, red `2` in Ex 3).
4.  **Spatial Relationship:** In all provided examples, the single pixel object is located immediately to the *left* of the contiguous block object. They are adjacent.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional swap between the single pixel object and the contiguous block object next to it. The single pixel moves to the position immediately following the original block, and the block shifts to occupy the original position of the single pixel. The internal order of pixels within the block remains the same. The background white pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - Type: Single_Pixel
    Role: Mover
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-white color (Color A)
      - Size: 1 pixel
  - Type: Contiguous_Block
    Role: Swapped_Entity
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-white color (Color B), different from Color A
      - Size: 1 or more pixels
      - Structure: Contiguous sequence of identical Color B pixels

Relationships:
  - Type: Adjacency
    Details: The Single_Pixel object is immediately adjacent to the Contiguous_Block object.
    Observed_Pattern: In all examples, the Single_Pixel is to the left of the Contiguous_Block.
    Example_1: Single_Pixel (8) left-adjacent to Block (5 5 5 5 5 5)
    Example_2: Single_Pixel (1) left-adjacent to Block (5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5)
    Example_3: Single_Pixel (5) left-adjacent to Block (2 2 2 2)

Actions:
  - Type: Positional_Swap
    Actors: Single_Pixel, Contiguous_Block
    Rule: The position occupied by the Single_Pixel in the input is occupied by the start of the Contiguous_Block in the output. The position immediately following the end of the Contiguous_Block in the input is occupied by the Single_Pixel in the output.
    Effect: The Contiguous_Block shifts left by one position. The Single_Pixel moves rightward to the position immediately after the block's original end position.
    Invariant:
      - Colors of the objects remain the same.
      - Internal pixel order within the Contiguous_Block remains the same.
      - Background (white) pixels remain in their original positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right, examining each pixel at index `i`.
3.  Identify the start of a potential "Contiguous_Block": Find the first index `j` such that the pixel at `j` (Color B) is non-white (not 0) and the pixel immediately to its left at `j-1` (Color A) is also non-white, and Color A is different from Color B.
4.  If such a pair (Color A at `j-1`, Color B at `j`) is found:
    a.  Determine the full extent of the "Contiguous_Block" of Color B starting at index `j`. Let it end at index `k`. The length of the block is `L = k - j + 1`.
    b.  Verify that the pixel at `j-1` (Color A) is indeed a single instance, meaning the pixel at `j-2` is white (0) or `j-1` is the start of the grid (index 0). (This check ensures we identified the "Single_Pixel" correctly based on the observed pattern).
    c.  Modify the output grid:
        i.  Place the block of Color B (length `L`) starting at index `j-1`.
        ii. Place the single pixel of Color A at index `(j-1) + L` (which is equivalent to index `k+1` relative to the original input indexing, or index `j-1 + L` in the output grid).
    d.  Since the transformation seems unique per grid based on examples, stop searching and return the modified output grid.
5.  If no such adjacent pair is found after scanning the entire grid, return the original input grid unchanged (as a copy).

**General Assessment**

The provided code aimed to implement the observed transformation rule: swapping a single non-white pixel (A) with an adjacent block of different non-white pixels (B), where A precedes B and A is either at the start or preceded by white (0). The manual trace of the code logic suggests it correctly identifies the pattern and performs the swap as intended for the given examples.

However, the execution results indicate that the `transform` function returned the input grid unchanged for all three training examples. This implies that the pattern-finding condition (`if pattern_indices:`) evaluated to false during execution. This discrepancy could stem from:

1.  A subtle bug in the `find_pattern_indices` function or the `transform` function that wasn't caught in the manual trace.
2.  An issue related to the execution environment or data types passed to the function (e.g., numpy array vs. list, although the code uses `deepcopy` which should handle lists).
3.  The code executed was not exactly the `Previous Code` provided.

Given the direct contradiction between the logical trace and the reported results, the most productive strategy is to reaffirm the observed transformation rule, refine its description, and ensure the core logic is clearly stated for the next coding phase. We will assume the visual interpretation of the examples is correct and the goal is to implement that swap.

**Metrics**

Based on the provided execution results:

*   **Example 1:** Failed. `find_pattern_indices` likely returned `None`. Expected swap of `8` (index 2) and `555555` (indices 3-8) did not occur.
*   **Example 2:** Failed. `find_pattern_indices` likely returned `None`. Expected swap of `1` (index 8) and `55555555` (indices 9-16) did not occur.
*   **Example 3:** Failed. `find_pattern_indices` likely returned `None`. Expected swap of `5` (index 2) and `2222` (indices 3-6) did not occur.

In all cases, the function returned the original input, indicating the conditional block performing the transformation was not entered.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)

Pattern_Elements:
  - Element: Pixel_A
    Role: First element in swap
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (Value != 0)
      - Size: 1 pixel
      - Context: Must be preceded by white (0) OR be at the start of the grid (index 0).
  - Element: Block_B
    Role: Second element in swap
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (Value != 0)
      - Color_Constraint: Must be different from Pixel_A's color.
      - Size: 1 or more contiguous pixels.
      - Structure: All pixels in the block have the same color.

Pattern_Configuration:
  - Type: Adjacency
    Details: Pixel_A must be immediately followed by the first pixel of Block_B.
    Structure: [... 0, A, B, B, ..., B, ...] OR [A, B, B, ..., B, ...]

Action:
  - Type: Positional_Swap
    Trigger: Finding the first occurrence (left-to-right) of the Pattern_Configuration.
    Actors: Pixel_A, Block_B
    Rule:
      1. Block_B moves left by one position, starting at the original index of Pixel_A.
      2. Pixel_A moves to the position immediately following the original end index of Block_B.
    Output_State:
      - Original position of A is occupied by the start of B.
      - Positions originally occupied by B (except the first) are occupied by the rest of B.
      - Position immediately after the original end of B is occupied by A.
    Invariant:
      - All other pixels (background 0s, pixels not part of the first matched pattern) remain unchanged.
      - If the pattern is not found, the grid remains unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid using an index `i`, starting from the second position (index 1) up to the end.
3.  At each index `i`, examine the pixel at `i-1` (let's call its color `Color_A`) and the pixel at `i` (let's call its color `Color_B`).
4.  Check if the start of the target pattern is found at this position:
    a.  Is `Color_A` non-white (`!= 0`)?
    b.  Is `Color_B` non-white (`!= 0`)?
    c.  Is `Color_A` different from `Color_B`?
    d.  Is the pixel at `i-1` a "single" pixel, meaning is it either at the very beginning of the grid (`i-1 == 0`) or is the pixel at `i-2` white (`grid[i-2] == 0`)?
5.  If all conditions in step 4 are true, then we have found the pattern:
    a.  Record the index of Pixel_A: `idx_A = i-1`.
    b.  Record the starting index of Block_B: `idx_B_start = i`.
    c.  Determine the end index of Block_B (`idx_B_end`) by continuing from `idx_B_start` as long as the pixels have `Color_B` and stay within the grid bounds.
    d.  Calculate the length of Block_B: `len_B = idx_B_end - idx_B_start + 1`.
    e.  Perform the transformation on the *output* grid:
        i.  Place the entire Block_B (all pixels of `Color_B`) into the output grid starting at index `idx_A` and continuing for `len_B` positions.
        ii. Place Pixel_A (color `Color_A`) into the output grid at the position immediately following the *new* position of Block_B, which is index `idx_A + len_B`.
    f.  Since only the first occurrence of the pattern should be transformed, stop searching and proceed to return the modified output grid.
6.  If the loop finishes without finding the pattern (i.e., the conditions in step 4 were never all true simultaneously), return the unmodified output grid (the copy created in step 1).
