The 'single' characteristic of Pixel A means it must be either at the very beginning of the grid (index 0) or immediately preceded by a white pixel (color 0).\n\nIf this pattern is found, perform a positional swap on a copy of the grid:\n1.  The contiguous block (Color B) is moved one position to the left, so it starts at the original index of Pixel A.\n2.  Pixel A (Color A) is moved to the position immediately following the original end position of Block B. This target index is calculated as `original_index_of_A + length_of_block_B`.\n\nAll other pixels (background white pixels, and any pixels not part of the first matched pattern instance) remain unchanged. If the specified pattern is not found anywhere in the grid, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\n# Using numpy is not strictly necessary for this 1D task, \n# but it's often useful in ARC.
