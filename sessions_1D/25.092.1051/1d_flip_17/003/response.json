The single pixel (Color A) must be preceded by white (0) or be at the very beginning of the grid. \n\nIf this pattern is found, perform a positional swap:\n1. The contiguous block (Color B) moves one position to the left, starting at the original index of the single pixel (Color A).\n2. The single pixel (Color A) moves to the position immediately following the original end position of the block (Color B).\n\nAll other pixels (background white pixels, and any pixels not part of the identified pattern) remain unchanged.
