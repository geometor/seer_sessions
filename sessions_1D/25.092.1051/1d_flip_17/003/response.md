"""
Transformation Rule:
Identify a specific pattern in the 1D input grid: a single non-white pixel (Color A) that is immediately followed by a contiguous block of one or more pixels of a different non-white color (Color B). The single pixel (Color A) must be preceded by white (0) or be at the very beginning of the grid. 

If this pattern is found, perform a positional swap:
1. The contiguous block (Color B) moves one position to the left, starting at the original index of the single pixel (Color A).
2. The single pixel (Color A) moves to the position immediately following the original end position of the block (Color B).

All other pixels (background white pixels, and any pixels not part of the identified pattern) remain unchanged. If the specific pattern is not found anywhere in the grid, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid. Only the first occurrence of the pattern is transformed.
