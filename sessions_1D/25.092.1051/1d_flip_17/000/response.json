            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Each example consists of a single input row and a corresponding single output row. These rows are 1D grids of colored pixels represented by integers 0-9.\n2.  **Key Colors:** The examples use white (0) as a background color. Other colors like azure (8), gray (5), blue (1), and red (2) form distinct objects or blocks within the row.\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form two distinct adjacent entities:\n    *   A single pixel of one color (e.g., azure `8` in Ex 1, blue `1` in Ex 2, gray `5` in Ex 3).\n    *   A contiguous block (one or more pixels) of a *different* single color (e.g., gray `5` in Ex 1 & 2, red `2` in Ex 3).\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** In all provided examples, the single pixel object is located immediately to the *left* of the contiguous block object. They are adjacent.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional swap between the single pixel object and the contiguous block object next to it. The single pixel moves to the position immediately following the original block, and the block shifts to occupy the original position of the single pixel. The internal order of pixels within the block remains the same. The background white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the input grid from left to right, examining each pixel at index `i`.\n3.  Identify the start of a potential \"Contiguous_Block\": Find the first index `j` such that the pixel at `j` (Color B) is non-white (not 0) and the pixel immediately to its left at `j-1` (Color A) is also non-white, and Color A is different from Color B.\n4.  If such a pair (Color A at `j-1`, Color B at `j`) is found:\n    a.  Determine the full extent of the \"Contiguous_Block\" of Color B starting at index `j`. Let it end at index `k`. The length of the block is `L = k - j + 1`.\n    b.  Verify that the pixel at `j-1` (Color A) is indeed a single instance, meaning the pixel at `j-2` is white (0) or `j-1` is the start of the grid (index 0). (This check ensures we identified the \"Single_Pixel\" correctly based on the observed pattern).\n    c.  Modify the output grid:\n        i.  Place the block of Color B (length `L`) starting at index `j-1`.\n        ii. Place the single pixel of Color A at index `(j-1) + L` (which is equivalent to index `k+1` relative to the original input indexing, or index `j-1 + L` in the output grid).\n    d.  Since the transformation seems unique per grid based on examples, stop searching and return the modified output grid.\n5.  If no such adjacent pair is found after scanning the entire grid, return the original input grid unchanged (as a copy)."
