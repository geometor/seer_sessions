Grid_Properties:
  - Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - Type: Single_Pixel
    Role: Mover
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-white color (Color A)
      - Size: 1 pixel
  - Type: Contiguous_Block
    Role: Swapped_Entity
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-white color (Color B), different from Color A
      - Size: 1 or more pixels
      - Structure: Contiguous sequence of identical Color B pixels

Relationships:
  - Type: Adjacency
    Details: The Single_Pixel object is immediately adjacent to the Contiguous_Block object.
    Observed_Pattern: In all examples, the Single_Pixel is to the left of the Contiguous_Block.
    Example_1: Single_Pixel (8) left-adjacent to Block (5 5 5 5 5 5)
    Example_2: Single_Pixel (1) left-adjacent to Block (5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5)
    Example_3: Single_Pixel (5) left-adjacent to Block (2 2 2 2)

Actions:
  - Type: Positional_Swap
    Actors: Single_Pixel, Contiguous_Block
    Rule: The position occupied by the Single_Pixel in the input is occupied by the start of the Contiguous_Block in the output. The position immediately following the end of the Contiguous_Block in the input is occupied by the Single_Pixel in the output.
    Effect: The Contiguous_Block shifts left by one position. The Single_Pixel moves rightward to the position immediately after the block's original end position.
    Invariant:
      - Colors of the objects remain the same.
      - Internal pixel order within the Contiguous_Block remains the same.
      - Background (white) pixels remain in their original positions.
