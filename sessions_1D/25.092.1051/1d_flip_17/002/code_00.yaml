Grid_Properties:
  - Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)
  - Size: Variable length (observed 19)

Objects:
  - Type: Single_Pixel_Trigger
    Role: Left_Element
    Identification:
      - A non-white pixel (Color A).
      - Preceded by white (0) or the start of the grid.
      - Immediately followed by a different non-white pixel (Color B).
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-white color (Color A)
      - Size: 1 pixel
  - Type: Contiguous_Block
    Role: Right_Element
    Identification:
      - Starts immediately after the Single_Pixel_Trigger.
      - Consists of one or more contiguous pixels of the same non-white color (Color B).
      - Color B must be different from Color A.
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-white color (Color B), different from Color A
      - Size: 1 or more pixels (Length L)
      - Structure: Contiguous sequence of identical Color B pixels

Relationships:
  - Type: Left_Adjacency
    Details: The Single_Pixel_Trigger is immediately to the left of the first pixel of the Contiguous_Block.
    Constraint: This specific adjacent pair (Single_Pixel_Trigger followed by Contiguous_Block) is the trigger for the transformation.

Actions:
  - Type: Positional_Swap
    Actors: Single_Pixel_Trigger, Contiguous_Block
    Condition: The specific adjacency pattern (Single_Pixel_Trigger, Contiguous_Block) must be found.
    Rule:
      1. Identify the index of the Single_Pixel_Trigger (`idx_A`).
      2. Identify the start and end indices of the Contiguous_Block (`idx_B_start`, `idx_B_end`). Calculate its length `L`.
      3. In the output grid:
         - Place the Contiguous_Block (all `L` pixels of Color B) starting at index `idx_A`.
         - Place the Single_Pixel_Trigger (Color A) at index `idx_A + L`.
    Effect: The Contiguous_Block effectively shifts left by one position, occupying the original position of the Single_Pixel_Trigger. The Single_Pixel_Trigger moves to the position immediately following the original end position of the Contiguous_Block.
    Invariant:
      - Colors of the objects remain the same.
      - Internal pixel order within the Contiguous_Block remains the same (it's just one color).
      - All other pixels (background white pixels, and any pixels not part of the identified pattern) remain in their original positions.
  - Default_Action: If the specific adjacency pattern is not found anywhere in the grid, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.
