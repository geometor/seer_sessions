Transformation Rule:
Identify a single non-white pixel (Color A) immediately followed by a contiguous block of one or more pixels of a different non-white color (Color B). Swap the positions of the single pixel (Color A) and the entire block (Color B). The single pixel moves to the position immediately after the original end of the block, and the block shifts one position to the left to occupy the original position of the single pixel. Background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged. If this pattern is not found, the grid remains unchanged.
