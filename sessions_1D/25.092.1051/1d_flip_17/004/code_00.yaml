Grid_Properties:
  - Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - Name: Pixel_A
    Type: Single_Pixel
    Role: Left element in swap
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-white color (Color A)
      - Size: 1 pixel
      - Position_Constraint: Must be preceded by white (0) or be at index 0.
  - Name: Block_B
    Type: Contiguous_Block
    Role: Right element in swap
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-white color (Color B), different from Color A
      - Size: 1 or more pixels
      - Structure: Contiguous sequence of identical Color B pixels
      - Position_Constraint: Must immediately follow Pixel_A.

Relationships:
  - Type: Adjacency
    Details: Pixel_A is immediately to the left of the first pixel of Block_B.
    Example_1: Pixel_A (8 at idx 2) left-adjacent to Block_B (5 5 5 5 5 5 starting at idx 3)
    Example_2: Pixel_A (1 at idx 8) left-adjacent to Block_B (5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 starting at idx 9)
    Example_3: Pixel_A (5 at idx 2) left-adjacent to Block_B (2 2 2 2 starting at idx 3)

Actions:
  - Type: Positional_Swap
    Actors: Pixel_A, Block_B
    Condition: The specific pattern (Pixel_A followed immediately by Block_B, with Pixel_A satisfying its position constraint) must be found. Only the first occurrence is acted upon.
    Rule:
      1. Identify the index of Pixel_A (`idx_A`).
      2. Identify the start and end indices of Block_B (`idx_B_start`, `idx_B_end`).
      3. Calculate the length of Block_B (`len_B = idx_B_end - idx_B_start + 1`).
      4. In the output grid:
         a. Place the sequence of pixels constituting Block_B starting at index `idx_A`.
         b. Place Pixel_A at index `idx_A + len_B`.
    Invariant:
      - Colors of the objects remain the same.
      - Internal pixel order within Block_B remains the same (implicitly handled by copying the block).
      - All pixels outside the range originally occupied by Pixel_A and Block_B remain unchanged.
