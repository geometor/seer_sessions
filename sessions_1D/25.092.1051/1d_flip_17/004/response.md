**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation: swapping a single non-background pixel with an adjacent block of different non-background pixels. The Python code implemented this logic. However, the test results indicate that the `transform` function returned the original input unchanged for all training examples. This suggests that either the `find_pattern_indices` function failed to locate the pattern as expected, or the conditional block `if pattern_indices:` was never entered. Manual tracing of the logic against the examples suggests the pattern *should* have been found.

**Strategy:**

1.  Verify the pattern identification step using code execution to confirm the indices returned by `find_pattern_indices`.
2.  Confirm the conditions within `find_pattern_indices` (non-zero colors, different colors, single pixel check) are being evaluated correctly against the example data.
3.  Re-affirm the transformation steps (block placement, single pixel placement) based on the confirmed indices.
4.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to ensure maximum clarity and accuracy, incorporating the findings from the code execution checks.

**Metrics Gathering:**

import copy
import numpy as np

# --- Previous Code (for find_pattern_indices) ---
def find_pattern_indices(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(1, n): 
        color_a = grid[i-1]
        color_b = grid[i]
        if color_a != 0 and color_b != 0 and color_a != color_b:
            is_single_pixel_a = (i == 1 or grid[i-2] == 0)
            if is_single_pixel_a:
                single_pixel_index = i - 1
                block_start_index = i
                block_end_index = block_start_index
                while block_end_index + 1 < n and grid[block_end_index + 1] == color_b:
                    block_end_index += 1
                return single_pixel_index, block_start_index, block_end_index

[{'Example': 1, 'Input Length': 19, 'Pattern Indices (A_idx, B_start, B_end)': (2, 3, 8), 'Color A': 8, 'Color B': 5, 'Block Length': 6, 'Is Single Pixel A Check (Index)': True}, {'Example': 2, 'Input Length': 19, 'Pattern Indices (A_idx, B_start, B_end)': (8, 9, 16), 'Color A': 1, 'Color B': 5, 'Block Length': 8, 'Is Single Pixel A Check (Index)': True}, {'Example': 3, 'Input Length': 19, 'Pattern Indices (A_idx, B_start, B_end)': (2, 3, 6), 'Color A': 5, 'Color B': 2, 'Block Length': 4, 'Is Single Pixel A Check (Index)': True}]

```
**Analysis of Metrics:**

The code execution confirms that the `find_pattern_indices` function *correctly* identifies the pattern and the relevant indices, colors, and block lengths for all three training examples, exactly as determined in the manual trace. The 'Is Single Pixel A Check' also confirms the logic correctly identifies that the pixel 'A' is preceded by a background color (0) or is at the start of the grid.

This strongly suggests the issue was not in the pattern *detection* logic but potentially in how the transformation was applied *within* the `transform` function or an issue external to the core logic (like the test harness environment or data handling). Since the trace of the transformation logic also seemed correct, I will re-affirm the original Natural Language Program, assuming the implementation should follow it precisely.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - Name: Pixel_A
    Type: Single_Pixel
    Role: Left element in swap
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-white color (Color A)
      - Size: 1 pixel
      - Position_Constraint: Must be preceded by white (0) or be at index 0.
  - Name: Block_B
    Type: Contiguous_Block
    Role: Right element in swap
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-white color (Color B), different from Color A
      - Size: 1 or more pixels
      - Structure: Contiguous sequence of identical Color B pixels
      - Position_Constraint: Must immediately follow Pixel_A.

Relationships:
  - Type: Adjacency
    Details: Pixel_A is immediately to the left of the first pixel of Block_B.
    Example_1: Pixel_A (8 at idx 2) left-adjacent to Block_B (5 5 5 5 5 5 starting at idx 3)
    Example_2: Pixel_A (1 at idx 8) left-adjacent to Block_B (5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 starting at idx 9)
    Example_3: Pixel_A (5 at idx 2) left-adjacent to Block_B (2 2 2 2 starting at idx 3)

Actions:
  - Type: Positional_Swap
    Actors: Pixel_A, Block_B
    Condition: The specific pattern (Pixel_A followed immediately by Block_B, with Pixel_A satisfying its position constraint) must be found. Only the first occurrence is acted upon.
    Rule:
      1. Identify the index of Pixel_A (`idx_A`).
      2. Identify the start and end indices of Block_B (`idx_B_start`, `idx_B_end`).
      3. Calculate the length of Block_B (`len_B = idx_B_end - idx_B_start + 1`).
      4. In the output grid:
         a. Place the sequence of pixels constituting Block_B starting at index `idx_A`.
         b. Place Pixel_A at index `idx_A + len_B`.
    Invariant:
      - Colors of the objects remain the same.
      - Internal pixel order within Block_B remains the same (implicitly handled by copying the block).
      - All pixels outside the range originally occupied by Pixel_A and Block_B remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right, looking for the first occurrence of the following pattern:
    *   A non-white pixel (Color A) at index `i-1`.
    *   This pixel must be either at the very beginning of the grid (`i-1 == 0`) or be preceded by a white pixel (0) at index `i-2`.
    *   A non-white pixel (Color B) at index `i`, where Color B is different from Color A.
3.  If this starting pattern (`Color A` at `i-1`, `Color B` at `i`) is found:
    a.  Note the index of Color A (`idx_A = i-1`).
    b.  Determine the full extent of the contiguous block of Color B starting at index `i`. Find the end index (`idx_B_end`) of this block.
    c.  Calculate the length of the block (`len_B = idx_B_end - i + 1`).
    d.  Modify the output grid:
        i.  Copy the block of Color B (from input index `i` to `idx_B_end`) into the output grid starting at index `idx_A`.
        ii. Place Color A into the output grid at index `idx_A + len_B`.
    e.  Stop searching and proceed to return the modified output grid.
4.  If the scan completes without finding the pattern, return the unmodified copy of the input grid.
