Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples show 1xN grids (single rows).
2.  **Background:** The background is uniformly white (0).
3.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
4.  **Object Composition:** This sequence consists of two distinct colors:
    *   One color appears multiple times consecutively (the "main sequence").
    *   Another color appears exactly once, adjacent to one end of the main sequence (the "singleton").
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the position of the singleton pixel relative to the main sequence. Specifically, the singleton pixel moves from one end of the main sequence to the other end. The main sequence pixels remain in their relative positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensions: All examples are 1xN (single row).
  background_color: white (0)
  objects_present: Yes
objects:
  - id: main_object
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels.
    composition:
      - type: main_sequence
        description: A block of multiple pixels of the same color.
        count: 1
      - type: singleton
        description: A single pixel of a different color adjacent to one end of the main_sequence.
        count: 1
    properties:
      colors: Contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
      structure: The singleton pixel is always located at one end of the main_sequence.
transformation:
  action: Relocate the singleton pixel.
  details:
    - The singleton pixel moves from its initial end of the main_sequence to the opposite end.
    - The pixels of the main_sequence maintain their relative order and position, shifting only to accommodate the moved singleton.
  input_state: Singleton pixel is adjacent to one end of the main_sequence.
  output_state: Singleton pixel is adjacent to the other end of the main_sequence.
  invariants:
    - The colors involved remain the same.
    - The length of the main_sequence remains the same.
    - The overall length of the non-white main_object remains the same.
    - The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Within this block, determine the color that appears multiple times (the main color) and the color that appears only once (the singleton color).
3.  Locate the position of the singleton pixel; it will be at one end of the sequence of main color pixels.
4.  Create the output row by reconstructing the block: place the sequence of main color pixels first, followed by the singleton pixel, if the singleton was initially at the left end. If the singleton was initially at the right end, place the singleton pixel first, followed by the sequence of main color pixels.
5.  Ensure the reconstructed block is placed in the same horizontal position within the row as the original block, surrounded by white pixels.
