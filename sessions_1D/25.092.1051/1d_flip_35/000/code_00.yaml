task_context:
  grid_dimensions: All examples are 1xN (single row).
  background_color: white (0)
  objects_present: Yes
objects:
  - id: main_object
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels.
    composition:
      - type: main_sequence
        description: A block of multiple pixels of the same color.
        count: 1
      - type: singleton
        description: A single pixel of a different color adjacent to one end of the main_sequence.
        count: 1
    properties:
      colors: Contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
      structure: The singleton pixel is always located at one end of the main_sequence.
transformation:
  action: Relocate the singleton pixel.
  details:
    - The singleton pixel moves from its initial end of the main_sequence to the opposite end.
    - The pixels of the main_sequence maintain their relative order and position, shifting only to accommodate the moved singleton.
  input_state: Singleton pixel is adjacent to one end of the main_sequence.
  output_state: Singleton pixel is adjacent to the other end of the main_sequence.
  invariants:
    - The colors involved remain the same.
    - The length of the main_sequence remains the same.
    - The overall length of the non-white main_object remains the same.
    - The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
