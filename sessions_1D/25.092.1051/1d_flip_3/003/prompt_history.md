*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are 1D arrays (or single rows of a grid) of integers representing colors.
    *   Each array primarily consists of white (0) pixels.
    *   Within the white background, there is a single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    *   This non-white block is composed of two distinct colors: one color appears only once (let's call it the "marker" color), and the other color fills the rest of the block (the "body" color).
    *   In all examples, the marker pixel is located at the leftmost position of the non-white block in the input.
    *   The transformation involves moving the marker pixel to the rightmost position of the non-white block in the output, while the body pixels shift accordingly to fill the space.
    *   The colors themselves, the length of the non-white block, and the position of the block within the overall array remain unchanged.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The previous code execution failed because the conditional logic responsible for rearranging the pixels within the identified colored block was flawed. It correctly identified the block, the marker color, and the body color, but the conditions for creating the new block arrangement were contradictory, leading to the function returning the original input array unchanged in all cases.

The analysis using `tool_code` confirms the initial perception of the task structure is accurate:
*   Input and output are 1D arrays.
*   A single, contiguous block of non-white pixels exists.
*   This block contains exactly two colors: a unique 'marker' color (count=1) and a 'body' color (count>1).
*   The marker is always at the leftmost position (relative index 0) in the input block.
*   The marker is always at the rightmost position (relative index `length-1`) in the output block.
*   The block's overall position, length, colors, and color counts are preserved.

The strategy is to correct the transformation logic based directly on this confirmed pattern:
1.  Locate the non-white block.
2.  Identify the marker and body colors within the block.
3.  Verify the marker is at the leftmost position (index `start_index`).
4.  If verified, construct the output block by placing `length-1` body pixels followed by the marker pixel.
5.  Insert this new block into the copied array at the original block's location.
6.  If the marker is *not* at the start (or the block structure is invalid), return the original array.

**Metrics**

The `code_execution` provided detailed analysis confirming the transformation rule for all three examples:
*   **Block Identification:** Correctly found contiguous non-white blocks in all inputs and outputs (`input_block_found`, `output_block_found`).
*   **Block Properties:** Confirmed block indices, length, colors, and color counts are invariant (`block_indices_match`, `block_length_match`, `block_colors_match`).
*   **Marker Identification:** Correctly identified marker and body colors (`input_marker_color`, `input_body_color`, `output_marker_color`, `output_body_color`). Marker and body colors match between input and output (`marker_color_match`, `body_color_match`).
*   **Marker Position:** Consistently found the marker at relative position 0 in the input (`input_marker_relative_pos: 0`) and at relative position `length - 1` in the output (`output_marker_relative_pos: block_length - 1`).
*   **Transformation Verification:** The `marker_moved_correctly` flag is True for all examples, explicitly confirming the observed rule (marker moves from relative index 0 to relative index `length - 1`).

**YAML Facts**

      - input_relative_positions: Indices 1 to `length - 1` within the colored_block.
      - output_relative_positions: Indices 0 to `length - 2` within the colored_block.
transformation:
  action: Reorder pixels within the colored_block.

  condition: The transformation applies only if a colored_block exists and contains exactly one marker pixel located at its starting position (relative index 0).
  steps:
    - Find the start and end indices of the non-zero block.
    - Extract the block.
    - Count colors to find the marker (count=1) and body (count>1) colors.
    - Verify the marker color is at the first position of the extracted block.
    - If verified, construct a new block: `[body_color] * (length - 1) + [marker_color]`.
    - Replace the original block segment in the array copy with the new block.
  invariants:
    - Background pixels (value 0).
    - Position (start/end indices) of the colored_block.
    - Length of the colored_block.
    - Set of colors present in the block.
    - Counts of each color within the block.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an identical copy of the input 1D array (list of integers) to serve as the basis for the output.
2.  Iterate through the input array to find the start index and end index of the first contiguous sequence of non-zero values (the "colored block").
3.  If no non-zero values are found, return the original array copy.
4.  Extract the sub-list representing the colored block from the input array using the found start and end indices.
5.  Count the occurrences of each color (integer value) within the extracted block.
6.  Identify the 'marker color' (the integer value that appears exactly once) and the 'body color' (the integer value that appears more than once).
7.  If the block does not contain exactly one color with a count of 1 and exactly one color with a count greater than 1, return the original array copy (as the structure is unexpected).
8.  Check if the first element (at relative index 0) of the extracted block is equal to the 'marker color'.
9.  If it is **not** the marker color, return the original array copy (as the input condition observed in examples is not met).
10. If it **is** the marker color:
    a.  Determine the length of the block.
    b.  Create a new list (the "reordered block").
    c.  Append the 'body color' to the reordered block `length - 1` times.
    d.  Append the 'marker color' to the end of the reordered block once.
    e.  Replace the segment in the output array copy from the original start index to the original end index with the elements of the newly created "reordered block".
11. Return the modified output array copy.
