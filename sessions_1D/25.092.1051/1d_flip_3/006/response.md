*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code attempt failed because the condition controlling the transformation was logically inverted. It correctly identified the target block, the unique 'marker' pixel, and the repeated 'body' pixels. However, it was designed to return the original grid *if* the marker was found at the beginning of the block, rather than performing the transformation *only when* the marker was found there. The strategy is to correct this conditional logic. The core identification and transformation mechanics (creating the new block sequence) appear sound based on the problem description.

*   **Metrics:**
    Let's verify the intermediate steps of the previous code on the training examples to confirm the identification logic is correct.

    **Metrics Analysis:** The metrics confirm that for all training examples:
    *   The non-white block is correctly identified (`start`, `end`, `block_array`).
    *   The block structure is valid (`is_valid` is true).
    *   The marker and body colors are correctly identified (`marker_color`, `body_color`).
    *   The marker pixel is indeed located at the start of the block (`marker_at_start` is true).
    This confirms the hypothesis that the identification logic was correct, and the error lies solely in the conditional check within the main `transform` function logic.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: Move a unique 'marker' pixel from the start to the end of a colored block.
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        description: Fills the array outside the main object. Remains unchanged.
      - type: colored_block
        description: A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the white background.
        properties:
          - composition: Contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
          - structure: One 'marker' pixel (unique color count=1) and multiple 'body' pixels (shared color count>1).
          - invariant: Total length, constituent colors, and overall position within the array remain the same after transformation.
      - type: marker_pixel
        description: The single pixel within the colored_block with a unique color.
        properties:
          - color: variable (green, orange, blue in examples)
          - required_initial_position: Must be at the leftmost position (start) of the colored_block in the input for the transformation to occur.
          - final_position: Moved to the rightmost position (end) of the colored_block in the output if the initial condition is met.
      - type: body_pixels
        description: The pixels within the colored_block that share the same color, distinct from the marker.
        properties:
          - color: variable (yellow, gray in examples)
          - quantity: Fills the rest of the colored_block.
          - relative_position: Shift leftwards to fill the space vacated by the marker, maintaining contiguity.
    transformation:
      condition: The identified colored_block must have the valid marker/body structure AND the marker_pixel must be at the start (leftmost position) of the block.
      action: If the condition is met, relocate the marker_pixel within the colored_block.
      details: Move the marker_pixel from the leftmost position to the rightmost position of the block. Fill the positions between the start and the new marker position with the body_pixels.
      no_action: If the condition is not met (block structure invalid or marker not at the start), the input grid is returned unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (the "colored block") in the input array. If no such block exists, return the input unchanged.
    2.  Analyze the colored block to determine its constituent colors and their counts.
    3.  Check if the block's structure is valid: it must contain exactly two distinct non-white colors, one occurring exactly once (the "marker" color) and the other occurring multiple times (the "body" color). If the structure is invalid, return the input unchanged.
    4.  Check if the pixel at the starting (leftmost) position of the colored block has the marker color. If it does not, return the input unchanged.
    5.  If the structure is valid AND the marker pixel is at the start, create the output array:
        *   Keep all background (white) pixels the same as the input.
        *   Reconstruct the colored block in the output array at the same position (start and end indices).
        *   Place the marker pixel at the end (rightmost position) of the block space.
        *   Fill all other positions within the block space with the body color.
    6.  Return the modified array.
