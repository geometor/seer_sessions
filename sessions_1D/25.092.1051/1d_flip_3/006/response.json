It correctly identified the target block, the unique 'marker' pixel, and the repeated 'body' pixels. However, it was designed to return the original grid *if* the marker was found at the beginning of the block, rather than performing the transformation *only when* the marker was found there. The strategy is to correct this conditional logic. The core identification and transformation mechanics (creating the new block sequence) appear sound based on the problem description.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Let's verify the intermediate steps of the previous code on the training examples to confirm the identification logic is correct.\n    "
