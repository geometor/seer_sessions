*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are 1D arrays (or single rows of a grid) of integers representing colors.
    *   Each array primarily consists of white (0) pixels.
    *   Within the white background, there is a single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    *   This non-white block is composed of two distinct colors: one color appears only once (let's call it the "marker" color), and the other color fills the rest of the block (the "body" color).
    *   In all examples, the marker pixel is located at the leftmost position of the non-white block in the input.
    *   The transformation involves moving the marker pixel to the rightmost position of the non-white block in the output, while the body pixels shift accordingly to fill the space.
    *   The colors themselves, the length of the non-white block, and the position of the block within the overall array remain unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: Move a unique 'marker' pixel from one end of a colored block to the other.
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        description: Fills the array outside the main object. Remains unchanged.
      - type: colored_block
        description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - composition: Contains two distinct colors.
          - structure: One 'marker' pixel and multiple 'body' pixels.
          - invariant: Total length and constituent colors remain the same. Position within the array remains the same.
      - type: marker_pixel
        description: The single pixel within the colored_block with a unique color.
        properties:
          - color: variable (green, orange, blue in examples)
          - initial_position: Leftmost end of the colored_block in the input.
          - final_position: Rightmost end of the colored_block in the output.
      - type: body_pixels
        description: The pixels within the colored_block that share the same color, distinct from the marker.
        properties:
          - color: variable (yellow, gray, yellow in examples)
          - quantity: Fills the rest of the colored_block.
          - relative_position: Shifts to accommodate the marker's movement but maintain contiguity.
    transformation:
      action: Relocate the marker_pixel within the colored_block.
      details: Move the marker_pixel from the leftmost position to the rightmost position of the block.
      constraints: Preserve the colors, length, and overall position of the colored_block.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (the "colored block") in the input array.
    2.  Within this colored block, distinguish the single "marker" pixel (which has a unique color within the block) from the "body" pixels (which all share a different, single color).
    3.  Determine the current position of the marker pixel within the block (it will be at one end - in the examples, the left end).
    4.  Create the output array by keeping all background (white) pixels the same.
    5.  Reconstruct the colored block in the output by placing the marker pixel at the opposite end of the block from where it was found in the input (e.g., if it was at the left end, move it to the right end).
    6.  Fill the remaining positions of the block with the body pixels, maintaining their color and count.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components (background, colored block, marker pixel, body pixels) and the fundamental transformation (moving the marker from the start to the end of the block). However, the generated code failed to execute this transformation, returning the input unchanged for all training examples. This indicates a flaw in the implementation logic, specifically likely within the conditional checks or the step where the modified block is placed back into the grid, rather than a misunderstanding of the task's goal. The strategy is to re-verify the properties of the input/output pairs, confirm the transformation steps, and refine the natural language program to be precise about the conditions and actions required.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task: Relocate a uniquely colored pixel within a contiguous block of otherwise uniformly colored pixels.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
elements:
  - type: colored_block
    description: A single contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - location: Does not change between input and output.
      - length: Does not change between input and output.
      - composition: Contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: The pixel within the colored_block whose color appears exactly once.
    properties:
      - color: Varies between examples (green, orange, blue). Preserved in output.
      - input_position: Always located at the leftmost end (index 0) of the colored_block.
      - output_position: Always located at the rightmost end (index N-1) of the colored_block.
  - type: body_pixels
    description: The pixels within the colored_block that are not the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: All body pixels share the same color, distinct from the marker. Varies between examples (yellow, gray). Preserved in output.
      - quantity: Fills the rest of the colored_block (length - 1). Preserved in output.
      - input_arrangement: Occupy indices 1 to N-1 of the colored_block.
      - output_arrangement: Occupy indices 0 to N-2 of the colored_block. Maintain relative order implicitly by filling the space.
transformation:
  action: Modify the arrangement of pixels within the colored_block.
  condition: The transformation applies only if a block exists that meets the composition criteria (one marker, N body pixels) AND the marker pixel is at the leftmost position (index 0) of the block.
  steps:
    1. Identify the start and end indices of the single contiguous non-white block.
    2. Extract the block.
    3. Analyze the block's colors to find the marker color (count=1) and body color (count>1).
    4. Verify the marker color is at the first position (index 0) of the extracted block.
    5. If verified, construct a new block of the same length:
       a. Fill positions 0 to N-2 with the body color.
       b. Place the marker color at position N-1 (the last position).
    6. Replace the original block segment in the grid with the newly constructed block.
    7. If the condition (marker at start) is not met, or the block structure is invalid, return the input grid unchanged.
  invariants:
    - The background (white pixels) remains unchanged.
    - The overall position (start/end indices) of the colored_block remains unchanged.
    - The length of the colored_block remains unchanged.
    - The marker color and body color remain unchanged.
    - The total count of each color within the block remains unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Locate the Object:** Find the first contiguous sequence (the "block") of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input array. Record its start and end indices. If no such block exists, the transformation is complete, and the input is the output.
2.  **Analyze the Object:** Examine the pixels within this block.
    a.  Count the occurrences of each color within the block.
    b.  Identify the "marker color" (the color that appears exactly once) and the "body color" (the color that appears multiple times).
    c.  Verify that there are exactly two distinct colors in the block: one marker and one body color. If not, the transformation does not apply, and the input is the output.
3.  **Check the Condition:** Determine the position of the marker color pixel within the block. Check if it is at the very beginning (leftmost position, relative index 0) of the block.
4.  **Perform Transformation (if condition met):** If the marker color is at the beginning of the block:
    a.  Create a new sequence of pixels for the block, having the same length as the original block.
    b.  Fill the new sequence from the beginning up to the second-to-last position with the identified body color.
    c.  Place the identified marker color in the very last position of the new sequence.
    d.  Create the output array by copying the input array.
    e.  Replace the segment in the output array corresponding to the original block's start and end indices with the newly created sequence.
5.  **Handle Non-Applicable Cases:** If the marker color was *not* at the beginning of the block (step 3), the transformation does not apply. The output is identical to the input.
6.  **Final Output:** Return the resulting array.
