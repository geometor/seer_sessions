            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe previous code execution failed because the conditional logic responsible for rearranging the pixels within the identified colored block was flawed. It correctly identified the block, the marker color, and the body color, but the conditions for creating the new block arrangement were contradictory, leading to the function returning the original input array unchanged in all cases.\n\nThe analysis using `tool_code` confirms the initial perception of the task structure is accurate:\n*   Input and output are 1D arrays.\n*   A single, contiguous block of non-white pixels exists.\n*   This block contains exactly two colors: a unique 'marker' color (count=1) and a 'body' color (count>1).\n*   The marker is always at the leftmost position (relative index 0) in the input block.\n*   The marker is always at the rightmost position (relative index `length-1`) in the output block.\n*   The block's overall position, length, colors, and color counts are preserved.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the transformation logic based directly on this confirmed pattern:\n1.  Locate the non-white block.\n2.  Identify the marker and body colors within the block.\n3.  Verify the marker is at the leftmost position (index `start_index`).\n4.  If verified, construct the output block by placing `length-1` body pixels followed by the marker pixel.\n5.  Insert this new block into the copied array at the original block's location.\n6.  If the marker is *not* at the start (or the block structure is invalid), return the original array.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe `code_execution` provided detailed analysis confirming the transformation rule for all three examples:\n*   **Block Identification:** Correctly found contiguous non-white blocks in all inputs and outputs (`input_block_found`, `output_block_found`).\n*   **Block Properties:** Confirmed block indices, length, colors, and color counts are invariant (`block_indices_match`, `block_length_match`, `block_colors_match`).\n*   **Marker Identification:** Correctly identified marker and body colors (`input_marker_color`, `input_body_color`, `output_marker_color`, `output_body_color`). Marker and body colors match between input and output (`marker_color_match`, `body_color_match`).\n*   **Marker Position:** Consistently found the marker at relative position 0 in the input (`input_marker_relative_pos: 0`) and at relative position `length - 1` in the output (`output_marker_relative_pos: block_length - 1`).\n*   **Transformation Verification:** The `marker_moved_correctly` flag is True for all examples, explicitly confirming the observed rule (marker moves from relative index 0 to relative index `length - 1`).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
