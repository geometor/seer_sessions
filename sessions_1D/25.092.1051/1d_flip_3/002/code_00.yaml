task: Move a unique 'marker' pixel from the start to the end of a contiguous colored block within a 1D array.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: Fills the array outside the main object. Remains unchanged.
    scope: Global array indices not belonging to the colored_block.
  - type: colored_block
    description: A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels identified by `value != 0`.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by start_index and end_index. Invariant between input and output.
      - composition: Contains exactly two distinct non-zero colors. Invariant.
      - structure: One 'marker' pixel (unique color) and N 'body' pixels (shared color, N > 0). Invariant counts.
      - length: `end_index - start_index + 1`. Invariant.
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: The single pixel within the colored_block with a unique color (count = 1 within the block).
    properties:
      - color: Variable (e.g., 3, 7, 1). Preserved between input and output.
      - input_relative_position: Always index 0 within the colored_block.
      - output_relative_position: Always index `length - 1` within the colored_block.
  - type: body_pixels
    description: The set of pixels within the colored_block sharing the same color (count > 1), distinct from the marker.
    properties:
      - color: Variable (e.g., 4, 5). Preserved between input and output.
      - input_relative_positions: Indices 1 to `length - 1` within the colored_block.
      - output_relative_positions: Indices 0 to `length - 2` within the colored_block.
transformation:
  action: Reorder pixels within the colored_block.
  description: The marker pixel originally at the start of the block is moved to the end, and the body pixels shift one position towards the start to fill the gap.
  condition: The transformation applies only if a colored_block exists and contains exactly one marker pixel located at its starting position (relative index 0).
  steps:
    - Find the start and end indices of the non-zero block.
    - Extract the block.
    - Count colors to find the marker (count=1) and body (count>1) colors.
    - Verify the marker color is at the first position of the extracted block.
    - If verified, construct a new block: `[body_color] * (length - 1) + [marker_color]`.
    - Replace the original block segment in the array copy with the new block.
  invariants:
    - Background pixels (value 0).
    - Position (start/end indices) of the colored_block.
    - Length of the colored_block.
    - Set of colors present in the block.
    - Counts of each color within the block.
