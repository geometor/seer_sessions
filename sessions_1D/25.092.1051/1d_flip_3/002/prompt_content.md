"""
Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (the 'colored block') in the input array.
Within this block, distinguish the single 'marker' pixel (unique color) from the 'body' pixels (shared color).
Move the marker pixel from its current end position (left in examples) to the opposite end (right in examples).
Fill the remaining positions of the block with the body pixels, maintaining their color and count.
The background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged.
