One color appears as a single pixel (the \"singleton\"), and the other color forms a contiguous horizontal block (the \"block\"). The singleton pixel is always adjacent to one end of the block. The transformation swaps the position of the singleton pixel and the entire block. The internal arrangement of pixels within the block remains unchanged, and the surrounding white pixels are unaffected.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "

If the singleton was originally to the left of the block, the block's new starting index is the original singleton index. If the singleton was to the right, the block's new starting index is the original block's starting index.\n    8.  Place the pixels corresponding to the block into the output row starting at the calculated new index.\n    9.  Place the singleton pixel into the output row at the position immediately following the newly placed block (if the singleton was originally left) or immediately preceding it (if the singleton was originally right). Specifically, its new index will be the original end index of the block (if singleton was left) or the original start index of the block (if singleton was right)."
