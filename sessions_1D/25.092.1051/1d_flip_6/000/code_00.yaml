task_type: object_transformation_1d

elements:
  - element: grid
    type: 1D_array
    description: A single row of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.

  - element: mover_pixel
    type: object
    description: A single pixel identified by its unique color relative to an adjacent block.
    properties:
      - color: (varies, e.g., azure, red, gray)
      - position: adjacent to one end of the color_block

  - element: color_block
    type: object
    description: A contiguous sequence of 2 or more pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: (varies, e.g., gray, orange)
      - length: (>= 2)
      - position: adjacent to the mover_pixel
      - distinct_color: color is different from mover_pixel's color

  - element: background_pixel
    type: pixel
    description: Pixels not part of the identified mover_pixel or color_block interaction.
    properties:
      - color: typically white (0)
      - state: unchanged in the transformation

actions:
  - action: find_pattern
    description: Identify a mover_pixel immediately adjacent to a color_block.
    inputs: grid
    outputs: mover_pixel, color_block, start_index, end_index (of the combined pattern)

  - action: determine_relative_position
    description: Check if the mover_pixel is to the left or right of the color_block.
    inputs: mover_pixel, color_block
    outputs: relative_position (left or right)

  - action: reorder_elements
    description: Swap the order of the mover_pixel and the color_block based on their initial relative position.
    condition: if mover_pixel is left of color_block
    result: new_sequence = color_block + mover_pixel
    condition: if mover_pixel is right of color_block
    result: new_sequence = mover_pixel + color_block

  - action: update_grid
    description: Replace the original sequence of mover_pixel and color_block in the grid with the reordered new_sequence, maintaining the start index.
    inputs: grid, start_index, end_index, new_sequence
    outputs: modified_grid

relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    between: [mover_pixel, color_block]
    description: The mover_pixel is located directly next to one end of the color_block in the input grid.
