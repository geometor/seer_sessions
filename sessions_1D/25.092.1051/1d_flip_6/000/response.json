            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single rows (1D grids) of colored pixels.\n2.  **Key Elements:** Each example features a single pixel of one color (let's call it the 'mover') positioned immediately adjacent to a contiguous block of two or more pixels of a second, different color (let's call it the 'block'). There are also background pixels (white/0) that seem unaffected.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve the 'mover' pixel and the 'block'. In all examples, the 'mover' pixel is initially on the left side of the 'block'. In the output, the 'mover' pixel appears on the right side of the 'block'. Essentially, the 'mover' pixel \"jumps\" over the 'block', or they swap their relative positions.\n4.  **Example Breakdown:**\n    *   **Ex 1:** Mover=azure(8), Block=gray(5). Input: `... 8 [5 5 5 ...] ...` Output: `... [5 5 5 ...] 8 ...`\n    *   **Ex 2:** Mover=red(2), Block=gray(5). Input: `2 [5 5 5 ...] ...` Output: `[5 5 5 ...] 2 ...`\n    *   **Ex 3:** Mover=gray(5), Block=orange(7). Input: `... 5 [7 7 7 ...] ...` Output: `... [7 7 7 ...] 5 ...`\n5.  **Invariance:** The colors and lengths of the 'mover' and 'block' remain the same. The background pixels (white/0) remain in their original positions relative to the grid boundaries. The combined sequence of the block and the mover replaces the original sequence in the grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
