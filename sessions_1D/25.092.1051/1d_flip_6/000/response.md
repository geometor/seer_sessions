Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single rows (1D grids) of colored pixels.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each example features a single pixel of one color (let's call it the 'mover') positioned immediately adjacent to a contiguous block of two or more pixels of a second, different color (let's call it the 'block'). There are also background pixels (white/0) that seem unaffected.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve the 'mover' pixel and the 'block'. In all examples, the 'mover' pixel is initially on the left side of the 'block'. In the output, the 'mover' pixel appears on the right side of the 'block'. Essentially, the 'mover' pixel "jumps" over the 'block', or they swap their relative positions.
4.  **Example Breakdown:**
    *   **Ex 1:** Mover=azure(8), Block=gray(5). Input: `... 8 [5 5 5 ...] ...` Output: `... [5 5 5 ...] 8 ...`
    *   **Ex 2:** Mover=red(2), Block=gray(5). Input: `2 [5 5 5 ...] ...` Output: `[5 5 5 ...] 2 ...`
    *   **Ex 3:** Mover=gray(5), Block=orange(7). Input: `... 5 [7 7 7 ...] ...` Output: `... [7 7 7 ...] 5 ...`
5.  **Invariance:** The colors and lengths of the 'mover' and 'block' remain the same. The background pixels (white/0) remain in their original positions relative to the grid boundaries. The combined sequence of the block and the mover replaces the original sequence in the grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation_1d

elements:
  - element: grid
    type: 1D_array
    description: A single row of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.

  - element: mover_pixel

    description: A single pixel identified by its unique color relative to an adjacent block.
    properties:
      - color: (varies, e.g., azure, red, gray)
      - position: adjacent to one end of the color_block

  - element: color_block

    description: A contiguous sequence of 2 or more pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: (varies, e.g., gray, orange)
      - length: (>= 2)
      - position: adjacent to the mover_pixel
      - distinct_color: color is different from mover_pixel's color

  - element: background_pixel
    type: pixel
    description: Pixels not part of the identified mover_pixel or color_block interaction.
    properties:
      - color: typically white (0)
      - state: unchanged in the transformation

actions:
  - action: find_pattern
    description: Identify a mover_pixel immediately adjacent to a color_block.
    inputs: grid
    outputs: mover_pixel, color_block, start_index, end_index (of the combined pattern)

  - action: determine_relative_position
    description: Check if the mover_pixel is to the left or right of the color_block.
    inputs: mover_pixel, color_block
    outputs: relative_position (left or right)

  - action: reorder_elements
    description: Swap the order of the mover_pixel and the color_block based on their initial relative position.
    condition: if mover_pixel is left of color_block
    result: new_sequence = color_block + mover_pixel
    condition: if mover_pixel is right of color_block
    result: new_sequence = mover_pixel + color_block

  - action: update_grid
    description: Replace the original sequence of mover_pixel and color_block in the grid with the reordered new_sequence, maintaining the start index.
    inputs: grid, start_index, end_index, new_sequence
    outputs: modified_grid

relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    between: [mover_pixel, color_block]
    description: The mover_pixel is located directly next to one end of the color_block in the input grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through the input grid to locate a pattern consisting of a single pixel (Pixel A) adjacent to a contiguous block of 2 or more pixels (Block B), where Pixel A and Block B have different colors. Record the start and end indices of this combined pattern (A + B or B + A).
2.  Determine if Pixel A is located to the left or right of Block B within this pattern.
3.  If Pixel A is to the left of Block B, create a new sequence by concatenating Block B followed by Pixel A.
4.  If Pixel A is to the right of Block B, create a new sequence by concatenating Pixel A followed by Block B.
5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
6.  Replace the segment in the output grid corresponding to the identified pattern (using the start and end indices found in step 1) with the new sequence created in step 3 or 4.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
