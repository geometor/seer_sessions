Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single rows (1D grids) of colored pixels.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each example features a single pixel of one color (let's call it the 'mover') positioned immediately adjacent to a contiguous block of two or more pixels of a second, different color (let's call it the 'block'). There are also background pixels (white/0) that seem unaffected.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve the 'mover' pixel and the 'block'. In all examples, the 'mover' pixel is initially on the left side of the 'block'. In the output, the 'mover' pixel appears on the right side of the 'block'. Essentially, the 'mover' pixel "jumps" over the 'block', or they swap their relative positions.
4.  **Example Breakdown:**
    *   **Ex 1:** Mover=azure(8), Block=gray(5). Input: `... 8 [5 5 5 ...] ...` Output: `... [5 5 5 ...] 8 ...`
    *   **Ex 2:** Mover=red(2), Block=gray(5). Input: `2 [5 5 5 ...] ...` Output: `[5 5 5 ...] 2 ...`
    *   **Ex 3:** Mover=gray(5), Block=orange(7). Input: `... 5 [7 7 7 ...] ...` Output: `... [7 7 7 ...] 5 ...`
5.  **Invariance:** The colors and lengths of the 'mover' and 'block' remain the same. The background pixels (white/0) remain in their original positions relative to the grid boundaries. The combined sequence of the block and the mover replaces the original sequence in the grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through the input grid to locate a pattern consisting of a single pixel (Pixel A) adjacent to a contiguous block of 2 or more pixels (Block B), where Pixel A and Block B have different colors. Record the start and end indices of this combined pattern (A + B or B + A).
2.  Determine if Pixel A is located to the left or right of Block B within this pattern.
3.  If Pixel A is to the left of Block B, create a new sequence by concatenating Block B followed by Pixel A.
4.  If Pixel A is to the right of Block B, create a new sequence by concatenating Pixel A followed by Block B.
5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
6.  Replace the segment in the output grid corresponding to the identified pattern (using the start and end indices found in step 1) with the new sequence created in step 3 or 4.
7.  Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code successfully solved examples 2 and 3 but failed on example 1. The failure analysis revealed that the `find_pattern` function incorrectly identified a sequence involving the background color (white/0) as the pattern (`[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] 8`). The intended pattern involved only non-background colors (`8 [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]`).

The core transformation logic (swapping the 'mover' pixel and the 'block') appears correct, but the pattern identification needs refinement.

**Refined Strategy:**

1.  **Pattern Definition:** The pattern consists of exactly two adjacent components:
    *   A 'mover': A single pixel of a non-background color (1-9).
    *   A 'block': A contiguous sequence of two or more pixels of the same non-background color (1-9), which is different from the mover's color.
2.  **Pattern Search:** Iterate through the grid, ignoring background pixels (0), to find the first occurrence where a mover pixel is adjacent to a block that meets the definition.
3.  **Transformation:** Once the pattern `(mover, block)` or `(block, mover)` and its start/end indices are identified, create a new sequence by swapping their order (`(block, mover)` or `(mover, block)` respectively).
4.  **Output Generation:** Replace the grid segment corresponding to the original pattern's start/end indices with the newly created swapped sequence. Preserve all other pixels (including background pixels outside the pattern).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the first occurrence of the following pattern:
    *   A single 'mover' pixel with a non-background color (1-9).
    *   Immediately adjacent (left or right) to the 'mover' pixel, a contiguous 'block' of two or more pixels exists.
    *   The 'block' pixels must all have the same non-background color (1-9).
    *   The 'block' color must be different from the 'mover' pixel color.
    *   The 'mover' pixel must be distinguished as single (i.e., not part of another block of the same color). It should be bordered by background (0), a grid edge, or the identified adjacent 'block'.
3.  If no such pattern is found, return the unchanged input grid copy.
4.  If the pattern is found:
    *   Record the 'mover' pixel's color and the sequence of pixels in the 'block'.
    *   Record the starting and ending indices of the combined pattern (mover + block or block + mover) in the input grid.
    *   Determine if the 'mover' pixel was originally to the left or right of the 'block'.
    *   Construct a new sequence:
        *   If the 'mover' was on the left, the new sequence is the 'block' sequence followed by the 'mover' pixel.
        *   If the 'mover' was on the right, the new sequence is the 'mover' pixel followed by the 'block' sequence.
    *   Replace the segment in the output grid (from the recorded start index to the end index) with this new sequence.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
