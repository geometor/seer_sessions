Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single rows (1D grids) of colored pixels.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each example features a single pixel of one color (let's call it the 'mover') positioned immediately adjacent to a contiguous block of two or more pixels of a second, different color (let's call it the 'block'). There are also background pixels (white/0) that seem unaffected.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve the 'mover' pixel and the 'block'. In all examples, the 'mover' pixel is initially on the left side of the 'block'. In the output, the 'mover' pixel appears on the right side of the 'block'. Essentially, the 'mover' pixel "jumps" over the 'block', or they swap their relative positions.
4.  **Example Breakdown:**
    *   **Ex 1:** Mover=azure(8), Block=gray(5). Input: `... 8 [5 5 5 ...] ...` Output: `... [5 5 5 ...] 8 ...`
    *   **Ex 2:** Mover=red(2), Block=gray(5). Input: `2 [5 5 5 ...] ...` Output: `[5 5 5 ...] 2 ...`
    *   **Ex 3:** Mover=gray(5), Block=orange(7). Input: `... 5 [7 7 7 ...] ...` Output: `... [7 7 7 ...] 5 ...`
5.  **Invariance:** The colors and lengths of the 'mover' and 'block' remain the same. The background pixels (white/0) remain in their original positions relative to the grid boundaries. The combined sequence of the block and the mover replaces the original sequence in the grid.

**Facts**

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through the input grid to locate a pattern consisting of a single pixel (Pixel A) adjacent to a contiguous block of 2 or more pixels (Block B), where Pixel A and Block B have different colors. Record the start and end indices of this combined pattern (A + B or B + A).
2.  Determine if Pixel A is located to the left or right of Block B within this pattern.
3.  If Pixel A is to the left of Block B, create a new sequence by concatenating Block B followed by Pixel A.
4.  If Pixel A is to the right of Block B, create a new sequence by concatenating Pixel A followed by Block B.
5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
6.  Replace the segment in the output grid corresponding to the identified pattern (using the start and end indices found in step 1) with the new sequence created in step 3 or 4.
7.  Return the modified output grid.

"""
Identifies a pattern where a single 'mover' pixel is adjacent to a
contiguous block (>= 2 pixels) of a different color in a 1D grid.
The transformation swaps the relative position of the mover pixel and
the block. If the mover is initially to the left of the block, it moves
to the right, and vice-versa. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.
