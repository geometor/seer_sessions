            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code successfully solved examples 2 and 3 but failed on example 1. The failure analysis revealed that the `find_pattern` function incorrectly identified a sequence involving the background color (white/0) as the pattern (`[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] 8`). The intended pattern involved only non-background colors (`8 [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]`).\n\nThe core transformation logic (swapping the 'mover' pixel and the 'block') appears correct, but the pattern identification needs refinement.\n\n**Refined Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Pattern Definition:** The pattern consists of exactly two adjacent components:\n    *   A 'mover': A single pixel of a non-background color (1-9).\n    *   A 'block': A contiguous sequence of two or more pixels of the same non-background color (1-9), which is different from the mover's color.\n2.  **Pattern Search:** Iterate through the grid, ignoring background pixels (0), to find the first occurrence where a mover pixel is adjacent to a block that meets the definition.\n3.  **Transformation:** Once the pattern `(mover, block)` or `(block, mover)` and its start/end indices are identified, create a new sequence by swapping their order (`(block, mover)` or `(mover, block)` respectively).\n4.  **Output Generation:** Replace the grid segment corresponding to the original pattern's start/end indices with the newly created swapped sequence. Preserve all other pixels (including background pixels outside the pattern).\n\n**Metrics**\n"
