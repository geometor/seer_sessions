There is a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels within each row.\n3.  **Non-White Segment:** This segment is composed of two distinct non-white colors. One color appears only once (let's call it the 'head'), and the other color appears multiple times consecutively (let's call it the 'body'). The head pixel is always located at one end of the body segment.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves repositioning the 'head' pixel. In the output, the head pixel is moved to the opposite end of the 'body' segment.\n5.  **Preservation:** The colors themselves, the length of the body segment, and the surrounding white pixels remain unchanged. The overall position of the non-white segment within the row is also preserved.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
