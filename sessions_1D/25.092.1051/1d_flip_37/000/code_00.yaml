task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: colored_segment
    description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      colors: Exactly two distinct non-white colors.
      structure: Consists of two parts:
        - name: head
          description: A single pixel of one color.
          location: At one end of the segment.
        - name: body
          description: Multiple contiguous pixels of the second color.
          location: Adjacent to the head.
    count_per_example: 1
actions:
  - name: move_head
    object: colored_segment
    description: The head pixel is moved from its original end of the body segment to the opposite end.
    details:
      - The sequence of body pixels remains unchanged relative to each other.
      - The head pixel retains its color.
      - The body pixels retain their color.
      - The overall start and end position of the reconstructed segment within the row remains the same as the original segment.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: head, body
    description: The head pixel is directly adjacent to the body segment in the input.
  - type: order_reversal
    target: head position relative to body
    description: The position of the head relative to the body segment is reversed (e.g., from leading to trailing, or vice-versa).
invariants:
  - Background pixels (white) remain unchanged.
  - The colors used for the head and body remain the same.
  - The number of body pixels remains the same.
  - The total length of the colored segment remains the same.
  - The position of the segment within the row (start and end indices) remains the same.
