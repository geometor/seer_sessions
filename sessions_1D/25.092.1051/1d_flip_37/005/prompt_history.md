Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
2.  **Content:** Each input primarily consists of white pixels (0). There is a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels within each row.
3.  **Non-White Segment:** This segment is composed of two distinct non-white colors. One color appears only once (let's call it the 'head'), and the other color appears multiple times consecutively (let's call it the 'body'). The head pixel is always located at one end of the body segment.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves repositioning the 'head' pixel. In the output, the head pixel is moved to the opposite end of the 'body' segment.
5.  **Preservation:** The colors themselves, the length of the body segment, and the surrounding white pixels remain unchanged. The overall position of the non-white segment within the row is also preserved.

## Facts

background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: colored_segment
    description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      colors: Exactly two distinct non-white colors.
      structure: Consists of two parts:
        - name: head
          description: A single pixel of one color.
          location: At one end of the segment.
        - name: body
          description: Multiple contiguous pixels of the second color.
          location: Adjacent to the head.
    count_per_example: 1
actions:
  - name: move_head
    object: colored_segment
    description: The head pixel is moved from its original end of the body segment to the opposite end.
    details:
      - The sequence of body pixels remains unchanged relative to each other.
      - The head pixel retains its color.
      - The body pixels retain their color.
      - The overall start and end position of the reconstructed segment within the row remains the same as the original segment.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: head, body
    description: The head pixel is directly adjacent to the body segment in the input.
  - type: order_reversal
    target: head position relative to body
    description: The position of the head relative to the body segment is reversed (e.g., from leading to trailing, or vice-versa).
invariants:
  - Background pixels (white) remain unchanged.
  - The colors used for the head and body remain the same.
  - The number of body pixels remains the same.
  - The total length of the colored segment remains the same.
  - The position of the segment within the row (start and end indices) remains the same.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Within this segment, identify the unique 'head' pixel (the color that appears only once) and the repeated 'body' pixels (the color that appears multiple times). Note the color and count of the body pixels.
3.  Determine the position (start and end indices) of the non-white segment in the original row.
4.  Construct the output row:
    a.  Keep all white pixels outside the segment's original position unchanged.
    b.  Reconstruct the segment at its original position by placing the sequence of 'body' pixels first, followed immediately by the single 'head' pixel. Ensure the total length and position match the original segment. If the head was originally at the beginning of the segment, place it at the end in the output. If it was originally at the end, place it at the beginning in the output.

## General Assessment

The initial code failed to produce the correct output for any of the training examples. The transformed output was identical to the input in all cases. This suggests a failure either in the logic that identifies the specific pattern required for transformation (causing the function to exit early and return the original grid) or in the step where the modified segment is written back into the output grid.

However, a manual trace of the code logic against the examples, along with the metrics gathered below, strongly indicates that the core understanding of the transformation (find a specific two-color segment, identify the unique 'head' pixel at one end, and move it to the other end) is correct and that the examples fit this pattern. The code *should* have identified the pattern and performed the transformation.

The strategy is to reaffirm the transformation logic based on the consistent pattern observed in the examples and confirmed by the metrics. The YAML facts and Natural Language Program will be refined for clarity and precision, assuming the core logic previously identified is correct and the execution failure was due to an implementation detail or environment issue.

## Metrics

The following metrics were gathered by analyzing the input grids of the training examples:

**Summary of Metrics:**

*   **Segment Found & Contiguous:** In all examples, a single, contiguous segment of non-white pixels was found.
*   **Pattern Match:** All examples perfectly match the defined pattern (`pattern_match: true`):
    *   Exactly two distinct non-white colors.
    *   One color appears exactly once (head).
    *   The other color appears multiple times (body).
    *   The head pixel is located at one of the ends of the segment (in all these cases, index 0).
*   **Head/Body:** The specific head and body colors vary, but the structure (1 head, N body) is consistent.
*   **Head Position:** In all training inputs, the head pixel is at the beginning (index 0) of the segment. The corresponding outputs show the head moved to the end.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: colored_segment
    description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the row.
    constraints: Must contain exactly two distinct non-white colors.
    count_per_example: 1
    properties:
      colors: Two distinct non-white colors.
      structure: Composed of two parts based on color frequency within the segment:
        - name: head
          description: A single pixel of the color that appears exactly once in the segment.
          location: Must be located at one of the two ends of the segment.
        - name: body
          description: Multiple contiguous pixels of the color that appears more than once in the segment.
          location: Occupies the rest of the segment adjacent to the head.
      length: Variable (minimum 2 pixels: 1 head + 1 body).
      position: Defined by start and end indices within the row.
actions:
  - name: relocate_head
    object: colored_segment
    description: The head pixel's position is swapped to the opposite end of the segment.
    details:
      - The relative order of the body pixels remains unchanged.
      - The head pixel retains its color.
      - The body pixels retain their color and count.
      - The segment's overall start and end position within the row remains the same.
      - If the head was at the start index, it moves to the end index of the segment.
      - If the head was at the end index, it moves to the start index of the segment.
invariants:
  - The background pixels (white) remain unchanged.
  - The colors used for the head and body remain the same.
  - The number of body pixels (and thus the total segment length) remains the same.
  - The start and end indices of the segment within the row remain the same.
  - Only segments matching the specified structure (contiguous, 2 colors, 1 unique at an end) are transformed; otherwise, the input is returned unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
2.  Scan the input row to find the start and end indices of the first contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
3.  If no such segment is found, return the original input row copy.
4.  Extract the segment subarray.
5.  Analyze the segment:
    a.  Count the occurrences of each color within the segment.
    b.  Check if there are exactly two distinct non-white colors.
    c.  Check if one color appears exactly once (the 'head' color) and the other color appears multiple times (the 'body' color).
    d.  Find the index of the 'head' pixel within the segment.
    e.  Verify that the 'head' pixel is located at either the start (index 0) or the end (index `length-1`) of the segment.
6.  If the segment does not match all criteria in step 5 (two colors, one unique head at an end, one repeated body), return the original input row copy.
7.  Construct the transformed segment:
    a.  Create a new array of the same length as the original segment.
    b.  Fill the new array with the 'body' color.
    c.  Determine the new position for the 'head': if it was at the start of the original segment, place it at the end of the new array; if it was at the end, place it at the start.
    d.  Place the 'head' color at its new position in the new array.
8.  Replace the portion of the output row corresponding to the original segment's start and end indices with the newly constructed transformed segment.
9.  Return the modified output row.
