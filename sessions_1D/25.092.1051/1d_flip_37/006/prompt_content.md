"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by locating a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels. 
This segment must contain exactly two distinct non-white colors: one 'head' color appearing once 
at either end, and one 'body' color appearing multiple times. The transformation moves the 
'head' pixel to the opposite end of the segment, keeping the body pixels, segment length, 
and overall segment position within the grid unchanged. If the input does not contain 
a segment matching these criteria, the original input grid is returned.
