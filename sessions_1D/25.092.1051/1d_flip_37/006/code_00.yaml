task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: colored_segment
    description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels found within the row.
    constraints: Must contain exactly two distinct non-white colors.
    properties:
      colors: Two distinct non-white colors.
      structure: Consists of two parts based on color frequency:
        - name: head
          description: A single pixel of one color (appears exactly once in the segment).
          location: Must be located at one of the two ends of the segment (index 0 or index N-1).
        - name: body
          description: One or more contiguous pixels of the second color (appears multiple times).
          location: Adjacent to the head, constituting the rest of the segment.
    count_per_example: 1 (implicit assumption based on examples)
actions:
  - name: reverse_head_position
    object: colored_segment
    description: The head pixel is moved from its original end of the segment to the opposite end.
    details:
      - The sequence/order of the body pixels relative to each other remains unchanged.
      - The head pixel retains its color.
      - The body pixels retain their color and count.
      - The overall start and end position (indices) of the segment within the row remains the same.
      - The length of the segment remains the same.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: head, body
    description: The head pixel is directly adjacent to the block of body pixels within the segment.
  - type: position_reversal
    target: head position relative to body
    description: The position of the head relative to the body segment is reversed (e.g., if head was at index 0, it moves to index N-1; if it was at N-1, it moves to 0).
invariants:
  - Background pixels (white/0) remain unchanged.
  - The colors used for the head and body remain the same.
  - The number of body pixels remains the same.
  - The total length of the colored segment remains the same.
  - The position (start and end indices) of the segment within the row remains the same.
error_handling:
  - If no contiguous non-white segment is found, return the input unchanged.
  - If a segment is found but does not match the head/body criteria (exactly two colors, one unique color at an end), return the input unchanged.
