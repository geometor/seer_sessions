task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: colored_segment
    description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels found within the row.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by a start and end index within the row.
      - colors: Contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
      - structure: Composed of two distinct parts based on color counts:
        - name: head
          description: A single pixel identified by its unique color within the segment.
          count: 1
          location: Positioned at one of the two ends of the segment (either start or end index relative to the segment).
        - name: body
          description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels identified by their shared color, which appears multiple times within the segment.
          count: >1
          location: Occupies the rest of the segment adjacent to the head.
    count_per_example: 1 # Assumes only one such segment per input row based on examples.
actions:
  - name: reverse_head_position
    object: colored_segment
    description: The 'head' pixel's position relative to the 'body' pixels is reversed within the segment's original boundaries.
    details:
      - The segment's start and end indices in the row remain the same.
      - The segment's length remains the same.
      - A new segment is constructed.
      - The 'body' pixels (color and count) are placed contiguously within the new segment.
      - The 'head' pixel (color) is placed at the end of the new segment that corresponds to the opposite end from its original position. (If original head index was 0, new index is N-1; if original was N-1, new index is 0, where N is segment length).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: head, body
    description: The head pixel is directly adjacent to one end of the body sequence in the input segment.
  - type: relative_position_reversal
    target: head position relative to body
    description: The position of the head relative to the body segment is reversed (e.g., from leading the body sequence to trailing it, or vice-versa).
invariants:
  - Background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged.
  - The colors used for the head and body remain the same.
  - The number of body pixels remains the same.
  - The total length of the colored segment remains the same.
  - The absolute position (start and end indices) of the segment within the row remains the same.
