"""
Identifies a contiguous segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid.
Within this segment, it finds a unique 'head' pixel (color appears once) 
and multiple 'body' pixels (color appears more than once).
The transformation moves the 'head' pixel to the opposite end of the 'body' pixels 
within the segment's original location in the grid.
