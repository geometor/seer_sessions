            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis and Python code appear to be correct, despite the erroneous test results previously provided. The `tool_code` execution confirmed that the `transform` function successfully processes all three training examples according to the identified logic: locating a specific two-color segment (head + body) and reversing the position of the single 'head' pixel relative to the 'body' pixels within that segment's boundaries.\n\nThe strategy is to proceed with this confirmed understanding and refine the documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) for clarity and completeness based on the consistent pattern observed across all examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered via `tool_code` execution:\n\n*   **Execution Success:** The provided Python code successfully transformed all three training inputs into their corresponding expected outputs.\n*   **Input Pattern:** All inputs contain a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels.\n*   **Segment Pattern:** Each non-white segment consists of exactly two distinct colors. One color appears once ('head'), and the other appears multiple times ('body'). The 'head' pixel is always located at one of the two ends of the segment.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation consistently involves moving the 'head' pixel to the opposite end of the segment while keeping the 'body' pixels and the segment's overall location unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Record its start index, end index, and extract the segment itself. If no non-white segment is found, return the initial output grid copy.\n3.  **Analyze Segment:**\n    a.  Count the occurrences of each color within the extracted segment.\n    b.  Verify that there are exactly two distinct non-white colors present.\n    c.  Identify the 'head' color as the one that appears exactly once.\n    d.  Identify the 'body' color as the one that appears more than once.\n    e.  Find the index of the 'head' pixel within the segment. Verify it is at one of the ends (index 0 or the last index).\n    f.  If any of these conditions (two colors, one head at an end, one body color) are not met, return the initial output grid copy (as the pattern doesn't match).\n4.  **Construct Transformed Segment:**\n    a.  Create a new array (the transformed segment) of the same length as the original segment.\n    b.  Fill this new array entirely with the 'body' color.\n    c.  Determine the target position for the 'head' pixel: if its original index in the segment was 0, the target index is the last index; if its original index was the last index, the target index is 0.\n    d.  Place the 'head' color into the new array at the calculated target position.\n5.  **Update Output Grid:** Replace the portion of the output grid corresponding to the original segment's location (using the recorded start and end indices) with the newly constructed transformed segment.\n6.  **Return Result:** Return the modified output grid."
