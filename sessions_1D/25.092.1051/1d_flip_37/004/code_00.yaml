task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: colored_segment
    description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the row.
    constraints: Must contain exactly two distinct non-white colors.
    count_per_example: 1
    properties:
      colors: Two distinct non-white colors.
      structure: Composed of two parts based on color frequency within the segment:
        - name: head
          description: A single pixel of the color that appears exactly once in the segment.
          location: Must be located at one of the two ends of the segment.
        - name: body
          description: Multiple contiguous pixels of the color that appears more than once in the segment.
          location: Occupies the rest of the segment adjacent to the head.
      length: Variable (minimum 2 pixels: 1 head + 1 body).
      position: Defined by start and end indices within the row.
actions:
  - name: relocate_head
    object: colored_segment
    description: The head pixel's position is swapped to the opposite end of the segment.
    details:
      - The relative order of the body pixels remains unchanged.
      - The head pixel retains its color.
      - The body pixels retain their color and count.
      - The segment's overall start and end position within the row remains the same.
      - If the head was at the start index, it moves to the end index of the segment.
      - If the head was at the end index, it moves to the start index of the segment.
invariants:
  - The background pixels (white) remain unchanged.
  - The colors used for the head and body remain the same.
  - The number of body pixels (and thus the total segment length) remains the same.
  - The start and end indices of the segment within the row remain the same.
  - Only segments matching the specified structure (contiguous, 2 colors, 1 unique at an end) are transformed; otherwise, the input is returned unchanged.
