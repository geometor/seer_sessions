            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code failed to produce the correct output for any of the training examples. The transformed output was identical to the input in all cases. This suggests a failure either in the logic that identifies the specific pattern required for transformation (causing the function to exit early and return the original grid) or in the step where the modified segment is written back into the output grid.\n\nHowever, a manual trace of the code logic against the examples, along with the metrics gathered below, strongly indicates that the core understanding of the transformation (find a specific two-color segment, identify the unique 'head' pixel at one end, and move it to the other end) is correct and that the examples fit this pattern. The code *should* have identified the pattern and performed the transformation.\n\nThe strategy is to reaffirm the transformation logic based on the consistent pattern observed in the examples and confirmed by the metrics. The YAML facts and Natural Language Program will be refined for clarity and precision, assuming the core logic previously identified is correct and the execution failure was due to an implementation detail or environment issue.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by analyzing the input grids of the training examples:\n"
