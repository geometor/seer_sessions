*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids are single rows.
    *   Each input grid contains a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
    *   Within this non-white sequence, the first pixel has a unique color, and the subsequent pixels all share a different, repeating color.
    *   The transformation modifies only the non-white sequence.
    *   The first pixel of the non-white sequence is moved to the end of that sequence. The rest of the sequence shifts one position to the left to fill the gap.
    *   Alternatively, the transformation can be seen as swapping the first and the last pixels within the contiguous non-white sequence.

*   **Facts:**

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation pattern: swapping the first and last elements of the contiguous non-white sequence within the single-row grid. The provided natural language program accurately describes this logic.

The errors reported during execution ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly suggest that the input grid is being passed to the `transform` function as a NumPy array, not a standard Python list of lists as perhaps initially assumed by the check `if not input_grid:`. This check fails for non-empty NumPy arrays.

The strategy is to adjust the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, specifically the initial checks for validity, while retaining the core transformation logic which appears sound based on the examples.

## Metrics

Let's verify the sequence boundaries and values for each example:

Analysis Example 1:
{'input': [0, 0, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'non_white_indices': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 11, 'start_value': 7, 'end_value': 3, 'is_contiguous': True, 'sequence_length': 10}

Analysis Example 2:
{'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], 'non_white_indices': [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 22, 'start_value': 4, 'end_value': 2, 'is_contiguous': True, 'sequence_length': 9}

```
The metrics confirm:
1.  All examples contain a single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
2.  The sequence lengths are 10, 9, and 10 respectively.
3.  The identified start/end indices and values correspond exactly to the pixels that need swapping to achieve the desired output.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_format: Expected to be numpy array (shape (1, N)) or list of lists representation of a single row.
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: Pixels outside the contiguous non-white sequence. They remain unchanged.
  - type: sequence
    color: non-white
    location: A single contiguous block (horizontal segment) of non-white pixels within the row.
    properties:
      - Contains at least two pixels (implicit from examples where a swap occurs).
      - Bounded by white pixels (color 0) or grid edges.
actions:
  - action: conditional_swap
    target: The identified contiguous non-white sequence.
    condition: Sequence must contain at least two pixels.
    effect: Swap the color value of the first pixel in the sequence with the color value of the last pixel in the sequence. All other pixels (background and intermediate sequence pixels) remain unchanged in their positions and colors.
relationships:
  - The non-white sequence is always contiguous.
  - Only the first and last pixels of the non-white sequence change their color values (they swap).
  - All pixel positions remain fixed; only the colors at the start and end positions of the non-white sequence are exchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Identify the indices of all non-white pixels (pixels with color values other than 0).
3.  If there are fewer than two non-white pixels, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  Determine the start index (minimum index) and end index (maximum index) of the contiguous block formed by these non-white pixels. (This assumes there's only one such block, as seen in the examples).
5.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
6.  Swap the pixel values at the start index and the end index in the output row.
7.  Return the modified row, formatted as a grid (list containing the single output row).
