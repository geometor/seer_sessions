Identifies the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the single-row input grid.
Swaps the color value of the first pixel in this sequence with the color value of the last pixel in the sequence.
Keeps all other pixels (background white pixels and intermediate sequence pixels) unchanged.
If no non-white sequence is found, or the sequence has only one pixel, returns the input grid unchanged.
