task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_format: Expected to be numpy array (shape (1, N)) or list of lists representation of a single row.
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: Pixels outside the contiguous non-white sequence. They remain unchanged.
  - type: sequence
    color: non-white
    location: A single contiguous block (horizontal segment) of non-white pixels within the row.
    properties:
      - Contains at least two pixels (implicit from examples where a swap occurs).
      - Bounded by white pixels (color 0) or grid edges.
actions:
  - action: conditional_swap
    target: The identified contiguous non-white sequence.
    condition: Sequence must contain at least two pixels.
    effect: Swap the color value of the first pixel in the sequence with the color value of the last pixel in the sequence. All other pixels (background and intermediate sequence pixels) remain unchanged in their positions and colors.
relationships:
  - The non-white sequence is always contiguous.
  - Only the first and last pixels of the non-white sequence change their color values (they swap).
  - All pixel positions remain fixed; only the colors at the start and end positions of the non-white sequence are exchanged.
