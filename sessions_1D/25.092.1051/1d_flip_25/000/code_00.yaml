task_description: Swap the position of a unique singleton pixel with the last pixel of an adjacent block.
grid_properties:
  flattened_length: 20
  background_color: 0 # white
  likely_dimensions: [4, 5] # height, width
objects:
  - id: singleton
    description: A single pixel whose color appears only once in the grid (excluding background).
    properties:
      color: Varies (5, 6, 4 in examples)
      size: 1 pixel
      count: 1
  - id: block
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color, adjacent to the singleton.
    properties:
      color: Varies (6, 8, 8 in examples), different from the singleton color and background.
      size: >1 pixel
      count: 1 (per example)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: singleton
    to: block
    details: The singleton pixel shares at least one edge or corner with a pixel from the block.
actions:
  - name: identify_singleton
    inputs: grid
    outputs: singleton_pixel (color, location)
  - name: identify_adjacent_block
    inputs: grid, singleton_pixel
    outputs: block_pixels (color, locations)
  - name: find_last_block_pixel
    inputs: block_pixels
    outputs: last_block_pixel (location)
    details: Determine the location of the pixel within the block that comes last in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
  - name: swap_pixels
    inputs: grid, singleton_pixel, last_block_pixel
    outputs: modified_grid
    details: Exchange the colors at the location of the singleton_pixel and the last_block_pixel.
