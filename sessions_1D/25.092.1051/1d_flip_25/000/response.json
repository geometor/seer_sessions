            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data appear to be flattened representations of 2D grids. The length of the arrays is 20, suggesting possible dimensions like 4x5 or 5x4. Based on how the colors group, a 4x5 grid seems plausible.\n2.  **Colors & Objects:** Each grid contains a background color (white, 0). There are two primary objects of interest:\n    *   A single pixel of a unique color (gray 5 in ex 1, magenta 6 in ex 2, yellow 4 in ex 3). Let's call this the \"singleton\".\n    *   A larger contiguous block of pixels of another color (magenta 6 in ex 1, azure 8 in ex 2, azure 8 in ex 3). Let's call this the \"block\".\n3.  **Relationship:** The singleton pixel is always spatially adjacent (sharing an edge or corner) to the block.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves a position swap. The singleton pixel moves to the location occupied by the *last* pixel of the block (when scanning the grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Conversely, the pixel originally at that last position of the block moves to the original location of the singleton pixel. The colors of the swapped pixels are maintained (i.e., the singleton's color moves to the new location, and the block's color moves to the singleton's original location).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the \"block\" pixels: Find all contiguous pixels that share the same color (different from the singleton and background) and are adjacent (sharing an edge or corner) to the singleton pixel.\n4.  Determine the \"last block pixel\": Among the identified block pixels, find the one that appears last when scanning the grid row by row, from top to bottom, and within each row, column by column, from left to right. Record its location.\n5.  Perform the swap: Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Then, change the color of the pixel at the singleton's original location to the color of the block. Change the color of the pixel at the last block pixel's location to the color of the singleton.\n6.  Flatten the modified 2D grid back into a 1D array for the final output."
