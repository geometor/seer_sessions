Reshape the input 1D array into a 2D grid (assuming 4 rows, 5 columns based on the length 20 and example structures).\n2. Identify the \"singleton\" pixel: Find the pixel whose color value (excluding background 0) appears exactly once in the grid. Record its color and location.\n3. Identify the color of the adjacent \"block\": Find the color of any neighbor (8-connectivity) of the singleton pixel that is not the background color (0) and not the singleton's color.\n4. Find the \"last block pixel\": Scan the grid row by row (top to bottom), then column by column (left to right), and identify the location of the very last pixel encountered that has the block color.\n5. Swap pixels: Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Set the pixel at the singleton's original location to the block's color. Set the pixel at the last block pixel's location to the singleton's color.\n6.
