            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (swapping a unique singleton pixel with the last pixel of an adjacent block) appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples. The failure reported (\"Input grid length is not 20\") strongly suggests that the `transform` function was not receiving the input as a simple flat list of 20 integers as initially assumed from the problem description's raw data format. Instead, the testing environment likely passed the input as a pre-formed 2D structure (e.g., a list of lists or a NumPy array). The hardcoded length check `len(input_grid_flat) != 20` and the subsequent `reshape` operation failed because the input `input_grid_flat` was already a 2D structure, and its `len()` would return the number of rows, not the total number of elements.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the `transform` function to:\n1.  Accept the input as a 2D structure (assuming NumPy array for convenience, as used in the previous code).\n2.  Remove the check for a flattened length of 20.\n3.  Remove the explicit `reshape` call.\n4.  Determine the grid dimensions directly from the input structure's shape.\n5.  Ensure the final output is flattened back into a simple list.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
