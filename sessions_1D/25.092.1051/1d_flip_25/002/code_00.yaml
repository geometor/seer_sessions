task_description: Swap the position of a unique singleton pixel with the last pixel (in reading order) of an adjacent block within a 2D grid.
grid_properties:
  dimensions: Variable (determined from the input structure, e.g., 4x5 in training examples).
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - id: singleton
    description: A single pixel whose color appears only once in the grid (excluding background).
    properties:
      color: Varies (5, 6, 4 in examples)
      size: 1 pixel
      count: 1
  - id: block
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color (different from singleton and background), at least one of which is adjacent to the singleton.
    properties:
      color: Varies (6, 8, 8 in examples)
      size: >1 pixel
      count: 1 (per example)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: singleton
    to: block
    details: The singleton pixel shares at least one edge or corner (8-connectivity) with a pixel from the block.
actions:
  - name: identify_grid_dimensions
    inputs: input_grid_structure
    outputs: height, width
  - name: identify_singleton
    inputs: grid (2D)
    outputs: singleton_pixel (color, location)
  - name: identify_adjacent_block_color
    inputs: grid (2D), singleton_pixel
    outputs: block_color
    details: Find the color of a non-background, non-singleton neighbor of the singleton.
  - name: find_last_block_pixel
    inputs: grid (2D), block_color
    outputs: last_block_pixel (location)
    details: Determine the location (row, column) of the pixel with the block_color that comes last in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
  - name: swap_pixels
    inputs: grid (2D), singleton_pixel, last_block_pixel, block_color
    outputs: modified_grid (2D)
    details: Create a copy of the input grid. Set the color at the singleton's original location to the block_color. Set the color at the last_block_pixel's location to the singleton's color.

    inputs: modified_grid (2D)
    outputs: output_list (1D)
