*   **Perception:**
    *   The input consists of a 1D array (or a 1xN grid) containing mostly white pixels (0).
    *   There are two non-white elements present:
        1.  A single pixel of one color (the "marker"). In the examples, this is green (3) or azure (8).
        2.  A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of another color (the "block"). In the examples, this is blue (1) or red (2).
    *   The marker pixel is always located immediately to the left of the block.
    *   The transformation involves moving the marker pixel from its original position to the position immediately to the right of the block.
    *   The block itself remains unchanged in position and color.
    *   The pixel at the original marker position becomes white (0).

## Example 3:

## General Assessment

The previous code failed on all training examples with a NumPy boolean ambiguity error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the input type checking logic within the `transform` function is encountering an unexpected input type, likely a NumPy array instead of the anticipated list of lists, specifically triggering the error at the `elif input_grid and ...` check.

The core logic for identifying the marker pixel and the adjacent block, as implemented in `find_marker_and_block_1d`, appears sound based on the examples and manual verification using the code execution tool.

The strategy is to simplify the `transform` function, assuming the input is consistently provided as a NumPy array (specifically a 2D array with shape 1xN). This eliminates the need for complex type checking and conversion, directly addressing the source of the error. The function will extract the single row, apply the transformation logic using the existing `find_marker_and_block_1d` helper, and return the modified grid in the same format.

## Metrics

Code execution was used to verify the input shapes and the results of the marker/block finding logic:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (1, 23)
    *   Marker Color: 3 (green)
    *   Marker Index: 5
    *   Block End Index: 13
    *   New Marker Index: 14
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (1, 23)
    *   Marker Color: 8 (azure)
    *   Marker Index: 13
    *   Block End Index: 20
    *   New Marker Index: 21
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (1, 23)
    *   Marker Color: 8 (azure)
    *   Marker Index: 12
    *   Block End Index: 17
    *   New Marker Index: 18

The finding logic correctly identifies the components needed for the transformation in all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid (assumed to be a 1xN NumPy array).
2.  Extract the single row from the input grid.
3.  Scan the row to find the unique "marker" pixel pattern: a non-white pixel (`marker_color` at `marker_index`) that is either at the beginning of the row or preceded by white (0), and immediately followed by a block of one or more pixels of a *different* non-white color (`block_color`).
4.  Determine the index of the last pixel in this adjacent `block_color` sequence (`block_end_index`).
5.  Verify that the pixel immediately following the block (`block_end_index + 1`) is either white (0) or the end of the row. If this pattern (marker + block + boundary) is not found, return the original input grid.
6.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
7.  Modify the output grid:
    a.  Set the pixel at the original marker position (`0`, `marker_index`) to white (0).
    b.  Set the pixel at the position immediately following the block (`0`, `block_end_index + 1`) to the `marker_color`.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
