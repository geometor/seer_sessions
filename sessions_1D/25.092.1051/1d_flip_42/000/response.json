A single pixel of one color (the \"marker\"). In the examples, this is green (3) or azure (8).\n        2.  A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of another color (the \"block\"). In the examples, this is blue (1) or red (2).\n    *   The marker pixel is always located immediately to the left of the block.\n    *   The transformation involves moving the marker pixel from its original position to the position immediately to the right of the block.\n    *   The block itself remains unchanged in position and color.\n    *   The pixel at the original marker position becomes white (0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
