            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed on all training examples with a NumPy boolean ambiguity error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the input type checking logic within the `transform` function is encountering an unexpected input type, likely a NumPy array instead of the anticipated list of lists, specifically triggering the error at the `elif input_grid and ...` check.\n\nThe core logic for identifying the marker pixel and the adjacent block, as implemented in `find_marker_and_block_1d`, appears sound based on the examples and manual verification using the code execution tool.\n\nThe strategy is to simplify the `transform` function, assuming the input is consistently provided as a NumPy array (specifically a 2D array with shape 1xN). This eliminates the need for complex type checking and conversion, directly addressing the source of the error. The function will extract the single row, apply the transformation logic using the existing `find_marker_and_block_1d` helper, and return the modified grid in the same format.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCode execution was used to verify the input shapes and the results of the marker/block finding logic:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (1, 23)\n    *   Marker Color: 3 (green)\n    *   Marker Index: 5\n    *   Block End Index: 13\n    *   New Marker Index: 14\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (1, 23)\n    *   Marker Color: 8 (azure)\n    *   Marker Index: 13\n    *   Block End Index: 20\n    *   New Marker Index: 21\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (1, 23)\n    *   Marker Color: 8 (azure)\n    *   Marker Index: 12\n    *   Block End Index: 17\n    *   New Marker Index: 18\n\nThe finding logic correctly identifies the components needed for the transformation in all examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
