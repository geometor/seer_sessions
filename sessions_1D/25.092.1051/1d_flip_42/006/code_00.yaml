task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN
objects:
  - type: marker_pixel
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white (distinct from block color)
      - size: 1 pixel
      - initial_position: immediately precedes the block, must be preceded by white(0) or grid start.
  - type: color_block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white (distinct from marker color)
      - shape: contiguous horizontal line
      - size: variable length (>= 1 pixel)
      - initial_position: immediately follows the marker, must be followed by white(0) or grid end.
background: white (0)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: marker_pixel
    object2: color_block
    details: marker is immediately left-adjacent to the block in the input.
  - type: boundary_conditions
    details: The marker-block pattern must be surrounded by white(0) pixels or grid boundaries.
actions:
  - action: swap_positions # More accurately describes the movement
    object1: marker_pixel
    object2: color_block
    details: |
      The block shifts one position to the left, starting at the marker's original index.
      The marker moves to the position immediately following the block's original end index.
