            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core components: a single \"marker\" pixel and an adjacent \"block\" of pixels of a different color, both distinct from the background (white). It also correctly identified that the marker moves to the position immediately following the block. However, comparing the transformed output with the expected output reveals a consistent error across all examples: the block of pixels *also* shifts one position to the left, effectively swapping positions with the original marker. The original code only moved the marker and cleared its original position, leaving the block stationary.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to update the transformation logic to include the leftward shift of the block, placing its first pixel where the marker originally was.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's re-examine the examples to confirm the marker and block positions and the transformation details.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Marker: color `3` at index `5`.\n    *   Block: color `1`, starts at index `6`, ends at index `13` (length 8).\n    *   Pattern: `[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` from index 5 to 13.\n*   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Block: color `1`, starts at index `5`, ends at index `12` (shifted left by 1).\n    *   Marker: color `3` at index `13` (position immediately after the *original* block end index).\n    *   Pattern: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]` from index 5 to 13.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]`\n    *   Marker: color `8` at index `13`.\n    *   Block: color `2`, starts at index `14`, ends at index `20` (length 7).\n    *   Pattern: `[8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` from index 13 to 20.\n*   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]`\n    *   Block: color `2`, starts at index `13`, ends at index `19` (shifted left by 1).\n    *   Marker: color `8` at index `20` (position immediately after the *original* block end index).\n    *   Pattern: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8]` from index 13 to 20.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Marker: color `8` at index `12`.\n    *   Block: color `2`, starts at index `13`, ends at index `17` (length 5).\n    *   Pattern: `[8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` from index 12 to 17.\n*   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Block: color `2`, starts at index `12`, ends at index `16` (shifted left by 1).\n    *   Marker: color `8` at index `17` (position immediately after the *original* block end index).\n    *   Pattern: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8]` from index 12 to 17.\n\n**Observation Confirmation:** The transformation involves swapping the marker pixel and the adjacent block. The block takes the marker's original position and shifts left, while the marker moves to the position immediately following the block's original end position. The total span occupied by the marker and block remains the same, but their internal order is reversed.\n\n## Updated Facts\n\n"

Verify the boundary conditions: the marker must be preceded by white (0) or be at the start of the array, and the block must be followed by white (0) or be at the end of the array.\n3.  If the unique pattern with correct boundaries is found:\n    a.  Record the marker's color and its index (`marker_index`).\n    b.  Record the block's color and the index of its last pixel (`block_end_index`).\n    c.  Calculate the length of the block (`block_length = block_end_index - marker_index`).\n    d.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output.\n    e.  Place the entire block into the output array, starting at the `marker_index` and extending for `block_length` positions.\n    f.  Place the marker's color into the output array at the position immediately following the *original* end of the block (`block_end_index + 1`).\n4.
