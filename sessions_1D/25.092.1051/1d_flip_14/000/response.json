Let's call this the \"singleton\" color.\n    *   The other color appears multiple times consecutively (e.g., gray(5) in train\\_1, magenta(6) in train\\_2, green(3) in train\\_3). Let's call this the \"repeated\" color.\n*   In all provided examples, the singleton color appears at the beginning of the non-white block in the input.\n*   The transformation involves moving the singleton color to the end of the non-white block and shifting the repeated color block one step towards the beginning. Essentially, the singleton pixel swaps places with the entire block of repeated color pixels.\n*   The white pixels surrounding the non-white block remain unchanged in their position and color.\n*   The overall length of the row and the length of the non-white block remain the same.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
