Task: Swap singleton color with repeated color block within a 1D sequence.

Elements:
  - Type: Pixel Grid (represented as 1D array/row)
  - Properties:
      - Contains white pixels (color 0).
      - Contains a contiguous block of non-white pixels.

Objects:
  - Object: Non-white block
    - Properties:
        - Contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
        - Bounded by white pixels (or grid edges, though not shown here).
        - Composed of exactly two distinct non-white colors.
  - Object: Singleton pixel
    - Properties:
        - A single pixel within the non-white block.
        - Has a color that appears only once in the non-white block.
        - In examples, located at the start of the non-white block.
  - Object: Repeated color block
    - Properties:
        - A contiguous sequence of pixels within the non-white block.
        - All pixels have the same color.
        - This color appears multiple times consecutively.
        - Occupies the rest of the non-white block besides the singleton pixel.

Relationships:
  - The singleton pixel is adjacent to one end of the repeated color block.
  - The non-white block is a sub-segment of the entire row.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the non-white block.
  - Identify: Within the non-white block, find the singleton color/pixel and the repeated color/block.
  - Transform: Swap the position of the singleton pixel with the entire repeated color block.
  - Preserve: Keep the surrounding white pixels unchanged.

Result:
  - The output row has the same dimensions and surrounding white pixels as the input.
  - The non-white block in the output contains the same pixels as the input's non-white block, but the singleton pixel and the repeated color block have swapped positions.
