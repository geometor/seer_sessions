Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are single rows of pixels (1D arrays).
*   Each row contains a sequence of white pixels (0), followed by a block of non-white pixels, followed by more white pixels (0).
*   The non-white block consists of two distinct colors:
    *   One color appears only once within the block (e.g., yellow(4) in train\_1, blue(1) in train\_2, azure(8) in train\_3). Let's call this the "singleton" color.
    *   The other color appears multiple times consecutively (e.g., gray(5) in train\_1, magenta(6) in train\_2, green(3) in train\_3). Let's call this the "repeated" color.
*   In all provided examples, the singleton color appears at the beginning of the non-white block in the input.
*   The transformation involves moving the singleton color to the end of the non-white block and shifting the repeated color block one step towards the beginning. Essentially, the singleton pixel swaps places with the entire block of repeated color pixels.
*   The white pixels surrounding the non-white block remain unchanged in their position and color.
*   The overall length of the row and the length of the non-white block remain the same.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Swap singleton color with repeated color block within a 1D sequence.

Elements:
  - Type: Pixel Grid (represented as 1D array/row)
  - Properties:
      - Contains white pixels (color 0).
      - Contains a contiguous block of non-white pixels.

Objects:
  - Object: Non-white block
    - Properties:
        - Contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
        - Bounded by white pixels (or grid edges, though not shown here).
        - Composed of exactly two distinct non-white colors.
  - Object: Singleton pixel
    - Properties:
        - A single pixel within the non-white block.
        - Has a color that appears only once in the non-white block.
        - In examples, located at the start of the non-white block.
  - Object: Repeated color block
    - Properties:
        - A contiguous sequence of pixels within the non-white block.
        - All pixels have the same color.
        - This color appears multiple times consecutively.
        - Occupies the rest of the non-white block besides the singleton pixel.

Relationships:
  - The singleton pixel is adjacent to one end of the repeated color block.
  - The non-white block is a sub-segment of the entire row.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the non-white block.
  - Identify: Within the non-white block, find the singleton color/pixel and the repeated color/block.
  - Transform: Swap the position of the singleton pixel with the entire repeated color block.
  - Preserve: Keep the surrounding white pixels unchanged.

Result:
  - The output row has the same dimensions and surrounding white pixels as the input.
  - The non-white block in the output contains the same pixels as the input's non-white block, but the singleton pixel and the repeated color block have swapped positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input row to find the contiguous segment of non-white pixels. Note the starting and ending indices of this segment.
2.  Analyze the colors within this non-white segment. Identify the color that appears only once (the singleton color) and the color that appears multiple times consecutively (the repeated color). Store the singleton color value and the repeated color value. Also, note the length of the repeated color block.
3.  Determine the position of the singleton pixel within the non-white segment (start or end). In the provided examples, it's always at the start.
4.  Create the output row by copying the input row.
5.  Modify the non-white segment in the output row:
    *   If the singleton pixel was at the start of the segment in the input, place the repeated color block at the start of the segment in the output, followed immediately by the singleton pixel.
    *   (Implicitly, if the singleton pixel were at the end of the segment in the input, place the singleton pixel at the start of the segment in the output, followed immediately by the repeated color block).
6.  Ensure the pixels outside the non-white segment (the leading and trailing white pixels) remain unchanged.
