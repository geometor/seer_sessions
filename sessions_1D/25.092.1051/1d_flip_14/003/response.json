Handle potential input format variations: If the input is a list containing a single list (e.g., [[0, 0, 4,...]]), extract the inner list.\n2. Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels (colors > 0) within the input row.\n3. Within this segment, identify the 'singleton' color (appears once) and the 'repeated' color (appears multiple times consecutively).\n4. Swap the position of the singleton pixel with the block of repeated color pixels.\n   - If the singleton is at the start of the segment, move it to the end, placing the repeated block first.\n   - If the singleton is at the end of the segment, move it to the start, placing the singleton first.\n5. Keep the surrounding white pixels (color 0) unchanged.\n6. Return the modified row as a list.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport copy # Used for deep copying if needed, though numpy copy is sufficient here\n\ndef find_non_white_segment_indices(grid_1d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start and end indices of the first contiguous non-white segment\n    in a 1D list or NumPy array.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_1d: A 1D list or NumPy array representing a row of pixels.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (start_index, end_index) if a segment is found,\n        otherwise (None, None).\n    \"\"\"\n    start_index = -1\n    end_index = -1\n    # Find the first non-zero pixel for the start index\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid_1d):\n        if pixel != 0:\n            start_index = i\n            break\n    # If no non-zero pixel found, return None\n    if start_index == -1:\n        return None, None\n\n    # Find the last non-zero pixel for the end index\n    for i in range(len(grid_1d) - 1, start_index - 1, -1):\n         if grid_1d[i] != 0:\n             # Check if the segment is contiguous\n             is_contiguous = True\n             for j in range(start_index, i + 1):\n                 if grid_1d[j] == 0:\n                     is_contiguous = False\n                     break # Found a zero within the potential segment\n             if is_contiguous:\n                 end_index = i\n                 break # Found the last non-zero of a contiguous block\n             else:\n                 # If not contiguous here, it means we encountered a zero.\n                 # We need to reset the search for the end index from before the zero.\n                 # However, the current logic implicitly handles finding the *first* contiguous block.\n                 # If the requirement was *any* such block, logic would need adjustment.\n                 # For this specific task structure, the first non-zero and last non-zero\n                 # correctly define the single segment seen in examples.\n                 pass # Continue loop backwards to find the true end of the first segment.\n\n\n    # The examples show only one segment, so finding the first non-zero (start_idx)\n    # and the last non-zero (end_idx) is sufficient, assuming contiguity.
