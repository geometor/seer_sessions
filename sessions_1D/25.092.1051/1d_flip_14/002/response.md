**Assessment and Strategy**

The execution results indicate a consistent error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This NumPy error typically arises when attempting to use an array in a context requiring a single boolean value, such as an `if` condition.

Given the code structure, the most likely cause is that the input `input_grid` is being treated as a 2D array (specifically, a 1xN array or list of lists `[[...]]`) instead of the assumed 1D list `[...]`. When `grid_1d = np.array(input_grid)` is called with a `[[...]]` input, `grid_1d` becomes a 2D array. Consequently, slicing it like `segment = grid_1d[start_idx : end_idx + 1]` might still result in a 2D array slice, and accessing `segment[0]` could return the first *row* of that slice (which is an array), leading to the error when comparing it (`segment[0] == singleton_color`).

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle a potential 1xN input format by extracting the first row at the beginning.
2.  Use `tool_code` to verify the structure of the input examples and the properties of the identified segments (start/end indices, colors, counts).
3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on confirmed structure and logic. The core logic of identifying the non-white segment, finding the singleton and repeated colors, and swapping them appears correct based on the visual examples, but the implementation needs adjustment for the input format.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

The metrics confirm:

1.  The inputs provided in the prompt *are* 1D lists.
2.  Converting them to NumPy arrays results in 1D arrays (shape `(N,)`).
3.  The `find_non_white_segment_indices` function correctly identifies the start and end of the non-white segments.
4.  The extracted segments contain exactly one singleton color and one repeated color.
5.  In all training examples, the singleton color is at the *start* of the segment.
6.  Accessing `segment[0]` yields a single integer value, as expected.

Conclusion: The error encountered during execution was likely *not* due to the input data format being 2D, nor the core logic of segment identification or color counting within the provided code snippet. The error must stem from how the `transform` function was *called* or integrated within the testing environment, potentially wrapping the 1D list input into a 1xN list of lists `[[...]]` before passing it to the function.

Assuming the `transform` function *will* receive a 1D list as input (consistent with the prompt examples), the original code *should* work. However, to be robust against accidental wrapping (e.g., `[[0, 0, 4, ...]]`), explicitly handling the potential 1xN case is safer. We will add a check and extraction step.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Task: Swap a unique pixel with a block of repeating pixels within a 1D sequence.

Input_Format: 1D list of integers (pixels). May sometimes be wrapped in a list `[[...]]`.

Output_Format: 1D list of integers (pixels), same length as input.

Grid_Properties:
  - Primarily composed of white pixels (0).
  - Contains exactly one contiguous segment of non-white pixels.

Objects:
  - Object: Non-white Segment
    - Type: Contiguous sub-list of the input list.
    - Properties:
      - All pixel values > 0.
      - Bounded by white pixels (0) or list boundaries.
      - Composed of exactly two distinct non-white colors.
  - Object: Singleton Pixel
    - Type: A single pixel (integer value) within the Non-white Segment.
    - Properties:
      - Its color appears exactly once within the Non-white Segment.
      - Located at one end of the Non-white Segment (specifically, at the start in all training examples).
  - Object: Repeated Color Block
    - Type: A contiguous sub-list within the Non-white Segment.
    - Properties:
      - All pixels have the same color.
      - This color appears more than once within the Non-white Segment.
      - Occupies the remainder of the Non-white Segment adjacent to the Singleton Pixel.

Relationships:
  - The Singleton Pixel is adjacent to one end of the Repeated Color Block within the Non-white Segment.
  - The Non-white Segment is a sub-list located between segments of white pixels (0).

Actions:
  - Pre-process: If input is a list containing a single list `[[...]]`, extract the inner list `[...]`.
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the Non-white Segment.
  - Analyze: Within the Non-white Segment, identify the Singleton Pixel's color and the Repeated Color Block's color.
  - Transform: Create a new Non-white Segment where the positions of the Singleton Pixel and the Repeated Color Block are swapped.
    - If the Singleton was at the start, the new segment starts with the Repeated Color Block followed by the Singleton Pixel.
    - (Hypothetical: If the Singleton were at the end, the new segment would start with the Singleton Pixel followed by the Repeated Color Block).
  - Reconstruct: Create the output list by replacing the original Non-white Segment in the input list with the transformed segment, keeping all white pixels (0) in their original positions.

Result:
  - The output list mirrors the input list, except the Singleton Pixel and the Repeated Color Block within the Non-white Segment have swapped places.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Check if the input `grid` is a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[0, 0, 4, ...]]`). If so, extract the inner list as the primary data row. Otherwise, use the input grid directly as the data row.
2.  Scan the data row to find the start and end indices of the contiguous segment containing only non-white pixels (pixels with values > 0). If no such segment exists or it has fewer than two pixels, return a copy of the original data row.
3.  Extract this non-white segment.
4.  Count the occurrences of each color within the segment. Identify the color that appears exactly once (the "singleton color") and the color that appears multiple times (the "repeated color"). If this pattern (exactly one singleton, exactly one repeated color) is not found, return a copy of the original data row.
5.  Determine if the singleton color is located at the start or the end of the segment.
6.  Construct the transformed segment:
    *   If the singleton color was at the start of the original segment, create the new segment by placing a block of the repeated color first, followed by the singleton color pixel. The length of the repeated block should be `segment length - 1`.
    *   If the singleton color was at the end of the original segment, create the new segment by placing the singleton color pixel first, followed by a block of the repeated color. The length of the repeated block should be `segment length - 1`.
7.  Create the final output row by taking a copy of the original data row and replacing the pixels from the start index to the end index (inclusive) with the pixels from the transformed segment.
8.  Return the final output row.
