Task: Swap a unique pixel with a block of repeating pixels within a 1D sequence.

Input_Format: 1D list of integers (pixels). May sometimes be wrapped in a list `[[...]]`.

Output_Format: 1D list of integers (pixels), same length as input.

Grid_Properties:
  - Primarily composed of white pixels (0).
  - Contains exactly one contiguous segment of non-white pixels.

Objects:
  - Object: Non-white Segment
    - Type: Contiguous sub-list of the input list.
    - Properties:
      - All pixel values > 0.
      - Bounded by white pixels (0) or list boundaries.
      - Composed of exactly two distinct non-white colors.
  - Object: Singleton Pixel
    - Type: A single pixel (integer value) within the Non-white Segment.
    - Properties:
      - Its color appears exactly once within the Non-white Segment.
      - Located at one end of the Non-white Segment (specifically, at the start in all training examples).
  - Object: Repeated Color Block
    - Type: A contiguous sub-list within the Non-white Segment.
    - Properties:
      - All pixels have the same color.
      - This color appears more than once within the Non-white Segment.
      - Occupies the remainder of the Non-white Segment adjacent to the Singleton Pixel.

Relationships:
  - The Singleton Pixel is adjacent to one end of the Repeated Color Block within the Non-white Segment.
  - The Non-white Segment is a sub-list located between segments of white pixels (0).

Actions:
  - Pre-process: If input is a list containing a single list `[[...]]`, extract the inner list `[...]`.
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the Non-white Segment.
  - Analyze: Within the Non-white Segment, identify the Singleton Pixel's color and the Repeated Color Block's color.
  - Transform: Create a new Non-white Segment where the positions of the Singleton Pixel and the Repeated Color Block are swapped.
    - If the Singleton was at the start, the new segment starts with the Repeated Color Block followed by the Singleton Pixel.
    - (Hypothetical: If the Singleton were at the end, the new segment would start with the Singleton Pixel followed by the Repeated Color Block).
  - Reconstruct: Create the output list by replacing the original Non-white Segment in the input list with the transformed segment, keeping all white pixels (0) in their original positions.

Result:
  - The output list mirrors the input list, except the Singleton Pixel and the Repeated Color Block within the Non-white Segment have swapped places.
