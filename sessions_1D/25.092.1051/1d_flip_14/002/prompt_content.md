Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels (colors > 0) within the input row.
2. Within this segment, identify the 'singleton' color (appears once) and the 'repeated' color (appears multiple times consecutively).
3. Swap the position of the singleton pixel with the block of repeated color pixels.
   - If the singleton is at the start of the segment, move it to the end.
   - If the singleton is at the end of the segment, move it to the start.
4. Keep the surrounding white pixels (color 0) unchanged.
