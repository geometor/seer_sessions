            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe execution results indicate a consistent error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This NumPy error typically arises when attempting to use an array in a context requiring a single boolean value, such as an `if` condition.\n\nGiven the code structure, the most likely cause is that the input `input_grid` is being treated as a 2D array (specifically, a 1xN array or list of lists `[[...]]`) instead of the assumed 1D list `[...]`. When `grid_1d = np.array(input_grid)` is called with a `[[...]]` input, `grid_1d` becomes a 2D array. Consequently, slicing it like `segment = grid_1d[start_idx : end_idx + 1]` might still result in a 2D array slice, and accessing `segment[0]` could return the first *row* of that slice (which is an array), leading to the error when comparing it (`segment[0] == singleton_color`).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle a potential 1xN input format by extracting the first row at the beginning.\n2.  Use `tool_code` to verify the structure of the input examples and the properties of the identified segments (start/end indices, colors, counts).\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on confirmed structure and logic. The core logic of identifying the non-white segment, finding the singleton and repeated colors, and swapping them appears correct based on the visual examples, but the implementation needs adjustment for the input format.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"

Converting them to NumPy arrays results in 1D arrays (shape `(N,)`).\n3.  The `find_non_white_segment_indices` function correctly identifies the start and end of the non-white segments.\n4.  The extracted segments contain exactly one singleton color and one repeated color.\n5.  In all training examples, the singleton color is at the *start* of the segment.\n6.  Accessing `segment[0]` yields a single integer value, as expected.\n\nConclusion: The error encountered during execution was likely *not* due to the input data format being 2D, nor the core logic of segment identification or color counting within the provided code snippet. The error must stem from how the `transform` function was *called* or integrated within the testing environment, potentially wrapping the 1D list input into a 1xN list of lists `[[...]]` before passing it to the function.\n\nAssuming the `transform` function *will* receive a 1D list as input (consistent with the prompt examples), the original code *should* work. However, to be robust against accidental wrapping (e.g., `[[0, 0, 4, ...]]`), explicitly handling the potential 1xN case is safer. We will add a check and extraction step.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
