This sequence appears to be the main object of interest.\n4.  **Object Structure:** Within this non-white sequence, there are two distinct parts:\n    *   A single \"head\" pixel at the beginning of the sequence (leftmost in the 1D representation).\n    *   A contiguous \"body\" sequence of pixels immediately following the head, all having the same color, which is different from the head's color.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the pixels within this non-white sequence. Specifically, the \"head\" pixel is moved from the start of the sequence to the end of the sequence. The \"body\" pixels shift one position to the left to occupy the space vacated by the head. The background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
