task_description: Rearrange pixels within a specific sequence structure found in a 1D grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: Primarily 1D (or single rows).
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - type: sequence
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels.
    properties:
      - structure: Composed of a 'head' pixel and a 'body' sequence.
      - head:
          - count: 1
          - position: Start (leftmost) of the sequence.
          - color: Distinct from the body color.
      - body:
          - count: Variable (>= 1)
          - position: Immediately follows the head pixel.
          - color: Uniform color, different from the head color.
          - contiguity: Forms a single block.

actions:
  - name: identify_sequence
    description: Locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - name: identify_components
    description: Distinguish the 'head' pixel from the 'body' sequence within the non-white block.
  - name: relocate_head
    description: Move the 'head' pixel from the start to the end of the sequence space.
  - name: shift_body
    description: Move the 'body' sequence one position towards the original start (left) to fill the gap left by the head.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The head pixel is initially adjacent to the start of the body sequence.
  - type: order_change
    description: The relative order of the head and body is reversed in the output compared to the input. Head moves from before the body to after the body.

constraints:
  - The transformation only applies if the identified non-white sequence has a single head pixel followed by a body sequence of uniform color different from the head.
  - The background remains unchanged.
