**Perception:**

The input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers representing colors. The transformation appears to operate on a specific segment of the array containing non-zero values, leaving the surrounding zero values (white pixels) unchanged. Within the non-zero segment, there are always two distinct non-zero colors present: one color appears as a single pixel (the "singleton"), and the other appears as a contiguous block of multiple pixels (the "block"). The core transformation is the swapping of the relative positions of the singleton pixel and the block of pixels.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the start and end indices of the contiguous segment containing non-zero pixels in the input array.
2.  Extract this non-zero segment.
3.  Within the extracted segment, count the occurrences of each unique non-zero color.
4.  Identify the color that appears exactly once; this is the 'singleton' color.
5.  Identify the color that appears multiple times; this constitutes the 'block' color and its associated pixels.
6.  Create a new segment by placing the block pixels first, followed by the singleton pixel, if the singleton was originally first. Otherwise (if the block was originally first), place the singleton pixel first, followed by the block pixels. Essentially, swap their order.
7.  Construct the output array by replacing the original non-zero segment (between the identified start and end indices) with the newly created swapped segment. Keep all zero pixels outside this segment in their original positions.

## Example 3:

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: swapping a singleton pixel and a contiguous block of pixels within a non-zero segment of a 1D array. The provided Python code implements this logic. However, the code failed execution on all examples with a "truth value of an array is ambiguous" error. This strongly suggests an issue with how the input data type (potentially a NumPy array) is handled, particularly in conditional statements (`if` statements) that expect a single boolean value but receive an array.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Input Type Handling:** Modify the code to explicitly handle potential NumPy array inputs by converting the relevant parts (the input grid row) to a standard Python list at the beginning of the `transform` function.
2.  **Refine Conditionals:** Review any `if` conditions that might implicitly operate on arrays (e.g., checking for emptiness) and make them explicit (e.g., using `.size` or `.any()`/`.all()` if NumPy arrays are kept, or checking `len()` if converted to lists). For this task, converting to lists seems simplest.
3.  **Verify Logic:** Re-confirm that the segment finding, object identification (singleton/block), and swapping logic are correct for all examples using the list-based approach.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the Facts YAML and Natural Language Program to be precise and reflect the list-based processing.

**Metrics and Verification:**

Let's verify the core logic components for each example, assuming the input is treated as a list.

The code execution confirms that the core logic correctly transforms the inputs to the expected outputs when operating on Python lists. The failures were indeed due to the input type handling, not the transformation logic itself.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: list_manipulation # Specific to 1D list structure

objects_within_segment:
  - name: singleton
    description: The element (pixel color) appearing exactly once in the active segment.
    properties:
      - color: variable (non-zero)
      - count: 1
  - name: block
    description: The contiguous sequence of identical elements (pixel color) appearing multiple times in the active segment.

      - count: >1
      - contiguous: true
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    objects: [singleton, block]
    description: The singleton element is always directly adjacent to the block sequence within the active segment. There are no other elements between them.
  - type: exclusive_composition
    objects: [singleton, block]
    parent: active_segment
    description: The active segment is composed entirely of the singleton element and the block sequence, placed adjacently.

  - name: identify_active_segment
    input: input_list (1D)
    output: start_index, end_index, segment_sublist
    description: Find the start and end indices bounding the first contiguous run of non-zero values. Extract this sublist.
  - name: identify_singleton_and_block
    input: segment_sublist
    output: singleton_color, block_color, block_length
    description: Count element occurrences within the segment to identify the color appearing once (singleton) and the color appearing multiple times (block), along with the block's length.
  - name: swap_elements
    input: singleton_color, block_color, block_length, original_segment_order (e.g., check segment[0])
    output: new_segment_sublist
    description: Construct a new sublist by reversing the order of the singleton element and the block sequence. If the original started with the singleton, the new starts with the block, and vice-versa.
  - name: reconstruct_output_list
    input: original_list, start_index, end_index, new_segment_sublist
    output: transformed_list (1D)
    description: Create a copy of the original list and replace the elements from start_index to end_index with the elements of the new_segment_sublist.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a 1xN grid (effectively a single list of integers). Ensure this row is treated as a Python list.
2.  Make a copy of the input list to serve as the basis for the output list.
3.  Scan the input list to find the start and end indices of the *first* contiguous sublist containing only non-zero values (the "active segment"). If no non-zero values exist, return the original list copy.
4.  Extract the active segment based on the identified indices.
5.  Analyze the active segment:
    *   Count the occurrences of each distinct non-zero value within the segment. There must be exactly two distinct non-zero values.
    *   Identify the value that occurs exactly once (the "singleton").
    *   Identify the value that occurs multiple times (the "block color") and determine its count (the "block length").
6.  Determine the original order: Check if the first element of the active segment is the singleton value.
7.  Construct the new segment:
    *   If the original segment started with the singleton, create the new segment by placing the block color repeated block length times, followed by the singleton value.
    *   If the original segment started with the block color, create the new segment by placing the singleton value first, followed by the block color repeated block length times.
8.  Replace the portion of the output list corresponding to the original active segment (from the start index to the end index) with the newly constructed segment.
9.  Return the modified list, formatted as a 1xN grid (a list containing one list).
