"""
Identifies a contiguous segment of non-zero pixels within a 1D input row (represented as a 1xN grid). 
Within this segment, it finds a single pixel ('singleton') of one color and a contiguous block 
of pixels ('block') of another color. The transformation swaps the relative positions of the 
singleton and the block within the segment, leaving the surrounding zero pixels unchanged.
