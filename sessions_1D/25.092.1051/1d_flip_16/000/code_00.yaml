task_type: array_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D arrays presented
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - name: singleton
    description: A single pixel of a non-zero color within the active segment.
    properties:
      - color: variable (5 in train_1, 1 in train_2, 4 in train_3)
      - count: 1
  - name: block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-zero color within the active segment.
    properties:
      - color: variable (8 in train_1, 8 in train_2, 5 in train_3)
      - count: >1
      - contiguous: true
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    objects: [singleton, block]
    description: The singleton and the block are always adjacent to each other in the input.
  - type: boundary
    objects: [singleton, block, background_color]
    description: The combined singleton and block form a contiguous segment surrounded by the background color (0).
actions:
  - name: identify_active_segment
    description: Find the contiguous subsequence of non-zero pixels.
  - name: identify_singleton_and_block
    description: Within the active segment, differentiate the pixel appearing once (singleton) from the pixel color appearing multiple times contiguously (block).
  - name: swap_position
    objects: [singleton, block]
    description: Reverse the order of the singleton and the block within the active segment.
  - name: reconstruct_output
    description: Place the modified active segment back into its original position relative to the surrounding background pixels.
