The transformation appears to operate on a specific segment of the array containing non-zero values, leaving the surrounding zero values (white pixels) unchanged. Within the non-zero segment, there are always two distinct non-zero colors present: one color appears as a single pixel (the \"singleton\"), and the other appears as a contiguous block of multiple pixels (the \"block\"). The core transformation is the swapping of the relative positions of the singleton pixel and the block of pixels.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Extract this non-zero segment.\n3.  Within the extracted segment, count the occurrences of each unique non-zero color.\n4.  Identify the color that appears exactly once; this is the 'singleton' color.\n5.  Identify the color that appears multiple times; this constitutes the 'block' color and its associated pixels.\n6.  Create a new segment by placing the block pixels first, followed by the singleton pixel, if the singleton was originally first. Otherwise (if the block was originally first), place the singleton pixel first, followed by the block pixels. Essentially, swap their order.\n7.  Construct the output array by replacing the original non-zero segment (between the identified start and end indices) with the newly created swapped segment. Keep all zero pixels outside this segment in their original positions."
