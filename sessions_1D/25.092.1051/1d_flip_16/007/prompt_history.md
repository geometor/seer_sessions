**Perception:**

The input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers representing colors. The transformation appears to operate on a specific segment of the array containing non-zero values, leaving the surrounding zero values (white pixels) unchanged. Within the non-zero segment, there are always two distinct non-zero colors present: one color appears as a single pixel (the "singleton"), and the other appears as a contiguous block of multiple pixels (the "block"). The core transformation is the swapping of the relative positions of the singleton pixel and the block of pixels.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the start and end indices of the contiguous segment containing non-zero pixels in the input array.
2.  Extract this non-zero segment.
3.  Within the extracted segment, count the occurrences of each unique non-zero color.
4.  Identify the color that appears exactly once; this is the 'singleton' color.
5.  Identify the color that appears multiple times; this constitutes the 'block' color and its associated pixels.
6.  Create a new segment by placing the block pixels first, followed by the singleton pixel, if the singleton was originally first. Otherwise (if the block was originally first), place the singleton pixel first, followed by the block pixels. Essentially, swap their order.
7.  Construct the output array by replacing the original non-zero segment (between the identified start and end indices) with the newly created swapped segment. Keep all zero pixels outside this segment in their original positions.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.` This indicates that a NumPy array was likely used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`). This commonly happens if the input `input_grid`, expected to be a list of lists, is instead passed as a NumPy array by the testing environment. The core logic of identifying the non-zero segment, finding the singleton and block, and swapping them appears sound based on manual checks against the examples.

**Strategy:**

The primary strategy is to make the code robust to receiving input as either a list of lists or a NumPy array. This involves:

1.  Modifying the initial input validation to correctly handle NumPy arrays.
2.  Ensuring that the core processing logic operates consistently, likely by converting the relevant row to a standard Python list early in the `transform` function if it isn't one already.
3.  Re-validating the logic with the examples mentally or using code execution snippets.

**Metrics Gathering:**

We will confirm the segment identification and analysis for each training example.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid. Ensure it represents a 1xN grid, potentially converting from a NumPy array to a list if necessary. Handle invalid or empty inputs appropriately.
2.  Identify the start and end indices of the first contiguous segment containing non-zero pixels (the "active segment") in the input row. If no such segment exists, return a copy of the original input grid.
3.  Extract the active segment based on the identified indices.
4.  Analyze the active segment:
    *   Count the occurrences of each unique non-zero color.
    *   Verify that there are exactly two distinct non-zero colors.
    *   Identify the color that appears once (the 'singleton' color).
    *   Identify the color that appears multiple times (the 'block' color) and determine its count (block length).
    *   Verify that the pixels of the 'block' color form a single contiguous sequence within the segment.
    *   If any verification step fails (e.g., not exactly two colors, singleton/block not identifiable, block not contiguous), return a copy of the original input grid.
5.  Determine the original order within the active segment by checking if the first element is the singleton color or the block color.
6.  Construct the new segment:
    *   If the original segment started with the singleton, the new segment consists of the block pixels followed by the singleton pixel.
    *   If the original segment started with the block, the new segment consists of the singleton pixel followed by the block pixels.
7.  Verify the new segment has the same length as the original segment. If not, return a copy of the original input grid (as this indicates an error).
8.  Construct the output row by replacing the slice corresponding to the original active segment with the newly constructed swapped segment.
9.  Return the output row formatted as a 1xN grid (a list containing one list).
