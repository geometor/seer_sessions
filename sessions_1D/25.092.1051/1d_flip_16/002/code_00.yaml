task_type: array_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input is effectively a single row (1xN grid).
grid_representation: list_of_lists # Standard ARC format [[...]]. May need robust handling for pure lists or numpy arrays.
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - name: active_segment
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence of the input row containing all non-zero pixels.
    properties:
      - location: Bounded by the first and last non-zero pixels.
      - content: Composed exclusively of non-zero pixels.
      - structure: Contains exactly two distinct non-zero colors.
  - name: singleton
    description: The object within the active_segment composed of a single pixel.
    properties:
      - color: The non-zero color appearing exactly once in the active_segment.
      - count: 1
      - relative_position: Either at the start or end of the active_segment.
  - name: block
    description: The object within the active_segment composed of multiple contiguous pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The non-zero color appearing more than once in the active_segment.
      - count: >1
      - contiguous: true
      - relative_position: Adjacent to the singleton, occupying the rest of the active_segment.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    objects: [singleton, block]
    description: The singleton and the block are always immediately adjacent within the active_segment, together forming the entirety of the segment.
  - type: boundary
    objects: [active_segment, background_color]
    description: The active_segment is surrounded by the background color (0) or the grid boundaries.
actions:
  - name: identify_active_segment
    description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous sub-sequence containing only non-zero pixels.
  - name: identify_singleton_and_block
    description: Within the active segment, count pixel color occurrences to distinguish the singleton (count=1) from the block (count>1). Determine their colors and the block's length.
  - name: swap_elements
    objects: [singleton, block]
    description: Reverse the order of the singleton pixel and the contiguous block of pixels within the identified segment boundaries.
  - name: reconstruct_output
    description: Create the output row by replacing the original active_segment in the input row with the newly ordered sequence of the block and singleton. Pixels outside the active_segment remain unchanged.
