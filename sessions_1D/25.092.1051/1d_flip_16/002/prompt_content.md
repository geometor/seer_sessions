Identifies a contiguous segment of non-zero pixels within a 1D input array. 
Within this segment, it finds a single pixel ('singleton') of one color and a 
contiguous block of pixels ('block') of another color. The transformation 
swaps the relative positions of the singleton and the block within the segment, 
leaving the surrounding zero pixels unchanged.
