            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.` This indicates that a NumPy array was likely used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`). This commonly happens if the input `input_grid`, expected to be a list of lists, is instead passed as a NumPy array by the testing environment. The core logic of identifying the non-zero segment, finding the singleton and block, and swapping them appears sound based on manual checks against the examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe primary strategy is to make the code robust to receiving input as either a list of lists or a NumPy array. This involves:\n\n1.  Modifying the initial input validation to correctly handle NumPy arrays.\n2.  Ensuring that the core processing logic operates consistently, likely by converting the relevant row to a standard Python list early in the `transform` function if it isn't one already.\n3.  Re-validating the logic with the examples mentally or using code execution snippets.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nWe will confirm the segment identification and analysis for each training example.\n\n"
