task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively single rows
objects:
  - type: block
    count: 2 per example (excluding background)
    properties:
      - contiguity: yes
      - color: non-white (0)
      - size:
          - one block is always size 1
          - the other block is size > 1
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: the single-pixel block and the multi-pixel block
    direction: side-by-side (horizontal)
actions:
  - name: swap_position
    target: the adjacent single-pixel block and multi-pixel block
    effect: The single pixel moves to the opposite end of the multi-pixel block's original span, and the multi-pixel block shifts into the single pixel's original position.
background:
  color: white (0)
  role: static, defines boundaries
invariance:
  - Background pixels remain unchanged.
  - The colors and total counts of non-white pixels remain unchanged.
  - The relative order of pixels *within* the multi-pixel block remains unchanged.
