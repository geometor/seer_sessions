In each example, there are two such objects immediately adjacent to each other:\n    *   A block consisting of a single pixel (blue `1`, blue `1`, azure `8` in the examples).\n    *   A block consisting of multiple pixels of the same color (green `3`, gray `5`, red `2` in the examples).\n3.  **Background:** The rest of the grid is filled with white (`0`) pixels, acting as background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a swap of position between the single-pixel object and the multi-pixel block object it is adjacent to. The single pixel effectively moves to the other end of the block, and the block shifts to occupy the original position of the single pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
