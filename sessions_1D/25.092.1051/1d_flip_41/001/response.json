Swaps the position of the single pixel with the multi-pixel \nblock it is adjacent to. Specifically, the single pixel moves to the opposite \nend of the span originally occupied by the multi-pixel block, and the \nmulti-pixel block shifts to occupy the remaining space, including the original \nposition of the single pixel.
