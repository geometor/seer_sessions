Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and a single contiguous block (object) of non-white pixels. The transformation involves modifying only this non-white block, leaving the white background pixels unchanged. Specifically, the first pixel of the non-white block is moved to the end position of that block, effectively shifting all other pixels within the block one position to the left. The overall grid dimensions remain the same.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
