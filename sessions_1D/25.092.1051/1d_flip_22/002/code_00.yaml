task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimension: 1xN (specifically 1x16 in examples)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - representation: Likely NumPy array based on errors and common practice in ARC.
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    pixels: non-white
    count: 1 per grid row
    location: Variable start/end indices within the row.
    properties:
      - length: Varies (5, 7, 6 in examples)
transformation:
  - type: modification
    target: the single non-white_block
    action: cyclic_shift_left
    details: |
      The sequence of pixels forming the block is shifted one position to the left,
      with the first pixel wrapping around to become the last pixel of the block.
      If the block has only one pixel, it remains unchanged.
  - scope: Only affects the non-white block; white background pixels remain unchanged.
relationships:
  - The position of white pixels relative to the grid boundaries is preserved.
  - The length and indices occupied by the non-white block remain the same after transformation.
  - The set and count of colors within the non-white block remain the same, only their order changes cyclically.
