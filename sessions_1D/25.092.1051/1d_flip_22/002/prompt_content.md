"""
Identifies the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input grid row.
Performs a left cyclic shift on this block: moves the first pixel of the block to the last position of the block, shifting all other pixels in the block one position to the left.
Keeps all white (0) background pixels in their original positions.
