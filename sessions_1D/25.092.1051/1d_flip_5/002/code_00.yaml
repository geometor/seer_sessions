Task: Reverse the position of a uniquely colored pixel within a contiguous segment in a 1-row grid.

Input_Grid:
  - type: 2D array (likely NumPy), typically 1xN dimensions.
  - contains:
    - background_pixels:
      - color: white (0)
      - arrangement: Surrounding the segment.
    - non_white_segment:
      - type: A single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
      - properties:
        - pixels: Contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
        - unique_pixel:
          - count: Exactly 1 instance within the segment.
          - color: One of the two non-white colors.
          - position: Located at either the start or the end of the segment.
        - repeated_pixels:
          - count: One or more instances within the segment (total segment length - 1).
          - color: The other non-white color.
          - arrangement: Forms a contiguous block adjacent to the unique_pixel.

Output_Grid:
  - type: 2D array (same dimensions and type as input).
  - derivation: Modified version of the input grid.
  - changes:
    - non_white_segment:
      - unique_pixel: Position is moved to the opposite end of the segment compared to the input.
      - repeated_pixels: Position is shifted contiguously to accommodate the moved unique_pixel. The relative order among repeated pixels is maintained.
    - background_pixels: Unchanged.
    - colors: All pixel colors within the segment are preserved, only their positions change.
    - segment_location: The start and end indices of the non-white segment remain the same in the overall grid.

Example_Properties (Consistent across examples):
  - Input grid shape: [1, 26]
  - Output grid shape: [1, 26]
  - Segment: Always contains exactly 2 colors.
  - Unique Pixel: Always exists (count=1) and is at one end of the segment.
  - Transformation: The unique pixel's position flips from start-of-segment to end-of-segment, or vice-versa.
