The single pixel appears at one end of the segment.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves moving the single, unique-colored pixel from one end of the multi-pixel block to the other end. The colors themselves and the surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **General Rule:** The core operation is relocating the uniquely colored pixel within the non-white segment to the opposite end of that segment.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Extract this segment from the row.\n3.  Within the extracted segment, identify the single pixel whose color is unique compared to the others in the segment. Note its color and the color of the repeated pixels.\n4.  Determine if the unique pixel is currently at the beginning or the end of the segment.\n5.  Construct the new segment by placing the block of repeated-color pixels first, followed by the unique-color pixel if the unique pixel was originally at the beginning, OR place the unique-color pixel first, followed by the block of repeated-color pixels if the unique pixel was originally at the end. Effectively, move the unique pixel to the opposite end of the segment.\n6.  Create the output row by replacing the original segment in the input row with the newly constructed segment at the same start and end indices. Keep the surrounding white pixels unchanged."
