Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input and output are both single rows (1D arrays) of pixels represented by integers.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each input row contains a contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels surrounded by white (zero) pixels.
3.  **Segment Composition:** Within the non-white segment, there's one pixel of a specific color (e.g., yellow in train_1, red in train_2, green in train_3) and multiple pixels of another single color (e.g., green in train_1, blue in train_2, yellow in train_3). The single pixel appears at one end of the segment.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves moving the single, unique-colored pixel from one end of the multi-pixel block to the other end. The colors themselves and the surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
5.  **General Rule:** The core operation is relocating the uniquely colored pixel within the non-white segment to the opposite end of that segment.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Move a unique colored pixel to the other end of its segment.

Input:
  - type: grid (1D array)
  - contains:
    - background: white pixels (0)
    - segment:
      - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - composition:
        - unique_pixel:
          - count: 1
          - color: non-white (e.g., 4, 2, 3)
          - position: one end of the segment
        - repeated_pixels:
          - count: multiple
          - color: single non-white color, different from unique_pixel (e.g., 3, 1, 4)
          - position: adjacent to unique_pixel, forming the rest of the segment

Output:
  - type: grid (1D array)
  - derived_from: input grid
  - changes:
    - segment:
      - unique_pixel:
        - action: moved
        - destination: opposite end of the segment
      - repeated_pixels:
        - position: shifted to accommodate the moved unique_pixel
    - background: unchanged

Relationships:
  - The unique_pixel is defined by its color being different from the adjacent pixels within the segment.
  - The transformation preserves the colors and the overall length of the non-white segment.
  - The transformation only affects the order of pixels within the non-white segment.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the start and end indices of the contiguous segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input row.
2.  Extract this segment from the row.
3.  Within the extracted segment, identify the single pixel whose color is unique compared to the others in the segment. Note its color and the color of the repeated pixels.
4.  Determine if the unique pixel is currently at the beginning or the end of the segment.
5.  Construct the new segment by placing the block of repeated-color pixels first, followed by the unique-color pixel if the unique pixel was originally at the beginning, OR place the unique-color pixel first, followed by the block of repeated-color pixels if the unique pixel was originally at the end. Effectively, move the unique pixel to the opposite end of the segment.
6.  Create the output row by replacing the original segment in the input row with the newly constructed segment at the same start and end indices. Keep the surrounding white pixels unchanged.
