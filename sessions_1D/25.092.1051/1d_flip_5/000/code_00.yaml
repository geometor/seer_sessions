Task: Move a unique colored pixel to the other end of its segment.

Input:
  - type: grid (1D array)
  - contains:
    - background: white pixels (0)
    - segment:
      - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - composition:
        - unique_pixel:
          - count: 1
          - color: non-white (e.g., 4, 2, 3)
          - position: one end of the segment
        - repeated_pixels:
          - count: multiple
          - color: single non-white color, different from unique_pixel (e.g., 3, 1, 4)
          - position: adjacent to unique_pixel, forming the rest of the segment

Output:
  - type: grid (1D array)
  - derived_from: input grid
  - changes:
    - segment:
      - unique_pixel:
        - action: moved
        - destination: opposite end of the segment
      - repeated_pixels:
        - position: shifted to accommodate the moved unique_pixel
    - background: unchanged

Relationships:
  - The unique_pixel is defined by its color being different from the adjacent pixels within the segment.
  - The transformation preserves the colors and the overall length of the non-white segment.
  - The transformation only affects the order of pixels within the non-white segment.
