Each input grid contains a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels, surrounded by white pixels (0). Within this non-white segment, there is always exactly one pixel of a unique color, while the rest of the pixels in the segment share another, different non-white color. The transformation involves swapping the position of the unique-colored pixel with the pixel at the opposite end of the non-white segment. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
