task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_segment
    description: A sequence of non-white pixels bounded by white pixels.
    properties:
      - contains exactly one instance of a unique non-white color (the 'unique_pixel').
      - contains multiple instances of another non-white color (the 'repeating_pixel').
      - location: defined by start and end indices within the 1D grid.
pixels:
  - type: unique_pixel
    description: The pixel within the segment whose color appears only once.
    properties:
      - color: variable (e.g., orange(7) in train_1/2, blue(1) in train_3)
      - count_in_segment: 1
  - type: repeating_pixel
    description: The pixels within the segment whose color appears multiple times.
    properties:
      - color: variable (e.g., azure(8) in train_1, blue(1) in train_2, orange(7) in train_3)
      - count_in_segment: >1
  - type: boundary_pixel
    description: The pixel at the opposite end of the segment from the unique_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: initially the color of the repeating_pixel.
      - location: either the start or end index of the segment.
actions:
  - type: identify_segment
    description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous non-white segment.
  - type: identify_unique_pixel
    description: Find the pixel within the segment whose color count is 1. Note its index and color.
  - type: identify_boundary_pixel
    description: Determine the index of the pixel at the opposite end of the segment relative to the unique_pixel. Note its index and color.
  - type: swap_pixels
    description: Exchange the colors of the unique_pixel and the boundary_pixel.
relationships:
  - The unique_pixel is always located at one of the ends (start or end) of the non-white segment.
  - The boundary_pixel is located at the other end of the segment.
invariance:
  - The white background pixels (0) remain unchanged.
  - The colors and count of the repeating_pixels (other than the one swapped) remain unchanged, only their relative position might shift slightly if the unique pixel was not originally adjacent to them.
  - The length of the non-white segment remains the same.
  - The overall grid dimensions remain the same.
