Identifies a contiguous segment of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid.
Within this segment, it finds the pixel with a unique color (appearing only once).
It then swaps the color of this unique pixel with the color of the pixel at the opposite end of the segment.
The white background pixels remain unchanged.
