Within this non-white segment, there is always a single pixel of one color followed immediately by a contiguous block of pixels of another color.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional swap within the non-white segment. The single pixel and the adjacent block of pixels exchange their positions. The white background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
