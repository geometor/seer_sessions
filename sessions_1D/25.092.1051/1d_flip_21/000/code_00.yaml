task_description: Swap the position of a single non-white pixel with the adjacent contiguous block of different non-white pixels within a row.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: All examples are 1x13.
  - background_color: White (0).
objects:
  - type: single_pixel
    description: A non-white pixel that is immediately followed by a pixel of a different non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (Orange, Yellow).
      - count: 1
  - type: pixel_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (Blue, Azure, Gray).
      - length: Variable (e.g., 5, 4).
relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The single_pixel is immediately to the left of the pixel_block within the non-white segment of the row.
action:
  - type: swap
    description: The single_pixel and the pixel_block exchange their positions in the output grid.
    constraints:
      - Only affects the identified single_pixel and pixel_block.
      - Background pixels (white) remain fixed.
      - Relative order of pixels within the pixel_block is maintained.
