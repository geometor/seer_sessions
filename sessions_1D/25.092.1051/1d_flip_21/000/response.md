Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Grids:** All examples show 1x13 grids (single rows).
*   **Colors:** The grids contain white pixels (0) acting as background, and sequences of non-white pixels.
    *   Example 1: Orange (7) and Blue (1).
    *   Example 2: Yellow (4) and Azure (8).
    *   Example 3: Yellow (4) and Gray (5).
*   **Structure:** In each input grid, there's a segment of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels. Within this non-white segment, there is always a single pixel of one color followed immediately by a contiguous block of pixels of another color.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional swap within the non-white segment. The single pixel and the adjacent block of pixels exchange their positions. The white background pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Swap the position of a single non-white pixel with the adjacent contiguous block of different non-white pixels within a row.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: All examples are 1x13.
  - background_color: White (0).
objects:
  - type: single_pixel
    description: A non-white pixel that is immediately followed by a pixel of a different non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (Orange, Yellow).
      - count: 1
  - type: pixel_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (Blue, Azure, Gray).
      - length: Variable (e.g., 5, 4).
relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The single_pixel is immediately to the left of the pixel_block within the non-white segment of the row.
action:
  - type: swap
    description: The single_pixel and the pixel_block exchange their positions in the output grid.
    constraints:
      - Only affects the identified single_pixel and pixel_block.
      - Background pixels (white) remain fixed.
      - Relative order of pixels within the pixel_block is maintained.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the horizontal sequence of connected non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Within this sequence, find the pixel (let's call it `pixel_A`) whose color is different from the pixel immediately to its right.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of identically colored pixels (let's call it `block_B`) that starts immediately to the right of `pixel_A`.
4.  Determine the starting position and length of `pixel_A` (which is always length 1) and `block_B`.
5.  Construct the output row by first placing `block_B` at the original starting position of `pixel_A`.
6.  Then, place `pixel_A` immediately after `block_B`.
7.  Ensure all other pixels (the surrounding white pixels) retain their original positions from the input row.
