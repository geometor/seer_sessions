Each input row contains a sequence of non-background pixels consisting of a single pixel of one color (let's call it the 'marker') immediately followed by a contiguous block of pixels of another color (let's call it the 'block'). The background is white (0). The transformation involves moving the marker pixel from the position *before* the block to the position immediately *after* the block. The pixels within the block shift one position to the left to fill the gap left by the marker.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
