*   **Perception**: The input and output are single rows of pixels. Each input row contains a sequence of non-background pixels consisting of a single pixel of one color (let's call it the 'marker') immediately followed by a contiguous block of pixels of another color (let's call it the 'block'). The background is white (0). The transformation involves moving the marker pixel from the position *before* the block to the position immediately *after* the block. The pixels within the block shift one position to the left to fill the gap left by the marker.

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_description: Move a single 'marker' pixel across an adjacent 'block' of pixels in a 1D grid.

    elements:
      - object: marker_pixel
        description: A single pixel with a color different from the background (white) and the adjacent block.
        properties:
          - color: unique_color_1 (e.g., magenta in ex1, yellow in ex2, blue in ex3)
          - position: index `i`
      - object: pixel_block
        description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels, all having the same color, different from the background and the marker pixel.
        properties:
          - color: unique_color_2 (e.g., red in ex1, gray in ex2, yellow in ex3)
          - position: starts at index `i+1`
          - length: `L` (number of pixels in the block)
      - object: background
        description: Pixels representing the empty space.
        properties:
          - color: white (0)

    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        objects: [marker_pixel, pixel_block]
        details: The marker_pixel is immediately to the left of the first pixel of the pixel_block.

    actions:
      - action: move
        object: marker_pixel
        from_position: index `i`
        to_position: index `i + L` (immediately after the original block)
      - action: shift
        object: pixel_block
        direction: left
        distance: 1 position (occupying indices `i` to `i + L - 1`)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the sequence of non-background pixels in the input row.
    2.  Find the first pixel in this sequence (the 'marker pixel').
    3.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels of a single, different color that immediately follows the marker pixel (the 'pixel block'). Let the length of this block be `L`.
    4.  Create the output row by copying the input row.
    5.  Move the marker pixel from its original position (`i`) to the position immediately following the end of the pixel block (position `i + L`).
    6.  Shift all pixels of the pixel block one position to the left, so they now occupy the original position of the marker pixel and the subsequent `L-1` positions (positions `i` through `i + L - 1`).
    7.  Leave all other pixels (background) unchanged.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The core logic identified in the previous step (swapping a 'marker' pixel with an adjacent 'block' of pixels) appears consistent with all three training examples. The failure reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") strongly suggests an issue with how the Python code handles the input data structure. ARC tasks use NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists. The previous code was written assuming `List[List[int]]` but likely received a NumPy array. Comparisons or conditional checks within the code (e.g., `if pixel != 0:`) were probably performed on array slices or multi-element arrays instead of individual pixel values, leading to the ambiguity error.

The strategy is to:
1.  Adapt the code to explicitly handle NumPy arrays.
2.  Ensure all indexing and comparisons operate on scalar values extracted from the array.
3.  Re-verify the logic within the context of NumPy array operations.

## Metrics and Observations

Let's analyze the examples assuming they are represented as 1xN NumPy arrays.

**Example 1:**
*   Input Shape: (1, 24)
*   Input Array: `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0]]`
*   Marker: Color=6 (magenta), Index=10
*   Block: Color=2 (red), Start Index=11, Length=11
*   Output Array: `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6 0 0]]`
*   Transformation: Marker at index 10 swaps positions with the block of 11 red pixels starting at index 11. The block shifts left to start at index 10, and the marker moves to index 10 + 11 = 21.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Shape: (1, 24)
*   Input Array: `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`
*   Marker: Color=4 (yellow), Index=9
*   Block: Color=5 (gray), Start Index=10, Length=7
*   Output Array: `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`
*   Transformation: Marker at index 9 swaps positions with the block of 7 gray pixels starting at index 10. The block shifts left to start at index 9, and the marker moves to index 9 + 7 = 16.

**Example 3:**
*   Input Shape: (1, 24)
*   Input Array: `[[1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`
*   Marker: Color=1 (blue), Index=0
*   Block: Color=4 (yellow), Start Index=1, Length=7
*   Output Array: `[[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`
*   Transformation: Marker at index 0 swaps positions with the block of 7 yellow pixels starting at index 1. The block shifts left to start at index 0, and the marker moves to index 0 + 7 = 7.

**Confirmation:** The pattern holds across all examples. The input is consistently a 1xN grid. The transformation identifies the first non-background pixel ('marker') and the subsequent contiguous block of same-colored pixels ('block'). The marker moves to the position immediately after the block's original end, and the block shifts left by one position. The primary issue was the code's incompatibility with NumPy arrays.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1xN grid by moving a single 'marker' pixel across an adjacent 'block' of pixels.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1xN (represented as a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N))
  - background_color: 0 (white)

elements:
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: The first non-background pixel encountered when scanning the row from left to right.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except background (0). Varies per example (magenta, yellow, blue).
      - position: Index `i` where the first non-zero pixel occurs.
  - object: pixel_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels immediately following the marker_pixel. All pixels in the block must have the same color, which must be different from both the background and the marker_pixel color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except background (0) and marker_pixel color. Varies per example (red, gray, yellow).
      - position: Starts at index `i+1`.
      - length: `L` (number of contiguous pixels with the block color, L >= 1).
  - object: background
    description: Pixels representing empty space.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    objects: [marker_pixel, pixel_block]
    details: The marker_pixel is at index `i`, and the pixel_block starts at index `i+1`.
  - type: constraint
    objects: [marker_pixel, pixel_block]
    details: marker_pixel.color != pixel_block.color
  - type: constraint
    objects: [marker_pixel, background]
    details: marker_pixel.color != background.color (0)
  - type: constraint
    objects: [pixel_block, background]
    details: pixel_block.color != background.color (0)

actions:
  - action: identify_pattern
    description: Scan the input row from left to right to find the first sequence matching the 'marker_pixel' followed immediately by a valid 'pixel_block'.
  - action: rearrange
    description: If the pattern is found, modify a copy of the input row.
    steps:
      - Copy the pixel_block's color to the indices from `i` to `i + L - 1`.
      - Copy the marker_pixel's color to the index `i + L`.
    condition: The pattern (marker followed by valid block) must be present. If not found, the grid remains unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N).
2.  Extract the first (and only) row of the grid as a 1D array. Create a mutable copy of this row for the output.
3.  Iterate through the copied row from left to right (index `i` from 0 to N-1) to find the first non-background pixel (color != 0). This is the potential 'marker pixel'. Record its color (`marker_color`) and index (`marker_idx`). If no non-background pixel is found, return the original input grid.
4.  Check if the marker pixel is immediately followed by another pixel (i.e., if `marker_idx + 1 < N`). If not, the pattern is incomplete; return the original input grid.
5.  Identify the color of the pixel immediately following the marker (`block_color` at index `marker_idx + 1`).
6.  Validate the `block_color`: it must not be the background color (0) and must not be the same as the `marker_color`. If validation fails, the pattern is invalid; return the original input grid.
7.  Starting from `marker_idx + 1`, count the number of contiguous pixels (`block_length`) that have the `block_color`. Stop counting when the color changes or the end of the row is reached. `block_length` must be at least 1.
8.  Check if moving the marker pixel would place it outside the grid boundaries (i.e., if `marker_idx + block_length >= N`). If it would, the move is invalid; return the original input grid.
9.  Perform the rearrangement on the copied row:
    *   Overwrite the pixels from index `marker_idx` to `marker_idx + block_length - 1` with the `block_color`.
    *   Overwrite the pixel at index `marker_idx + block_length` with the `marker_color`.
10. Wrap the modified 1D row back into a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N) and return it.
