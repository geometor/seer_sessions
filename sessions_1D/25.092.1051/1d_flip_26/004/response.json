            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe core logic identified in the previous step (swapping a 'marker' pixel with an adjacent 'block' of pixels) appears consistent with all three training examples. The failure reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") strongly suggests an issue with how the Python code handles the input data structure. ARC tasks use NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists. The previous code was written assuming `List[List[int]]` but likely received a NumPy array. Comparisons or conditional checks within the code (e.g., `if pixel != 0:`) were probably performed on array slices or multi-element arrays instead of individual pixel values, leading to the ambiguity error.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Adapt the code to explicitly handle NumPy arrays.\n2.  Ensure all indexing and comparisons operate on scalar values extracted from the array.\n3.  Re-verify the logic within the context of NumPy array operations.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nLet's analyze the examples assuming they are represented as 1xN NumPy arrays.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Shape: (1, 24)\n*   Input Array: `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0]]`\n*   Marker: Color=6 (magenta), Index=10\n*   Block: Color=2 (red), Start Index=11, Length=11\n*   Output Array: `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6 0 0]]`\n*   Transformation: Marker at index 10 swaps positions with the block of 11 red pixels starting at index 11. The block shifts left to start at index 10, and the marker moves to index 10 + 11 = 21.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Shape: (1, 24)\n*   Input Array: `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`\n*   Marker: Color=4 (yellow), Index=9\n*   Block: Color=5 (gray), Start Index=10, Length=7\n*   Output Array: `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`\n*   Transformation: Marker at index 9 swaps positions with the block of 7 gray pixels starting at index 10. The block shifts left to start at index 9, and the marker moves to index 9 + 7 = 16.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Shape: (1, 24)\n*   Input Array: `[[1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`\n*   Marker: Color=1 (blue), Index=0\n*   Block: Color=4 (yellow), Start Index=1, Length=7\n*   Output Array: `[[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`\n*   Transformation: Marker at index 0 swaps positions with the block of 7 yellow pixels starting at index 1. The block shifts left to start at index 0, and the marker moves to index 0 + 7 = 7.\n\n**Confirmation:** The pattern holds across all examples. The input is consistently a 1xN grid. The transformation identifies the first non-background pixel ('marker') and the subsequent contiguous block of same-colored pixels ('block'). The marker moves to the position immediately after the block's original end, and the block shifts left by one position. The primary issue was the code's incompatibility with NumPy arrays.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Extract the first (and only) row of the grid as a 1D array. Create a mutable copy of this row for the output.\n3.  Iterate through the copied row from left to right (index `i` from 0 to N-1) to find the first non-background pixel (color != 0). This is the potential 'marker pixel'. Record its color (`marker_color`) and index (`marker_idx`). If no non-background pixel is found, return the original input grid.\n4.  Check if the marker pixel is immediately followed by another pixel (i.e., if `marker_idx + 1 < N`). If not, the pattern is incomplete; return the original input grid.\n5.  Identify the color of the pixel immediately following the marker (`block_color` at index `marker_idx + 1`).\n6.  Validate the `block_color`: it must not be the background color (0) and must not be the same as the `marker_color`. If validation fails, the pattern is invalid; return the original input grid.\n7.  Starting from `marker_idx + 1`, count the number of contiguous pixels (`block_length`) that have the `block_color`. Stop counting when the color changes or the end of the row is reached. `block_length` must be at least 1.\n8.  Check if moving the marker pixel would place it outside the grid boundaries (i.e., if `marker_idx + block_length >= N`). If it would, the move is invalid; return the original input grid.\n9.  Perform the rearrangement on the copied row:\n    *   Overwrite the pixels from index `marker_idx` to `marker_idx + block_length - 1` with the `block_color`.\n    *   Overwrite the pixel at index `marker_idx + block_length` with the `marker_color`.\n10. Wrap the modified 1D row back into a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N) and return it."
