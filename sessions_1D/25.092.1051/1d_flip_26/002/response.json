The error reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") is highly suggestive of an issue within the testing framework's comparison method, likely comparing a list output from the function to a NumPy array representation of the expected output directly using `==`, which results in element-wise comparison and a boolean array unsuitable for a simple `if` condition.\n\nAssuming the comparison framework is the source of the error message and not an underlying logical flaw in the transformation itself (which manual tracing suggests is correct), the strategy is to:\n\n1.  Re-verify the core transformation logic against the examples.\n2.  Gather precise metrics about the input and output structures using code execution to confirm assumptions.\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for maximum clarity, ensuring they accurately reflect the observed pattern and the intended transformation, paying attention to data types (lists of lists).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's confirm the structure and properties of the examples."
