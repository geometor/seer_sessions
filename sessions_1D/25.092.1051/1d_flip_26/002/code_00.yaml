task_description: Rearrange a specific sequence of pixels within a 1D grid (represented as a 1xN grid). The sequence consists of a single 'marker' pixel immediately followed by a contiguous 'block' of pixels of a different color. The transformation moves the marker pixel to the position immediately after the block, shifting the block one position leftwards to occupy the marker's original position.

input_structure:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 1 row, N columns (N varies, e.g., 24 in examples)
  format: List of lists of integers (e.g., [[0, 6, 2, 2, 0]])

output_structure:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 1 row, N columns (same as input)
  format: List of lists of integers

elements:
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: The first non-background (non-zero) pixel encountered when scanning the row from left to right.
    properties:
      - color: C1 (a color value from 1-9)
      - initial_position: index `i`
  - object: pixel_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels starting immediately after the marker pixel. All pixels in the block have the same color, which is different from the marker color and the background color.
    properties:
      - color: C2 (a color value from 1-9, C2 != C1)
      - initial_position: starts at index `i+1`
      - length: L (number of pixels in the block, L >= 1)
  - object: background
    description: Pixels representing empty space.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    objects: [marker_pixel, pixel_block]
    details: The marker_pixel at index `i` is immediately followed by the first pixel of the pixel_block at index `i+1`.

actions:
  - action: identify_pattern
    description: Scan the input row from left to right to find the first occurrence of the marker_pixel followed by the pixel_block.
    inputs: input_row
    outputs: marker_pixel details (color C1, index i), pixel_block details (color C2, length L)
  - action: rearrange_pixels
    description: Modify a copy of the input row based on the identified pattern.
    steps:
      - 1: Place the block color (C2) into the indices from `i` to `i + L - 1`.
      - 2: Place the marker color (C1) into the index `i + L`.
    condition: Only perform if the marker_pixel and pixel_block pattern is found. Otherwise, the row remains unchanged.

output_generation:
  - step: Process the single row of the input grid according to the actions.
  - step: Return the modified row, enclosed in a list to match the 1xN grid format.
