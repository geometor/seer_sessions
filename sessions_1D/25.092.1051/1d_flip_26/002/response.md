## Assessment and Strategy

The previous code implementation correctly interpreted the core logic of the task based on the examples: identify a single 'marker' pixel followed by a contiguous block of different-colored pixels, and swap their relative positions (moving the marker to the end of the block and shifting the block left). The error reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") is highly suggestive of an issue within the testing framework's comparison method, likely comparing a list output from the function to a NumPy array representation of the expected output directly using `==`, which results in element-wise comparison and a boolean array unsuitable for a simple `if` condition.

Assuming the comparison framework is the source of the error message and not an underlying logical flaw in the transformation itself (which manual tracing suggests is correct), the strategy is to:

1.  Re-verify the core transformation logic against the examples.
2.  Gather precise metrics about the input and output structures using code execution to confirm assumptions.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for maximum clarity, ensuring they accurately reflect the observed pattern and the intended transformation, paying attention to data types (lists of lists).

## Metrics Gathering

Let's confirm the structure and properties of the examples.

        "output": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0]]
    },

```
The metrics confirm the initial observations and the logic implemented:
*   All examples involve 1xN grids.
*   The number of non-background pixels remains constant.
*   The pattern consistently involves a single 'marker' pixel (the first non-background pixel encountered) followed immediately by a block of pixels of a different, non-background color.
*   The marker pixel's final position in the output is indeed its original index plus the length of the block.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange a specific sequence of pixels within a 1D grid (represented as a 1xN grid). The sequence consists of a single 'marker' pixel immediately followed by a contiguous 'block' of pixels of a different color. The transformation moves the marker pixel to the position immediately after the block, shifting the block one position leftwards to occupy the marker's original position.

input_structure:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 1 row, N columns (N varies, e.g., 24 in examples)
  format: List of lists of integers (e.g., [[0, 6, 2, 2, 0]])

output_structure:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 1 row, N columns (same as input)
  format: List of lists of integers

elements:
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: The first non-background (non-zero) pixel encountered when scanning the row from left to right.
    properties:
      - color: C1 (a color value from 1-9)
      - initial_position: index `i`
  - object: pixel_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels starting immediately after the marker pixel. All pixels in the block have the same color, which is different from the marker color and the background color.
    properties:
      - color: C2 (a color value from 1-9, C2 != C1)
      - initial_position: starts at index `i+1`
      - length: L (number of pixels in the block, L >= 1)
  - object: background
    description: Pixels representing empty space.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    objects: [marker_pixel, pixel_block]
    details: The marker_pixel at index `i` is immediately followed by the first pixel of the pixel_block at index `i+1`.

actions:
  - action: identify_pattern
    description: Scan the input row from left to right to find the first occurrence of the marker_pixel followed by the pixel_block.
    inputs: input_row
    outputs: marker_pixel details (color C1, index i), pixel_block details (color C2, length L)
  - action: rearrange_pixels
    description: Modify a copy of the input row based on the identified pattern.
    steps:
      - 1: Place the block color (C2) into the indices from `i` to `i + L - 1`.
      - 2: Place the marker color (C1) into the index `i + L`.
    condition: Only perform if the marker_pixel and pixel_block pattern is found. Otherwise, the row remains unchanged.

output_generation:
  - step: Process the single row of the input grid according to the actions.
  - step: Return the modified row, enclosed in a list to match the 1xN grid format.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels (represented as a list within a list).
2.  Create a copy of the input row to modify.
3.  Scan the input row from left to right (index 0 onwards) to find the first pixel that is not background (color 0). This is the 'marker pixel'. Record its color (C1) and index (`i`).
4.  If no marker pixel is found (the row is all background), return the original input grid.
5.  Check the pixel immediately following the marker pixel (at index `i+1`).
6.  If there is no pixel at `i+1` (marker is at the end), or if the pixel at `i+1` is background (0) or has the same color as the marker (C1), then the required pattern is not present. Return the original input grid.
7.  Otherwise, the pixel at `i+1` is the start of the 'pixel block'. Record its color (C2).
8.  Determine the length (`L`) of the contiguous pixel block by counting how many pixels from index `i+1` onwards have the color C2.
9.  If a valid block (L >= 1) is found:
    a.  In the copied row, set the pixels from index `i` up to (but not including) index `i + L` to the block color (C2).
    b.  In the copied row, set the pixel at index `i + L` to the marker color (C1).
10. If a valid block was not found after identifying a potential marker, return the original input grid.
11. Return the modified row, enclosed within a list, as the output grid.
