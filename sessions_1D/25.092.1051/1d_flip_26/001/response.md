Identify a sequence of non-background pixels in the input row. This sequence consists 
of a single 'marker' pixel followed immediately by a contiguous 'block' of pixels 
of a single, different color. Move the marker pixel to the position immediately 
following the end of the block. Shift the pixels of the block one position to the 
left to fill the original position of the marker.
