"""
Transforms a single-row grid by finding a contiguous segment of non-white pixels. 
Within this segment, identifies a single pixel of one color and a contiguous block 
of pixels of another color. Swaps the positions of the single pixel and the block 
within the segment's original boundaries, leaving surrounding white pixels unchanged.
