            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code execution failed with a \"truth value of an array is ambiguous\" error. This typically occurs when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if my_numpy_array:`). The ARC testing framework likely converts the input list-of-lists into a NumPy array before passing it to the `transform` function. The original code, while logically sound for list inputs, didn't explicitly handle this potential type conversion, especially in conditional checks involving array slices.\n\nThe core logic identified in the initial analysis appears correct based on the examples: locate a non-white segment, identify the single unique pixel and the contiguous block of the other color within that segment, and swap their positions.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the code, specifically the `transform` function, to explicitly handle the input as a list of lists (even if it's just one row) and ensure that any segments or slices extracted are treated as standard Python lists before being used in conditional statements or standard list operations. The helper functions `find_non_white_segment` and `analyze_segment` already operate on lists and should be correct.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the code execution analysis:\n\n| Example | Input Row                       | Output Row                      | Segment Indices | Segment         | Analysis                                                                                                |\n| :------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1       | `[0,0,0,0,6,4,4,0,0,0]`         | `[0,0,0,0,4,4,6,0,0,0]`         | `(4, 7)`        | `[6, 4, 4]`     | `valid: True, single: 6, block: 4, single_pos: start, block_len: 2, seg_len: 3`                      |\n| 2       | `[0,0,0,7,8,8,8,8,0,0]`         | `[0,0,0,8,8,8,8,7,0,0]`         | `(3, 8)`        | `[7, 8, 8, 8, 8]` | `valid: True, single: 7, block: 8, single_pos: start, block_len: 4, seg_len: 5`                      |\n| 3       | `[0,0,3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]`         | `[0,0,4,4,3,0,0,0,0,0]`         | `(2, 5)`        | `[3, 4, 4]`     | `valid: True, single: 3, block: 4, single_pos: start, block_len: 2, seg_len: 3`                      |\n\nAll examples conform to the pattern:\n*   Input is a single row.\n*   A single contiguous non-white segment exists.\n*   The segment contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.\n*   One color appears once (single pixel).\n*   The other color appears multiple times contiguously (block).\n*   The single pixel is adjacent to the block (at one end of the segment).\n*   The transformation swaps the position of the single pixel and the block.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
