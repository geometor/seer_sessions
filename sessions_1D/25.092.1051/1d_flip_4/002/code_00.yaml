objects:
  - type: contiguous_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the single row, bounded by white pixels or grid edges.
    properties:
      - contains_exactly_two_distinct_non_white_colors
      - one_color_appears_once # (single_pixel object)
      - other_color_appears_multiple_times_contiguously # (contiguous_block object)
  - type: single_pixel
    description: The unique pixel within the contiguous_segment (the color that appears only once).
    relationship: located_at_one_end_of the contiguous_segment
    relationship: adjacent_to the contiguous_block
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: The block of identical, repeating pixels within the contiguous_segment (the color that appears more than once).
    relationship: located_at_one_end_of the contiguous_segment
    relationship: adjacent_to the single_pixel
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous_segment
    details: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row.
  - action: identify
    target: single_pixel
    within: contiguous_segment
    details: Find the color and its relative position (start or end) within the segment.
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous_block
    within: contiguous_segment
    details: Find the color and length of the block.
  - action: swap
    target1: single_pixel
    target2: contiguous_block
    details: Reverse the order of the single_pixel and the contiguous_block within the bounds defined by the original contiguous_segment's start and end indices.
constraints:
  - The input grid contains exactly one row.
  - The row contains exactly one contiguous segment of non-white pixels.
  - This segment must contain exactly two distinct non-white colors, one appearing once, the other multiple times contiguously.
  - The single pixel must be at either the start or the end of the non-white segment.
  - The surrounding white pixels (color 0) remain fixed.
  - The length of the row remains unchanged.
