*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output are single rows of pixels.
    *   Each row contains a segment of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
    *   Within the non-white segment, there are exactly two distinct colors present.
    *   One of these colors appears as a single pixel.
    *   The other color appears as a contiguous block of two or more pixels.
    *   The transformation involves swapping the position of the single pixel with the contiguous block of pixels within the non-white segment.
    *   The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.

## Example 3:

## General Assessment

The previous code execution failed with a "truth value of an array is ambiguous" error. This typically occurs when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if my_numpy_array:`). The ARC testing framework likely converts the input list-of-lists into a NumPy array before passing it to the `transform` function. The original code, while logically sound for list inputs, didn't explicitly handle this potential type conversion, especially in conditional checks involving array slices.

The core logic identified in the initial analysis appears correct based on the examples: locate a non-white segment, identify the single unique pixel and the contiguous block of the other color within that segment, and swap their positions.

The strategy is to refine the code, specifically the `transform` function, to explicitly handle the input as a list of lists (even if it's just one row) and ensure that any segments or slices extracted are treated as standard Python lists before being used in conditional statements or standard list operations. The helper functions `find_non_white_segment` and `analyze_segment` already operate on lists and should be correct.

## Metrics

Based on the code execution analysis:

| Example | Input Row                       | Output Row                      | Segment Indices | Segment         | Analysis                                                                                                |

| 2       | `[0,0,0,7,8,8,8,8,0,0]`         | `[0,0,0,8,8,8,8,7,0,0]`         | `(3, 8)`        | `[7, 8, 8, 8, 8]` | `valid: True, single: 7, block: 8, single_pos: start, block_len: 4, seg_len: 5`                      |
| 3       | `[0,0,3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]`         | `[0,0,4,4,3,0,0,0,0,0]`         | `(2, 5)`        | `[3, 4, 4]`     | `valid: True, single: 3, block: 4, single_pos: start, block_len: 2, seg_len: 3`                      |

All examples conform to the pattern:
*   Input is a single row.
*   A single contiguous non-white segment exists.
*   The segment contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
*   One color appears once (single pixel).
*   The other color appears multiple times contiguously (block).
*   The single pixel is adjacent to the block (at one end of the segment).
*   The transformation swaps the position of the single pixel and the block.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Assume the input is a grid containing exactly one row.
2.  Make a copy of the input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
3.  Identify the start and end indices of the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the input row. If no such sequence exists, return the original input grid.
4.  Extract this non-white sequence (segment).
5.  Analyze the segment:
    *   Count the occurrences of each color.
    *   Verify there are exactly two distinct non-white colors.
    *   Identify the color that appears only once (`single_pixel_color`) and the color that appears multiple times (`block_color`).
    *   Determine the length of the block (`block_length`, which is segment length - 1).
    *   Determine if the `single_pixel_color` is at the beginning or the end of the segment.
    *   If the segment structure does not match these criteria (e.g., wrong number of colors, single pixel not at an end), return the original input grid.
6.  Construct the new segment:
    *   If the single pixel was originally at the start, the new segment consists of the `block_color` repeated `block_length` times, followed by the `single_pixel_color`.
    *   If the single pixel was originally at the end, the new segment consists of the `single_pixel_color`, followed by the `block_color` repeated `block_length` times.
7.  Replace the portion of the output row corresponding to the original segment's indices with the newly constructed segment.
8.  Return the modified row packaged as a single-row grid (list containing one list).
