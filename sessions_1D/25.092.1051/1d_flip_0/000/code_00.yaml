Grid:
  Type: 1D array (row)
  BackgroundPixel:
    Value: 0
    Color: white
Objects:
  - Name: ColorBlock
    Identification: A contiguous sequence of non-BackgroundPixel values within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - Sequence: List of pixel values in order.
      - StartIndex: The grid index where the block begins.
      - EndIndex: The grid index where the block ends.
Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Left Shift (Rotation)
  Target: The Sequence property of the ColorBlock.
  Rule: Move the first element of the Sequence to the end of the Sequence.
Output:
  Construction:
    - Copy the input Grid.
    - Replace the pixels in the copied grid from StartIndex to EndIndex with the transformed Sequence of the ColorBlock.
