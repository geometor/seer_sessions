The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged in position and value.\n5.  **Object Modification:** Within the non-white block, the sequence of colors is altered. Specifically, the *first* pixel of the block in the input is moved to the *last* position of the block in the output. All other pixels within the block shift one position to the left to fill the gap left by the first pixel. This is effectively a left cyclic shift or rotation of the pixels within the block.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
