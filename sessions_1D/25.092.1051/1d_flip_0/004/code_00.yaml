InputType: NumPy Array
Grid:
  Structure: 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N), representing a single row.
  MaxDimensions: Not specified, but examples are (1, 25).
  BackgroundPixel:
    Value: 0
    Color: white
Objects:
  - Name: ColorBlock
    Identification: A contiguous sequence of non-BackgroundPixel values (non-zero) within the single row of the Grid. Assumed to be unique per input grid based on examples.
    Properties:
      - Sequence: List or NumPy array of pixel values in order.
      - StartIndex: The column index where the block begins.
      - EndIndex: The column index where the block ends (inclusive).
      - Length: The number of pixels in the block (EndIndex - StartIndex + 1).
Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Left Shift (Rotation)
  Target: The Sequence property of the ColorBlock.
  Rule:
    1. Extract the Sequence of pixels from the ColorBlock found in the input grid row.
    2. If the Sequence has more than one element, move the first element of the Sequence to the end.
    3. If the Sequence has zero or one element, it remains unchanged.
Output:
  Construction:
    - Create a copy of the input NumPy array grid.
    - Replace the pixel values in the copied grid's row from StartIndex to EndIndex with the transformed Sequence of the ColorBlock.
    - The output grid retains the same shape and data type as the input grid.
