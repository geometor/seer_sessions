InputGrid:
  Type: List containing a single List of integers (representing a 1xN grid).
  Height: 1
  Width: Variable (e.g., 25 in the examples)
  BackgroundPixel:
    Value: 0
    Color: white
Objects:
  - Name: ColorBlock
    Identification: The single contiguous sequence of non-BackgroundPixel values within the InputGrid's row.
    Existence: Assumed to exist in valid inputs based on examples.
    Properties:
      - PixelSequence: A list of integer pixel values.
      - StartIndex: The 0-based column index where the block begins.
      - EndIndex: The 0-based column index where the block ends.
      - Length: The number of pixels in the block (EndIndex - StartIndex + 1).
Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Left Shift (List Rotation)
  Target: The PixelSequence of the ColorBlock.
  Rule:
    1. Check if the PixelSequence has more than one element.
    2. If yes, remove the first element from the PixelSequence.
    3. Append the removed element to the end of the PixelSequence.
    4. If no (sequence has 0 or 1 element), the sequence remains unchanged.
OutputGrid:
  Construction:
    - Create a copy of the InputGrid's row.
    - Identify the ColorBlock in the input row (StartIndex, EndIndex, PixelSequence).
    - Apply the Cyclic Left Shift transformation to the PixelSequence, yielding a TransformedPixelSequence.
    - Replace the pixels in the copied row from StartIndex to EndIndex with the TransformedPixelSequence.
    - Format the result as a List containing the single modified List (row).
