Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of a single row (a 1D grid) of pixels.
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).
3.  **Foreground Object:** In each input row, there is a single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation focuses solely on this non-white block. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged in position and value.
5.  **Object Modification:** Within the non-white block, the sequence of colors is altered. Specifically, the *first* pixel of the block in the input is moved to the *last* position of the block in the output. All other pixels within the block shift one position to the left to fill the gap left by the first pixel. This is effectively a left cyclic shift or rotation of the pixels within the block.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (row)
  BackgroundPixel:
    Value: 0
    Color: white
Objects:
  - Name: ColorBlock
    Identification: A contiguous sequence of non-BackgroundPixel values within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - Sequence: List of pixel values in order.
      - StartIndex: The grid index where the block begins.
      - EndIndex: The grid index where the block ends.
Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Left Shift (Rotation)
  Target: The Sequence property of the ColorBlock.
  Rule: Move the first element of the Sequence to the end of the Sequence.
Output:
  Construction:
    - Copy the input Grid.
    - Replace the pixels in the copied grid from StartIndex to EndIndex with the transformed Sequence of the ColorBlock.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in the input row. Record its starting index, ending index, and the sequence of pixel values.
2.  Perform a cyclic left shift on the identified sequence of pixel values: take the first pixel value from the sequence and append it to the end.
3.  Create the output row by copying the input row.
4.  Replace the segment of the output row corresponding to the original block's location (from the starting index to the ending index) with the modified (cyclically shifted) sequence of pixel values.
```python
import numpy as np
import copy

"""
