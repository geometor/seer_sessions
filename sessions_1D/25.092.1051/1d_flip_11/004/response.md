## General Assessment

The previous analysis correctly identified the key components: a single 'singleton' pixel and an adjacent 'block' of pixels, forming a contiguous 'span'. The transformation involves rearranging the pixels *within* this span. However, the specific rearrangement operation was incorrectly implemented. The error messages (`list index out of range`) are unexpected if the span identification and slicing are correct; this might suggest an edge case not handled or a subtle bug in indexing or assignment, but the primary logical flaw identified is the direction of the transformation/rotation within the span.

The core idea is that the singleton pixel moves to the *opposite end* of the identified span, and the block pixels shift uniformly to fill the vacated space. This is equivalent to a circular shift (roll) of the span sequence. The direction of the roll depends on the singleton's initial position.

Strategy:
1.  Verify the identified spans and singleton positions for each example.
2.  Determine the correct roll direction (`numpy.roll`) needed for each case.
3.  Correct the logic in the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to use the appropriate roll direction based on the singleton's position (left or right end of the span).

## Metrics

Let's re-evaluate each example to confirm the span, singleton position, and the required transformation.

    # Verify contiguity
    if len(non_white_indices) != (span_end - span_start + 1):

    span_sequence_output = output_row[span_start : span_end + 1] # Assume span location is same

    singleton_pos = 'left' if singleton_index_in_span == 0 else 'right'

    if np.array_equal(np.roll(span_sequence_input, 1), span_sequence_output):
        required_roll = 1 # roll right

        required_roll = -1 # roll left

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Determine the start and end indices of the contiguous span formed by these non-white pixels. Verify that there are no gaps (i.e., all pixels between the start and end indices are non-white). If not contiguous, or fewer than two non-white pixels exist, return the input unchanged.
3.  Extract the sequence of pixels within this span.
4.  Count the occurrences of each color within the span. Identify the 'singleton' color (appears once) and the 'block' color (appears multiple times). Verify that there is exactly one singleton color and one block color within the span. If not, return the input unchanged.
5.  Determine the position of the singleton pixel within the span. Verify it is either at the very beginning (left end) or the very end (right end) of the span sequence. If not, return the input unchanged.
6.  Create a copy of the input row for the output.
7.  Perform a circular shift (roll) on the extracted span sequence:
    *   If the singleton was at the left end, roll the sequence **left** by one position (e.g., `[S, B, B]` becomes `[B, B, S]`).
    *   If the singleton was at the right end, roll the sequence **right** by one position (e.g., `[B, B, S]` becomes `[S, B, B]`).
8.  Place the rolled sequence back into the output row at the original span's start and end indices.
9.  Return the modified row as the output grid (wrapped in a list).
