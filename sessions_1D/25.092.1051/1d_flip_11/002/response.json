            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: a 'singleton' pixel and a 'block' of pixels. The relationship (adjacency) was also correctly identified. However, the transformation rule was inaccurately described. The initial code assumed only the singleton moved, leaving the block static, which led to incorrect outputs.\n\nThe key insight from comparing the failed outputs with the expected outputs is that both the singleton *and* the block change position. They maintain their relative adjacency but effectively swap ends within the contiguous span they jointly occupy. This behavior resembles a **rotation** of the combined object (singleton + block) within its original boundaries.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors involves:\n1.  Precisely identifying the start and end indices of the combined contiguous span formed by the singleton and the block.\n2.  Extracting the sequence of pixels within this span.\n3.  Performing a 1-position rotation on this sequence:\n    *   Rotate right if the singleton was originally at the left end of the span.\n    *   Rotate left if the singleton was originally at the right end of the span.\n4.  Placing the rotated sequence back into the output grid at the original start index of the span.\n5.  Ensuring all pixels outside this span remain unchanged.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the key assumptions about the structure using code execution.\n\n"
