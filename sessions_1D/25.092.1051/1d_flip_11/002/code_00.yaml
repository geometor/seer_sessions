task_type: object_manipulation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as single row)
  size_preservation: True
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - name: singleton
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white, unique instance in the grid
      - size: 1 pixel
  - name: block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white, different from singleton, multiple instances
      - shape: contiguous horizontal line
      - size: >= 1 pixel
  - name: combined_span
    count: 1
    properties:
      - composition: concatenation of singleton and block pixels
      - shape: contiguous horizontal line
      - location: occupies indices from min(singleton_idx, block_start_idx) to max(singleton_idx, block_end_idx)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    subject: singleton
    object: block
    details: The singleton is immediately adjacent (left or right) to the block.
actions:
  - name: rotate_span
    target: combined_span
    details:
      - The sequence of pixels within the combined_span is rotated by one position.
      - If the singleton is originally at the left end of the span, the rotation is to the right (last element becomes first).
      - If the singleton is originally at the right end of the span, the rotation is to the left (first element becomes last).
      - The rotated sequence replaces the original sequence within the same start and end indices in the output grid.
invariants:
  - background_pixels: Unchanged (pixels outside the combined_span)
  - grid_dimensions: Unchanged
  - object_colors: Colors of singleton and block pixels are preserved.
  - object_counts: Number of singleton and block pixels are preserved.
  - span_location: The start and end indices of the combined_span remain the same between input and output.
