Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays represented within a 2D structure). The length of the row remains constant between input and output.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use white (0) as a background color. Other colors observed are orange (7), magenta (6), azure (8), and blue (1).
3.  **Key Objects:** In each input, there appear to be two distinct non-white objects:
    *   A single pixel of one color (e.g., orange 7 in train_1, azure 8 in train_2, orange 7 in train_3). Let's call this the "singleton".
    *   A contiguous horizontal block of one or more pixels of another color (e.g., magenta 6 in train_1 and train_3, blue 1 in train_2). Let's call this the "block".
4.  **Relationship:** The singleton pixel is always immediately adjacent (horizontally) to the block.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the singleton pixel changing its position relative to the block. It moves from one side of the block (e.g., left) to the immediately adjacent position on the *other* side of the block (e.g., right).
6.  **Background/Other Pixels:** The white (0) background pixels remain unchanged. The pixels forming the block also remain in their original positions. The original position of the singleton pixel becomes white (0) in the output.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as single row)
  size_preservation: True
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - name: singleton
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., 7, 8)
      - size: 1 pixel
      - unique_color_instance: True # only one pixel of this color in the input
  - name: block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., 6, 1), different from singleton color
      - shape: contiguous horizontal line
      - size: 1 or more pixels
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    subject: singleton
    object: block
    details: The singleton is immediately adjacent (left or right) to the block.
actions:
  - name: move_singleton
    target: singleton
    details:
      - The singleton pixel moves its position.
      - The original position of the singleton becomes the background color (0).
      - The new position is immediately adjacent to the block, but on the side opposite its original position.
      - The block itself does not move or change color.
invariants:
  - background_pixels: Unchanged
  - block_pixels: Position and color unchanged
  - grid_dimensions: Unchanged
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  Find the pixel whose color appears only once in the grid; this is the 'singleton'.
3.  Find the contiguous horizontal block of pixels of another single non-white color; this is the 'block'.
4.  Verify that the 'singleton' is horizontally adjacent to the 'block'.
5.  Determine if the 'singleton' is to the left or right of the 'block'.
6.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
7.  In the output grid, change the color of the 'singleton's original position to white (0).
8.  If the 'singleton' was originally to the left of the 'block', place the 'singleton' pixel immediately to the right of the 'block' in the output grid.
9.  If the 'singleton' was originally to the right of the 'block', place the 'singleton' pixel immediately to the left of the 'block' in the output grid.
10. Return the modified grid as the output.

"""
Transformation Rule:
Identify two non-white objects in the 1D input grid: a 'singleton' (a single pixel of one color) and a 'block' (a contiguous horizontal line of one or more pixels of another color). The singleton is always adjacent to the block. Move the singleton pixel from its original position to the position immediately adjacent to the block on the opposite side. The original position of the singleton becomes white (0). The block and background pixels remain unchanged.
