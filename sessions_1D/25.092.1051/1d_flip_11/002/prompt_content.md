Transformation Rule:
Identify two non-white objects in the 1D input grid: a 'singleton' (a single pixel of one color) and a 'block' (a contiguous horizontal line of one or more pixels of another color). The singleton is always adjacent to the block. Move the singleton pixel from its original position to the position immediately adjacent to the block on the opposite side. The original position of the singleton becomes white (0). The block and background pixels remain unchanged.
