            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays represented within a 2D structure). The length of the row remains constant between input and output.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use white (0) as a background color. Other colors observed are orange (7), magenta (6), azure (8), and blue (1).\n3.  **Key Objects:** In each input, there appear to be two distinct non-white objects:\n    *   A single pixel of one color (e.g., orange 7 in train_1, azure 8 in train_2, orange 7 in train_3). Let's call this the \"singleton\".\n    *   A contiguous horizontal block of one or more pixels of another color (e.g., magenta 6 in train_1 and train_3, blue 1 in train_2). Let's call this the \"block\".\n4.  **Relationship:** The singleton pixel is always immediately adjacent (horizontally) to the block.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the singleton pixel changing its position relative to the block. It moves from one side of the block (e.g., left) to the immediately adjacent position on the *other* side of the block (e.g., right).\n6.  **Background/Other Pixels:** The white (0) background pixels remain unchanged. The pixels forming the block also remain in their original positions. The original position of the singleton pixel becomes white (0) in the output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
