task_type: object_manipulation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as single row)
  size_preservation: True
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - name: singleton
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., 7, 8)
      - size: 1 pixel
      - unique_color_instance: True # only one pixel of this color in the input
  - name: block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., 6, 1), different from singleton color
      - shape: contiguous horizontal line
      - size: 1 or more pixels
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    subject: singleton
    object: block
    details: The singleton is immediately adjacent (left or right) to the block.
actions:
  - name: move_singleton
    target: singleton
    details:
      - The singleton pixel moves its position.
      - The original position of the singleton becomes the background color (0).
      - The new position is immediately adjacent to the block, but on the side opposite its original position.
      - The block itself does not move or change color.
invariants:
  - background_pixels: Unchanged
  - block_pixels: Position and color unchanged
  - grid_dimensions: Unchanged
