            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code implements a transformation rule based on identifying a 'singleton' pixel and an adjacent 'block' of pixels, forming a contiguous non-white 'span'. The transformation is defined as a circular shift (roll) of the pixels within this span. The direction of the shift depends on whether the singleton is at the left or right end of the span.\n\nHowever, the execution results show that the provided code failed to produce the expected output for all training examples, instead returning the original input grid. This discrepancy is puzzling because a manual trace of the code logic with the example inputs suggests it *should* produce the correct outputs based on the circular shift interpretation.\n\nPossible reasons for the failure include:\n1.  A subtle bug in the `find_span_and_singleton_pos` function causing it to incorrectly return `None`, thus preventing the transformation.\n2.  An issue in the main `transform` function related to array copying, slicing, or assignment, although the code appears standard.\n3.  An incorrect assumption about the `np.roll` direction (though the current implementation seems consistent with the examples).\n4.  An execution environment issue or a difference between the analyzed code and the executed code.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe most likely interpretation based *purely on the visual input/output examples* is the circular shift within the span. Despite the execution failure report, the natural language program and facts will be refined based on this interpretation, as it directly maps the observed visual change. The implementation details (especially the conditions in `find_span_and_singleton_pos` and the `np.roll` application) should be carefully re-examined in the coding phase.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Grid                 | Expected Output            | Transformed Output (Reported) | Match | Pixels Off | Span        | Singleton Pos | Required Roll | Code's Roll Action |\n| :------ | :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :---- | :--------- | :---------- | :------------ | :------------ | :----------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0,7,6,6,6,0,...]`        | `[0,6,6,6,7,0,...]`        | `[0,7,6,6,6,0,...]`           | False | 2          | `[7,6,6,6]` | left          | `roll(...,-1)` | `roll(...,-1)`     |\n| train_2 | `[...0,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,0...]` | `[...0,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,0...]` | `[...0,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,0...]`   | False | 2          | `[8,1..1]`  | left          | `roll(...,-1)` | `roll(...,-1)`     |\n| train_3 | `[7,6,6,6,0,...]`          | `[6,6,6,7,0,...]`          | `[7,6,6,6,0,...]`             | False | 2          | `[7,6,6,6]` | left          | `roll(...,-1)` | `roll(...,-1)`     |\n\n*Note: The 'Code's Roll Action' column indicates the action the provided Python code *should* have taken based on its logic, even though the reported output suggests no transformation occurred.*\n\n## Facts\n\n"

If this condition isn't met (e.g., two singletons, or more than two colors), return the original grid.\n10. Determine the position of the singleton pixel within the original sequence: check if the pixel at `span_start` or the pixel at `span_end` has the singleton color.\n11.
