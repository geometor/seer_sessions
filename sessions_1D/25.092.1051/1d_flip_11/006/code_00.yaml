task_type: object_manipulation_1d
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
  size_preservation: True
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - name: combined_span
    count: 1
    properties:
      - definition: A maximal contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
      - composition: Must contain exactly two distinct non-white colors.
      - internal_structure: One color appears exactly once (singleton), the other appears one or more times (block).
      - contiguity: No background pixels (0) are allowed within the span.
  - name: singleton_pixel
    count: 1 (within the span)
    properties:
      - definition: The pixel within the span whose color appears only once in that span.
      - location: Must be located at either the leftmost or the rightmost position of the 'combined_span'.
  - name: block_pixels
    count: 1 or more (within the span)
    properties:
      - definition: The pixel(s) within the span whose color appears more than once (or exactly once if the span length is 2).
      - contiguity: Forms a contiguous sub-sequence within the span, adjacent to the singleton.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    subject: singleton_pixel
    object: block_pixels
    details: The singleton_pixel is immediately adjacent to one end of the sequence of block_pixels, together forming the contiguous combined_span.
  - type: location
    subject: singleton_pixel
    object: combined_span
    details: The singleton_pixel occupies either the starting index or the ending index of the combined_span.
actions:
  - name: circular_shift_span
    target: combined_span
    details:
      - Identify the sequence of pixels constituting the combined_span.
      - Perform a circular shift (numpy.roll) on this sequence.
      - If the singleton_pixel was originally at the left end (start index) of the span, shift the sequence LEFT by 1 position (np.roll(sequence, -1)).
      - If the singleton_pixel was originally at the right end (end index) of the span, shift the sequence RIGHT by 1 position (np.roll(sequence, 1)).
      - Place the resulting shifted sequence back into the original grid location occupied by the combined_span.
invariants:
  - background_pixels: Pixels outside the combined_span remain unchanged.
  - grid_dimensions: Unchanged.
  - colors_present: The set and count of each color remain the same, only their positions within the span change.
