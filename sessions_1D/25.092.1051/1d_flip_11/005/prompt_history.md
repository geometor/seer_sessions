Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays represented within a 2D structure). The length of the row remains constant between input and output.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use white (0) as a background color. Other colors observed are orange (7), magenta (6), azure (8), and blue (1).
3.  **Key Objects:** In each input, there appear to be two distinct non-white objects:
    *   A single pixel of one color (e.g., orange 7 in train_1, azure 8 in train_2, orange 7 in train_3). Let's call this the "singleton".
    *   A contiguous horizontal block of one or more pixels of another color (e.g., magenta 6 in train_1 and train_3, blue 1 in train_2). Let's call this the "block".
4.  **Relationship:** The singleton pixel is always immediately adjacent (horizontally) to the block.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the singleton pixel changing its position relative to the block. It moves from one side of the block (e.g., left) to the immediately adjacent position on the *other* side of the block (e.g., right).
6.  **Background/Other Pixels:** The white (0) background pixels remain unchanged. The pixels forming the block also remain in their original positions. The original position of the singleton pixel becomes white (0) in the output.

      - The new position is immediately adjacent to the block, but on the side opposite its original position.
      - The block itself does not move or change color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  Find the pixel whose color appears only once in the grid; this is the 'singleton'.
3.  Find the contiguous horizontal block of pixels of another single non-white color; this is the 'block'.
4.  Verify that the 'singleton' is horizontally adjacent to the 'block'.
5.  Determine if the 'singleton' is to the left or right of the 'block'.
6.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
7.  In the output grid, change the color of the 'singleton's original position to white (0).
8.  If the 'singleton' was originally to the left of the 'block', place the 'singleton' pixel immediately to the right of the 'block' in the output grid.
9.  If the 'singleton' was originally to the right of the 'block', place the 'singleton' pixel immediately to the left of the 'block' in the output grid.
10. Return the modified grid as the output.

Error: list index out of range

## Example 3:
Error: list index out of range
## General Assessment

The previous analysis correctly identified the key components: a single 'singleton' pixel and an adjacent 'block' of pixels, forming a contiguous 'span'. The transformation involves rearranging the pixels *within* this span. However, the specific rearrangement operation was incorrectly implemented. The error messages (`list index out of range`) are unexpected if the span identification and slicing are correct; this might suggest an edge case not handled or a subtle bug in indexing or assignment, but the primary logical flaw identified is the direction of the transformation/rotation within the span.

The core idea is that the singleton pixel moves to the *opposite end* of the identified span, and the block pixels shift uniformly to fill the vacated space. This is equivalent to a circular shift (roll) of the span sequence. The direction of the roll depends on the singleton's initial position.

Strategy:
1.  Verify the identified spans and singleton positions for each example.
2.  Determine the correct roll direction (`numpy.roll`) needed for each case.
3.  Correct the logic in the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to use the appropriate roll direction based on the singleton's position (left or right end of the span).

## Metrics

Let's re-evaluate each example to confirm the span, singleton position, and the required transformation.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation_within_span
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as single row)
  size_preservation: True
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - name: singleton
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - size: 1 pixel
      - unique_color_instance: True # Only one pixel of this color in the input row
  - name: block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-white, different from singleton
      - shape: contiguous horizontal line
      - size: 1 or more pixels
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    subject: singleton
    object: block
    details: The singleton is immediately adjacent (left or right) to the block, forming a single contiguous span of non-white pixels.
  - type: location
    subject: singleton
    details: The singleton is located at one of the two ends (leftmost or rightmost position) of the combined non-white span.
actions:
  - name: rearrange_span
    target: the contiguous span formed by the singleton and the block
    details:
      - Identify the start and end indices of the combined non-white span.
      - Extract the sequence of pixels within this span.
      - Perform a circular shift (roll) on the extracted sequence.
      - If the singleton was originally at the left end of the span, roll the sequence left by one position (numpy.roll(sequence, -1)).
      - If the singleton was originally at the right end of the span, roll the sequence right by one position (numpy.roll(sequence, 1)).
      - Place the resulting rolled sequence back into the original span location (start to end indices) in the output grid.
invariants:
  - background_pixels: Unchanged position and color.
  - span_location: The start and end indices of the non-white span remain the same in the output grid.
  - object_colors: The colors of the singleton and block pixels are preserved, only their positions within the span change.
  - grid_dimensions: Unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Determine the start and end indices of the contiguous span formed by these non-white pixels. Verify that there are no gaps (i.e., all pixels between the start and end indices are non-white). If not contiguous, or fewer than two non-white pixels exist, return the input unchanged.
3.  Extract the sequence of pixels within this span.
4.  Count the occurrences of each color within the span. Identify the 'singleton' color (appears once) and the 'block' color (appears multiple times). Verify that there is exactly one singleton color and one block color within the span. If not, return the input unchanged.
5.  Determine the position of the singleton pixel within the span. Verify it is either at the very beginning (left end) or the very end (right end) of the span sequence. If not, return the input unchanged.
6.  Create a copy of the input row for the output.
7.  Perform a circular shift (roll) on the extracted span sequence:
    *   If the singleton was at the left end, roll the sequence **left** by one position (e.g., `[S, B, B]` becomes `[B, B, S]`).
    *   If the singleton was at the right end, roll the sequence **right** by one position (e.g., `[B, B, S]` becomes `[S, B, B]`).
8.  Place the rolled sequence back into the output row at the original span's start and end indices.
9.  Return the modified row as the output grid (wrapped in a list).
