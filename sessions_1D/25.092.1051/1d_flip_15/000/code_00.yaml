task_description: "Move a single 'marker' pixel from the position before a contiguous block of different-colored pixels to the position immediately after that block."
elements:
  - name: marker_pixel
    description: A single non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white color.
  - name: object_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white color, different from the marker_pixel color.
      - length: Variable (>= 1).
  - name: background
    description: Pixels with color white (0).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The marker_pixel is immediately to the left of the first pixel of the object_block in the input.
  - type: color_difference
    description: The color of the marker_pixel is different from the color of the pixels in the object_block.
action:
  - name: find_pattern
    description: Locate the marker_pixel and the adjacent object_block based on their adjacency and color difference.
  - name: move_marker
    description: Relocate the marker_pixel to the position immediately following the last pixel of the object_block.
    constraints: The object_block itself does not move. Other pixels (background) remain in their positions.
input_output_structure:
  - input: Single row (1D array) containing the marker_pixel, object_block, and background pixels.
  - output: Single row (1D array) with the marker_pixel repositioned after the object_block.
