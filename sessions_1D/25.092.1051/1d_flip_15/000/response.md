Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are presented as single rows (1D arrays) of colors. The length of the row is consistent across examples (10 pixels).
2.  **Key Elements:** Each input contains a distinctive pattern: a single pixel of one color (e.g., yellow in ex 1, yellow in ex 2, red in ex 3) immediately followed by a contiguous block of one or more pixels of *another* color (e.g., red block in ex 1, blue block in ex 2, green block in ex 3). The rest of the row consists of white pixels (0).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the single initial pixel (the 'marker' pixel) from its position *before* the block to the position immediately *after* the block. The block itself remains in its original location relative to the background white pixels.
4.  **Invariance:** The colors and lengths of the marker pixel and the block remain unchanged. The background white pixels also remain unchanged in their relative positions.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Move a single 'marker' pixel from the position before a contiguous block of different-colored pixels to the position immediately after that block."
elements:
  - name: marker_pixel
    description: A single non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white color.
  - name: object_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white color, different from the marker_pixel color.
      - length: Variable (>= 1).
  - name: background
    description: Pixels with color white (0).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The marker_pixel is immediately to the left of the first pixel of the object_block in the input.
  - type: color_difference
    description: The color of the marker_pixel is different from the color of the pixels in the object_block.
action:
  - name: find_pattern
    description: Locate the marker_pixel and the adjacent object_block based on their adjacency and color difference.
  - name: move_marker
    description: Relocate the marker_pixel to the position immediately following the last pixel of the object_block.
    constraints: The object_block itself does not move. Other pixels (background) remain in their positions.
input_output_structure:
  - input: Single row (1D array) containing the marker_pixel, object_block, and background pixels.
  - output: Single row (1D array) with the marker_pixel repositioned after the object_block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input row from left to right.
2.  Identify the index `i` of a non-white pixel (the 'marker pixel') such that the pixel at index `i+1` is also non-white *and* has a different color than the pixel at `i`.
3.  Determine the extent of the contiguous block of pixels starting at `i+1` that all share the same color (the 'object block'). Let the index of the last pixel in this block be `j`.
4.  Construct the output row by:
    a.  Taking all pixels from the input row *before* index `i`.
    b.  Appending the pixels from the 'object block' (input row from index `i+1` to `j`).
    c.  Appending the 'marker pixel' (the pixel originally at index `i`).
    d.  Appending all remaining pixels from the input row (from index `j+1` onwards).
