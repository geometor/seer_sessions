The length of the row is consistent across examples (10 pixels).\n2.  **Key Elements:** Each input contains a distinctive pattern: a single pixel of one color (e.g., yellow in ex 1, yellow in ex 2, red in ex 3) immediately followed by a contiguous block of one or more pixels of *another* color (e.g., red block in ex 1, blue block in ex 2, green block in ex 3). The rest of the row consists of white pixels (0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the single initial pixel (the 'marker' pixel) from its position *before* the block to the position immediately *after* the block. The block itself remains in its original location relative to the background white pixels.\n4.  **Invariance:** The colors and lengths of the marker pixel and the block remain unchanged. The background white pixels also remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
