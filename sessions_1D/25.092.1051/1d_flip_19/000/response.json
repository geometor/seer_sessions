Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (pixels with values 1-9) surrounded by white pixels (value 0). The white pixels act as background or padding. The transformation modifies the arrangement of colors *within* the non-white block, while the positions of the white pixels and the overall location of the non-white block remain unchanged. Specifically, the first pixel of the non-white block is moved to the end of that block, and all other pixels within the block shift one position to the left.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
