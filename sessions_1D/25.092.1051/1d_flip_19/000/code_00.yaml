task_type: array_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D
grid_size: variable width (1xN)
pixel_colors: 0-9 representing colors (0=white, 1-9=non-white)

input_features:
  - background:
      color: white (0)
      description: Surrounds the main object.
  - object:
      description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      composition: Sequence of non-white colors (1-9).
      location: Varies across examples.
      size: Varies across examples (length >= 2).

output_features:
  - background:
      description: Identical in position and color to the input background.
  - object:
      description: The same contiguous block as in the input, but with rearranged colors.
      composition: The sequence of non-white colors from the input object, cyclically shifted left by one position.
      location: Same indices as the input object block.
      size: Same length as the input object block.

transformation:
  - identify: Locate the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - extract: Get the sequence of colors within this block.
  - manipulate: Perform a left cyclic shift on the extracted sequence (move the first element to the end).
  - replace: Place the manipulated sequence back into the original start and end indices in the grid.
  - invariant: White pixels (value 0) remain unchanged.
