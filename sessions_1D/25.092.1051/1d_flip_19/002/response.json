            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: finding a contiguous block of non-white pixels and performing a left cyclic shift on the colors within that block. However, the code failed because it assumed a 1D list input structure (`List[int]`), while the ARC framework likely provides inputs as 2D arrays (e.g., `List[List[int]]` or NumPy arrays), even if the grid visually appears as a single row (e.g., a 1xN grid). The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" occurs when trying to evaluate a condition like `if pixel > 0:` where `pixel` itself is an array/list (representing a row or part of it) instead of a single integer value.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the code to handle the 2D input structure. Since all examples show the transformation occurring within a single row, the revised approach will identify the relevant row (likely the only row in these specific examples) and apply the existing block-finding and shifting logic to that row.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n"
