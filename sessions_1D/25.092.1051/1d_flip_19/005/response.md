"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying the first contiguous block of non-white 
pixels (values 1-9) in the first row. It then performs a left cyclic shift 
on the colors within that block (moves the first element to the end) and 
updates the first row of the grid accordingly. Other rows and white pixels 
remain unchanged. Assumes input is a 2D grid structure (list of lists or 
NumPy array).
