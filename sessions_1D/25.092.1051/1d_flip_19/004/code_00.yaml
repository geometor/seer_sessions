task_type: array_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 2D (typically 1xN, transformation applied only to the first row)
grid_size: variable width, fixed height of 1 in examples
data_type: Input likely NumPy array, handling needed for list operations.
pixel_colors: 0-9 representing colors (0=white, 1-9=non-white)

input_features:
  - target_row: The first row of the input grid.
  - background:
      color: white (0)
      description: Surrounds the main object within the target row.
  - object:
      description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the target row.
      composition: Sequence of non-white colors (1-9).
      location: Varies across examples within the target row.
      size: Varies across examples (length >= 2).

output_features:
  - grid: Identical shape to the input grid.
  - target_row: The first row, modified.
  - background:
      description: Identical in position and color to the input background within the target row.
  - object:
      description: The same contiguous block as in the input, but with rearranged colors, placed back into the target row.
      composition: The sequence of non-white colors from the input object, cyclically shifted left by one position.
      location: Same indices as the input object block within the target row.
      size: Same length as the input object block.
  - invariant_rows: All rows other than the first remain unchanged (if any exist, though examples only show 1 row).
  - invariant_pixels: White pixels (value 0) within the target row remain unchanged.

transformation:
  - handle_input: Accept a 2D grid (likely NumPy array).
  - validate_input: Check if the grid has at least one row.
  - select_row: Isolate the first row for processing.
  - identify_block: Locate the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the first row.
  - extract_block: Get the sequence of colors within this block as a list.
  - manipulate_block: Perform a left cyclic shift on the extracted list (move the first element to the end).
  - replace_block: Place the manipulated list back into the original start and end indices in a copy of the first row.
  - construct_output: Return a grid (matching input type, likely NumPy array) with the modified first row and any other rows unchanged.
