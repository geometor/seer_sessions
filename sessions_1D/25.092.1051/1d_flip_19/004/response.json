This occurred in all three training examples, indicating a fundamental issue with how the code handles the input data type, specifically in conditional checks.\n\nThe core transformation logic (identify contiguous non-white block in the first row, perform a left cyclic shift) appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples. The error is likely located in the initial checks or data handling within the `transform` function.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Modify Boolean Checks:** Identify the location where a NumPy array might be used in a boolean context. The most likely candidate is the check for an empty grid (`if not output_grid:`). Replace this with a check that is safe for both lists and NumPy arrays, such as checking the number of rows (`if len(output_grid) == 0:`).\n2.  **Ensure List Operations:** Explicitly convert the target row (the first row) to a Python list *before* passing it to helper functions (`find_non_white_block`) or performing list-specific operations (slicing, concatenation in `cyclic_shift_left`), ensuring compatibility regardless of whether the input row was originally a list or a NumPy array slice.\n3.  **Verify Assumptions:** Re-confirm that the transformation only applies to the first row and involves a single contiguous block of non-white pixels per the examples.\n4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the handling of potential NumPy inputs and the focus on the first row.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nBased on the error and the structure of ARC tasks, the input grids are likely multi-dimensional arrays (even if only 1 row high).\n\n<ctrl97>tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Simulate the data structures based on the problem description and errors\ntrain_1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\ntrain_1_output = np.array([[0, 0, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\ntrain_2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]])\ntrain_2_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0]])\n\ntrain_3_input = np.array([[5, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\ntrain_3_output = np.array([[6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\n# --- Example 1 ---\nprint(\"--- Example 1 ---\")\ninput_shape = train_1_input.shape\noutput_shape = train_1_output.shape\nprint(f\"Input Shape: {input_shape}\")\nprint(f\"Output Shape: {output_shape}\")\n# Find block\nrow = train_1_input[0]\nstart, end = -1, -1\nin_block = False\nfor i, p in enumerate(row):\n    if p > 0:\n        if not in_block: start = i; in_block = True\n        end = i\n    elif in_block: break\nblock = row[start:end+1]\nprint(f\"Identified Block: {list(block)} at indices [{start}, {end}]\")\nprint(f\"Expected Output Block: {list(train_1_output[0][start:end+1])}\")\n\n# --- Example 2 ---\nprint(\"\\n--- Example 2 ---\")\ninput_shape = train_2_input.shape\noutput_shape = train_2_output.shape\nprint(f\"Input Shape: {input_shape}\")\nprint(f\"Output Shape: {output_shape}\")\n# Find block\nrow = train_2_input[0]\nstart, end = -1, -1\nin_block = False\nfor i, p in enumerate(row):\n    if p > 0:\n        if not in_block: start = i; in_block = True\n        end = i\n    elif in_block: break\nblock = row[start:end+1]\nprint(f\"Identified Block: {list(block)} at indices [{start}, {end}]\")\nprint(f\"Expected Output Block: {list(train_2_output[0][start:end+1])}\")\n\n# --- Example 3 ---\nprint(\"\\n--- Example 3 ---\")\ninput_shape = train_3_input.shape\noutput_shape = train_3_output.shape\nprint(f\"Input Shape: {input_shape}\")\nprint(f\"Output Shape: {output_shape}\")\n# Find block\nrow = train_3_input[0]\nstart, end = -1, -1\nin_block = False\nfor i, p in enumerate(row):\n    if p > 0:\n        if not in_block: start = i; in_block = True\n        end = i\n    elif in_block: break\nblock = row[start:end+1]\nprint(f\"Identified Block: {list(block)} at indices [{start}, {end}]\")\nprint(f\"Expected Output Block: {list(train_3_output[0][start:end+1])}\")\n\n# Check the faulty boolean condition\nprint(\"\\n--- NumPy Boolean Check ---\")\ntry:\n    print(f\"Result of 'if not train_1_input:' -> Raises Error: {not train_1_input}\")\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"Result of 'if not train_1_input:' -> Raises Error: {e}\")\n\n# Check the proposed fix\nprint(f\"Result of 'if len(train_1_input) == 0:' -> {len(train_1_input) == 0}\")\nempty_np_array = np.array([]) # Shape (0,)\nprint(f\"Result of 'if len(empty_np_array) == 0:' -> {len(empty_np_array) == 0}\")\nempty_np_array_2d = np.empty((0,5)) # Shape (0,5)\nprint(f\"Result of 'if len(empty_np_array_2d) == 0:' -> {len(empty_np_array_2d) == 0}\")"

However, an empty grid in ARC is usually represented as `[]` (list) or `np.empty((0, N))` or `np.empty((N, 0))`. The check `if not output_grid:` which caused the error fails for *any* non-empty NumPy array. Using `if len(output_grid) == 0:` avoids the truthiness error and correctly handles `[]` and `np.empty((0,N))`. It would incorrectly proceed for `np.array([[]])`, but this might be an edge case not present in ARC or handled differently. Let's stick with `if len(output_grid) == 0:`.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 101)\n"
