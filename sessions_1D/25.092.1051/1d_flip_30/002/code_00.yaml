task_type: array_manipulation_1d_in_2d_representation
grid_dimensionality: Input/Output are 2D arrays with shape (1, N). Effective logic operates on the single row.
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: grid_row
    description: The single row within the 2D input array containing pixel data.
  - name: non_white_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the grid_row.
    properties:
      colors: Contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
      location: Can be anywhere within the row, possibly touching the edges.
  - name: singleton_pixel
    description: A single pixel within the non_white_block whose color appears only once in the block.
    properties:
      color: Any non-white color.
      count: 1 within the non_white_block.
      location: Always at one of the two ends of the non_white_block.
  - name: sequence_pixels
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels within the non_white_block, all having the same color, which is different from the singleton_pixel's color.
    properties:
      color: Any non-white color, different from singleton_pixel color.
      count: > 1 within the non_white_block.
      location: Forms the rest of the non_white_block adjacent to the singleton_pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: singleton_pixel
    object2: sequence_pixels
    details: The singleton_pixel is directly adjacent to one end of the sequence_pixels within the non_white_block.
action:
  - type: move
    object: singleton_pixel
    details: The singleton_pixel is moved from its original end of the non_white_block to the opposite end, preserving the order of the sequence_pixels.
invariants:
  - The background white pixels remain unchanged.
  - The colors and number of pixels within the non_white_block remain the same; only their order changes.
  - The dimensions of the grid (1, N) remain unchanged.
input_output_format:
  - type: numpy_array
    shape: (1, width) where width varies per task instance but is consistent between input/output.
