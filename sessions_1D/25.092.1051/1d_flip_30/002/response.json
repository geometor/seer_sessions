            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core transformation logic: locating a contiguous block of non-white pixels containing exactly two colors (one singleton, one sequence) and moving the singleton pixel to the opposite end of the block. However, the code failed execution with a `ValueError` related to NumPy array truthiness.\n\nThis strongly suggests that the input grids, although representing a single row, are being passed to the `transform` function as 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, N), not as 1D Python lists as the previous code assumed. The `if pixel != 0:` check within `find_non_white_block` fails when `pixel` is an entire NumPy array row derived from iterating over a list containing a single row array (`list(numpy_array_1xN)`).\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle a 2D NumPy array input.\n2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input array.\n3.  Convert this row to a Python list to utilize the existing helper functions (`find_non_white_block`, `analyze_block`).\n4.  Perform the transformation logic on the extracted list.\n5.  Convert the transformed list back into a 2D NumPy array with the original shape (1, N).\n6.  The core logic within `find_non_white_block` and `analyze_block` appears sound and likely doesn't need changes, provided they receive a 1D list.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the assumption that inputs are (1, N) NumPy arrays:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Shape: (1, 20)\n*   Non-white Block Indices (in row): `range(11, 18)`\n*   Non-white Block Content: `[4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`\n*   Singleton Color: 4 (Yellow)\n*   Sequence Color: 2 (Red)\n*   Singleton Position in Block: Start (index 0)\n*   Action: Move singleton 4 to the end.\n*   Expected Transformed Block: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]`\n*   Output Grid Shape: (1, 20)\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Shape: (1, 20)\n*   Non-white Block Indices (in row): `range(6, 15)`\n*   Non-white Block Content: `[6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`\n*   Singleton Color: 6 (Magenta)\n*   Sequence Color: 8 (Azure)\n*   Singleton Position in Block: Start (index 0)\n*   Action: Move singleton 6 to the end.\n*   Expected Transformed Block: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6]`\n*   Output Grid Shape: (1, 20)\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid Shape: (1, 20)\n*   Non-white Block Indices (in row): `range(0, 9)`\n*   Non-white Block Content: `[4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`\n*   Singleton Color: 4 (Yellow)\n*   Sequence Color: 7 (Orange)\n*   Singleton Position in Block: Start (index 0)\n*   Action: Move singleton 4 to the end.\n*   Expected Transformed Block: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4]`\n*   Output Grid Shape: (1, 20)\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
