## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code correctly identified the core transformation logic: locating a contiguous block of non-white pixels containing exactly two colors (one singleton, one sequence) and moving the singleton pixel to the opposite end of the block. However, the code failed execution with a `ValueError` related to NumPy array truthiness.

This strongly suggests that the input grids, although representing a single row, are being passed to the `transform` function as 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, N), not as 1D Python lists as the previous code assumed. The `if pixel != 0:` check within `find_non_white_block` fails when `pixel` is an entire NumPy array row derived from iterating over a list containing a single row array (`list(numpy_array_1xN)`).

**Strategy:**
1.  Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle a 2D NumPy array input.
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input array.
3.  Convert this row to a Python list to utilize the existing helper functions (`find_non_white_block`, `analyze_block`).
4.  Perform the transformation logic on the extracted list.
5.  Convert the transformed list back into a 2D NumPy array with the original shape (1, N).
6.  The core logic within `find_non_white_block` and `analyze_block` appears sound and likely doesn't need changes, provided they receive a 1D list.

## Metrics

Based on the assumption that inputs are (1, N) NumPy arrays:

**Example 1:**
*   Input Grid Shape: (1, 20)
*   Non-white Block Indices (in row): `range(11, 18)`
*   Non-white Block Content: `[4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`
*   Singleton Color: 4 (Yellow)
*   Sequence Color: 2 (Red)
*   Singleton Position in Block: Start (index 0)
*   Action: Move singleton 4 to the end.
*   Expected Transformed Block: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]`
*   Output Grid Shape: (1, 20)

**Example 2:**
*   Input Grid Shape: (1, 20)
*   Non-white Block Indices (in row): `range(6, 15)`
*   Non-white Block Content: `[6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`
*   Singleton Color: 6 (Magenta)
*   Sequence Color: 8 (Azure)
*   Singleton Position in Block: Start (index 0)
*   Action: Move singleton 6 to the end.
*   Expected Transformed Block: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6]`
*   Output Grid Shape: (1, 20)

**Example 3:**
*   Input Grid Shape: (1, 20)
*   Non-white Block Indices (in row): `range(0, 9)`
*   Non-white Block Content: `[4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`
*   Singleton Color: 4 (Yellow)
*   Sequence Color: 7 (Orange)
*   Singleton Position in Block: Start (index 0)
*   Action: Move singleton 4 to the end.
*   Expected Transformed Block: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4]`
*   Output Grid Shape: (1, 20)

    properties:
      color: Any non-white color, different from singleton_pixel color.
      count: > 1 within the non_white_block.
      location: Forms the rest of the non_white_block adjacent to the singleton_pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: singleton_pixel
    object2: sequence_pixels
    details: The singleton_pixel is directly adjacent to one end of the sequence_pixels within the non_white_block.
action:
  - type: move
    object: singleton_pixel
    details: The singleton_pixel is moved from its original end of the non_white_block to the opposite end, preserving the order of the sequence_pixels.
invariants:
  - The background white pixels remain unchanged.
  - The colors and number of pixels within the non_white_block remain the same; only their order changes.
  - The dimensions of the grid (1, N) remain unchanged.
input_output_format:
  - type: numpy_array
    shape: (1, width) where width varies per task instance but is consistent between input/output.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N).
2.  Extract the single row from the input array as a 1D list or array.
3.  Identify the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within this row. If no such block exists, or the block has fewer than two pixels, return the original input array unchanged.
4.  Extract the sequence of pixels corresponding to this non-white block.
5.  Analyze the extracted block: Count the occurrences of each color. Verify that exactly two distinct non-white colors are present and that one color appears exactly once (the singleton color) and the other appears multiple times (the sequence color). If this condition is not met, return the original input array unchanged.
6.  Identify the singleton pixel and the sequence of pixels. Determine if the singleton pixel is at the start (index 0) or the end (last index) of the block. If it's not at either end, return the original input array unchanged.
7.  Construct the new arrangement for the non-white block:
    *   If the singleton pixel was at the start, create the new block by concatenating the sequence pixels followed by the singleton pixel.
    *   If the singleton pixel was at the end, create the new block by concatenating the singleton pixel followed by the sequence pixels.
8.  Create a copy of the original input row (as a list).
9.  Replace the pixels in the copied row corresponding to the original block's indices with the newly constructed block.
10. Convert the modified 1D list back into a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N).
11. Return the resulting 2D NumPy array.
