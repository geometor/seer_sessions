The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   The transformation moves the singleton pixel to the opposite end of the multi-pixel sequence.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

If no such block exists or the block contains fewer than two pixels or more than two distinct colors, return the input unchanged (though this case is not shown in examples).\n    2.  Within this non-white block, identify the color that appears only once (the singleton color) and the color that appears multiple times (the sequence color). Determine the single pixel with the singleton color and the sequence of pixels with the sequence color.\n    3.  Determine the position of the singleton pixel relative to the sequence pixels (i.e., is it at the start or the end of the combined non-white block?).\n    4.  Construct the new non-white block by placing the sequence of pixels first, followed by the singleton pixel, if the singleton was originally at the start.\n    5.  Construct the new non-white block by placing the singleton pixel first, followed by the sequence of pixels, if the singleton was originally at the end.
