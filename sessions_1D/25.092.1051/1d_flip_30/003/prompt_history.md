*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (single rows).
    *   Each input contains a contiguous sequence of non-white pixels, potentially flanked by white pixels (0).
    *   Within this non-white sequence, there are exactly two distinct colors present.
    *   One color appears as a single pixel (the "singleton").
    *   The other color appears as a contiguous sequence of multiple pixels (the "sequence").
    *   The singleton pixel is always located at one end of the non-white sequence, adjacent to the start or end of the multi-pixel sequence.
    *   The transformation modifies only the non-white sequence. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.
    *   The transformation moves the singleton pixel to the opposite end of the multi-pixel sequence.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. If no such block exists or the block contains fewer than two pixels or more than two distinct colors, return the input unchanged (though this case is not shown in examples).
    2.  Within this non-white block, identify the color that appears only once (the singleton color) and the color that appears multiple times (the sequence color). Determine the single pixel with the singleton color and the sequence of pixels with the sequence color.
    3.  Determine the position of the singleton pixel relative to the sequence pixels (i.e., is it at the start or the end of the combined non-white block?).
    4.  Construct the new non-white block by placing the sequence of pixels first, followed by the singleton pixel, if the singleton was originally at the start.
    5.  Construct the new non-white block by placing the singleton pixel first, followed by the sequence of pixels, if the singleton was originally at the end. (This case doesn't appear in the examples but follows the observed "move to other end" logic).
    6.  Reconstruct the output row by replacing the original non-white block with the newly constructed block, keeping all surrounding white pixels in their original positions.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code correctly identified the core transformation logic: locating a contiguous block of non-white pixels containing exactly two colors (one singleton, one sequence) and moving the singleton pixel to the opposite end of the block. However, the code failed execution with a `ValueError` related to NumPy array truthiness.

This strongly suggests that the input grids, although representing a single row, are being passed to the `transform` function as 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, N), not as 1D Python lists as the previous code assumed. The `if pixel != 0:` check within `find_non_white_block` fails when `pixel` is an entire NumPy array row derived from iterating over a list containing a single row array (`list(numpy_array_1xN)`).

**Strategy:**
1.  Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle a 2D NumPy array input.
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input array.
3.  Convert this row to a Python list to utilize the existing helper functions (`find_non_white_block`, `analyze_block`).
4.  Perform the transformation logic on the extracted list.
5.  Convert the transformed list back into a 2D NumPy array with the original shape (1, N).
6.  The core logic within `find_non_white_block` and `analyze_block` appears sound and likely doesn't need changes, provided they receive a 1D list.

## Metrics

*   Singleton Color: 4 (Yellow)
*   Sequence Color: 2 (Red)
*   Singleton Position in Block: Start (index 0)
*   Action: Move singleton 4 to the end.
*   Expected Transformed Block: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]`
*   Output Grid Shape: (1, 20)

**Example 2:**
*   Input Grid Shape: (1, 20)
*   Non-white Block Indices (in row): `range(6, 15)`
*   Non-white Block Content: `[6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`
*   Singleton Color: 6 (Magenta)
*   Sequence Color: 8 (Azure)
*   Singleton Position in Block: Start (index 0)
*   Action: Move singleton 6 to the end.
*   Expected Transformed Block: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6]`
*   Output Grid Shape: (1, 20)

**Example 3:**

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N).
2.  Extract the single row from the input array as a 1D list or array.
3.  Identify the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within this row. If no such block exists, or the block has fewer than two pixels, return the original input array unchanged.
4.  Extract the sequence of pixels corresponding to this non-white block.
5.  Analyze the extracted block: Count the occurrences of each color. Verify that exactly two distinct non-white colors are present and that one color appears exactly once (the singleton color) and the other appears multiple times (the sequence color). If this condition is not met, return the original input array unchanged.
6.  Identify the singleton pixel and the sequence of pixels. Determine if the singleton pixel is at the start (index 0) or the end (last index) of the block. If it's not at either end, return the original input array unchanged.
7.  Construct the new arrangement for the non-white block:
    *   If the singleton pixel was at the start, create the new block by concatenating the sequence pixels followed by the singleton pixel.
    *   If the singleton pixel was at the end, create the new block by concatenating the singleton pixel followed by the sequence pixels.
8.  Create a copy of the original input row (as a list).
9.  Replace the pixels in the copied row corresponding to the original block's indices with the newly constructed block.
10. Convert the modified 1D list back into a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N).
11. Return the resulting 2D NumPy array.
