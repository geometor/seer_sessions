A single pixel of one color (e.g., red in example 1, yellow in example 2, gray in example 3).\n    2.  A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of *another* color (e.g., yellow block in example 1, orange block in examples 2 and 3).\n*   These two non-white elements are always directly adjacent to each other.\n*   The single pixel is always immediately to the left of the block of pixels.\n*   The transformation appears to swap the positions of the single pixel and the adjacent block. The single pixel moves to occupy the position immediately to the right of where the block was, and the block shifts left to occupy the original position of the single pixel. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
