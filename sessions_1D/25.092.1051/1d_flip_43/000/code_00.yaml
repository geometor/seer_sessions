task_description: Swap the positions of an adjacent single pixel and a contiguous block of pixels.
elements:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills space around active elements.
  - type: active_element_1
    description: A single non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - count: 1 per input grid
      - color: variable (red, yellow, gray in examples)
  - type: active_element_2
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - count: 1 per input grid
      - color: variable, different from active_element_1 (yellow, orange in examples)
      - length: variable (5 in example 1, 3 in example 2, 4 in example 3)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    element1: active_element_1
    element2: active_element_2
    details: Element 1 is immediately to the left of Element 2.
transformation:
  action: swap_position
  elements: [active_element_1, active_element_2]
  details:
    - Locate the single pixel (Element 1) and the adjacent block (Element 2).
    - Determine the color and index of Element 1.
    - Determine the color, starting index, and length of Element 2.
    - In the output grid, place the block (Element 2) starting at the original index of Element 1.
    - Place the single pixel (Element 1) immediately to the right of where the block (Element 2) was originally placed.
    - Maintain the position of all background (white) pixels.
