## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the key components: a "movable block" of a single color (not white or orange), a fixed "anchor pixel" (orange), and a background (white). The transformation was identified as a shift of the movable block. The previous code implemented this logic.

The error reported (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`) likely originated from the testing framework's comparison method, not the core transformation logic within the `transform` function itself. Using element-wise comparison (like `np.array_equal` or comparing lists element by element) resolves this.

The code execution confirms the transformation logic is correct for all training examples: find the non-white, non-orange block, find the orange anchor, shift the block 2 positions to the right, and keep the anchor in its original position, filling the rest with white.

## Metrics

The following metrics were gathered via code execution:

    description: A single pixel with the color orange (7). Assumed to be unique per input.
    properties:
      - color: 7 (orange)
      - index: The 0-based index of the pixel.

      - length: Same as the input movable_block's length.
      - start_index: Input movable_block's start_index + 2.
  - type: object
    name: fixed_anchor
    description: The anchor_pixel placed at its original position.
    properties:
      - color: 7 (orange)
      - index: Same as the input anchor_pixel's index.
  - type: background
    name: empty_space
    description: Pixels with the color white (0). Fills all positions not occupied by the shifted_block or the fixed_anchor.

transformation:
  - type: identify
    source: input_array
    target: movable_block
    using: Scan for contiguous pixels != 0 and != 7. Record color, length, start_index.
  - type: identify
    source: input_array
    target: anchor_pixel
    using: Scan for pixel == 7. Record index.
  - type: initialize_output
    details: Create an output array of the same size as the input, filled with white (0).

constraints:
  - Input and output arrays have the same length.
  - Each input contains exactly one movable_block.
  - Each input contains exactly one anchor_pixel.
  - The shift amount is fixed at +2 positions.
  - The anchor_pixel maintains its absolute position.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output array with the same length as the input array and fill it entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Identify the "movable block" in the input array: Find the first contiguous sequence of identical pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor orange (7). Record its color, length, and starting index.
3.  Identify the "anchor pixel" in the input array: Find the index of the pixel with the color orange (7).
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the movable block in the output array by adding 2 to its starting index found in the input array.
5.  Copy the pixels of the identified "movable block" (using its recorded color and length) into the output array, starting at the calculated target starting index. Ensure the block does not extend beyond the bounds of the output array.
6.  Place the orange (7) "anchor pixel" into the output array at the same index it occupied in the input array. If this position is already occupied by part of the shifted movable block, the anchor pixel (7) overwrites it.
7.  Return the completed output array.
