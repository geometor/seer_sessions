task_type: array_manipulation
dimensionality: 1D
elements:
  - type: object
    name: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels, excluding white (0) and orange (7).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 1, 8, 5).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The starting position (index) of the block in the input array.
  - type: object
    name: anchor_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color orange (7).
    properties:
      - color: 7 (orange)
      - index: The position (index) of the pixel in the input array.
  - type: background
    name: empty_space
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
transformation:
  - type: spatial_shift
    target: movable_block
    details:
      - direction: right
      - magnitude: 2 positions
      - reference: original position of the movable_block
  - type: static_position
    target: anchor_pixel
    details: Remains in its original index position.
  - type: fill
    target: empty_space
    details: Fills all positions in the output array not occupied by the shifted movable_block or the anchor_pixel.
constraints:
  - The input array always contains exactly one movable_block.
  - The input array always contains exactly one anchor_pixel.
  - The movable_block and anchor_pixel do not overlap in the input.
  - The shift operation does not cause the movable_block to go out of the array bounds.
