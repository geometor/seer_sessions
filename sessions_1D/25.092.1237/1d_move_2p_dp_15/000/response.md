Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (or grids of height 1) of integers representing pixel colors.
2.  **Key Colors:** White (0) acts as the background. Orange (7) seems to be a fixed point or marker. Other colors (blue=1, azure=8, gray=5) form contiguous blocks.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   A contiguous block of a single color (not white or orange). Let's call this the "movable block".
    *   A single orange pixel (7). Let's call this the "anchor pixel".
    *   White pixels (0) acting as background/empty space.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the "movable block".
5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The relative position of the "movable block" changes, while the "anchor pixel" stays in the same absolute position. The shift seems consistent across examples (+2 positions to the right).
6.  **Background Handling:** White pixels fill the space left by the moved block and any other positions not occupied by the movable block or the anchor pixel.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation
dimensionality: 1D
elements:
  - type: object
    name: movable_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels, excluding white (0) and orange (7).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 1, 8, 5).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The starting position (index) of the block in the input array.
  - type: object
    name: anchor_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color orange (7).
    properties:
      - color: 7 (orange)
      - index: The position (index) of the pixel in the input array.
  - type: background
    name: empty_space
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
transformation:
  - type: spatial_shift
    target: movable_block
    details:
      - direction: right
      - magnitude: 2 positions
      - reference: original position of the movable_block
  - type: static_position
    target: anchor_pixel
    details: Remains in its original index position.
  - type: fill
    target: empty_space
    details: Fills all positions in the output array not occupied by the shifted movable_block or the anchor_pixel.
constraints:
  - The input array always contains exactly one movable_block.
  - The input array always contains exactly one anchor_pixel.
  - The movable_block and anchor_pixel do not overlap in the input.
  - The shift operation does not cause the movable_block to go out of the array bounds.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output array of the same size as the input array, filling it entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Scan the input array to locate the contiguous block of pixels whose color is not white (0) and not orange (7). Record the color, length, and starting index of this "movable block".
3.  Scan the input array to locate the index of the orange pixel (7), the "anchor pixel".
4.  Place the orange pixel (7) into the output array at the same index it occupied in the input array.
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the "movable block" by adding 2 to its original starting index found in step 2.
6.  Place the "movable block" (using its recorded color and length) into the output array, starting at the newly calculated index from step 5.
7.  Return the completed output array.
