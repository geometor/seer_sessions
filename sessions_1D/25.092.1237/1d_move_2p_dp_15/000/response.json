Orange (7) seems to be a fixed point or marker. Other colors (blue=1, azure=8, gray=5) form contiguous blocks.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   A contiguous block of a single color (not white or orange). Let's call this the \"movable block\".\n    *   A single orange pixel (7). Let's call this the \"anchor pixel\".\n    *   White pixels (0) acting as background/empty space.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the \"movable block\".\n5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The relative position of the \"movable block\" changes, while the \"anchor pixel\" stays in the same absolute position. The shift seems consistent across examples (+2 positions to the right).\n6.  **Background Handling:** White pixels fill the space left by the moved block and any other positions not occupied by the movable block or the anchor pixel.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"

Scan the input array to locate the contiguous block of pixels whose color is not white (0) and not orange (7). Record the color, length, and starting index of this \"movable block\".\n3.

Calculate the new starting index for the \"movable block\" by adding 2 to its original starting index found in step 2.\n6.
