            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.` This strongly suggests that somewhere in the code, a NumPy array resulting from a comparison (a boolean array) was used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement). Given that ARC grids are inherently 2D, the likely cause is that the input was treated as 1D, but `np.array()` created a 2D array (e.g., shape `(1, 12)`), and subsequent iterations or comparisons were performed incorrectly on entire rows instead of individual pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Data Handling:** Treat the input as a 2D NumPy array, even if it only has one row. Adapt the helper functions and main transform logic to operate on the elements of the specific row (likely the first row, row 0).\n2.  **Refine Logic:** Ensure all comparisons and operations target individual pixel values within the relevant row.\n3.  **Verify Assumptions:** Use code execution to confirm grid dimensions, block properties, anchor position, and the shift magnitude across all examples.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the structure and properties of each training example, assuming they are 2D grids with height 1.\n\n"
