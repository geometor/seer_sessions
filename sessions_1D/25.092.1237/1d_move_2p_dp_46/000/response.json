Each example features a sequence containing a gray pixel (5) preceded by two white pixels (0), forming a `0 0 5` pattern. The surrounding pixels are mostly uniform blocks of a single color (yellow, azure) or a mix including white.\n\nThe transformation appears to involve rearranging segments of the input grid based on the location of the `0 0 5` sequence. Specifically, the `0 0` part moves to the very beginning of the grid. The pixels that were originally *before* the `0 0 5` sequence are then placed immediately after the moved `0 0`. The gray pixel (5) and any pixels originally *after* it remain in their relative order and are placed at the end, following the relocated block.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
