Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

The input and output are both 1x20 grids (or single rows) of pixels. Each example features a sequence containing a gray pixel (5) preceded by two white pixels (0), forming a `0 0 5` pattern. The surrounding pixels are mostly uniform blocks of a single color (yellow, azure) or a mix including white.

The transformation appears to involve rearranging segments of the input grid based on the location of the `0 0 5` sequence. Specifically, the `0 0` part moves to the very beginning of the grid. The pixels that were originally *before* the `0 0 5` sequence are then placed immediately after the moved `0 0`. The gray pixel (5) and any pixels originally *after* it remain in their relative order and are placed at the end, following the relocated block.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to locate the gray pixel (color 5).
2.  Identify the two white pixels (color 0) that are immediately to the left of the gray pixel.
3.  Define three segments of the input grid:
    *   `Segment A`: All pixels to the left of the two identified white pixels.
    *   `Segment B`: The two identified white pixels (`0 0`).
    *   `Segment C`: The gray pixel (5) and all pixels to its right.
4.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the segments in the following order: `Segment B`, then `Segment A`, then `Segment C`.
