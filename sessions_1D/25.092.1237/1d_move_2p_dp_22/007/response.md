Transformation Rule:
1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels (the 'main block') and its starting index in the input row.
2.  Identify the single maroon (9) pixel (the 'marker') in the input row, located after the main block.
3.  Create a new sequence by concatenating the main block's pixels followed immediately by the marker pixel (9).
4.  Determine the target starting position for this new sequence in the output row by adding 2 to the original starting index of the main block.
5.  Construct the output row (same length as the input) by:
    a. Initializing it with white (0) pixels.
    b. Placing the new combined sequence at the target starting position, overwriting the initial white pixels. Truncate the sequence if it extends beyond the row boundaries.
