Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the contiguous block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels (the 'main block') and its starting index.
2. Identify the single maroon (9) pixel ('marker').
3. Create a new sequence by concatenating the main block's pixels followed immediately by the marker pixel.
4. Determine the target starting position for this new sequence by adding 2 to the original starting index of the main block.
5. Construct the output row by placing the new sequence at the target starting position, filling all preceding positions with white (0) pixels, and keeping the remaining positions (after the placed sequence) as white (0).
