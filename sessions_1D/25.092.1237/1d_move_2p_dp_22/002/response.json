The Python code implements this logic using standard Python lists.\n\nThe error message, \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\", typically arises when a boolean operation is expected to yield a single True/False value, but instead receives a NumPy boolean array (e.g., `if numpy_array == value:` where `numpy_array` has multiple elements).\n\nThis strongly suggests that the issue lies not in the fundamental transformation *logic* described, but in how the Python code interacts with the data types used by the testing environment. The ARC environment often uses NumPy arrays. Even though the Python code is written using `List[List[int]]`, the test harness might be:\na) Passing input grids as NumPy arrays.\nb) Comparing the function's list-based output to an expected output stored as a NumPy array using an operation like `==` which performs element-wise comparison, resulting in a boolean array instead of a single boolean.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Confirm Logic with Metrics:** Use code execution to verify the key parameters (start index, block details, marker index, target index) for each example, confirming the \"shift by 2\" rule is consistent.\n2.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be precise based on all examples.\n3.  **Inform Coder:** Explicitly state the likely cause of the error (data type mismatch, likely List vs NumPy array handling in the test harness comparison) and recommend that the coder phase implements the solution using NumPy consistently for both input processing and output generation to align with the ARC environment's typical usage.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"
