*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays) of the same length (14 pixels).
    *   Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single color (e.g., green '3' in train\_1, orange '7' in train\_2). This block is neither white ('0') nor maroon ('9').
    *   Each input grid also contains exactly one maroon ('9') pixel.
    *   The main colored block always appears before the maroon pixel.
    *   There may be white ('0') pixels before the main block, between the main block and the maroon pixel, and after the maroon pixel.
    *   In the output, the main colored block and the maroon pixel appear adjacent to each other, with any white pixels that were originally between them removed.
    *   This combined structure (main block + maroon pixel) is shifted two positions to the right compared to the starting position of the main block in the input.
    *   The positions to the left, vacated or shifted over, are filled with white ('0') pixels. Pixels to the right of the maroon pixel in the input seem to remain in their relative positions after the shifted structure.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels.
    2.  Scan the input row to find the first pixel that is not white (0) and not maroon (9). This marks the start of the main colored block.
    3.  Identify the sequence of identical, non-white, non-maroon pixels that form the main block. Record its color and its pixel values. Let the starting index of this block be `start_index`.
    4.  Scan the input row starting from the end of the main block to find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel. Record its value (9).
    5.  Create a new temporary sequence consisting of the pixels from the main block followed immediately by the maroon pixel (9).
    6.  Calculate the target starting index in the output grid for this new sequence: `target_start_index = start_index + 2`.
    7.  Place the temporary sequence into the output grid, starting at `target_start_index`.
    8.  Ensure all positions in the output grid before `target_start_index` are filled with white (0) pixels.
    9.  Ensure all positions in the output grid after the placed sequence match the corresponding trailing white pixels from the input grid (if any remain after the shift). (Alternatively, Step 1 already initializes the whole output grid with white, so only the placement in step 7 is needed, overwriting the initial white pixels).
