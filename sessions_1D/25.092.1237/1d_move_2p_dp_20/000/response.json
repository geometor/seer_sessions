The input array contains segments of different colors: white (0), magenta (6), and gray (5). The transformation appears to involve relocating the magenta segment based on the position of the gray pixel.\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of the same length.\n2.  **Key Colors:** White (0) acts as a background/filler. Magenta (6) forms a movable block. Gray (5) acts as a fixed anchor or boundary.\n3.  **Transformation:** The contiguous block of magenta pixels shifts horizontally to the right.\n4.  **Goal/Constraint:** The movement stops when the right edge of the magenta block is immediately adjacent to the left side of the gray pixel.\n5.  **Filling Mechanism:** The space originally occupied by the magenta block, and the space it traverses during the shift, are filled with white pixels in the output. The area to the right of the gray pixel remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
