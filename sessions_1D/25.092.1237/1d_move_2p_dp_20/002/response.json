            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: moving a contiguous block of a specific color (magenta or yellow in the examples) rightwards until it is adjacent to a fixed anchor pixel (gray). The background color (white) fills the vacated space. The error messages indicate a dimensionality mismatch during the implementation, likely stemming from treating the 1xN grid as purely 1D in list/array slicing or assignment operations within the numpy context. The strategy is to refine the understanding of the data as 1xN 2D grids and adjust the logic and implementation to handle array operations correctly, likely by operating primarily on the single row of the grid.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's analyze each example more formally, treating them as 1x19 grids.\n\n*   **Grid Dimensions:** All examples use 1x19 grids for both input and output.\n*   **Anchor Pixel:** In all examples, the gray pixel (5) is located at `(row=0, col=17)`.\n*   **Background Pixel:** White (0) is the background.\n*   **Moving Block:** A contiguous block of a non-white, non-gray color exists to the left of the anchor.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input: `[[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0]]`\n*   Moving Block: Magenta (6), length 14, columns 1 to 14.\n*   Anchor: Gray (5), column 17.\n*   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0]]`\n*   Output Block: Magenta (6), length 14, columns 3 to 16.\n*   Observation: The block of 14 magenta pixels shifted right. Its new end column is 16, which is `anchor_col (17) - 1`. Its new start column is `16 - 14 + 1 = 3`.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input: `[[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0]]`\n*   Moving Block: Yellow (4), length 14, columns 1 to 14.\n*   Anchor: Gray (5), column 17.\n*   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0]]`\n*   Output Block: Yellow (4), length 14, columns 3 to 16.\n*   Observation: The block of 14 yellow pixels shifted right. Its new end column is 16 (`anchor_col - 1`). Its new start column is `16 - 14 + 1 = 3`.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0]]`\n*   Moving Block: Magenta (6), length 11, columns 4 to 14.\n*   Anchor: Gray (5), column 17.\n*   Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0]]`\n*   Output Block: Magenta (6), length 11, columns 6 to 16.\n*   Observation: The block of 11 magenta pixels shifted right. Its new end column is 16 (`anchor_col - 1`). Its new start column is `16 - 11 + 1 = 6`.\n\n**Code Execution for Metrics (Conceptual):**\n\nNo specific code execution is needed here as the analysis is straightforward by visual inspection and counting, confirming the grid sizes, block properties, and anchor position. The core logic identified previously holds true for all examples. The primary issue was the implementation detail causing the broadcast error.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
