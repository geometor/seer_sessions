**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 1-dimensional array of colored pixels. The input array contains segments of different colors: white (0), magenta (6), and gray (5). The transformation appears to involve relocating the magenta segment based on the position of the gray pixel.

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of the same length.
2.  **Key Colors:** White (0) acts as a background/filler. Magenta (6) forms a movable block. Gray (5) acts as a fixed anchor or boundary.
3.  **Transformation:** The contiguous block of magenta pixels shifts horizontally to the right.
4.  **Goal/Constraint:** The movement stops when the right edge of the magenta block is immediately adjacent to the left side of the gray pixel.
5.  **Filling Mechanism:** The space originally occupied by the magenta block, and the space it traverses during the shift, are filled with white pixels in the output. The area to the right of the gray pixel remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: Array transformation
dimensionality: 1D
grid_properties:
  size_relation: input and output grids have the same dimensions
colors_present:
  - white (0)
  - magenta (6)
  - gray (5)
objects:
  - object_type: block
    identifier: moving_block
    color: magenta (6) # In this specific example; generally non-white, non-gray
    properties:
      - contiguous
  - object_type: pixel
    identifier: anchor_pixel
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - fixed position relative to the right boundary
relationships:
  - relation_type: spatial
    initial_state: moving_block is located to the left of anchor_pixel, potentially separated by white pixels.
    final_state: the rightmost pixel of moving_block is immediately adjacent to the left of anchor_pixel.
actions:
  - action_type: identify
    target: moving_block
    details: Find the contiguous block of non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixels.
  - action_type: identify
    target: anchor_pixel
    details: Find the gray (5) pixel.
  - action_type: calculate_position
    target: moving_block
    details: Determine the target end position (index adjacent to anchor_pixel) and start position based on block length.
  - action_type: reconstruct_grid
    details: Create the output grid by placing the anchor_pixel and pixels to its right, placing the moving_block in its calculated target position, and filling the remaining pixels to the left with white (0).
state_change:
  - element: moving_block
    attribute: position
    change: shifted rightwards
  - element: pixels
    attribute: color
    change: pixels between original start of moving_block and target start of moving_block become white (0).
assumptions:
  - There is exactly one anchor_pixel (gray).
  - There is exactly one contiguous block of non-white, non-gray color to the left of the anchor_pixel.
  - The task operates on a 1D array.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output array of the same size as the input array, initially filled with the background color, white (0).
2.  Scan the input array to find the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not gray (5). Record its color and its length (number of pixels). Let this be the `moving_block`.
3.  Scan the input array to find the index of the gray (5) pixel. Let this be the `anchor_index`.
4.  Copy the pixel at `anchor_index` and all pixels to the right of `anchor_index` from the input array to the corresponding positions in the output array.
5.  Calculate the target end index for the `moving_block` in the output array as `anchor_index - 1`.
6.  Calculate the target start index for the `moving_block` as `target_end_index - length_of_moving_block + 1`.
7.  Fill the segment of the output array from the `target_start_index` to the `target_end_index` (inclusive) with the color of the `moving_block`.
