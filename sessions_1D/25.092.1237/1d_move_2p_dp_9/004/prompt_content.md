"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on the following rules:
1. Initialize an output array of the same size as the input array, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2. Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input array that are neither white (0) nor magenta (6) (the "main object"). Record its color, starting index, and length.
3. Identify the index of the single magenta (6) pixel in the input array (the "marker object"). Record its index.
4. Calculate the new starting index for the main object by adding 2 to its original starting index.
5. Place the main object (using its recorded color and length) into the output array starting at its calculated new index. Ensure the placement does not exceed the array bounds; truncate if necessary.
6. Place the marker object (magenta pixel, 6) into the output array at its *original* identified index.
7. Return the modified output array.
