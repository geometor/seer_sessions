task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: fills empty space initially in the output
  - role: main_object
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-magenta color.
    colors_observed: [yellow (4), orange (7), gray (5)]
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - single_color (excluding white (0) and magenta (6))
    action: Shifted right by 2 positions relative to its input start index.
  - role: marker_object
    description: A single pixel of magenta color.
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - single_pixel
    action: Remains in its original input index position.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array
  - size: constant between input and output (observed size 25)
relationships:
  - The main_object and marker_object are distinct and do not overlap in the input.
  - Their relative order can vary.
  - The shift amount for the main object (+2) is constant.
  - The marker object's position remains constant (shift = 0).
output_construction:
  - Start with a background-filled grid of the same size as the input.
  - Place the main object at its new position (original start index + 2). Handle boundary conditions (object might be truncated if shifted past the end).
  - Place the marker object at its original position. This might overwrite a part of the shifted main object if their output positions overlap, or overwrite the background.
