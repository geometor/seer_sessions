## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (or grids) of integers representing pixel colors.
2.  **Colors Present:** The colors observed are white (0), yellow (4), magenta (6), orange (7), and gray (5). White serves as the background color.
3.  **Key Objects:** In each input, there are two distinct non-white objects:
    *   A contiguous block of a single color (yellow, orange, or gray).
    *   A single pixel of magenta (6).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves shifting the positions of the non-white objects within the grid. The grid size remains constant.
5.  **Shift Pattern:**
    *   The contiguous block of color (yellow, orange, gray) is shifted 2 positions to the right.
    *   The single magenta pixel (6) is shifted 1 position to the right.
6.  **Background Handling:** Positions vacated by the shifted objects and the positions to the left of the newly placed objects are filled with the background color (white, 0). The overall length of the array remains unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: fills empty space
  - role: main_object
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-magenta color.
    colors_observed: [yellow (4), orange (7), gray (5)]
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - single_color (excluding white and magenta)
    action: shifted right by 2 positions
  - role: marker_object
    description: A single pixel of magenta color.
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - single_pixel
    action: shifted right by 1 position
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array
  - size: constant between input and output
relationships:
  - The main_object and marker_object are distinct and do not overlap in the input.
  - Their relative order can vary (marker can be before or after the main block).
  - The shift amounts are constant and independent of the object's color or initial position (main block always +2, marker always +1).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output array of the same size as the input array, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input array that are neither white (0) nor magenta (6). Record its color, starting index, and length.
3.  Identify the index of the single magenta (6) pixel in the input array.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the main color block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
5.  Calculate the new index for the magenta pixel by adding 1 to its original index.
6.  Place the main color block (using its recorded color and length) into the output array starting at its calculated new index.
7.  Place the magenta pixel (6) into the output array at its calculated new index.
8.  Return the modified output array.
