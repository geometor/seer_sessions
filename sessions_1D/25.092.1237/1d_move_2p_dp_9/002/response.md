## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the main components (background, main object block, marker object) and the 1D array format. However, the action associated with the marker object (magenta pixel) was incorrectly perceived as a shift of +1. The `tool_code` simulation and re-examination of the input/output pairs revealed that the marker object (magenta pixel) *remains stationary*, while only the main object block shifts +2 positions to the right. The code execution error ("ambiguous truth value") reported previously was likely a symptom of the testing framework handling the incorrect output generated by the flawed logic, rather than a fundamental flaw in the comparison logic itself, as the standalone simulation did not produce that specific error but did produce incorrect results based on the initial flawed perception. The strategy is to correct the rule for the marker object and update the documentation and natural language program accordingly.

## Metrics

Metrics gathered using `tool_code` simulation with the **revised** logic (main object shifts +2, marker stays put):


```python
# Simulate finding logic for example 1
input_1 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
expected_output_1 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]
main_color_1=4; main_start_1=9; main_length_1=10; marker_index_1=21
new_main_start_1 = main_start_1 + 2 # = 11
new_marker_index_1 = marker_index_1 # = 21 (Stays put)
# Generated Output matches Expected Output 1: True

# Simulate finding logic for example 2
input_2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]
expected_output_2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]
main_color_2=7; main_start_2=7; main_length_2=14; marker_index_2=23
new_main_start_2 = main_start_2 + 2 # = 9
new_marker_index_2 = marker_index_2 # = 23 (Stays put)
# Generated Output matches Expected Output 2: True

# Simulate finding logic for example 3
input_3 = [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
expected_output_3 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
main_color_3=5; main_start_3=3; main_length_3=7; marker_index_3=12
new_main_start_3 = main_start_3 + 2 # = 5
new_marker_index_3 = marker_index_3 # = 12 (Stays put)
# Generated Output matches Expected Output 3: True
```


The revised logic correctly reproduces the output for all training examples.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: fills empty space
  - role: main_object
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-magenta color.
    colors_observed: [yellow (4), orange (7), gray (5)]
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - single_color (value != 0 and value != 6)
    action: shifted right by 2 positions
  - role: marker_object
    description: A single pixel of magenta color.
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - single_pixel
    action: remains stationary (position does not change)
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array
  - size: constant between input and output (observed size: 25)
relationships:
  - The main_object and marker_object are distinct and do not overlap in the input.
  - Their relative order can vary (marker can be before or after the main block).
  - The shift amount for the main block (+2) is constant.
  - The marker object's position is constant.
constraints:
  - Assumes exactly one main_object block exists.
  - Assumes exactly one marker_object pixel (magenta) exists.
  - Assumes objects shifted right do not wrap around; pixels shifted off the right edge are lost.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output array of the same size as the input array, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input array that are neither white (0) nor magenta (6) (the "main object"). Record its color, starting index, and length.
3.  Identify the index of the single magenta (6) pixel in the input array (the "marker object"). Record its index.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the main object by adding 2 to its original starting index.
5.  Place the main object (using its recorded color and length) into the output array starting at its calculated new index. Ensure the placement does not exceed the array bounds; truncate if necessary.
6.  Place the marker object (magenta pixel, 6) into the output array at its *original* identified index.
7.  Return the modified output array.
