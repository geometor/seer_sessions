task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: fills empty space initially in the output.
  - role: main_object
    description: A contiguous block of a single color that is not white (0) or magenta (6).
    colors_observed: [yellow (4), orange (7), gray (5)]
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - single_color (excluding white and magenta)
      - preserves_color
      - preserves_length
    action: Shifted right by exactly 2 positions relative to its starting index in the input. The shifted object might be truncated if it exceeds the grid boundary.
  - role: marker_object
    description: A single pixel of magenta color.
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - single_pixel
    action: Remains stationary; its position in the output is the same as its position in the input. This object might overwrite part of the shifted main object if their output positions overlap.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array
  - size: constant between input and output (observed size 25 in examples)
relationships:
  - The main_object and marker_object are distinct in the input.
  - Their relative order can vary.
  - The main object's shift (+2) is constant.
  - The marker object's shift (+0) is constant.
  - The transformation constructs a new grid, placing the shifted main object first, then placing the stationary marker object, potentially overwriting the main object or background at that specific index.
