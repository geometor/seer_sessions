Create an output array of the same size as the input array, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n2. Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input array that represent the \"main object\" (i.e., are neither white (0) nor magenta (6)). Record its color, starting index, and length.\n3. Identify the index of the single \"marker object\" pixel (magenta, 6) in the input array. Record its index.\n4. Calculate the new starting index for the main object by adding 2 to its original starting index.\n5. Place the main object (using its recorded color and length) into the output array starting at the calculated new index. Ensure the placement respects the array boundaries; if the object extends beyond the end of the array, only place the part that fits.\n6. Place the marker object (magenta, 6) into the output array at its original index. This placement occurs regardless of whether it overwrites the background or part of the main object already placed.\n7.
