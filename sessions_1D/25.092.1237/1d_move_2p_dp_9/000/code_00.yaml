task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: fills empty space
  - role: main_object
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-magenta color.
    colors_observed: [yellow (4), orange (7), gray (5)]
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - single_color (excluding white and magenta)
    action: shifted right by 2 positions
  - role: marker_object
    description: A single pixel of magenta color.
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - single_pixel
    action: shifted right by 1 position
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array
  - size: constant between input and output
relationships:
  - The main_object and marker_object are distinct and do not overlap in the input.
  - Their relative order can vary (marker can be before or after the main block).
  - The shift amounts are constant and independent of the object's color or initial position (main block always +2, marker always +1).
