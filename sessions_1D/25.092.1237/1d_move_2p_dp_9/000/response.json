White serves as the background color.\n3.  **Key Objects:** In each input, there are two distinct non-white objects:\n    *   A contiguous block of a single color (yellow, orange, or gray).\n    *   A single pixel of magenta (6).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves shifting the positions of the non-white objects within the grid. The grid size remains constant.\n5.  **Shift Pattern:**\n    *   The contiguous block of color (yellow, orange, gray) is shifted 2 positions to the right.\n    *   The single magenta pixel (6) is shifted 1 position to the right.\n6.  **Background Handling:** Positions vacated by the shifted objects and the positions to the left of the newly placed objects are filled with the background color (white, 0). The overall length of the array remains unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
