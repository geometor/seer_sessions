1. Initialize an output array of the same size as the input array, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2. Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input array that are neither white (0) nor magenta (6). Record its color, starting index, and length.
3. Identify the index of the single magenta (6) pixel in the input array.
4. Calculate the new starting index for the main color block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
5. Calculate the new index for the magenta pixel by adding 1 to its original index.
6. Place the main color block (using its recorded color and length) into the output array starting at its calculated new index.
7. Place the magenta pixel (6) into the output array at its calculated new index.
8. Return the modified output array.
