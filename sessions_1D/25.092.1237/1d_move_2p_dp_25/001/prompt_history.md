## Perception

1.  **Data Representation:** The input and output are presented as single strings of space-separated integers. These represent flattened 1D arrays or sequences of pixels/colors. The length of the sequence is consistent within each example pair but varies between examples (all examples shown have length 23, but the test case might differ).
2.  **Key Element - Separator:** The color maroon (9) consistently appears in each input and output. Its position remains unchanged relative to the end of the sequence. It acts as a delimiter, separating the sequence into two parts: a prefix (before the maroon pixel) and a suffix (the maroon pixel and everything after it).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects the prefix part of the sequence. The suffix remains identical between the input and output.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** Within the prefix sequence:
    *   All white pixels (0) are identified.
    *   All non-white pixels are identified.
    *   The output prefix is constructed by first placing all the identified white pixels, followed by all the identified non-white pixels.
    *   Crucially, the relative order of the non-white pixels among themselves is preserved from the input prefix to the output prefix.
5.  **Object Analogy:** While not strictly 2D objects, we can consider contiguous blocks of non-white pixels as one type of "object" and individual or blocks of white pixels as another. The action is akin to sorting the prefix based on color, grouping all white pixels at the beginning while maintaining the sequence of the other colors.

## Facts


```yaml
Data:
  Type: 1D sequence of integers (colors)
  Delimiter:
    Color: maroon (9)
    Function: Separates the sequence into a prefix and a suffix.
    Position: Fixed relative to the end; unchanged by the transformation.

Transformation:
  Target: The prefix subsequence (elements before the maroon delimiter).
  Action: Reordering pixels within the prefix.
  Rule:
    1. Identify all white pixels (0) in the prefix.
    2. Identify all non-white pixels in the prefix, maintaining their relative order.
    3. Construct the new prefix by concatenating:
       - All identified white pixels.
       - All identified non-white pixels (in their original relative order).
  Unaffected_Part: The suffix subsequence (the maroon delimiter and all subsequent pixels) remains unchanged.

Relationships:
  - The transformation depends on the position of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - The relative order of non-white pixels within the prefix is preserved.
  - The count of each color within the prefix remains the same, only their positions change.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of pixels.
2.  Locate the position (index) of the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel.
3.  Split the input sequence into two parts:
    *   `prefix`: The subsequence of pixels from the beginning up to (but not including) the maroon pixel.
    *   `suffix`: The subsequence of pixels starting from the maroon pixel to the end of the sequence.
4.  Initialize two empty lists: `white_pixels` and `non_white_pixels`.
5.  Iterate through each pixel in the `prefix` subsequence:
    *   If the pixel is white (0), add it to the `white_pixels` list.
    *   If the pixel is not white (non-zero), add it to the `non_white_pixels` list.
6.  Create the `transformed_prefix` by concatenating the `white_pixels` list followed by the `non_white_pixels` list.
7.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `transformed_prefix` and the original `suffix`.
8.  Return the final output sequence.
