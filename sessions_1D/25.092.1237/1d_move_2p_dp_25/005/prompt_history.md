## Perception

1.  **Data Representation:** The input and output are presented as single strings of space-separated integers. These represent flattened 1D arrays or sequences of pixels/colors. The length of the sequence is consistent within each example pair but varies between examples (all examples shown have length 23, but the test case might differ).
2.  **Key Element - Separator:** The color maroon (9) consistently appears in each input and output. Its position remains unchanged relative to the end of the sequence. It acts as a delimiter, separating the sequence into two parts: a prefix (before the maroon pixel) and a suffix (the maroon pixel and everything after it).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects the prefix part of the sequence. The suffix remains identical between the input and output.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** Within the prefix sequence:
    *   All white pixels (0) are identified.
    *   All non-white pixels are identified.
    *   The output prefix is constructed by first placing all the identified white pixels, followed by all the identified non-white pixels.
    *   Crucially, the relative order of the non-white pixels among themselves is preserved from the input prefix to the output prefix.
5.  **Object Analogy:** While not strictly 2D objects, we can consider contiguous blocks of non-white pixels as one type of "object" and individual or blocks of white pixels as another. The action is akin to sorting the prefix based on color, grouping all white pixels at the beginning while maintaining the sequence of the other colors.

## Facts


```yaml
Data:
  Type: 1D sequence of integers (colors)
  Delimiter:
    Color: maroon (9)
    Function: Separates the sequence into a prefix and a suffix.
    Position: Fixed relative to the end; unchanged by the transformation.

Transformation:
  Target: The prefix subsequence (elements before the maroon delimiter).
  Action: Reordering pixels within the prefix.
  Rule:
    1. Identify all white pixels (0) in the prefix.
    2. Identify all non-white pixels in the prefix, maintaining their relative order.
    3. Construct the new prefix by concatenating:
       - All identified white pixels.
       - All identified non-white pixels (in their original relative order).
  Unaffected_Part: The suffix subsequence (the maroon delimiter and all subsequent pixels) remains unchanged.

Relationships:
  - The transformation depends on the position of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - The relative order of non-white pixels within the prefix is preserved.
  - The count of each color within the prefix remains the same, only their positions change.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of pixels.
2.  Locate the position (index) of the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel.
3.  Split the input sequence into two parts:
    *   `prefix`: The subsequence of pixels from the beginning up to (but not including) the maroon pixel.
    *   `suffix`: The subsequence of pixels starting from the maroon pixel to the end of the sequence.
4.  Initialize two empty lists: `white_pixels` and `non_white_pixels`.
5.  Iterate through each pixel in the `prefix` subsequence:
    *   If the pixel is white (0), add it to the `white_pixels` list.
    *   If the pixel is not white (non-zero), add it to the `non_white_pixels` list.
6.  Create the `transformed_prefix` by concatenating the `white_pixels` list followed by the `non_white_pixels` list.
7.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `transformed_prefix` and the original `suffix`.
8.  Return the final output sequence.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis identified the core components: a 1D sequence, a maroon (9) delimiter separating a prefix and suffix, and a transformation applied only to the prefix. The first attempt at the transformation logic was plausible based on a single example but proved incorrect when tested against the full training set.

The code generated based on the initial natural language program failed because it returned the input unchanged for all examples. This indicates the transformation logic within the code, specifically the separation and recombination of white and non-white pixels, was either flawed or not triggered correctly.

The comparison between the input and expected output reveals a more nuanced transformation than initially perceived. The key insight is that not *all* white pixels in the prefix are moved. Instead, only the contiguous block of white pixels located *immediately before* the maroon (9) delimiter are relocated to the very beginning of the prefix. The relative order of all other pixels within the prefix remains unchanged.

## Metrics

Based on the comparison between the provided inputs and expected outputs:


```yaml
Example 1:
  length: 23
  delimiter_index: 21
  prefix_length: 21
  prefix_input_white_count: 2
  prefix_expected_white_count: 2
  prefix_input_non_white_count: 19
  prefix_expected_non_white_count: 19
  zeros_moved_from_end_of_prefix: 2 # The two '0's at indices 19, 20
  pixels_off_input_vs_expected: 4  # Indices 0, 1, 19, 20 differ

Example 2:
  length: 23
  delimiter_index: 13
  prefix_length: 13
  prefix_input_white_count: 4
  prefix_expected_white_count: 4
  prefix_input_non_white_count: 9
  prefix_expected_non_white_count: 9
  zeros_moved_from_end_of_prefix: 2 # The two '0's at indices 11, 12
  pixels_off_input_vs_expected: 4  # Indices 2, 3, 11, 12 differ (relative to expected)

Example 3:
  length: 23
  delimiter_index: 13
  prefix_length: 13
  prefix_input_white_count: 3
  prefix_expected_white_count: 3
  prefix_input_non_white_count: 10
  prefix_expected_non_white_count: 10
  zeros_moved_from_end_of_prefix: 2 # The two '0's at indices 11, 12
  pixels_off_input_vs_expected: 4  # Indices 1, 2, 11, 12 differ (relative to expected)

```


**Key Observations from Metrics:**

*   The counts of white and non-white pixels within the prefix remain constant, confirming it's a rearrangement task.
*   The number of pixels differing between the input prefix and the expected output prefix is consistently 4 in these examples (twice the number of zeros moved), reflecting the displacement.
*   The crucial insight is the identification of the *specific* white pixels being moved: only those immediately preceding the delimiter.

## Facts


```yaml
Data:
  Type: 1D sequence of integers (colors).
  Delimiter:
    Color: maroon (9)
    Function: Separates the sequence into a prefix and a suffix.
    Position: Its index marks the boundary. Unchanged by the transformation.

Transformation:
  Target: The prefix subsequence (elements before the maroon delimiter).
  Action: Relocation of a specific subset of white pixels within the prefix.
  Rule:
    1. Identify the contiguous block of white (0) pixels, if any, located immediately before the maroon (9) delimiter in the input prefix.
    2. Separate the prefix into three parts:
       - `leading_part`: Pixels from the start of the prefix up to the beginning of the identified white block.
       - `moved_whites`: The identified contiguous block of white pixels from step 1.
       - `trailing_part`: Any remaining pixels between the `leading_part` and the `moved_whites` (This part seems to be always empty based on the rule focusing on the *end* block of whites, but conceptually useful). More accurately: the prefix consists of `part_before_moved_whites` and `moved_whites`.
    3. Construct the new prefix by concatenating:
       - The `moved_whites`.
       - The `part_before_moved_whites` (all pixels from the original prefix *excluding* the `moved_whites`).
    4. The relative order of pixels within the `part_before_moved_whites` is preserved.
  Unaffected_Part: The suffix subsequence (the maroon delimiter and all subsequent pixels) remains unchanged.

Relationships:
  - The transformation depends on the position of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - Only white pixels immediately adjacent (left side) to the maroon pixel are affected.
  - Other white pixels earlier in the sequence are *not* moved.
  - The relative order of all non-moved pixels is preserved.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of pixels.
2.  Locate the position (index) of the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel (the delimiter). If no delimiter is found, return the input sequence unchanged.
3.  Split the input sequence into two parts:
    *   `prefix`: The subsequence of pixels from the beginning up to (but not including) the delimiter index.
    *   `suffix`: The subsequence of pixels starting from the delimiter index to the end of the sequence.
4.  If the `prefix` is empty, return the input sequence unchanged.
5.  Initialize an empty list `moved_whites`.
6.  Initialize a variable `split_point` to the length of the `prefix`.
7.  Iterate backwards from the end of the `prefix` (index `len(prefix) - 1`) towards the beginning:
    *   If the current pixel is white (0), prepend it to the `moved_whites` list and update `split_point` to the current index.
    *   If the current pixel is not white (non-zero), stop the backward iteration.
8.  Identify the `part_before_moved_whites` as the portion of the original `prefix` from its beginning up to the `split_point` index (exclusive).
9.  Create the `transformed_prefix` by concatenating the `moved_whites` list followed by the `part_before_moved_whites` list/subsequence.
10. Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `transformed_prefix` and the original `suffix`.
11. Return the final output sequence.
