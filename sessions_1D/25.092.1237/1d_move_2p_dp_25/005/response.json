Locate the index of the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel (the delimiter). If no delimiter is found, return the input sequence unchanged.\n3.  Split the input sequence into two parts:\n    *   `prefix`: The subsequence of pixels from the beginning up to (but not including) the delimiter index.\n    *   `suffix`: The subsequence of pixels starting from the delimiter index to the end of the sequence.\n4.  If the `prefix` is empty, return the input sequence unchanged.\n5.  Identify the contiguous block of white (0) pixels located immediately at the end of the `prefix` (i.e., just before the delimiter).\n6.  Determine the starting index (`split_point`) of this contiguous white block within the `prefix`. If no white block exists at the end, the `split_point` is the length of the `prefix`.\n7.  Separate the `prefix` into two parts based on the `split_point`:\n    *   `part_before_moved_whites`: Pixels from the start of the `prefix` up to the `split_point` (exclusive).\n    *   `moved_whites`: The contiguous block of white pixels from the `split_point` to the end of the `prefix`.\n8.  Create the `transformed_prefix` by concatenating the `moved_whites` followed by the `part_before_moved_whites`.\n9.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `transformed_prefix` and the original `suffix`.\n10. Return the final output sequence as a NumPy array.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Imports\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define constants\nWHITE = 0\nMAROON = 9\n\ndef find_first_delimiter(sequence: np.ndarray, delimiter_value: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the first occurrence of the delimiter value in a NumPy array.\n    \n    Args:\n        sequence: The input NumPy array.\n        delimiter_value: The integer value to search for.\n        \n    Returns:\n        The index of the first occurrence of the delimiter.
