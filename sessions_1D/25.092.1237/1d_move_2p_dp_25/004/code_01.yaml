Data:
  Type: 1D sequence of integers (colors).
  Delimiter:
    Color: maroon (9)
    Function: Separates the sequence into a prefix and a suffix.
    Position: Its index marks the boundary. Unchanged by the transformation.

Transformation:
  Target: The prefix subsequence (elements before the maroon delimiter).
  Action: Relocation of a specific subset of white pixels within the prefix.
  Rule:
    1. Identify the contiguous block of white (0) pixels, if any, located immediately before the maroon (9) delimiter in the input prefix.
    2. Separate the prefix into three parts:
       - `leading_part`: Pixels from the start of the prefix up to the beginning of the identified white block.
       - `moved_whites`: The identified contiguous block of white pixels from step 1.
       - `trailing_part`: Any remaining pixels between the `leading_part` and the `moved_whites` (This part seems to be always empty based on the rule focusing on the *end* block of whites, but conceptually useful). More accurately: the prefix consists of `part_before_moved_whites` and `moved_whites`.
    3. Construct the new prefix by concatenating:
       - The `moved_whites`.
       - The `part_before_moved_whites` (all pixels from the original prefix *excluding* the `moved_whites`).
    4. The relative order of pixels within the `part_before_moved_whites` is preserved.
  Unaffected_Part: The suffix subsequence (the maroon delimiter and all subsequent pixels) remains unchanged.

Relationships:
  - The transformation depends on the position of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - Only white pixels immediately adjacent (left side) to the maroon pixel are affected.
  - Other white pixels earlier in the sequence are *not* moved.
  - The relative order of all non-moved pixels is preserved.
