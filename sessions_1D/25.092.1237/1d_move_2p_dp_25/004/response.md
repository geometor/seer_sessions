## General Assessment

The initial analysis identified the core components: a 1D sequence, a maroon (9) delimiter separating a prefix and suffix, and a transformation applied only to the prefix. The first attempt at the transformation logic was plausible based on a single example but proved incorrect when tested against the full training set.

The code generated based on the initial natural language program failed because it returned the input unchanged for all examples. This indicates the transformation logic within the code, specifically the separation and recombination of white and non-white pixels, was either flawed or not triggered correctly.

The comparison between the input and expected output reveals a more nuanced transformation than initially perceived. The key insight is that not *all* white pixels in the prefix are moved. Instead, only the contiguous block of white pixels located *immediately before* the maroon (9) delimiter are relocated to the very beginning of the prefix. The relative order of all other pixels within the prefix remains unchanged.

## Metrics

Based on the comparison between the provided inputs and expected outputs:


```yaml
Example 1:
  length: 23
  delimiter_index: 21
  prefix_length: 21
  prefix_input_white_count: 2
  prefix_expected_white_count: 2
  prefix_input_non_white_count: 19
  prefix_expected_non_white_count: 19
  zeros_moved_from_end_of_prefix: 2 # The two '0's at indices 19, 20
  pixels_off_input_vs_expected: 4  # Indices 0, 1, 19, 20 differ

Example 2:
  length: 23
  delimiter_index: 13
  prefix_length: 13
  prefix_input_white_count: 4
  prefix_expected_white_count: 4
  prefix_input_non_white_count: 9
  prefix_expected_non_white_count: 9
  zeros_moved_from_end_of_prefix: 2 # The two '0's at indices 11, 12
  pixels_off_input_vs_expected: 4  # Indices 2, 3, 11, 12 differ (relative to expected)

Example 3:
  length: 23
  delimiter_index: 13
  prefix_length: 13
  prefix_input_white_count: 3
  prefix_expected_white_count: 3
  prefix_input_non_white_count: 10
  prefix_expected_non_white_count: 10
  zeros_moved_from_end_of_prefix: 2 # The two '0's at indices 11, 12
  pixels_off_input_vs_expected: 4  # Indices 1, 2, 11, 12 differ (relative to expected)

```


**Key Observations from Metrics:**

*   The counts of white and non-white pixels within the prefix remain constant, confirming it's a rearrangement task.
*   The number of pixels differing between the input prefix and the expected output prefix is consistently 4 in these examples (twice the number of zeros moved), reflecting the displacement.
*   The crucial insight is the identification of the *specific* white pixels being moved: only those immediately preceding the delimiter.

## Facts


```yaml
Data:
  Type: 1D sequence of integers (colors).
  Delimiter:
    Color: maroon (9)
    Function: Separates the sequence into a prefix and a suffix.
    Position: Its index marks the boundary. Unchanged by the transformation.

Transformation:
  Target: The prefix subsequence (elements before the maroon delimiter).
  Action: Relocation of a specific subset of white pixels within the prefix.
  Rule:
    1. Identify the contiguous block of white (0) pixels, if any, located immediately before the maroon (9) delimiter in the input prefix.
    2. Separate the prefix into three parts:
       - `leading_part`: Pixels from the start of the prefix up to the beginning of the identified white block.
       - `moved_whites`: The identified contiguous block of white pixels from step 1.
       - `trailing_part`: Any remaining pixels between the `leading_part` and the `moved_whites` (This part seems to be always empty based on the rule focusing on the *end* block of whites, but conceptually useful). More accurately: the prefix consists of `part_before_moved_whites` and `moved_whites`.
    3. Construct the new prefix by concatenating:
       - The `moved_whites`.
       - The `part_before_moved_whites` (all pixels from the original prefix *excluding* the `moved_whites`).
    4. The relative order of pixels within the `part_before_moved_whites` is preserved.
  Unaffected_Part: The suffix subsequence (the maroon delimiter and all subsequent pixels) remains unchanged.

Relationships:
  - The transformation depends on the position of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - Only white pixels immediately adjacent (left side) to the maroon pixel are affected.
  - Other white pixels earlier in the sequence are *not* moved.
  - The relative order of all non-moved pixels is preserved.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of pixels.
2.  Locate the position (index) of the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel (the delimiter). If no delimiter is found, return the input sequence unchanged.
3.  Split the input sequence into two parts:
    *   `prefix`: The subsequence of pixels from the beginning up to (but not including) the delimiter index.
    *   `suffix`: The subsequence of pixels starting from the delimiter index to the end of the sequence.
4.  If the `prefix` is empty, return the input sequence unchanged.
5.  Initialize an empty list `moved_whites`.
6.  Initialize a variable `split_point` to the length of the `prefix`.
7.  Iterate backwards from the end of the `prefix` (index `len(prefix) - 1`) towards the beginning:
    *   If the current pixel is white (0), prepend it to the `moved_whites` list and update `split_point` to the current index.
    *   If the current pixel is not white (non-zero), stop the backward iteration.
8.  Identify the `part_before_moved_whites` as the portion of the original `prefix` from its beginning up to the `split_point` index (exclusive).
9.  Create the `transformed_prefix` by concatenating the `moved_whites` list followed by the `part_before_moved_whites` list/subsequence.
10. Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `transformed_prefix` and the original `suffix`.
11. Return the final output sequence.
