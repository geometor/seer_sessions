            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis identified the core components: a 1D sequence, a maroon (9) delimiter separating a prefix and suffix, and a transformation applied only to the prefix. The first attempt at the transformation logic was plausible based on a single example but proved incorrect when tested against the full training set.\n\nThe code generated based on the initial natural language program failed because it returned the input unchanged for all examples. This indicates the transformation logic within the code, specifically the separation and recombination of white and non-white pixels, was either flawed or not triggered correctly.\n\nThe comparison between the input and expected output reveals a more nuanced transformation than initially perceived. The key insight is that not *all* white pixels in the prefix are moved. Instead, only the contiguous block of white pixels located *immediately before* the maroon (9) delimiter are relocated to the very beginning of the prefix. The relative order of all other pixels within the prefix remains unchanged.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the comparison between the provided inputs and expected outputs:\n\n"
