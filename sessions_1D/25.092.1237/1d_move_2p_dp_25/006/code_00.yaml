Data:
  Type: 1D sequence of integers (colors).
  Format: NumPy array.
  Key_Colors:
    - white (0)
    - maroon (9)
Objects:
  - Delimiter: The first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - Prefix: The subsequence of pixels from the start of the input sequence up to (but not including) the delimiter.
  - Suffix: The subsequence of pixels starting from the delimiter to the end of the input sequence.
  - White_Pixels (within Prefix): All pixels in the prefix with the value 0.
  - Non_White_Pixels (within Prefix): All pixels in the prefix with values other than 0.
Properties:
  - Relative order of Non_White_Pixels within the prefix is significant.
Actions:
  - Find: Locate the first maroon (9) pixel.
  - Split: Divide the input sequence into Prefix and Suffix based on the delimiter's position.
  - Filter/Separate: Within the Prefix, separate White_Pixels from Non_White_Pixels.
  - Preserve_Order: Maintain the original relative order of the Non_White_Pixels during separation.
  - Concatenate:
    1. Combine the separated White_Pixels and the ordered Non_White_Pixels to form the `transformed_prefix`.
    2. Combine the `transformed_prefix` and the original Suffix to form the final output sequence.
Constraints:
  - If no maroon (9) delimiter is found, the input sequence should remain unchanged.
  - If the prefix is empty (delimiter is the first element), the input sequence should remain unchanged.
  - The Suffix part of the sequence is always unchanged.
