Locate the index of the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel, which acts as a delimiter.\n3.  Split the input sequence into two parts based on the delimiter index:\n    *   `prefix`: The subsequence of pixels from the beginning up to (but not including) the delimiter.\n    *   `suffix`: The subsequence of pixels starting from the delimiter to the end of the sequence.\n4.  Within the `prefix`, identify and separate pixels into two groups:\n    *   `white_pixels`: All pixels with the value 0.\n    *   `non_white_pixels`: All pixels with values other than 0, maintaining their original relative order.\n5.  Create the `transformed_prefix` by concatenating the `white_pixels` array followed by the `non_white_pixels` array.\n6.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `transformed_prefix` and the original `suffix`.\n7.
