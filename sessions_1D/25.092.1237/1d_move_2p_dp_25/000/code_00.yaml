Data:
  Type: 1D sequence of integers (colors)
  Delimiter:
    Color: maroon (9)
    Function: Separates the sequence into a prefix and a suffix.
    Position: Fixed relative to the end; unchanged by the transformation.

Transformation:
  Target: The prefix subsequence (elements before the maroon delimiter).
  Action: Reordering pixels within the prefix.
  Rule:
    1. Identify all white pixels (0) in the prefix.
    2. Identify all non-white pixels in the prefix, maintaining their relative order.
    3. Construct the new prefix by concatenating:
       - All identified white pixels.
       - All identified non-white pixels (in their original relative order).
  Unaffected_Part: The suffix subsequence (the maroon delimiter and all subsequent pixels) remains unchanged.

Relationships:
  - The transformation depends on the position of the maroon (9) pixel.
  - The relative order of non-white pixels within the prefix is preserved.
  - The count of each color within the prefix remains the same, only their positions change.
