"""
Transformation Rule:
1.  Receive the input sequence of pixels as a NumPy array.
2.  Locate the index of the first occurrence of the maroon (9) pixel (the delimiter). If no delimiter is found, return the input sequence unchanged.
3.  Split the input sequence into two parts:
    *   `prefix`: The subsequence of pixels from the beginning up to (but not including) the delimiter index.
    *   `suffix`: The subsequence of pixels starting from the delimiter index to the end of the sequence.
4.  If the `prefix` is empty, return the input sequence unchanged.
5.  Within the `prefix`, separate the pixels into two groups using NumPy boolean indexing:
    *   `white_pixels`: All pixels with the value 0.
    *   `non_white_pixels`: All pixels with values other than 0. Boolean indexing preserves their original relative order.
6.  Create the `transformed_prefix` by concatenating the `white_pixels` array followed by the `non_white_pixels` array.
7.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `transformed_prefix` and the original `suffix`.
8.  Return the final output sequence as a NumPy array.
