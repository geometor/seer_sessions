Data:
  Type: 1D sequence (numpy.ndarray) of integers (colors).
  Delimiter:
    Color: maroon (9)
    Function: Separates the sequence into a prefix and a suffix.
    Occurrence: Assumed to appear at least once in each sequence based on examples.
    Position: The index of the *first* occurrence defines the split point.

Transformation:
  Target: The prefix subsequence (elements before the first maroon delimiter).
  Action: Reordering pixels within the prefix based on color.
  Rule:
    1. Identify all white pixels (0) within the prefix.
    2. Identify all non-white pixels (non-0) within the prefix, preserving their relative order.
    3. Construct the new prefix by concatenating:
       - All identified white pixels.
       - All identified non-white pixels (in their original relative order).
  Unaffected_Part: The suffix subsequence (the first maroon delimiter and all subsequent pixels) remains unchanged.

Properties:
  - The length of the sequence remains the same after transformation.
  - The count of each color within the entire sequence remains the same.
  - The relative order of non-white pixels in the prefix is preserved.
  - The relative order of all pixels in the suffix is preserved.
  - The transformation is deterministic.
