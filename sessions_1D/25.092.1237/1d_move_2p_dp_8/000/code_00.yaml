Grid:
  - type: 1xN array (row vector)
  - size: Constant between input and output
Pixels:
  - background: white (0)
  - target: gray (5) - exactly one instance
  - moving_object_color: Any color except white (0) or gray (5)
Objects:
  - background: Area composed of white (0) pixels
  - target_pixel: A single pixel of gray (5) color
    - properties: Fixed position
  - moving_block: A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of the same color (not white, not gray)
    - properties:
      - color: Consistent within the block
      - length: Variable
      - position: Changes between input and output
Relationships:
  - target_pixel: Always present, unique
  - moving_block: Always present, unique, contiguous
  - final_position: The rightmost pixel of the moving_block is adjacent to (immediately left of) the target_pixel in the output.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the target_pixel (gray) and the moving_block (non-white, non-gray contiguous block).
  - Preserve: Keep the target_pixel in its original column position in the output.
  - Calculate: Determine the required starting column for the moving_block in the output based on the target_pixel's position and the moving_block's length.
  - Move: Place the moving_block at the calculated position in the output grid.
  - Fill: Set all other pixels in the output grid to white (0).
