**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on 1xN grids (row vectors). Each input grid contains three types of pixels: background white pixels (0), a single gray pixel (5), and a single contiguous block of another color (e.g., red (2) or azure (8)). The gray pixel acts as a fixed anchor or target point. The colored block is the object that moves. The transformation involves repositioning the colored block within the grid. The output grid retains the gray pixel in its original position, moves the colored block so that it ends immediately to the left of the gray pixel, and fills the remaining positions with white pixels. The size of the grid remains unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  - type: 1xN array (row vector)
  - size: Constant between input and output
Pixels:
  - background: white (0)
  - target: gray (5) - exactly one instance
  - moving_object_color: Any color except white (0) or gray (5)
Objects:
  - background: Area composed of white (0) pixels
  - target_pixel: A single pixel of gray (5) color
    - properties: Fixed position
  - moving_block: A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of the same color (not white, not gray)
    - properties:
      - color: Consistent within the block
      - length: Variable
      - position: Changes between input and output
Relationships:
  - target_pixel: Always present, unique
  - moving_block: Always present, unique, contiguous
  - final_position: The rightmost pixel of the moving_block is adjacent to (immediately left of) the target_pixel in the output.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the target_pixel (gray) and the moving_block (non-white, non-gray contiguous block).
  - Preserve: Keep the target_pixel in its original column position in the output.
  - Calculate: Determine the required starting column for the moving_block in the output based on the target_pixel's position and the moving_block's length.
  - Move: Place the moving_block at the calculated position in the output grid.
  - Fill: Set all other pixels in the output grid to white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  Find the column index of the gray (5) pixel in the input grid. Place a gray (5) pixel at this same column index in the new grid.
3.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not gray (5). Record its color and its length (number of pixels).
4.  Calculate the target starting column index for this block in the new grid by subtracting the block's length from the column index of the gray pixel.
5.  Fill the cells in the new grid starting from the calculated target starting column index for the recorded length with the block's recorded color.
