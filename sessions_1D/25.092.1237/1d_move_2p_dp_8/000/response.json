Each input grid contains three types of pixels: background white pixels (0), a single gray pixel (5), and a single contiguous block of another color (e.g., red (2) or azure (8)). The gray pixel acts as a fixed anchor or target point. The colored block is the object that moves. The transformation involves repositioning the colored block within the grid. The output grid retains the gray pixel in its original position, moves the colored block so that it ends immediately to the left of the gray pixel, and fills the remaining positions with white pixels. The size of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
