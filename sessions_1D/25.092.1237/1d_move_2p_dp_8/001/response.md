Transforms a 1xN grid by moving a contiguous block of a non-background, non-gray color 
so that its right edge is immediately adjacent to the single gray pixel (5).

1.  Identify the position (index) of the gray pixel (5).
2.  Identify the contiguous block of color that is not white (0) or gray (5). Record its color and length.
3.  Create an output grid of the same size, initialized to white (0).
4.  Place the gray pixel (5) in the output grid at its original index.
5.  Calculate the starting index for the colored block in the output grid by subtracting the block's length from the gray pixel's index.
6.  Place the colored block into the output grid starting at the calculated index.
