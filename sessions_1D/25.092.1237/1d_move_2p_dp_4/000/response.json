The rest of the pixels are white (0).\nThe output shows that the contiguous block of color has shifted its position horizontally to the right.\nThe azure (8) pixel does not change its position.\nThe block of color moves rightwards until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the azure (8) pixel.\nThe pixels originally occupied by the left part of the block before the shift become white (0) in the output. The relative positions of other white pixels and the azure pixel remain unchanged, except for those replaced by the shifted block or those filling the vacated space.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
