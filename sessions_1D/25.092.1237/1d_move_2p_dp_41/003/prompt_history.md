Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or grids of height 1).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), green (3), and one other color which varies between examples (red=2, orange=7). White seems to function as a background or separator.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is always a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-green color (e.g., `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2` or `7 7 7 7 7 7`). Let's call this the "main object".
    *   There is always a single green pixel (3). Let's call this the "anchor pixel".
    *   The anchor pixel always appears *after* the main object in the input sequence.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve rearranging the pixels. Specifically, the main object seems to shift its position relative to the start of the grid, but its position relative to the anchor pixel remains constant *if* you ignore the intervening white pixels. The number of white pixels between the main object and the anchor pixel in the input seems crucial. In all examples, there are two white pixels between the main object and the anchor. In the output, these two white pixels appear immediately *before* the main object, effectively pushing the main object to the right. The anchor pixel and any pixels following it remain in their original positions relative to the end of the sequence.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify three key components:
    a.  The 'main object': A contiguous sequence of identical pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor green (3).
    b.  The 'anchor pixel': The single pixel with the color green (3).
    c.  The 'separator pixels': The sequence of white (0) pixels located directly between the end of the 'main object' and the 'anchor pixel'.
2.  Identify the pixels *before* the 'main object'.
3.  Identify the pixels *from* the 'anchor pixel' to the end of the grid.
4.  Construct the output grid by concatenating these components in the following order:
    a.  The pixels *before* the 'main object'.
    b.  The 'separator pixels'.
    c.  The 'main object'.
    d.  The pixels *from* the 'anchor pixel' to the end.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` typically occurs when a NumPy array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (like an `if` statement) without explicit aggregation (`.any()` or `.all()`). Given that the core logic identified (finding segments and rearranging them) seems correct and matches all examples, the error likely originates from the testing environment passing the input grid as a NumPy array instead of the list-of-lists format the initial code might have implicitly assumed for all operations. The strategy is to make the Python code robust to this potential input type variation, likely by ensuring the data being processed is in a consistent format (e.g., standard Python lists) or by using NumPy-aware functions and checks if NumPy arrays are indeed being used. The underlying logic of the transformation does not need revision based on this error.

**Metrics:**

Metrics derived manually by applying the previously defined logic to each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]` (Length 14)
    *   Pixels Before Main Object: `[0]` (Length 1)
    *   Main Object: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (Length 9, Color 2)
    *   Separator Pixels: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Anchor & After: `[3, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Expected Output: `[0] + [0, 0] + [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] + [3, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 14)
    *   Pixels Before Main Object: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Main Object: `[2, 2, 2]` (Length 3, Color 2)
    *   Separator Pixels: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Anchor & After: `[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 7)
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0] + [0, 0] + [2, 2, 2] + [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0]` (Length 14)
    *   Pixels Before Main Object: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 4)
    *   Main Object: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]` (Length 6, Color 7)
    *   Separator Pixels: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Anchor & After: `[3, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0] + [0, 0] + [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] + [3, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0]`

The manually derived outputs match the target outputs for all examples, confirming the transformation logic remains valid. The error reported during execution points towards an implementation detail or data type mismatch rather than a flaw in the perceived rule.

  Rule: Move the 'Separator Pixels' sequence from its original position (between 'Main Object' and 'Anchor Pixel') to a new position immediately before the 'Main Object'.
Output:
  Structure: Derived by rearranging Input pixel sequences.
  Order:
    1. Background/Prefix Pixels (from Input)
    2. Separator Pixels (from Input)
    3. Main Object pixels (from Input)
    4. Anchor Pixel (from Input)
    5. Suffix Pixels (from Input)
  Note: The combination of 'Anchor Pixel' and 'Suffix Pixels' can be treated as a single 'Anchor and After' segment that remains fixed relative to the end of the sequence rearrangement.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a single row (1D array) of pixels.
2.  Scan the input row to identify and segment it into the following parts based on pixel values and contiguity:
    a.  The `Prefix`: Any sequence of pixels from the start until the first pixel that is *not* white (0) and *not* green (3).
    b.  The `Main Object`: The contiguous sequence of identical pixels immediately following the `Prefix`, where the pixel color is *neither* white (0) *nor* green (3).
    c.  The `Separators`: The sequence of white (0) pixels immediately following the `Main Object`.
    d.  The `Anchor and Suffix`: The single green (3) pixel immediately following the `Separators`, plus all subsequent pixels until the end of the row.
3.  Construct the output row by concatenating these segments in the order: `Prefix` + `Separators` + `Main Object` + `Anchor and Suffix`.
4.  Format the output as a single row (1D array).
