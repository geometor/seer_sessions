            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or grids of height 1).\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), green (3), and one other color which varies between examples (red=2, orange=7). White seems to function as a background or separator.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   There is always a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-green color (e.g., `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2` or `7 7 7 7 7 7`). Let's call this the \"main object\".\n    *   There is always a single green pixel (3). Let's call this the \"anchor pixel\".\n    *   The anchor pixel always appears *after* the main object in the input sequence.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve rearranging the pixels. Specifically, the main object seems to shift its position relative to the start of the grid, but its position relative to the anchor pixel remains constant *if* you ignore the intervening white pixels. The number of white pixels between the main object and the anchor pixel in the input seems crucial. In all examples, there are two white pixels between the main object and the anchor. In the output, these two white pixels appear immediately *before* the main object, effectively pushing the main object to the right. The anchor pixel and any pixels following it remain in their original positions relative to the end of the sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
