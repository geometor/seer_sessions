Grid:
  Type: 1D Array
  Element: Pixel (Integer 0-9)
Input:
  Objects:
    - Name: Main Object
      Type: Contiguous block of pixels
      Properties:
        - Color != 0 (white)
        - Color != 3 (green)
        - Appears once
    - Name: Anchor Pixel
      Type: Single pixel
      Properties:
        - Color == 3 (green)
        - Appears once
        - Located after the Main Object
    - Name: Separator Pixels
      Type: Sequence of pixels
      Properties:
        - Color == 0 (white)
        - Located between the end of the Main Object and the Anchor Pixel
  Relationships:
    - Main Object precedes Anchor Pixel.
    - Separator Pixels are located between Main Object and Anchor Pixel.
Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange Pixels
  Rule: Move the Separator Pixels from their position between the Main Object and Anchor Pixel to the position immediately preceding the Main Object.
Output:
  Structure: Derived by rearranging Input pixels.
  Order:
    1. Pixels before Main Object (from Input)
    2. Separator Pixels (from Input)
    3. Main Object pixels (from Input)
    4. Anchor Pixel and subsequent pixels (from Input)
