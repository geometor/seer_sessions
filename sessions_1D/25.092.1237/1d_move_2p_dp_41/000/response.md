Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or grids of height 1).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), green (3), and one other color which varies between examples (red=2, orange=7). White seems to function as a background or separator.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is always a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-green color (e.g., `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2` or `7 7 7 7 7 7`). Let's call this the "main object".
    *   There is always a single green pixel (3). Let's call this the "anchor pixel".
    *   The anchor pixel always appears *after* the main object in the input sequence.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve rearranging the pixels. Specifically, the main object seems to shift its position relative to the start of the grid, but its position relative to the anchor pixel remains constant *if* you ignore the intervening white pixels. The number of white pixels between the main object and the anchor pixel in the input seems crucial. In all examples, there are two white pixels between the main object and the anchor. In the output, these two white pixels appear immediately *before* the main object, effectively pushing the main object to the right. The anchor pixel and any pixels following it remain in their original positions relative to the end of the sequence.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D Array
  Element: Pixel (Integer 0-9)
Input:
  Objects:
    - Name: Main Object
      Type: Contiguous block of pixels
      Properties:
        - Color != 0 (white)
        - Color != 3 (green)
        - Appears once
    - Name: Anchor Pixel
      Type: Single pixel
      Properties:
        - Color == 3 (green)
        - Appears once
        - Located after the Main Object
    - Name: Separator Pixels
      Type: Sequence of pixels
      Properties:
        - Color == 0 (white)
        - Located between the end of the Main Object and the Anchor Pixel
  Relationships:
    - Main Object precedes Anchor Pixel.
    - Separator Pixels are located between Main Object and Anchor Pixel.
Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange Pixels
  Rule: Move the Separator Pixels from their position between the Main Object and Anchor Pixel to the position immediately preceding the Main Object.
Output:
  Structure: Derived by rearranging Input pixels.
  Order:
    1. Pixels before Main Object (from Input)
    2. Separator Pixels (from Input)
    3. Main Object pixels (from Input)
    4. Anchor Pixel and subsequent pixels (from Input)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify three key components:
    a.  The 'main object': A contiguous sequence of identical pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor green (3).
    b.  The 'anchor pixel': The single pixel with the color green (3).
    c.  The 'separator pixels': The sequence of white (0) pixels located directly between the end of the 'main object' and the 'anchor pixel'.
2.  Identify the pixels *before* the 'main object'.
3.  Identify the pixels *from* the 'anchor pixel' to the end of the grid.
4.  Construct the output grid by concatenating these components in the following order:
    a.  The pixels *before* the 'main object'.
    b.  The 'separator pixels'.
    c.  The 'main object'.
    d.  The pixels *from* the 'anchor pixel' to the end.
