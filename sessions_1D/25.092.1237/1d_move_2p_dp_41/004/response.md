**Assessment and Strategy:**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" consistently occurs across all examples. This strongly indicates an issue with how the input data, likely represented as NumPy arrays or lists containing NumPy arrays by the testing environment, is being handled within conditional statements (like `if not input_grid:` or potentially others if NumPy arrays are unexpectedly created). The core transformation logic identified previously (finding prefix, main object, separators, anchor+suffix, and rearranging them) seems plausible based on visual inspection, but the implementation fails due to type mismatches or improper handling of array structures in boolean contexts.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the exact structure and type of the `input_grid` passed to the function using `tool_code`.
2.  Modify the Python code to explicitly handle the expected input structure (likely a list containing one list or NumPy array) and ensure that all conditional checks operate on standard Python lists or use appropriate NumPy methods (`.any()`, `.all()`, `.size`).
3.  Re-verify the identification and slicing logic for the prefix, main object, separators, and anchor/suffix segments based on the confirmed input structure.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's examine the structure of the input for each training example.

    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0]],

**Revised YAML Facts:**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Format: List containing a single element, which is a List (representing the 1D grid row).
  ExampleFormat: [[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]
  PotentialFormatInEnv: May be passed as a NumPy array of shape (1, N).
  Content: Pixels represented by integers 0-9.
Objects:
  - Name: MainObject
    Identification: Contiguous sequence of identical pixels with color C, where C is not white (0) and not green (3).
    Properties: Appears exactly once.
  - Name: AnchorPixel
    Identification: The first pixel with color green (3) appearing *after* the MainObject.
    Properties: Appears exactly once after the MainObject.
  - Name: SeparatorPixels
    Identification: Sequence of pixels located directly between the end of the MainObject and the AnchorPixel.
    Properties: Consist only of white (0) pixels in observed examples. Length varies (is 2 in all examples).
  - Name: PrefixPixels
    Identification: Sequence of pixels located before the start of the MainObject.
    Properties: Can be empty or contain any pixels.
  - Name: SuffixPixels
    Identification: Sequence of pixels located after the AnchorPixel.
    Properties: Can be empty or contain any pixels. Include the AnchorPixel itself for concatenation purposes.
Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange pixel segments.
  Rule: Reconstruct the grid row by concatenating segments in the order: PrefixPixels, SeparatorPixels, MainObject, AnchorPixel + SuffixPixels.
OutputGrid:
  Format: Same as InputGrid (List containing a single List).
  Content: Rearranged pixels from the InputGrid based on the transformation rule.
```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected as a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]]`). Extract the inner list representing the 1D row of pixels. If the input format is different (e.g., empty list, or the inner element isn't a list), handle appropriately (e.g., return the input unchanged).
2.  Scan the row to find the start and end indices of the 'Main Object': the first contiguous sequence of identical pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor green (3). Record its color. If no such object is found, return the original grid.
3.  Scan the row *starting from the index immediately after the Main Object* to find the index of the 'Anchor Pixel', which is the first occurrence of the green (3) pixel. If no Anchor Pixel is found after the Main Object, return the original grid.
4.  Identify the pixel segments based on the found indices:
    a.  'Prefix': Pixels from the start of the row up to (but not including) the start index of the Main Object.
    b.  'Main Object': Pixels from the start index to the end index of the Main Object.
    c.  'Separators': Pixels from the index immediately after the Main Object up to (but not including) the index of the Anchor Pixel.
    d.  'Anchor+Suffix': Pixels from the index of the Anchor Pixel to the end of the row.
5.  Construct the output row by concatenating the segments in this specific order: Prefix + Separators + Main Object + Anchor+Suffix.
6.  Format the output row into the required output structure: a list containing the newly constructed list (e.g., `[[p1, p2, ...]]`).
