InputGrid:
  Format: List containing a single element, which is a List (representing the 1D grid row).
  ExampleFormat: [[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]
  PotentialFormatInEnv: May be passed as a NumPy array of shape (1, N).
  Content: Pixels represented by integers 0-9.
Objects:
  - Name: MainObject
    Identification: Contiguous sequence of identical pixels with color C, where C is not white (0) and not green (3).
    Properties: Appears exactly once.
  - Name: AnchorPixel
    Identification: The first pixel with color green (3) appearing *after* the MainObject.
    Properties: Appears exactly once after the MainObject.
  - Name: SeparatorPixels
    Identification: Sequence of pixels located directly between the end of the MainObject and the AnchorPixel.
    Properties: Consist only of white (0) pixels in observed examples. Length varies (is 2 in all examples).
  - Name: PrefixPixels
    Identification: Sequence of pixels located before the start of the MainObject.
    Properties: Can be empty or contain any pixels.
  - Name: SuffixPixels
    Identification: Sequence of pixels located after the AnchorPixel.
    Properties: Can be empty or contain any pixels. Include the AnchorPixel itself for concatenation purposes.
Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange pixel segments.
  Rule: Reconstruct the grid row by concatenating segments in the order: PrefixPixels, SeparatorPixels, MainObject, AnchorPixel + SuffixPixels.
OutputGrid:
  Format: Same as InputGrid (List containing a single List).
  Content: Rearranged pixels from the InputGrid based on the transformation rule.
