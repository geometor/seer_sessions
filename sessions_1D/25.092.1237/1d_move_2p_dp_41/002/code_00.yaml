Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (represented as a list or 1xN 2D array)
  Element: Pixel (Integer 0-9)
Input:
  Objects:
    - Name: Background/Prefix Pixels
      Type: Sequence of pixels
      Properties:
        - Located at the start of the grid, before the Main Object.
        - Color == 0 (white) # In examples, but definition is just 'before main object'
    - Name: Main Object
      Type: Contiguous block of pixels
      Properties:
        - Color != 0 (white)
        - Color != 3 (green)
        - Appears once
    - Name: Separator Pixels
      Type: Sequence of pixels
      Properties:
        - Color == 0 (white)
        - Located between the end of the Main Object and the Anchor Pixel.
        - Length is consistent (2) across examples. # Observation added
    - Name: Anchor Pixel
      Type: Single pixel
      Properties:
        - Color == 3 (green)
        - Appears once
        - Located after the Separator Pixels.
    - Name: Suffix Pixels
      Type: Sequence of pixels
      Properties:
        - Located after the Anchor Pixel, until the end of the grid.
Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange Pixel Sequences
  Rule: Move the 'Separator Pixels' sequence from its original position (between 'Main Object' and 'Anchor Pixel') to a new position immediately before the 'Main Object'.
Output:
  Structure: Derived by rearranging Input pixel sequences.
  Order:
    1. Background/Prefix Pixels (from Input)
    2. Separator Pixels (from Input)
    3. Main Object pixels (from Input)
    4. Anchor Pixel (from Input)
    5. Suffix Pixels (from Input)
  Note: The combination of 'Anchor Pixel' and 'Suffix Pixels' can be treated as a single 'Anchor and After' segment that remains fixed relative to the end of the sequence rearrangement.
