            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` typically occurs when a NumPy array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (like an `if` statement) without explicit aggregation (`.any()` or `.all()`). Given that the core logic identified (finding segments and rearranging them) seems correct and matches all examples, the error likely originates from the testing environment passing the input grid as a NumPy array instead of the list-of-lists format the initial code might have implicitly assumed for all operations. The strategy is to make the Python code robust to this potential input type variation, likely by ensuring the data being processed is in a consistent format (e.g., standard Python lists) or by using NumPy-aware functions and checks if NumPy arrays are indeed being used. The underlying logic of the transformation does not need revision based on this error.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nMetrics derived manually by applying the previously defined logic to each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]` (Length 14)\n    *   Pixels Before Main Object: `[0]` (Length 1)\n    *   Main Object: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (Length 9, Color 2)\n    *   Separator Pixels: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)\n    *   Anchor & After: `[3, 0]` (Length 2)\n    *   Expected Output: `[0] + [0, 0] + [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] + [3, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]`\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 14)\n    *   Pixels Before Main Object: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)\n    *   Main Object: `[2, 2, 2]` (Length 3, Color 2)\n    *   Separator Pixels: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)\n    *   Anchor & After: `[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 7)\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0] + [0, 0] + [2, 2, 2] + [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0]` (Length 14)\n    *   Pixels Before Main Object: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 4)\n    *   Main Object: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]` (Length 6, Color 7)\n    *   Separator Pixels: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)\n    *   Anchor & After: `[3, 0]` (Length 2)\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0] + [0, 0] + [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] + [3, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0]`\n\nThe manually derived outputs match the target outputs for all examples, confirming the transformation logic remains valid. The error reported during execution points towards an implementation detail or data type mismatch rather than a flaw in the perceived rule.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
