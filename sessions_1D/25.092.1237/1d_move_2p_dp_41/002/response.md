**General Assessment:**

The error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` typically occurs when a NumPy array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (like an `if` statement) without explicit aggregation (`.any()` or `.all()`). Given that the core logic identified (finding segments and rearranging them) seems correct and matches all examples, the error likely originates from the testing environment passing the input grid as a NumPy array instead of the list-of-lists format the initial code might have implicitly assumed for all operations. The strategy is to make the Python code robust to this potential input type variation, likely by ensuring the data being processed is in a consistent format (e.g., standard Python lists) or by using NumPy-aware functions and checks if NumPy arrays are indeed being used. The underlying logic of the transformation does not need revision based on this error.

**Metrics:**

Metrics derived manually by applying the previously defined logic to each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]` (Length 14)
    *   Pixels Before Main Object: `[0]` (Length 1)
    *   Main Object: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (Length 9, Color 2)
    *   Separator Pixels: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Anchor & After: `[3, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Expected Output: `[0] + [0, 0] + [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] + [3, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 14)
    *   Pixels Before Main Object: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Main Object: `[2, 2, 2]` (Length 3, Color 2)
    *   Separator Pixels: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Anchor & After: `[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 7)
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0] + [0, 0] + [2, 2, 2] + [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0]` (Length 14)
    *   Pixels Before Main Object: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 4)
    *   Main Object: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]` (Length 6, Color 7)
    *   Separator Pixels: `[0, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Anchor & After: `[3, 0]` (Length 2)
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0] + [0, 0] + [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] + [3, 0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0]`

The manually derived outputs match the target outputs for all examples, confirming the transformation logic remains valid. The error reported during execution points towards an implementation detail or data type mismatch rather than a flaw in the perceived rule.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (represented as a list or 1xN 2D array)
  Element: Pixel (Integer 0-9)
Input:
  Objects:
    - Name: Background/Prefix Pixels
      Type: Sequence of pixels
      Properties:
        - Located at the start of the grid, before the Main Object.
        - Color == 0 (white) # In examples, but definition is just 'before main object'
    - Name: Main Object
      Type: Contiguous block of pixels
      Properties:
        - Color != 0 (white)
        - Color != 3 (green)
        - Appears once
    - Name: Separator Pixels
      Type: Sequence of pixels
      Properties:
        - Color == 0 (white)
        - Located between the end of the Main Object and the Anchor Pixel.
        - Length is consistent (2) across examples. # Observation added
    - Name: Anchor Pixel
      Type: Single pixel
      Properties:
        - Color == 3 (green)
        - Appears once
        - Located after the Separator Pixels.
    - Name: Suffix Pixels
      Type: Sequence of pixels
      Properties:
        - Located after the Anchor Pixel, until the end of the grid.
Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange Pixel Sequences
  Rule: Move the 'Separator Pixels' sequence from its original position (between 'Main Object' and 'Anchor Pixel') to a new position immediately before the 'Main Object'.
Output:
  Structure: Derived by rearranging Input pixel sequences.
  Order:
    1. Background/Prefix Pixels (from Input)
    2. Separator Pixels (from Input)
    3. Main Object pixels (from Input)
    4. Anchor Pixel (from Input)
    5. Suffix Pixels (from Input)
  Note: The combination of 'Anchor Pixel' and 'Suffix Pixels' can be treated as a single 'Anchor and After' segment that remains fixed relative to the end of the sequence rearrangement.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a single row (1D array) of pixels.
2.  Scan the input row to identify and segment it into the following parts based on pixel values and contiguity:
    a.  The `Prefix`: Any sequence of pixels from the start until the first pixel that is *not* white (0) and *not* green (3).
    b.  The `Main Object`: The contiguous sequence of identical pixels immediately following the `Prefix`, where the pixel color is *neither* white (0) *nor* green (3).
    c.  The `Separators`: The sequence of white (0) pixels immediately following the `Main Object`.
    d.  The `Anchor and Suffix`: The single green (3) pixel immediately following the `Separators`, plus all subsequent pixels until the end of the row.
3.  Construct the output row by concatenating these segments in the order: `Prefix` + `Separators` + `Main Object` + `Anchor and Suffix`.
4.  Format the output as a single row (1D array).
