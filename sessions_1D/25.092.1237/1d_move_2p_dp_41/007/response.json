Identify the 'Main Object': The first contiguous sequence of identical pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor green (3).\n2. Identify the 'Anchor Pixel': The first pixel with the color green (3) that appears *after* the Main Object.\n3. Identify the 'Separator Pixels': The sequence of pixels located directly between the end of the 'Main Object' and the 'Anchor Pixel'.\n4. Identify the 'Prefix Pixels': Any pixels before the 'Main Object'.\n5. Identify the 'Anchor and Suffix Pixels': The Anchor Pixel and any pixels after it.\n6.
