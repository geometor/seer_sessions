Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (represented as a list within a list, e.g., [[...]])
  Element: Pixel (Integer 0-9)
Input_Segments:
  - Name: Prefix
    Type: Sequence of pixels
    Role: Pixels preceding the Main Object.
    Identification: All pixels from the start of the grid up to the index where the Main Object begins. Can be empty.
  - Name: Main Object
    Type: Contiguous sequence of identical pixels
    Role: The primary object to be repositioned.
    Identification: The first contiguous sequence of identical pixels where the pixel color is neither white (0) nor green (3).
    Properties:
      - Color != 0
      - Color != 3
  - Name: Separator
    Type: Sequence of pixels
    Role: Pixels originally separating the Main Object from the Anchor. These are moved.
    Identification: All pixels located between the end index of the Main Object and the start index of the Anchor. Assumed to be white (0) based on examples.
    Properties:
      - Located immediately after the Main Object.
      - Located immediately before the Anchor.
  - Name: Anchor_and_Suffix
    Type: Sequence of pixels
    Role: The anchor point for the transformation and all subsequent pixels. Their relative order remains unchanged.
    Identification: Starts with the first green (3) pixel found *after* the Main Object, and includes all pixels to the end of the grid.
Transformation:
  Action: Segment Reordering
  Rule: Reconstruct the grid by concatenating the identified segments in a new order.
Output_Order:
  1. Prefix
  2. Separator
  3. Main Object
  4. Anchor_and_Suffix
Assumptions:
  - The input grid will always be 1xN.
  - There will be exactly one 'Main Object'.
  - There will be at least one green (3) pixel ('Anchor') located *after* the 'Main Object'.
