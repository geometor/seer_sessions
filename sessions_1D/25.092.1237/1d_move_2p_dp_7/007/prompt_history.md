Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers representing colors.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors involved are white (0), green (3), red (2), and maroon (9).
3.  **Array Length:** The length of the array remains constant between input and output in all examples (length 7).
4.  **Key Colors:** White (0) and Maroon (9) seem to play special roles. Other colors (green/red) form contiguous blocks.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the elements *before* the maroon (9) pixel. The non-white block (e.g., `[3, 3, 3]` or `[2, 2, 2]`) stays together, and the white (0) pixels are moved to the beginning of this section. The maroon pixel and any pixels *after* it remain fixed in their positions.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Find the index of the first occurrence of the maroon pixel (9) in the input array.
2.  If no maroon pixel is found, treat the entire array as the segment *before* the boundary. Otherwise, split the array into three segments: the part *before* the maroon pixel, the maroon pixel itself, and the part *after* the maroon pixel.
3.  Examine the segment *before* the maroon pixel.
4.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white (non-0) pixels within this segment.
5.  Count the number of white (0) pixels within this segment.
6.  Create a new segment by first placing the counted number of white pixels, followed immediately by the identified contiguous block of non-white pixels.
7.  Construct the final output array by concatenating the newly created segment, the maroon pixel (if it existed), and the original segment that came *after* the maroon pixel (if it existed).

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation pattern: finding the boundary marker (maroon pixel, 9) and rearranging the preceding segment by grouping white pixels (0) at the beginning, followed by the other non-maroon pixels. The error reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") stems from a common issue when using NumPy arrays directly in boolean conditional statements (`if array:`). The fix involves explicitly checking the size or presence of the boundary element rather than its implicit boolean value. The overall logic described in the natural language program appears sound and consistent with the examples; only the implementation detail needs correction.

**Metrics:**

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: rearrangement_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1D
input_output_size_relation: same_size
fixed_elements:
  - type: boundary_marker
    color: 9 # maroon
    description: The first occurrence of this pixel determines the split point. Its position and the position of all subsequent pixels remain fixed relative to the start of the boundary marker.
movable_elements:
  - description: All pixels *before* the first boundary marker (9).
objects:
  - id: background_pixels
    description: White pixels (0) located before the boundary marker.
    property: movable
  - id: content_pixels
    description: Non-white (non-0) pixels located before the boundary marker.
    property: movable, preserve_relative_order
  - id: boundary_pixel
    description: The first maroon pixel (9).
    property: fixed_position, acts_as_separator
  - id: trailing_pixels
    description: All pixels located after the boundary pixel.
    property: fixed_position, preserve_relative_order
actions:
  - name: locate_boundary
    input: input_array
    target: color 9
    output: index of the first occurrence (or indication of absence)
  - name: partition_array
    input: input_array, boundary_index
    output: segment_before, boundary_pixel (optional), segment_after
  - name: separate_elements
    input: segment_before
    output: background_pixels (0s), content_pixels (non-0s, order preserved)
  - name: reconstruct_segment
    inputs: background_pixels, content_pixels
    output: new_segment_before (background pixels followed by content pixels)
  - name: assemble_output
    inputs: new_segment_before, boundary_pixel (optional), segment_after
    output: final_output_array
constraints:
  - The relative order of non-0 pixels within the segment before the boundary is preserved.
  - The boundary pixel (9) and all subsequent pixels retain their positions relative to the boundary pixel's original location.
  - If no boundary pixel (9) exists, the entire array is treated as the 'segment_before'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Boundary:** Scan the input array from left to right to find the index of the first occurrence of the maroon pixel (9). If found, note this `boundary_index`.
2.  **Partition:**
    *   If a `boundary_index` was found:
        *   Define `segment_before` as all pixels from the start of the array up to, but not including, `boundary_index`.
        *   Define `boundary_pixel` as the maroon pixel (9) at `boundary_index`.
        *   Define `segment_after` as all pixels from `boundary_index + 1` to the end of the array.
    *   If no maroon pixel (9) was found:
        *   Define `segment_before` as the entire input array.
        *   `boundary_pixel` and `segment_after` are considered non-existent for assembly purposes.
3.  **Rearrange `segment_before`:**
    *   Create a list of all white pixels (0) found in `segment_before`.
    *   Create a list of all non-white pixels found in `segment_before`, maintaining their original relative order.
    *   Concatenate the list of white pixels followed by the list of non-white pixels to form the `rearranged_segment_before`.
4.  **Assemble Output:**
    *   If a `boundary_pixel` exists: Construct the final output array by concatenating `rearranged_segment_before`, the `boundary_pixel`, and `segment_after`.
    *   If no `boundary_pixel` exists: The final output array is simply the `rearranged_segment_before`.
