Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  **Find Boundary:** Scan the input array from left to right to find the index of the first occurrence of the maroon pixel (9). If found, note this `boundary_index`.
2.  **Partition:**
    *   If a `boundary_index` was found:
        *   Define `segment_before` as all pixels from the start of the array up to, but not including, `boundary_index`.
        *   Define `boundary_pixel` as the maroon pixel (9) at `boundary_index`.
        *   Define `segment_after` as all pixels from `boundary_index + 1` to the end of the array.
    *   If no maroon pixel (9) was found:
        *   Define `segment_before` as the entire input array.
        *   `boundary_pixel` and `segment_after` are considered non-existent for assembly purposes.
3.  **Rearrange `segment_before`:**
    *   Create a list (or array) of all white pixels (0) found in `segment_before`.
    *   Create a list (or array) of all non-white pixels found in `segment_before`, maintaining their original relative order.
    *   Concatenate the list/array of white pixels followed by the list/array of non-white pixels to form the `rearranged_segment_before`.
4.  **Assemble Output:**
    *   If a `boundary_pixel` exists: Construct the final output array by concatenating `rearranged_segment_before`, the `boundary_pixel` (as a single-element array), and `segment_after`.
    *   If no `boundary_pixel` exists: The final output array is simply the `rearranged_segment_before`.
