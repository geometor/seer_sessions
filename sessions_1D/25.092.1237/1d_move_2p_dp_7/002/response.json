            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code aims to implement the transformation logic derived from the examples. The core logic involves locating a boundary marker (maroon pixel 9), partitioning the array, rearranging the segment before the boundary (moving white pixels 0 to the start, keeping the non-white/non-maroon block contiguous), and then reassembling the array.\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" indicates that a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values was used in a context requiring a single boolean (like an `if` statement). Although the code includes `if segment_before.size > 0:`, which explicitly checks the size rather than the truthiness of the array itself, the error persists. This suggests the error might occur:\n\n1.  Within the testing environment's interaction with the code, potentially misinterpreting a NumPy operation.\n2.  During the concatenation steps if array types are inconsistent (e.g., mixing Python lists and NumPy arrays in `np.concatenate` in an unexpected way, although the provided code seems to handle this).\n3.  An untested edge case not covered by the examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the core logic by manually tracing the examples again.\n2.  Gather precise metrics using code execution to confirm properties of the input/output pairs.\n3.  Ensure consistent use of NumPy arrays throughout the core logic, particularly during concatenation.\n4.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on these verified details. The fundamental logic appears sound based on the examples, so major changes to the program are unlikely needed, but precision can be improved.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
