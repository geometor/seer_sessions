Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers representing colors.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors involved are white (0), green (3), red (2), and maroon (9).
3.  **Array Length:** The length of the array remains constant between input and output in all examples (length 7).
4.  **Key Colors:** White (0) and Maroon (9) seem to play special roles. Other colors (green/red) form contiguous blocks.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the elements *before* the maroon (9) pixel. The non-white block (e.g., `[3, 3, 3]` or `[2, 2, 2]`) stays together, and the white (0) pixels are moved to the beginning of this section. The maroon pixel and any pixels *after* it remain fixed in their positions.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Find the index of the first occurrence of the maroon pixel (9) in the input array.
2.  If no maroon pixel is found, treat the entire array as the segment *before* the boundary. Otherwise, split the array into three segments: the part *before* the maroon pixel, the maroon pixel itself, and the part *after* the maroon pixel.
3.  Examine the segment *before* the maroon pixel.
4.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white (non-0) pixels within this segment.
5.  Count the number of white (0) pixels within this segment.
6.  Create a new segment by first placing the counted number of white pixels, followed immediately by the identified contiguous block of non-white pixels.
7.  Construct the final output array by concatenating the newly created segment, the maroon pixel (if it existed), and the original segment that came *after* the maroon pixel (if it existed).

Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1. Identify the first occurrence of the maroon pixel (9) which acts as a boundary marker.
2. Consider the segment of the array *before* this boundary marker. If no boundary marker exists, consider the entire array.
3. Within this 'before' segment, locate the contiguous block of non-white (non-0) pixels.
4. Count the number of white (0) pixels in this 'before' segment.
5. Reconstruct the 'before' segment by first placing all the counted white pixels, followed immediately by the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
6. The boundary marker (9), if it exists, and any pixels following it retain their original positions relative to the start of the boundary marker.
7. Combine the reconstructed 'before' segment, the boundary marker (if present), and the 'after' segment (if present) to form the output array.

Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  **Locate Boundary:** Find the index of the first maroon pixel (9) in the input array. This is the boundary index.
2.  **Partition:**
    *   If a boundary index is found: Define three parts: `segment_before` (pixels from the start up to, but not including, the boundary index), `boundary_pixel` (the maroon pixel at the boundary index), and `segment_after` (pixels from after the boundary index to the end).
    *   If no maroon pixel (9) is found: Define `segment_before` as the entire input array. `boundary_pixel` and `segment_after` are considered empty or non-existent for assembly purposes.
3.  **Analyze `segment_before`:**
    *   Identify all white pixels (0) within this segment.
    *   Identify all non-white pixels (the `color_block`) within this segment, preserving their relative order.
4.  **Reconstruct `segment_before`:** Create a new sequence by first placing all the identified white pixels (0) together, followed immediately by the identified `color_block`.
