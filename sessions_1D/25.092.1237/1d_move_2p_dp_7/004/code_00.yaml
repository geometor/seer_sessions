task_type: rearrangement_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Confirmed by examples
input_output_relation: transform_segment # Transformation applies only to a part of the array
size_invariance: true # Array length is preserved

pivot_element:
  color: 9 # maroon
  role: boundary_marker
  action: locates the segment to be transformed (segment before the marker)
  persistence: fixed_position # The marker itself and elements after it do not move

transformed_segment:
  location: array elements before the first occurrence of the pivot_element (color 9)
  elements:
    - id: background_pixels
      color: 0 # white
      role: movable, filler
      input_property: potentially_scattered
      output_property: grouped_at_start # Grouped at the beginning of the transformed segment
    - id: content_pixels
      color: non-0 and non-9
      role: movable_block
      input_property: scattered_among_background or contiguous
      output_property: grouped_after_background # Appears after all background pixels in the segment
      internal_order: preserved # Relative order among content pixels is maintained

untransformed_segment:
  location: array elements at and after the first occurrence of the pivot_element (color 9)
  persistence: fixed_position # These elements retain their original values and relative positions

actions:
  - name: locate_boundary
    input: input_array
    target: color 9
    output: index of the first occurrence (boundary_index) or indicator of absence
  - name: partition_array
    input: input_array, boundary_index
    outputs:
      - segment_before (elements before boundary_index)
      - boundary_pixel (element at boundary_index, if exists)
      - segment_after (elements after boundary_index)
  - name: separate_elements
    input: segment_before
    outputs:
      - list_of_background_pixels (color 0)
      - list_of_content_pixels (non-0, order preserved)
  - name: reconstruct_segment
    inputs: list_of_background_pixels, list_of_content_pixels
    output: new_segment_before (background pixels followed by content pixels)
  - name: assemble_output
    inputs: new_segment_before, boundary_pixel (if exists), segment_after (if exists)
    output: final_output_array
