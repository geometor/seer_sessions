Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  **Locate Boundary:** Find the index of the first maroon pixel (9) in the input array. This is the boundary index.
2.  **Partition:**
    *   If a boundary index is found: Define three parts: `segment_before` (pixels from the start up to, but not including, the boundary index), `boundary_pixel` (the maroon pixel at the boundary index), and `segment_after` (pixels from after the boundary index to the end).
    *   If no maroon pixel (9) is found: Define `segment_before` as the entire input array. `boundary_pixel` and `segment_after` are considered empty or non-existent for assembly purposes.
3.  **Analyze `segment_before`:**
    *   Identify all white pixels (0) within this segment.
    *   Identify all non-white pixels (the `color_block`) within this segment, preserving their relative order.
4.  **Reconstruct `segment_before`:** Create a new sequence by first placing all the identified white pixels (0) together, followed immediately by the identified `color_block`.
5.  **Assemble Output:** Construct the final output array by concatenating:
    *   The reconstructed `segment_before`.
    *   The `boundary_pixel` (if it exists).
    *   The original `segment_after` (if it exists).
