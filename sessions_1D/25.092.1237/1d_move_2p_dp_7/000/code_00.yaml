task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D
color_invariance: true # Colors present in input are the same as in output
size_invariance: true # Array length is preserved
key_elements:
  - color: 0 # white - background/movable element
  - color: 9 # maroon - fixed pivot/boundary element
  - type: contiguous_block # non-white, non-maroon elements form a block
objects:
  - id: background_pixels
    color: 0 # white
    role: movable, fill space before the block
    location: scattered before the boundary pixel in input, grouped at the start before the boundary pixel in output
  - id: color_block
    color: non-0 and non-9 (e.g., 2, 3)
    property: contiguous
    role: movable object
    location: found before the boundary pixel in input, placed after background pixels before the boundary pixel in output
  - id: boundary_pixel
    color: 9 # maroon
    role: fixed position, separator
    location: maintains its index position
  - id: trailing_pixels
    color: any
    role: fixed position
    location: any pixels after the boundary pixel maintain their relative positions
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The color block is positioned relative to the boundary pixel and the background pixels.
