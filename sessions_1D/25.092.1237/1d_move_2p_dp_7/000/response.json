Other colors (green/red) form contiguous blocks.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the elements *before* the maroon (9) pixel. The non-white block (e.g., `[3, 3, 3]` or `[2, 2, 2]`) stays together, and the white (0) pixels are moved to the beginning of this section. The maroon pixel and any pixels *after* it remain fixed in their positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
