Identify the first occurrence of the maroon pixel (9) which acts as a boundary marker.\n2. Consider the segment of the array *before* this boundary marker. If no boundary marker exists, consider the entire array.\n3. Within this 'before' segment, locate the contiguous block of non-white (non-0) pixels.\n4. Count the number of white (0) pixels in this 'before' segment.\n5. Reconstruct the 'before' segment by first placing all the counted white pixels, followed immediately by the contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n6. The boundary marker (9), if it exists, and any pixels following it retain their original positions relative to the start of the boundary marker.\n7. Combine the reconstructed 'before' segment, the boundary marker (if present), and the 'after' segment (if present) to form the output array.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input 1D grid according to the described rule.\n    Moves all white pixels (0) before the first maroon pixel (9) to the beginning\n    of that segment, while keeping the contiguous block of other non-zero colors\n    together after the white pixels. Pixels at or after the maroon pixel (9)\n    remain unchanged.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list containing a single list representing the 1D input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing a single list representing the transformed 1D grid.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Input Processing ---\n    # Extract the 1D array from the input grid format\n    # Assuming input_grid is always [[...]] for 1D cases based on examples\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return input_grid # Return empty or invalid input as is\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # --- Core Logic ---\n    # 1.
