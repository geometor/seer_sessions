Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of integers representing colors.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors involved are white (0), green (3), red (2), and maroon (9).
3.  **Array Length:** The length of the array remains constant between input and output in all examples (length 7).
4.  **Key Colors:** White (0) and Maroon (9) seem to play special roles. Other colors (green/red) form contiguous blocks.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the elements *before* the maroon (9) pixel. The non-white block (e.g., `[3, 3, 3]` or `[2, 2, 2]`) stays together, and the white (0) pixels are moved to the beginning of this section. The maroon pixel and any pixels *after* it remain fixed in their positions.

**YAML Facts:**

color_invariance: true # Colors present in input are the same as in output
size_invariance: true # Array length is preserved
key_elements:
  - color: 0 # white - background/movable element

objects:
  - id: background_pixels
    color: 0 # white
    role: movable, fill space before the block
    location: scattered before the boundary pixel in input, grouped at the start before the boundary pixel in output
  - id: color_block
    color: non-0 and non-9 (e.g., 2, 3)
    property: contiguous
    role: movable object
    location: found before the boundary pixel in input, placed after background pixels before the boundary pixel in output
  - id: boundary_pixel
    color: 9 # maroon
    role: fixed position, separator
    location: maintains its index position
  - id: trailing_pixels
    color: any
    role: fixed position
    location: any pixels after the boundary pixel maintain their relative positions

  - type: spatial
    description: The color block is positioned relative to the boundary pixel and the background pixels.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Find the index of the first occurrence of the maroon pixel (9) in the input array.
2.  If no maroon pixel is found, treat the entire array as the segment *before* the boundary. Otherwise, split the array into three segments: the part *before* the maroon pixel, the maroon pixel itself, and the part *after* the maroon pixel.
3.  Examine the segment *before* the maroon pixel.
4.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white (non-0) pixels within this segment.
5.  Count the number of white (0) pixels within this segment.
6.  Create a new segment by first placing the counted number of white pixels, followed immediately by the identified contiguous block of non-white pixels.
7.  Construct the final output array by concatenating the newly created segment, the maroon pixel (if it existed), and the original segment that came *after* the maroon pixel (if it existed).
