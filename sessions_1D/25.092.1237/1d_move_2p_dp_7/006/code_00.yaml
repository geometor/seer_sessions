task_type: rearrangement_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1D
input_output_size_relation: same_size
fixed_elements:
  - type: boundary_marker
    color: 9 # maroon
    description: The first occurrence of this pixel determines the split point. Its position and the position of all subsequent pixels remain fixed relative to the start of the boundary marker.
movable_elements:
  - description: All pixels *before* the first boundary marker (9).
objects:
  - id: background_pixels
    description: White pixels (0) located before the boundary marker.
    property: movable
  - id: content_pixels
    description: Non-white (non-0) pixels located before the boundary marker.
    property: movable, preserve_relative_order
  - id: boundary_pixel
    description: The first maroon pixel (9).
    property: fixed_position, acts_as_separator
  - id: trailing_pixels
    description: All pixels located after the boundary pixel.
    property: fixed_position, preserve_relative_order
actions:
  - name: locate_boundary
    input: input_array
    target: color 9
    output: index of the first occurrence (or indication of absence)
  - name: partition_array
    input: input_array, boundary_index
    output: segment_before, boundary_pixel (optional), segment_after
  - name: separate_elements
    input: segment_before
    output: background_pixels (0s), content_pixels (non-0s, order preserved)
  - name: reconstruct_segment
    inputs: background_pixels, content_pixels
    output: new_segment_before (background pixels followed by content pixels)
  - name: assemble_output
    inputs: new_segment_before, boundary_pixel (optional), segment_after
    output: final_output_array
constraints:
  - The relative order of non-0 pixels within the segment before the boundary is preserved.
  - The boundary pixel (9) and all subsequent pixels retain their positions relative to the boundary pixel's original location.
  - If no boundary pixel (9) exists, the entire array is treated as the 'segment_before'.
