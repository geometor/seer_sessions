The number and type of pixels remain unchanged between input and output.\n    *   The rearrangement seems localized to the beginning of the sequence. Specifically, the first contiguous block of non-white pixels and the immediately following contiguous block of white pixels appear to swap positions.\n    *   Pixels further down the sequence (the Magenta and trailing White pixel in the examples) retain their positions relative to the end of the sequence.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
