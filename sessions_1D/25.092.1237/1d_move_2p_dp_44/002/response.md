**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation pattern for the provided examples: swapping the first contiguous block of non-white pixels with the immediately following block of white pixels. The Python code implemented this logic. However, the execution resulted in errors (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`), indicating a potential mismatch between the expected data structure (list) and the actual data structure used during testing (likely a NumPy array, possibly 2D like 1xN).

The strategy is to adapt the process to handle the input as a potential 2D NumPy array (specifically 1xN or Nx1, given the examples look like sequences). The core logic of identifying and swapping blocks remains valid, but it needs to be applied to the relevant dimension of the array.

**Metrics and Input Analysis:**

Let's re-examine the inputs assuming they might be 1xN NumPy arrays.

*   **train_1:**
    *   Input: `np.array([[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)
    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)
    *   First non-white block: `[7, 7, 7]` (indices 0-2)
    *   Following white block: `[0, 0]` (indices 3-4)
    *   Remainder: `[6, 0]` (indices 5-6)
    *   Action: Swap `[7, 7, 7]` and `[0, 0]`. Result: `[0, 0] + [7, 7, 7] + [6, 0]`

*   **train_2:**
    *   Input: `np.array([[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)
    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)
    *   First non-white block: `[3, 3, 3]` (indices 0-2)
    *   Following white block: `[0, 0]` (indices 3-4)
    *   Remainder: `[6, 0]` (indices 5-6)
    *   Action: Swap `[3, 3, 3]` and `[0, 0]`. Result: `[0, 0] + [3, 3, 3] + [6, 0]`

*   **train_3:**
    *   Input: `np.array([[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)
    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)
    *   First non-white block: `[8, 8, 8]` (indices 0-2)
    *   Following white block: `[0, 0]` (indices 3-4)
    *   Remainder: `[6, 0]` (indices 5-6)
    *   Action: Swap `[8, 8, 8]` and `[0, 0]`. Result: `[0, 0] + [8, 8, 8] + [6, 0]`

The core logic holds perfectly. The implementation issue stemmed from assuming the input was a Python list when it was likely a NumPy array, causing comparison errors. The code needs modification to handle NumPy array inputs, specifically by operating on the single row or column if the input is 1xN or Nx1.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 2D (manifesting as 1xN in examples)
element_type: pixels
properties:
  - color: (represented by integers 0-9)
  - position: index within the sequence (row or column)
  - contiguity: groups of adjacent pixels sharing a property (e.g., non-white, white) along the primary sequence dimension.
objects:
  - object_type: pixel_sequence
    description: The effective 1D sequence of pixels contained within the 1xN or Nx1 input grid.
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    description: A sequence of one or more adjacent pixels within the pixel_sequence sharing a property.
    properties:
      - color_type: (all white (0) or all non-white (>0))
      - start_index: position of the first pixel in the block within the sequence
      - end_index: position of the last pixel in the block within the sequence
      - length: number of pixels in the block
actions:
  - action_type: identify
    description: Locate specific blocks within the pixel_sequence based on criteria.
    criteria:
      - 1: The first contiguous block of non-white pixels starting from the beginning of the sequence.
      - 2: The contiguous block of white pixels immediately following the block identified in step 1.
  - action_type: swap
    description: Exchange the positions of the two identified blocks within the pixel_sequence.
relationships:
  - relationship_type: adjacency
    description: One block immediately follows another in the pixel_sequence.
  - relationship_type: ordering
    description: The relative order of blocks and pixels in the sequence.
constraints:
  - The dimensions (shape) of the grid remain constant.
  - The count of each color pixel remains constant.
  - Only the identified non-white block and the adjacent white block change positions relative to each other. All other pixels (leading white pixels, if any, and pixels after the swapped blocks) retain their original relative order.
  - The transformation operates along the single dimension containing the sequence (row for 1xN, column for Nx1).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the orientation of the input grid (is it effectively a row vector 1xN, or a column vector Nx1?). Extract the 1D sequence of pixels. If the grid is larger than 1xN or Nx1, this rule may not apply or needs adaptation. For now, assume it's 1xN based on examples.
2.  Scan the extracted 1D pixel sequence from the beginning (left to right or top to bottom depending on orientation).
3.  Identify the first contiguous block (one or more adjacent pixels) of non-white (non-zero color) pixels. Record its start and end indices within the sequence. If no non-white block is found, the sequence remains unchanged.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of white (zero color) pixels that starts immediately after the end index of the non-white block found in step 3. Record its start and end indices. If no such white block is found immediately following, the sequence remains unchanged.
5.  Construct the output sequence by:
    a.  Taking any pixels preceding the identified non-white block (these must be white).
    b.  Appending the identified white block (from step 4).
    c.  Appending the identified non-white block (from step 3).
    d.  Appending all remaining pixels from the input sequence, starting from the pixel immediately after the end of the white block identified in step 4, maintaining their original relative order.
6.  Reconstruct the output grid with the same dimensions (shape) as the input grid, using the modified sequence.
