            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation pattern for the provided examples: swapping the first contiguous block of non-white pixels with the immediately following block of white pixels. The Python code implemented this logic. However, the execution resulted in errors (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`), indicating a potential mismatch between the expected data structure (list) and the actual data structure used during testing (likely a NumPy array, possibly 2D like 1xN).\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the process to handle the input as a potential 2D NumPy array (specifically 1xN or Nx1, given the examples look like sequences). The core logic of identifying and swapping blocks remains valid, but it needs to be applied to the relevant dimension of the array.\n\n**Metrics and Input Analysis:**\n\nLet's re-examine the inputs assuming they might be 1xN NumPy arrays.\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Input: `np.array([[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)\n    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)\n    *   First non-white block: `[7, 7, 7]` (indices 0-2)\n    *   Following white block: `[0, 0]` (indices 3-4)\n    *   Remainder: `[6, 0]` (indices 5-6)\n    *   Action: Swap `[7, 7, 7]` and `[0, 0]`. Result: `[0, 0] + [7, 7, 7] + [6, 0]`\n\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Input: `np.array([[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)\n    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)\n    *   First non-white block: `[3, 3, 3]` (indices 0-2)\n    *   Following white block: `[0, 0]` (indices 3-4)\n    *   Remainder: `[6, 0]` (indices 5-6)\n    *   Action: Swap `[3, 3, 3]` and `[0, 0]`. Result: `[0, 0] + [3, 3, 3] + [6, 0]`\n\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Input: `np.array([[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)\n    *   Output: `np.array([[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0]])` (Shape: 1x7)\n    *   First non-white block: `[8, 8, 8]` (indices 0-2)\n    *   Following white block: `[0, 0]` (indices 3-4)\n    *   Remainder: `[6, 0]` (indices 5-6)\n    *   Action: Swap `[8, 8, 8]` and `[0, 0]`. Result: `[0, 0] + [8, 8, 8] + [6, 0]`\n\nThe core logic holds perfectly. The implementation issue stemmed from assuming the input was a Python list when it was likely a NumPy array, causing comparison errors. The code needs modification to handle NumPy array inputs, specifically by operating on the single row or column if the input is 1xN or Nx1.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
