            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" indicates that a NumPy array was used in a boolean context where a single True/False value was expected. Reviewing the code, this likely occurred because the input grid, even if representing a single row, is passed as a 2D structure (e.g., `[[0, 3, 3, ...]]`). The code's logic for handling the input dimensions incorrectly assigned the 2D array to the `input_row` variable, which was then passed to helper functions expecting a 1D iterable. The comparison operations within these helper functions (e.g., `color == anchor_color`) then failed when `color` was an array instead of an integer.\n\nThe strategy for resolving this is to ensure that the `input_row` variable correctly extracts the single row (as a 1D array or list) from the potentially 2D input `input_np` before passing it to the helper functions. The core transformation logic (identify anchor, identify block, move block left of anchor) appears sound based on the examples and only the input handling needs correction.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nThe code failed uniformly across all training examples with the same error. This confirms the issue is systematic input handling rather than specific data conditions within one example. The input format is consistently a 1xN grid represented as a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[val1, val2, ...]]`).\n\n*   **Input Shape:** Assumed to be `(1, 9)` for all training examples based on the prompt.\n*   **Error Trigger:** The `else` block in the initial `if input_np.shape[0] != 1:` check incorrectly assigned the 2D `input_np` to `input_row`.\n*   **Helper Function Failure:** Functions `find_anchor` and `find_largest_movable_block` received a 2D array (`[[...]]`) instead of a 1D array (`[...]`), causing comparison errors when iterating.\n\nLet's verify the assumed input shape and the extraction logic.\n"
