Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements and Transformation:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input and output are both 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of pixels. In the provided examples, they are 1x9.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The key colors are white (0), azure (8), and one other color which varies between examples (green (3), magenta (6), blue (1)).
3.  **Key Objects:**
    *   A single azure (8) pixel acts as a fixed anchor point. Its position remains unchanged from input to output (index 7 in all examples).
    *   A contiguous block of a single color (green, magenta, or blue in the examples) which is not white (0) or azure (8). This block appears to be the primary object being manipulated.
    *   Background white (0) pixels fill the remaining space.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve repositioning the colored block relative to the fixed azure pixel.
    *   The colored block (green, magenta, or blue) is moved horizontally.
    *   Its final position in the output is always immediately to the left of the azure (8) pixel. The rightmost pixel of the block sits at the index just before the azure pixel's index.
    *   The azure (8) pixel itself does not move.
    *   All other positions are filled with the white (0) background color. The original positions of the white pixels are disregarded; they simply fill the space not occupied by the moved block and the anchor azure pixel.
5.  **Consistency:** The length and color of the block are preserved. The position of the azure pixel is preserved. The overall grid size is preserved.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**

    description: contiguous block of a single color C, where C is not white (0) and not azure (8).
    role: movable_object
    properties:

      size: variable (length of the block)
      count: 1 (assumed unique largest block based on examples)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: anchor pixel (azure 8)
    result: store its index (anchor_index)
  - action: identify
    target: the largest contiguous block of a single color C (where C != 0 and C != 8)
    result: store its color (block_color) and length (block_length)
  - action: create_output_grid
    properties:

      initial_fill: background_color (white 0)
  - action: place
    target: anchor pixel (azure 8)
    destination: output grid at anchor_index
  - action: place
    target: the identified block (block_color, block_length)
    destination: output grid
    details: position the block such that its last pixel is at index (anchor_index - 1)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: movable_object (block)
    object2: anchor pixel (azure 8)
    state_in_output: object1 is immediately to the left of object2.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color, white (0).
2.  Find the index of the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid. Let this be `anchor_index`.
3.  Place the azure (8) pixel at `anchor_index` in the output grid.
4.  Identify the largest contiguous block of pixels in the input grid consisting of a single color that is *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8). Determine its color (`block_color`) and length (`block_length`).
5.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output grid: `target_start_index = anchor_index - block_length`.
6.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from `target_start_index` to `anchor_index - 1` (inclusive) with the `block_color`.
