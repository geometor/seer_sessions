task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1
  grid_size: constant (1x9 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    color: azure (8)
    role: anchor
    properties:
      position: fixed (index 7 in examples)
      count: 1
  - object_type: block
    description: contiguous block of a single color C, where C is not white (0) and not azure (8).
    role: movable_object
    properties:
      color: variable (green, magenta, blue in examples)
      size: variable (length of the block)
      count: 1 (assumed unique largest block based on examples)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: anchor pixel (azure 8)
    result: store its index (anchor_index)
  - action: identify
    target: the largest contiguous block of a single color C (where C != 0 and C != 8)
    result: store its color (block_color) and length (block_length)
  - action: create_output_grid
    properties:
      size: same as input grid
      initial_fill: background_color (white 0)
  - action: place
    target: anchor pixel (azure 8)
    destination: output grid at anchor_index
  - action: place
    target: the identified block (block_color, block_length)
    destination: output grid
    details: position the block such that its last pixel is at index (anchor_index - 1)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: movable_object (block)
    object2: anchor pixel (azure 8)
    state_in_output: object1 is immediately to the left of object2.
