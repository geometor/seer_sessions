            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements and Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input and output are both 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of pixels. In the provided examples, they are 1x9.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The key colors are white (0), azure (8), and one other color which varies between examples (green (3), magenta (6), blue (1)).\n3.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   A single azure (8) pixel acts as a fixed anchor point. Its position remains unchanged from input to output (index 7 in all examples).\n    *   A contiguous block of a single color (green, magenta, or blue in the examples) which is not white (0) or azure (8). This block appears to be the primary object being manipulated.\n    *   Background white (0) pixels fill the remaining space.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve repositioning the colored block relative to the fixed azure pixel.\n    *   The colored block (green, magenta, or blue) is moved horizontally.\n    *   Its final position in the output is always immediately to the left of the azure (8) pixel. The rightmost pixel of the block sits at the index just before the azure pixel's index.\n    *   The azure (8) pixel itself does not move.\n    *   All other positions are filled with the white (0) background color. The original positions of the white pixels are disregarded; they simply fill the space not occupied by the moved block and the anchor azure pixel.\n5.  **Consistency:** The length and color of the block are preserved. The position of the azure pixel is preserved. The overall grid size is preserved.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
