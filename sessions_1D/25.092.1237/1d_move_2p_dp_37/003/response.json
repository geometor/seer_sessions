Create an output grid of the same 1xN dimensions, filled initially with \n    the background color white (0). Extract the single row of the output \n    grid for modification.\n3.  Locate the column index of the azure (8) pixel (the anchor) in the \n    input row. Let this be `anchor_index`.\n4.  Place the azure (8) pixel into the output row at `anchor_index`.\n5.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of pixels in the input row \n    consisting of a single color that is *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8). \n    Determine its color (`block_color`) and its length (`block_length`). \n    (Assume only one such block exists).\n6.  Calculate the target starting column index for this block in the output \n    row: `target_start_index = anchor_index - block_length`.\n7.
