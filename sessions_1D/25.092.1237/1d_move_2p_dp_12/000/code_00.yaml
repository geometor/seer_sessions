Grid_Properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_conservation: Input and output grids have the same length.
  - background_color: white (0)

Objects:
  - type: Block
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not red (2).
    properties:
      - color: variable (green, gray, blue in examples)
      - length: variable
      - position: variable
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: Pixel
    definition: A single pixel.
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - position: variable
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: Separator
    definition: A sequence of white (0) pixels between the Block object and the Pixel object.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: 2
      - position: between the Block and the red Pixel

Relationships:
  - The Block object is always to the left of the red Pixel object.
  - The Block object and the red Pixel object are separated by the Separator object (2 white pixels).

Actions:
  - operation: Shift
    target: [Block object, red Pixel object]
    details:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 positions
  - operation: Fill
    target: Vacated positions (positions 0, 1 and the original positions of the first two elements of the Block object)
    details:
      - color: white (0)

Transformation:
  - description: Both the Block object and the red Pixel object are translated two positions to the right within the grid. The space created by this shift is filled with the background color (white).
