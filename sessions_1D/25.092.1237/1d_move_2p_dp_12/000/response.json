A contiguous horizontal block of a single color (green, gray, or blue in the examples).\n2.  A single red pixel.\n\nThese two objects are always separated by exactly two white pixels in the input. The transformation involves shifting both the colored block and the single red pixel two positions to the right. The positions vacated by the shift, as well as the initial positions to the left of the colored block, become white. The relative positions of the colored block and the red pixel, including the two-pixel white gap between them, are maintained after the shift. The grid size remains constant.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
