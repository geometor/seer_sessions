## Perception

The input and output are single-row grids of pixels. Each input grid contains two distinct colored "objects" on a white background:
1.  A contiguous horizontal block of a single color (green, gray, or blue in the examples).
2.  A single red pixel.

These two objects are always separated by exactly two white pixels in the input. The transformation involves shifting both the colored block and the single red pixel two positions to the right. The positions vacated by the shift, as well as the initial positions to the left of the colored block, become white. The relative positions of the colored block and the red pixel, including the two-pixel white gap between them, are maintained after the shift. The grid size remains constant.

## Facts


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_conservation: Input and output grids have the same length.
  - background_color: white (0)

Objects:
  - type: Block
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not red (2).
    properties:
      - color: variable (green, gray, blue in examples)
      - length: variable
      - position: variable
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: Pixel
    definition: A single pixel.
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - position: variable
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: Separator
    definition: A sequence of white (0) pixels between the Block object and the Pixel object.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: 2
      - position: between the Block and the red Pixel

Relationships:
  - The Block object is always to the left of the red Pixel object.
  - The Block object and the red Pixel object are separated by the Separator object (2 white pixels).

Actions:
  - operation: Shift
    target: [Block object, red Pixel object]
    details:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 positions
  - operation: Fill
    target: Vacated positions (positions 0, 1 and the original positions of the first two elements of the Block object)
    details:
      - color: white (0)

Transformation:
  - description: Both the Block object and the red Pixel object are translated two positions to the right within the grid. The space created by this shift is filled with the background color (white).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-red colored pixels in the input grid. Record its color, start index, and end index.
3.  Identify the position (index) of the single red (2) pixel in the input grid.
4.  Copy the pixels from the identified block (from its start index to its end index in the input grid) to the output grid, starting at the original start index plus 2.
5.  Place the red pixel in the output grid at the original red pixel index plus 2.
6.  Return the modified output grid.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the presence of a colored block and a single red pixel separated by two white pixels. The proposed transformation involved shifting both objects two positions to the right. However, comparing the code's output with the expected output reveals that this transformation rule is incorrect.

The transformed outputs consistently show the colored block shifted correctly by two positions, but the red pixel is also shifted by two positions, whereas in the expected outputs, the red pixel *remains in its original position*.

The strategy to resolve this is to revise the understanding of the transformation: only the colored block shifts; the red pixel's position is maintained from the input to the output.

## Metrics

Let's gather precise metrics for each example to confirm the block shift and red pixel position.

The calculated metrics confirm the revised analysis:
*   The colored block consistently shifts 2 positions to the right (`block_shift: 2`).
*   The red pixel's position remains unchanged (`red_pixel_shift: 0`).
*   The gap between the block and the red pixel changes from 2 in the input to 0 in the output.

## Facts


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_conservation: Input and output grids have the same length.
  - background_color: white (0)

Objects:
  - type: Block
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not red (2).
    properties:
      - color: variable (green, gray, blue in examples)
      - length: variable
      - position: variable (start_index, end_index)
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: Pixel
    definition: A single pixel.
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - position: variable (index)
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: Separator
    definition: A sequence of exactly two white (0) pixels between the Block object and the Pixel object in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: 2
      - position: between the Block and the red Pixel (input only)

Relationships:
  - Input: The Block object is always to the left of the red Pixel object, separated by the Separator object (2 white pixels).
  - Output: The Block object's end index is immediately adjacent to the left of the red Pixel object's index (gap is 0).

Actions:
  - operation: Shift
    target: Block object
    details:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 positions
  - operation: Maintain Position
    target: red Pixel object
    details:
      - The red pixel appears at the same index in the output as it did in the input.
  - operation: Fill
    target: Entire grid initially, then specific positions are overwritten.
    details:
      - color: white (0)

Transformation:
  - description: Create an output grid filled with the background color (white). Identify the colored block (non-white, non-red) and the red pixel in the input. Copy the colored block to the output grid, shifted two positions to the right from its original location. Place the red pixel in the output grid at its original input index.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-red colored pixels in the input grid. Record its color, start index, and end index.
3.  Identify the position (index) of the single red (2) pixel in the input grid.
4.  Calculate the new start index for the block by adding 2 to its original start index.
5.  Copy the pixels from the identified block (using its original start/end indices and color) to the output grid, placing them starting at the *new* start index calculated in the previous step. Ensure the copy does not exceed the grid boundaries.
6.  Place the red pixel (2) in the output grid at the *original* index identified in step 3.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
