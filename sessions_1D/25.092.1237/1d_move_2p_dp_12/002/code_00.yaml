Grid_Properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_conservation: Input and output grids have the same length.
  - background_color: white (0)

Objects:
  - type: Block
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not red (2).
    properties:
      - color: variable (green, gray, blue in examples)
      - length: variable
      - position: variable (start_index, end_index)
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: Pixel
    definition: A single pixel.
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - position: variable (index)
    count: 1 per grid
  - type: Separator
    definition: A sequence of exactly two white (0) pixels between the Block object and the Pixel object in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: 2
      - position: between the Block and the red Pixel (input only)

Relationships:
  - Input: The Block object is always to the left of the red Pixel object, separated by the Separator object (2 white pixels).
  - Output: The Block object's end index is immediately adjacent to the left of the red Pixel object's index (gap is 0).

Actions:
  - operation: Shift
    target: Block object
    details:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 2 positions
  - operation: Maintain Position
    target: red Pixel object
    details:
      - The red pixel appears at the same index in the output as it did in the input.
  - operation: Fill
    target: Entire grid initially, then specific positions are overwritten.
    details:
      - color: white (0)

Transformation:
  - description: Create an output grid filled with the background color (white). Identify the colored block (non-white, non-red) and the red pixel in the input. Copy the colored block to the output grid, shifted two positions to the right from its original location. Place the red pixel in the output grid at its original input index.
