task_type: array_segment_swap_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: target_marker
    color: green (3)
    quantity: 1
    role: fixed anchor point (position remains unchanged)
  - type: fixed_gap
    description: A contiguous block of background pixels immediately preceding the target_marker.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      size: 2 (constant across examples)
      contiguity: required
      position: immediately left of target_marker
  - type: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-background, non-target color immediately preceding the fixed_gap.
    properties:
      color: variable (red=2, orange=7, gray=5 in examples)
      contiguity: required
      position: immediately left of fixed_gap
      size: variable
  - type: prefix_segment
    description: All pixels from the start of the array up to (but not including) the movable_block.
    role: remains unchanged and stays at the beginning.
  - type: suffix_segment
    description: All pixels from the target_marker to the end of the array.
    role: remains unchanged and stays at the end relative to the swapped block/gap.
actions:
  - name: identify_target
    actor: system
    target: target_marker (green=3)
    result: target_index
  - name: identify_gap
    actor: system
    target: background (white=0) pixels immediately left of target_index
    constraints: must be size 2
    result: gap_segment, gap_start_index
  - name: identify_block
    actor: system
    target: contiguous non-background, non-target pixels immediately left of gap_start_index
    result: block_segment, block_start_index
  - name: identify_prefix
    actor: system
    target: pixels from array start up to block_start_index
    result: prefix_segment
  - name: identify_suffix
    actor: system
    target: pixels from target_index to array end
    result: suffix_segment

    actor: system
    inputs: [prefix_segment, gap_segment, block_segment, suffix_segment]
    output_order: [prefix_segment, gap_segment, block_segment, suffix_segment]
    effect: Creates the output array by placing the gap segment before the block segment.
