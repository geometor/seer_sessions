Okay, let's analyze the provided task example (`train_1`).

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are presented as 1D arrays (or single rows) of integers representing colors. The length remains constant (26 elements).
2.  **Key Colors/Objects:**
    *   **White Pixels (0):** These act as the background or empty space.
    *   **Red Block (2):** In the input, there's a contiguous block of 12 red pixels (`2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`).
    *   **Green Pixel (3):** There is a single green pixel. It appears relatively late in the array.
3.  **Spatial Relationships (Input):**
    *   The red block starts after 6 white pixels.
    *   There are 2 white pixels between the end of the red block and the single green pixel.
    *   The green pixel is followed by 5 white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The red block's position changes between input and output.
    *   The green pixel's position remains the same (index 20 in both).
    *   The number and color of pixels in the red block remain unchanged (12 red pixels).
    *   The number of white pixels remains unchanged overall, but their distribution shifts.
5.  **Observed Change Detail:** The red block shifts 2 positions to the right. In the input, it spans indices 6-17. In the output, it spans indices 8-19. The 2 white pixels originally between the red block and the green pixel (at indices 18, 19) are effectively relocated to the positions previously occupied by the start of the red block (indices 6, 7). The result is that the red block becomes immediately adjacent to the green pixel on its left.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input array from left to right to locate the unique green (3) pixel. This is the 'target pixel'.
2.  Starting from the position immediately to the left of the target pixel, scan leftwards.
3.  Identify the first sequence of one or more white (0) pixels encountered. This is the 'gap'. Record its size (number of white pixels). If no white pixels are found before a non-white pixel, the gap size is 0.
4.  Continue scanning leftwards from the beginning of the gap (or from the position left of the target pixel if the gap size was 0) to identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels. This is the 'movable block'. Record its start index, end index, and the sequence of colors within it.
5.  Construct the output array:
    a.  Copy all pixels from the start of the input array up to (but not including) the start index of the movable block.
    b.  Append a sequence of white (0) pixels equal in length to the recorded gap size.
    c.  Append the sequence of pixels corresponding to the movable block.
    d.  Append the target pixel (green = 3).
    e.  Append all remaining pixels from the input array that were originally positioned after the target pixel.
6.  The resulting array is the final output.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code (`code_00.py`) failed because it hardcoded a gap size of 2 based on observations from `train_1` only. The results show that the transformed output was identical to the input for all examples, meaning the condition for performing the shift was not met. This confirms the hardcoded gap logic was incorrect.

The core transformation appears to involve locating a specific marker pixel (green=3), identifying a block of non-background color and a block of background color (the gap) immediately to its left, and then swapping the positions of the gap and the colored block. The size of the gap determines the distance the colored block shifts right.

The strategy is to:
1.  Implement logic to dynamically identify the gap size by scanning leftwards from the target pixel (green=3) until a non-background pixel is encountered.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-background pixels immediately preceding this gap.
3.  Reconstruct the array by placing the pixels before the block, then the gap pixels, then the block pixels, then the target pixel, and finally the pixels after the target.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation_1d_swap
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills space, forms the gap
  - type: target_marker
    color: green (3)
    quantity: 1
    role: fixed anchor point for the transformation
  - type: gap
    description: A contiguous block of background (white=0) pixels located immediately to the left of the target_marker.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      contiguity: required
      position: immediately left of target_marker
      size: variable (determined by scanning left from target_marker)
  - type: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-background, non-target color located immediately to the left of the gap.
    properties:
      color: variable (non-0, non-3)
      contiguity: required
      position: immediately left of the gap
      size: variable (determined by scanning left from the end of the block)
actions:
  - name: identify_target
    actor: system
    target: target_marker (green=3)
  - name: identify_gap
    actor: system
    target: contiguous white (0) pixels immediately left of target_marker
    output: gap start index, gap end index, gap size
  - name: identify_movable_block
    actor: system
    target: contiguous non-white (0), non-green (3) pixels immediately left of the gap
    output: block start index, block end index, block color, block size
  - name: swap_segments
    actor: system
    target1: gap segment
    target2: movable_block segment
    effect: The positions of the gap segment and the movable_block segment are swapped relative to the pixels before the block and the target pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: movable_block
    entity2: gap
    state: adjacent in input (block left of gap)
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: gap
    entity2: target_marker
    state: adjacent in input (gap left of target)
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: gap

  - type: adjacency
    entity1: movable_block
    entity2: target_marker
    state: adjacent in output (block left of target)
  - type: spatial_invariance
    description: Pixels before the movable_block and pixels after the target_marker maintain their relative order and position with respect to the array boundaries.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the index of the unique target pixel (green=3).
2.  Scan leftwards from the position immediately preceding the target pixel. Identify the contiguous sequence of background pixels (white=0). This sequence is the 'gap'. Record its start index, end index, and size. If no background pixels are found immediately left of the target, the gap size is 0.
3.  If the gap size is greater than 0, identify the contiguous block of non-background pixels located immediately to the left of the gap's start index. This is the 'movable block'. Record its start index, end index, and the sequence of pixels within it. If the gap size is 0, no transformation occurs.
4.  Extract four segments from the input array:
    a.  `segment_before`: Pixels from the start of the array up to (but not including) the start index of the movable block.
    b.  `segment_block`: Pixels constituting the movable block.
    c.  `segment_gap`: Pixels constituting the gap.
    d.  `segment_after`: Pixels from the target pixel to the end of the array.
5.  Construct the output array by concatenating the segments in the following order: `segment_before` + `segment_gap` + `segment_block` + `segment_after`.
6.  If the gap size identified in step 2 was 0, return the original input array unchanged.
