task_type: array_manipulation_1d_swap
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills space, forms the gap
  - type: target_marker
    color: green (3)
    quantity: 1
    role: fixed anchor point for the transformation
  - type: gap
    description: A contiguous block of background (white=0) pixels located immediately to the left of the target_marker.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      contiguity: required
      position: immediately left of target_marker
      size: variable (determined by scanning left from target_marker)
  - type: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-background, non-target color located immediately to the left of the gap.
    properties:
      color: variable (non-0, non-3)
      contiguity: required
      position: immediately left of the gap
      size: variable (determined by scanning left from the end of the block)
actions:
  - name: identify_target
    actor: system
    target: target_marker (green=3)
  - name: identify_gap
    actor: system
    target: contiguous white (0) pixels immediately left of target_marker
    output: gap start index, gap end index, gap size
  - name: identify_movable_block
    actor: system
    target: contiguous non-white (0), non-green (3) pixels immediately left of the gap
    output: block start index, block end index, block color, block size
  - name: swap_segments
    actor: system
    target1: gap segment
    target2: movable_block segment
    effect: The positions of the gap segment and the movable_block segment are swapped relative to the pixels before the block and the target pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: movable_block
    entity2: gap
    state: adjacent in input (block left of gap)
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: gap
    entity2: target_marker
    state: adjacent in input (gap left of target)
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: gap
    entity2: movable_block
    state: adjacent in output (gap left of block)
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: movable_block
    entity2: target_marker
    state: adjacent in output (block left of target)
  - type: spatial_invariance
    description: Pixels before the movable_block and pixels after the target_marker maintain their relative order and position with respect to the array boundaries.
