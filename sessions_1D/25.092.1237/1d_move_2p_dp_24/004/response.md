**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code (`code_00.py`) failed because it hardcoded a gap size of 2 based on observations from `train_1` only. The results show that the transformed output was identical to the input for all examples, meaning the condition for performing the shift was not met. This confirms the hardcoded gap logic was incorrect.

The core transformation appears to involve locating a specific marker pixel (green=3), identifying a block of non-background color and a block of background color (the gap) immediately to its left, and then swapping the positions of the gap and the colored block. The size of the gap determines the distance the colored block shifts right.

The strategy is to:
1.  Implement logic to dynamically identify the gap size by scanning leftwards from the target pixel (green=3) until a non-background pixel is encountered.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-background pixels immediately preceding this gap.
3.  Reconstruct the array by placing the pixels before the block, then the gap pixels, then the block pixels, then the target pixel, and finally the pixels after the target.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the index of the unique target pixel (green=3).
2.  Scan leftwards from the position immediately preceding the target pixel. Identify the contiguous sequence of background pixels (white=0). This sequence is the 'gap'. Record its start index, end index, and size. If no background pixels are found immediately left of the target, the gap size is 0.
3.  If the gap size is greater than 0, identify the contiguous block of non-background pixels located immediately to the left of the gap's start index. This is the 'movable block'. Record its start index, end index, and the sequence of pixels within it. If the gap size is 0, no transformation occurs.
4.  Extract four segments from the input array:
    a.  `segment_before`: Pixels from the start of the array up to (but not including) the start index of the movable block.
    b.  `segment_block`: Pixels constituting the movable block.
    c.  `segment_gap`: Pixels constituting the gap.
    d.  `segment_after`: Pixels from the target pixel to the end of the array.
5.  Construct the output array by concatenating the segments in the following order: `segment_before` + `segment_gap` + `segment_block` + `segment_after`.
6.  If the gap size identified in step 2 was 0, return the original input array unchanged.
