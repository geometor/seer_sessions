task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: target_marker
    color: green (3)
    quantity: 1
    role: static anchor point
  - type: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels immediately preceding the target_marker (potentially separated by background pixels).
    properties:
      color: variable (red=2 in example)
      contiguity: required
      position: left of target_marker
  - type: gap
    description: Contiguous block of background (white) pixels between the movable_block and the target_marker.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      size: variable (2 in example)
      role: determines shift distance
actions:
  - name: identify_target
    actor: system
    target: target_marker (green=3)
  - name: identify_movable_block
    actor: system
    target: non-white block left of target_marker
  - name: measure_gap
    actor: system
    target: white pixels between movable_block and target_marker
  - name: shift_block
    actor: movable_block
    direction: right
    distance: size of the gap
    effect: closes the gap, makes movable_block adjacent to target_marker
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: movable_block
    entity2: target_marker
    state: initially separated by gap, finally adjacent
  - type: dependency
    variable: shift_distance
    depends_on: size of the gap
