            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided task example (`train_1`).\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are presented as 1D arrays (or single rows) of integers representing colors. The length remains constant (26 elements).\n2.  **Key Colors/Objects:**\n    *   **White Pixels (0):** These act as the background or empty space.\n    *   **Red Block (2):** In the input, there's a contiguous block of 12 red pixels (`2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`).\n    *   **Green Pixel (3):** There is a single green pixel. It appears relatively late in the array.\n3.  **Spatial Relationships (Input):**\n    *   The red block starts after 6 white pixels.\n    *   There are 2 white pixels between the end of the red block and the single green pixel.\n    *   The green pixel is followed by 5 white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The red block's position changes between input and output.\n    *   The green pixel's position remains the same (index 20 in both).\n    *   The number and color of pixels in the red block remain unchanged (12 red pixels).\n    *   The number of white pixels remains unchanged overall, but their distribution shifts.\n5.  **Observed Change Detail:** The red block shifts 2 positions to the right. In the input, it spans indices 6-17. In the output, it spans indices 8-19. The 2 white pixels originally between the red block and the green pixel (at indices 18, 19) are effectively relocated to the positions previously occupied by the start of the red block (indices 6, 7). The result is that the red block becomes immediately adjacent to the green pixel on its left.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Starting from the position immediately to the left of the target pixel, scan leftwards.\n3.  Identify the first sequence of one or more white (0) pixels encountered. This is the 'gap'. Record its size (number of white pixels). If no white pixels are found before a non-white pixel, the gap size is 0.\n4.  Continue scanning leftwards from the beginning of the gap (or from the position left of the target pixel if the gap size was 0) to identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels. This is the 'movable block'. Record its start index, end index, and the sequence of colors within it.\n5.  Construct the output array:\n    a.  Copy all pixels from the start of the input array up to (but not including) the start index of the movable block.\n    b.  Append a sequence of white (0) pixels equal in length to the recorded gap size.\n    c.  Append the sequence of pixels corresponding to the movable block.\n    d.  Append the target pixel (green = 3).\n    e.  Append all remaining pixels from the input array that were originally positioned after the target pixel.\n6.  The resulting array is the final output."
