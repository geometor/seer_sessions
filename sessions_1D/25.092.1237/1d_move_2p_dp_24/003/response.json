Locate the unique target pixel (green=3) in the 1D input NumPy array.\n2. Identify the block of two background pixels (white=0) immediately to the left of the target pixel. This is the 'fixed gap'.\n3. Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white, non-green color located immediately to the left of the fixed gap. This is the 'movable block'.\n4. Determine the start and end indices of the movable block.\n5. Construct the output array by rearranging segments:\n   a. Pixels originally before the movable block.\n   b. The two white background pixels (representing the gap shifted left).\n   c. The movable block pixels.\n   d. The target pixel.\n   e.
