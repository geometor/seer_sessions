Okay, let's analyze the provided task example (`train_1`).

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are presented as 1D arrays (or single rows) of integers representing colors. The length remains constant (26 elements).
2.  **Key Colors/Objects:**
    *   **White Pixels (0):** These act as the background or empty space.
    *   **Red Block (2):** In the input, there's a contiguous block of 12 red pixels (`2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`).
    *   **Green Pixel (3):** There is a single green pixel. It appears relatively late in the array.
3.  **Spatial Relationships (Input):**
    *   The red block starts after 6 white pixels.
    *   There are 2 white pixels between the end of the red block and the single green pixel.
    *   The green pixel is followed by 5 white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The red block's position changes between input and output.
    *   The green pixel's position remains the same (index 20 in both).
    *   The number and color of pixels in the red block remain unchanged (12 red pixels).
    *   The number of white pixels remains unchanged overall, but their distribution shifts.
5.  **Observed Change Detail:** The red block shifts 2 positions to the right. In the input, it spans indices 6-17. In the output, it spans indices 8-19. The 2 white pixels originally between the red block and the green pixel (at indices 18, 19) are effectively relocated to the positions previously occupied by the start of the red block (indices 6, 7). The result is that the red block becomes immediately adjacent to the green pixel on its left.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input array from left to right to locate the unique green (3) pixel. This is the 'target pixel'.
2.  Starting from the position immediately to the left of the target pixel, scan leftwards.
3.  Identify the first sequence of one or more white (0) pixels encountered. This is the 'gap'. Record its size (number of white pixels). If no white pixels are found before a non-white pixel, the gap size is 0.
4.  Continue scanning leftwards from the beginning of the gap (or from the position left of the target pixel if the gap size was 0) to identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels. This is the 'movable block'. Record its start index, end index, and the sequence of colors within it.
5.  Construct the output array:
    a.  Copy all pixels from the start of the input array up to (but not including) the start index of the movable block.
    b.  Append a sequence of white (0) pixels equal in length to the recorded gap size.
    c.  Append the sequence of pixels corresponding to the movable block.
    d.  Append the target pixel (green = 3).
    e.  Append all remaining pixels from the input array that were originally positioned after the target pixel.
6.  The resulting array is the final output.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'

## Example 2:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'

## Example 3:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

1.  **Error Analysis:** The traceback clearly shows an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`. This occurred because the initial code assumed the input grid was a standard Python `list` and used the `list.index()` method. However, the testing framework provided the input as a NumPy `ndarray`.
2.  **Pattern Consistency:** The core logic identified from `train_1` (finding a green marker, a colored block to its left separated by a gap, and shifting the block to close the gap) appears consistent across all three training examples, as confirmed by the metrics gathered using `tool_code`. The block color changes, but the process and the gap size (always 2 white pixels) remain the same.
3.  **Resolution Strategy:** The primary fix involves adapting the Python code to work with NumPy arrays. This means:
    *   Using NumPy functions like `np.where()` to find element indices instead of `list.index()`.
    *   Using NumPy slicing and array manipulation techniques for extracting segments (block, pixels before/after) and constructing the output array.
    *   The underlying algorithm (identify target, identify block left of gap, shift block right by gap size) remains valid.

**Metrics:**

The `tool_code` execution provided the following details for each training example:

| Example | Input Type        | Input Shape | Target Idx | Block Start (Input) | Block End (Input) | Block Color | Gap Size | Output Block Start | Output Block End |
| :------ | :---------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------------------ | :---------------- | :---------- | :------- | :----------------- | :--------------- |
| train_1 | `numpy.ndarray` | (26,)       | 20         | 6                   | 17                | 2 (red)     | 2        | 8                  | 19               |
| train_2 | `numpy.ndarray` | (26,)       | 22         | 2                   | 19                | 7 (orange)  | 2        | 4                  | 21               |
| train_3 | `numpy.ndarray` | (26,)       | 20         | 2                   | 17                | 5 (gray)    | 2        | 4                  | 19               |

*Observations from Metrics:*
*   Input is consistently a 1D NumPy array of length 26.
*   The target green (3) pixel's position varies.
*   The block's start/end position and color vary.
*   The gap size between the block's end and the target pixel is consistently 2 white (0) pixels.
*   The transformation consistently shifts the block 2 positions to the right, making it adjacent to the target pixel.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input 1D NumPy array.
2.  Find the index (`target_index`) of the single green (3) pixel.
3.  Identify the end position of the 'movable block' as `block_end_index = target_index - 3`. The block consists of the non-white pixels immediately to the left of the two white (0) pixels preceding the green pixel.
4.  Determine the start position (`block_start_index`) of the 'movable block' by scanning leftwards from `block_end_index` until a pixel with a different color (which will be white=0 based on examples) or the beginning of the array is encountered. The first index with a different color marks the position *before* the block starts; the block starts at the next index.
5.  Extract the following segments from the input array:
    *   `pixels_before`: Elements from index 0 up to (but not including) `block_start_index`.
    *   `movable_block`: Elements from `block_start_index` up to and including `block_end_index`.
    *   `target_pixel`: The single element at `target_index`.
    *   `pixels_after`: Elements from `target_index + 1` to the end of the array.
6.  Define the `new_gap` segment as two white (0) pixels: `[0, 0]`.
7.  Construct the output array by concatenating these segments in the new order: `pixels_before` + `new_gap` + `movable_block` + `target_pixel` + `pixels_after`.
8.  Return the resulting NumPy array.
