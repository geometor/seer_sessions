Okay, let's analyze the provided task example (`train_1`).

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are presented as 1D arrays (or single rows) of integers representing colors. The length remains constant (26 elements).
2.  **Key Colors/Objects:**
    *   **White Pixels (0):** These act as the background or empty space.
    *   **Red Block (2):** In the input, there's a contiguous block of 12 red pixels (`2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`).
    *   **Green Pixel (3):** There is a single green pixel. It appears relatively late in the array.
3.  **Spatial Relationships (Input):**
    *   The red block starts after 6 white pixels.
    *   There are 2 white pixels between the end of the red block and the single green pixel.
    *   The green pixel is followed by 5 white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The red block's position changes between input and output.
    *   The green pixel's position remains the same (index 20 in both).
    *   The number and color of pixels in the red block remain unchanged (12 red pixels).
    *   The number of white pixels remains unchanged overall, but their distribution shifts.
5.  **Observed Change Detail:** The red block shifts 2 positions to the right. In the input, it spans indices 6-17. In the output, it spans indices 8-19. The 2 white pixels originally between the red block and the green pixel (at indices 18, 19) are effectively relocated to the positions previously occupied by the start of the red block (indices 6, 7). The result is that the red block becomes immediately adjacent to the green pixel on its left.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: target_marker
    color: green (3)
    quantity: 1
    role: static anchor point
  - type: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels immediately preceding the target_marker (potentially separated by background pixels).
    properties:
      color: variable (red=2 in example)
      contiguity: required
      position: left of target_marker
  - type: gap
    description: Contiguous block of background (white) pixels between the movable_block and the target_marker.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      size: variable (2 in example)
      role: determines shift distance
actions:
  - name: identify_target
    actor: system
    target: target_marker (green=3)
  - name: identify_movable_block
    actor: system
    target: non-white block left of target_marker
  - name: measure_gap
    actor: system
    target: white pixels between movable_block and target_marker
  - name: shift_block
    actor: movable_block
    direction: right
    distance: size of the gap
    effect: closes the gap, makes movable_block adjacent to target_marker
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: movable_block
    entity2: target_marker
    state: initially separated by gap, finally adjacent
  - type: dependency
    variable: shift_distance
    depends_on: size of the gap
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input array from left to right to locate the unique green (3) pixel. This is the 'target pixel'.
2.  Starting from the position immediately to the left of the target pixel, scan leftwards.
3.  Identify the first sequence of one or more white (0) pixels encountered. This is the 'gap'. Record its size (number of white pixels). If no white pixels are found before a non-white pixel, the gap size is 0.
4.  Continue scanning leftwards from the beginning of the gap (or from the position left of the target pixel if the gap size was 0) to identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels. This is the 'movable block'. Record its start index, end index, and the sequence of colors within it.
5.  Construct the output array:
    a.  Copy all pixels from the start of the input array up to (but not including) the start index of the movable block.
    b.  Append a sequence of white (0) pixels equal in length to the recorded gap size.
    c.  Append the sequence of pixels corresponding to the movable block.
    d.  Append the target pixel (green = 3).
    e.  Append all remaining pixels from the input array that were originally positioned after the target pixel.
6.  The resulting array is the final output.
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List

"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Locate the unique target pixel (green=3).
2. Identify the contiguous block of non-background (non-white=0) pixels immediately to the left of the target pixel. This is the 'movable block'.
3. Identify the contiguous block of background (white=0) pixels, if any, situated between the movable block and the target pixel. This is the 'gap'.
4. Determine the size of the gap (number of white pixels).
5. Shift the 'movable block' to the right by a distance equal to the size of the gap, effectively closing the gap and making the movable block adjacent to the target pixel.
6. The relative order and content of all other pixels (background pixels before the movable block, the target pixel itself, and pixels after the target pixel) remain unchanged.
