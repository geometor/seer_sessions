task_type: array_manipulation_1d
input_format: numpy.ndarray (1D)
output_format: numpy.ndarray (1D)
background_color: white (0)
components:
  - type: target_marker
    color: green (3)
    quantity: 1
    role: static anchor point, determines the reference position for the shift.
  - type: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-green color.
    properties:
      color: variable (non-white, non-green)
      contiguity: required
      position_relation_to_target: located to the left, separated by a fixed-size gap.
  - type: gap
    description: A contiguous block of exactly two background (white) pixels.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      size: fixed (2)
      position: located immediately between the end of the movable_block and the target_marker.
      role: space that is eliminated by the transformation.
actions:
  - name: identify_target
    actor: system
    input: input array
    output: index of the target_marker (green=3).
  - name: identify_gap
    actor: system
    input: target_index
    output: indices of the two white pixels immediately left of the target ([target_index - 2, target_index - 1]).
  - name: identify_movable_block
    actor: system
    input: input array, target_index
    method: Identify the non-white pixel at `target_index - 3`. Scan left from this position to find the start of the contiguous block of the same color.
    output: block start index, block end index (`target_index - 3`), block color, block pixel sequence.
  - name: construct_output_array
    actor: system
    input: input array, target_index, block_start_index, block_end_index, movable_block_pixels
    method: Concatenate array slices - (pixels before block) + (two background pixels) + (movable block pixels) + (target pixel) + (pixels after target).
    output: transformed array.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: movable_block
    entity2: target_marker
    state_initial: separated by a gap of 2 white pixels.
    state_final: adjacent (movable_block ends at target_index - 1).
  - type: relative_position
    entity1: gap
    entity2: target_marker
    description: Gap is always immediately to the left of the target marker in the input.
  - type: relative_position
    entity1: movable_block
    entity2: gap
    description: Movable block is always immediately to the left of the gap in the input.
