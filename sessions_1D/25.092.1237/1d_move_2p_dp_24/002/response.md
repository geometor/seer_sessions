**General Assessment and Strategy:**

1.  **Error Analysis:** The traceback clearly shows an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`. This occurred because the initial code assumed the input grid was a standard Python `list` and used the `list.index()` method. However, the testing framework provided the input as a NumPy `ndarray`.
2.  **Pattern Consistency:** The core logic identified from `train_1` (finding a green marker, a colored block to its left separated by a gap, and shifting the block to close the gap) appears consistent across all three training examples, as confirmed by the metrics gathered using `tool_code`. The block color changes, but the process and the gap size (always 2 white pixels) remain the same.
3.  **Resolution Strategy:** The primary fix involves adapting the Python code to work with NumPy arrays. This means:
    *   Using NumPy functions like `np.where()` to find element indices instead of `list.index()`.
    *   Using NumPy slicing and array manipulation techniques for extracting segments (block, pixels before/after) and constructing the output array.
    *   The underlying algorithm (identify target, identify block left of gap, shift block right by gap size) remains valid.

**Metrics:**

The `tool_code` execution provided the following details for each training example:

| Example | Input Type        | Input Shape | Target Idx | Block Start (Input) | Block End (Input) | Block Color | Gap Size | Output Block Start | Output Block End |
| :------ | :---------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------------------ | :---------------- | :---------- | :------- | :----------------- | :--------------- |
| train_1 | `numpy.ndarray` | (26,)       | 20         | 6                   | 17                | 2 (red)     | 2        | 8                  | 19               |
| train_2 | `numpy.ndarray` | (26,)       | 22         | 2                   | 19                | 7 (orange)  | 2        | 4                  | 21               |
| train_3 | `numpy.ndarray` | (26,)       | 20         | 2                   | 17                | 5 (gray)    | 2        | 4                  | 19               |

*Observations from Metrics:*
*   Input is consistently a 1D NumPy array of length 26.
*   The target green (3) pixel's position varies.
*   The block's start/end position and color vary.
*   The gap size between the block's end and the target pixel is consistently 2 white (0) pixels.
*   The transformation consistently shifts the block 2 positions to the right, making it adjacent to the target pixel.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input 1D NumPy array.
2.  Find the index (`target_index`) of the single green (3) pixel.
3.  Identify the end position of the 'movable block' as `block_end_index = target_index - 3`. The block consists of the non-white pixels immediately to the left of the two white (0) pixels preceding the green pixel.
4.  Determine the start position (`block_start_index`) of the 'movable block' by scanning leftwards from `block_end_index` until a pixel with a different color (which will be white=0 based on examples) or the beginning of the array is encountered. The first index with a different color marks the position *before* the block starts; the block starts at the next index.
5.  Extract the following segments from the input array:
    *   `pixels_before`: Elements from index 0 up to (but not including) `block_start_index`.
    *   `movable_block`: Elements from `block_start_index` up to and including `block_end_index`.
    *   `target_pixel`: The single element at `target_index`.
    *   `pixels_after`: Elements from `target_index + 1` to the end of the array.
6.  Define the `new_gap` segment as two white (0) pixels: `[0, 0]`.
7.  Construct the output array by concatenating these segments in the new order: `pixels_before` + `new_gap` + `movable_block` + `target_pixel` + `pixels_after`.
8.  Return the resulting NumPy array.
