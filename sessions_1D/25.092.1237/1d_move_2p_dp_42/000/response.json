Let's call this the \"marker pattern\".\n3.  **Main Object:** Immediately preceding the marker pattern in each input is a contiguous block of a single, non-`white` color (red in train_1, orange in train_2, blue in train_3). Let's call this the \"color block\".\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting the color block two positions to the right. This shift overwrites the first two `white` pixels of the marker pattern with the color of the color block. The original first two positions occupied by the color block become `white`. The `gray` and the final `white` of the marker pattern remain in their shifted positions. Other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Ensure the pixel at index `marker_start + 2` in the output grid is `gray` (5) and the pixel at index `marker_start + 3` is `white` (0) (though step 1 already ensures this unless the block is very short, the rule implies these are preserved)."
