task_description: Shift a color block based on a marker pattern.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN)
elements:
  - element: marker_pattern
    description: A fixed sequence of four pixels.
    value: [white, white, gray, white] # or [0, 0, 5, 0]
    role: Trigger for the transformation and destination overlap for the shift.
  - element: color_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (varies per example).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (varies per example).
      - position: Located immediately before the marker_pattern in the input.
    role: The object being moved/transformed.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The color_block is always immediately adjacent to and before the marker_pattern in the input.
transformation:
  - action: find
    target: marker_pattern
    details: Locate the starting index of the [0, 0, 5, 0] sequence.
  - action: find
    target: color_block
    details: Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels ending just before the marker_pattern starts. Note its color (C), starting index (block_start), and ending index (block_end).
  - action: shift_and_overwrite
    target: color_block
    details: The block effectively moves two positions to the right.
    results:
      - The output grid initially matches the input.
      - Pixels at indices `block_start` and `block_start + 1` in the output are set to white (0).
      - Pixels from index `block_start + 2` up to `block_end + 2` in the output are set to the color C.
      - The pixel at index `block_end + 3` (originally the gray pixel's position relative to the start of the marker pattern) retains the gray color (5).
      - The pixel at index `block_end + 4` (originally the last white pixel's position relative to the start of the marker pattern) retains the white color (0).
      - All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.
