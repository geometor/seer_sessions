            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core pattern: locating a marker sequence `[0, 0, 5, 0]`, identifying the preceding contiguous block of non-white color, and shifting that block two positions to the right, adjusting the starting positions and overwriting the first part of the marker. The provided examples are consistent with this rule.\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly suggests that during execution, the input grid or slices thereof were treated as NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists. The comparison `slice == sequence` within the `find_sequence` function, when applied to NumPy arrays, results in an element-wise boolean array. Using this boolean array directly in an `if` condition is ambiguous. The fix involves ensuring the comparison handles potential NumPy arrays correctly, likely by using the `.all()` method on the resulting boolean array.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the `find_sequence` helper function to explicitly handle the comparison between a slice (which might be a NumPy array) and the sequence (a list), ensuring the result is a single boolean value (e.g., using `.all()`).\n2.  Consider explicitly converting the input row to a list at the beginning of the `transform` function to guarantee consistent data types, although modifying `find_sequence` is the direct fix for the reported error.\n3.  Re-verify the logic steps in the natural language program and YAML to ensure clarity and accuracy, reflecting the understanding confirmed by analyzing all training examples.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nBased on re-analysis of the examples:\n\n*   **Data Structure:** All examples use a 1xN grid (effectively 1D). The length is 27 in all provided training cases.\n*   **Marker:** The sequence `[0, 0, 5, 0]` (white, white, gray, white) is present in all inputs.\n    *   Train 1: Starts at index 23.\n    *   Train 2: Starts at index 18.\n    *   Train 3: Starts at index 14.\n*   **Color Block:** A contiguous block of a single non-white color exists immediately before the marker in all inputs.\n    *   Train 1: Color 2 (red), Indices 0-22 (Length 23).\n    *   Train 2: Color 7 (orange), Indices 14-17 (Length 4).\n    *   Train 3: Color 1 (blue), Indices 2-13 (Length 12).\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation consistently involves:\n    1.  Setting the first two indices of the original block to 0 (white).\n    2.  Copying the block's color to the indices starting 2 positions to the right of the original block's start index, for the length of the block. This overwrites the `[0, 0]` part of the marker.\n    3.  The `[5, 0]` part of the marker remains untouched relative to its original position after the shift.\n\nThe logic appears sound; the implementation needs adjustment for potential data type issues during comparison.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
