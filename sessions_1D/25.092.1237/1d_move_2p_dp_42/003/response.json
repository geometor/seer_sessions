Locate a specific marker sequence: [white, white, gray, white] ([0, 0, 5, 0]).\n2. Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white color immediately preceding this marker.\n3. Shift this color block two positions to the right.\n4. The original first two positions occupied by the color block become white (0).\n5. The shifted block overwrites the first two positions previously occupied by the marker sequence ([white, white]).\n6. The last two positions of the original marker sequence ([gray, white]) retain their values and relative position after the block shift.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_sequence(grid_row, sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the starting index of the first occurrence of a sequence in a list (grid row).\n    Returns -1 if the sequence is not found.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_row (list): The 1D list representing the grid row to search within.\n        sequence (list): The sequence of values to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The starting index of the sequence, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seq_len = len(sequence)\n    row_len = len(grid_row)\n    for i in range(row_len - seq_len + 1):\n        # Check if the slice of grid_row matches the sequence\n        if grid_row[i:i + seq_len] == sequence:\n            return i\n    return -1 # Sequence not found\n\ndef find_block_start(grid_row, end_index, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the starting index of a contiguous block of a given color\n    ending at end_index (inclusive).
