task_description: Shifts a contiguous block of color two cells to the right, triggered by a specific marker sequence following the block.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
elements:
  - element: marker_pattern
    description: A fixed sequence of four pixels acting as a trigger and spatial reference.
    value: [white, white, gray, white] # [0, 0, 5, 0]
    role: Identifies the location for the transformation. The first two elements are overwritten during the transformation. The last two elements ([gray, white]) retain their value and relative position after the shift.
  - element: color_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white color located immediately before the marker_pattern.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., red, orange, blue).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (variable).
      - start_index: The grid index where the block begins.
      - end_index: The grid index where the block ends (equal to marker_start_index - 1).
    role: The object being moved/transformed.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: The color_block's last pixel is immediately before the marker_pattern's first pixel.
transformation_steps:
  - action: locate_marker
    input: input_grid (1D row)
    output: marker_start_index (start index of [0, 0, 5, 0])
    description: Find the starting index of the marker sequence [0, 0, 5, 0].
  - action: identify_block
    input: input_grid (1D row), marker_start_index
    output: block_start_index, block_end_index, block_color
    description: Determine the end index (marker_start_index - 1), color, and start index of the contiguous non-white color block preceding the marker.
  - action: initialize_output
    input: input_grid (1D row)
    output: output_grid (1D row)
    description: Create a mutable copy of the input grid row.
  - action: clear_original_block_start
    input: output_grid, block_start_index
    output: modified output_grid
    description: Set the cells at block_start_index and block_start_index + 1 in the output grid to white (0).
  - action: write_shifted_block
    input: output_grid, block_start_index, block_end_index, block_color
    output: modified output_grid
    description: Iterate from block_start_index to block_end_index (inclusive). For each index `i`, set the cell at index `i + 2` in the output grid to block_color. This overwrites the first two elements originally part of the marker sequence's location.
  - action: finalize
    input: modified output_grid
    output: final output grid (1xN)
    description: Ensure the grid is formatted as a 1xN list of lists. The gray (5) and final white (0) from the original marker position remain at indices marker_start_index + 2 and marker_start_index + 3, respectively, due to the specific overwrite range.
