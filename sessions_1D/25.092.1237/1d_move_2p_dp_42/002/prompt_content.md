"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Locate a marker sequence defined as [0, 0, 5, 0] (white, white, gray, white) within the 1D input grid row.
2. Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white color that immediately precedes this marker sequence.
3. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
4. Modify the output grid:
   a. Set the first two cells corresponding to the original position of the color block to white (0).
   b. Shift the color block two positions to the right, overwriting the cells starting from two positions past the block's original start index. The length of the block remains the same. This shift overwrites the first two white cells (0, 0) of the marker pattern with the block's color.
   c. The gray (5) and the final white (0) pixels of the original marker sequence remain in their positions relative to the shifted block.
