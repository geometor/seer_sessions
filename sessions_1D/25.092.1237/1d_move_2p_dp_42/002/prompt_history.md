Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All examples show a 1-dimensional grid (or a 1xN grid).
2.  **Key Pattern:** A recurring sequence `white, white, gray, white` (0, 0, 5, 0) appears in each input grid. Let's call this the "marker pattern".
3.  **Main Object:** Immediately preceding the marker pattern in each input is a contiguous block of a single, non-`white` color (red in train_1, orange in train_2, blue in train_3). Let's call this the "color block".
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting the color block two positions to the right. This shift overwrites the first two `white` pixels of the marker pattern with the color of the color block. The original first two positions occupied by the color block become `white`. The `gray` and the final `white` of the marker pattern remain in their shifted positions. Other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a color block based on a marker pattern.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN)
elements:
  - element: marker_pattern
    description: A fixed sequence of four pixels.
    value: [white, white, gray, white] # or [0, 0, 5, 0]
    role: Trigger for the transformation and destination overlap for the shift.
  - element: color_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (varies per example).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (varies per example).
      - position: Located immediately before the marker_pattern in the input.
    role: The object being moved/transformed.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The color_block is always immediately adjacent to and before the marker_pattern in the input.
transformation:
  - action: find
    target: marker_pattern
    details: Locate the starting index of the [0, 0, 5, 0] sequence.
  - action: find
    target: color_block
    details: Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels ending just before the marker_pattern starts. Note its color (C), starting index (block_start), and ending index (block_end).
  - action: shift_and_overwrite
    target: color_block
    details: The block effectively moves two positions to the right.
    results:
      - The output grid initially matches the input.
      - Pixels at indices `block_start` and `block_start + 1` in the output are set to white (0).
      - Pixels from index `block_start + 2` up to `block_end + 2` in the output are set to the color C.
      - The pixel at index `block_end + 3` (originally the gray pixel's position relative to the start of the marker pattern) retains the gray color (5).
      - The pixel at index `block_end + 4` (originally the last white pixel's position relative to the start of the marker pattern) retains the white color (0).
      - All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the starting index of the sequence `white, white, gray, white` (0, 0, 5, 0). Let this index be `marker_start`.
3.  Identify the color (`C`) of the pixel at index `marker_start - 1`. This is the color of the block to be shifted.
4.  Find the starting index (`block_start`) of the contiguous block of color `C` that ends at `marker_start - 1`.
5.  Set the pixels at indices `block_start` and `block_start + 1` in the output grid to `white` (0).
6.  Iterate from index `i = block_start + 2` up to `marker_start + 1` (inclusive). For each `i`, set the pixel at index `i` in the output grid to color `C`.
7.  Ensure the pixel at index `marker_start + 2` in the output grid is `gray` (5) and the pixel at index `marker_start + 3` is `white` (0) (though step 1 already ensures this unless the block is very short, the rule implies these are preserved).
```python
import numpy as np # Using numpy for potential future array operations, though lists suffice here

"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Locate a marker sequence defined as [0, 0, 5, 0] (white, white, gray, white) within the 1D input grid row.
2. Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white color that immediately precedes this marker sequence.
3. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
4. Modify the output grid:
   a. Set the first two cells corresponding to the original position of the color block to white (0).
   b. Shift the color block two positions to the right, overwriting the cells starting from two positions past the block's original start index. The length of the block remains the same. This shift overwrites the first two white cells (0, 0) of the marker pattern with the block's color.
   c. The gray (5) and the final white (0) pixels of the original marker sequence remain in their positions relative to the shifted block.
