Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All examples show a 1-dimensional grid (or a 1xN grid).
2.  **Key Pattern:** A recurring sequence `white, white, gray, white` (0, 0, 5, 0) appears in each input grid. Let's call this the "marker pattern".
3.  **Main Object:** Immediately preceding the marker pattern in each input is a contiguous block of a single, non-`white` color (red in train_1, orange in train_2, blue in train_3). Let's call this the "color block".
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting the color block two positions to the right. This shift overwrites the first two `white` pixels of the marker pattern with the color of the color block. The original first two positions occupied by the color block become `white`. The `gray` and the final `white` of the marker pattern remain in their shifted positions. Other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a color block based on a marker pattern.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN)
elements:
  - element: marker_pattern
    description: A fixed sequence of four pixels.
    value: [white, white, gray, white] # or [0, 0, 5, 0]
    role: Trigger for the transformation and destination overlap for the shift.
  - element: color_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (varies per example).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (varies per example).
      - position: Located immediately before the marker_pattern in the input.
    role: The object being moved/transformed.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The color_block is always immediately adjacent to and before the marker_pattern in the input.
transformation:
  - action: find
    target: marker_pattern
    details: Locate the starting index of the [0, 0, 5, 0] sequence.
  - action: find
    target: color_block
    details: Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels ending just before the marker_pattern starts. Note its color (C), starting index (block_start), and ending index (block_end).
  - action: shift_and_overwrite
    target: color_block
    details: The block effectively moves two positions to the right.
    results:
      - The output grid initially matches the input.
      - Pixels at indices `block_start` and `block_start + 1` in the output are set to white (0).
      - Pixels from index `block_start + 2` up to `block_end + 2` in the output are set to the color C.
      - The pixel at index `block_end + 3` (originally the gray pixel's position relative to the start of the marker pattern) retains the gray color (5).
      - The pixel at index `block_end + 4` (originally the last white pixel's position relative to the start of the marker pattern) retains the white color (0).
      - All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the starting index of the sequence `white, white, gray, white` (0, 0, 5, 0). Let this index be `marker_start`.
3.  Identify the color (`C`) of the pixel at index `marker_start - 1`. This is the color of the block to be shifted.
4.  Find the starting index (`block_start`) of the contiguous block of color `C` that ends at `marker_start - 1`.
5.  Set the pixels at indices `block_start` and `block_start + 1` in the output grid to `white` (0).
6.  Iterate from index `i = block_start + 2` up to `marker_start + 1` (inclusive). For each `i`, set the pixel at index `i` in the output grid to color `C`.
7.  Ensure the pixel at index `marker_start + 2` in the output grid is `gray` (5) and the pixel at index `marker_start + 3` is `white` (0) (though step 1 already ensures this unless the block is very short, the rule implies these are preserved).
