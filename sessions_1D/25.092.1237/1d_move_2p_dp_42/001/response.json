Locate a marker sequence defined as [0, 0, 5, 0] (white, white, gray, white) within the 1D input grid row.\n2. Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white color that immediately precedes this marker sequence.\n3. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.\n4. Modify the output grid:\n   a. Set the first two cells corresponding to the original position of the color block to white (0).\n   b. Shift the color block two positions to the right, overwriting the cells starting from two positions past the block's original start index. The length of the block remains the same. This shift overwrites the first two white cells (0, 0) of the marker pattern with the block's color.\n   c. The gray (5) and the final white (0) pixels of the original marker sequence remain in their positions relative to the shifted block.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_sequence(grid_row, sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the starting index of the first occurrence of a sequence in a list (grid row).\n    Returns -1 if the sequence is not found.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_row (list): The 1D list representing the grid row to search within.\n        sequence (list): The sequence of values to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The starting index of the sequence, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    seq_len = len(sequence)\n    row_len = len(grid_row)\n    for i in range(row_len - seq_len + 1):\n        if grid_row[i:i + seq_len] == sequence:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\ndef find_block_start(grid_row, end_index, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the starting index of a contiguous block of a given color\n    ending at end_index (inclusive).
