"""
Transforms a 1D input grid row based on the following steps:
1. Locate a specific marker sequence: [white, white, gray, white] ([0, 0, 5, 0]).
2. Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white color immediately preceding this marker.
3. Shift this color block two positions to the right.
4. The original first two positions occupied by the color block become white (0).
5. The shifted block overwrites the first two positions previously occupied by the marker sequence ([white, white]).
6. The last two positions of the original marker sequence ([gray, white]) retain their values and relative position after the block shift.
