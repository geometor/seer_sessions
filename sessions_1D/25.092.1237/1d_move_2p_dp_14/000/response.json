A sequence of zero or more leading white pixels (0).\n2.  A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (magenta, green, or gray in the examples). Let's call this the \"main block\".\n3.  Exactly two white pixels (0).\n4.  A single blue pixel (1).\n5.  A sequence of zero or more trailing white pixels (0).\n\nThe output array maintains the same overall structure and length as the input.\nThe key transformation is a shift:\n*   The main block appears shifted two positions to the right in the output compared to the input.\n*   The two white pixels that immediately followed the main block in the input appear to be moved to the beginning of the array in the output, effectively prepending them to the initial leading white pixels.\n*   The single blue pixel and any trailing white pixels retain their positions relative to the end of the array.\n*   The color and length of the main block remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
