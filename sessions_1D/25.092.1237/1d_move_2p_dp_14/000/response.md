Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

The input and output are both 1-dimensional arrays (or single-row grids) of pixel values.
Each input array contains:
1.  A sequence of zero or more leading white pixels (0).
2.  A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (magenta, green, or gray in the examples). Let's call this the "main block".
3.  Exactly two white pixels (0).
4.  A single blue pixel (1).
5.  A sequence of zero or more trailing white pixels (0).

The output array maintains the same overall structure and length as the input.
The key transformation is a shift:
*   The main block appears shifted two positions to the right in the output compared to the input.
*   The two white pixels that immediately followed the main block in the input appear to be moved to the beginning of the array in the output, effectively prepending them to the initial leading white pixels.
*   The single blue pixel and any trailing white pixels retain their positions relative to the end of the array.
*   The color and length of the main block remain unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Shift a colored block based on specific delimiters.

Examples:
  - Input_Structure:
      - Type: 1D array
      - Components:
          - Leading_Whites: Sequence of 0s at the start (variable length, >=0).
          - Main_Block: Contiguous sequence of non-0, non-1 pixels (single color, variable length > 0).
          - Separator_Whites: Exactly two 0s immediately after Main_Block.
          - Blue_Marker: Exactly one 1 immediately after Separator_Whites.
          - Trailing_Whites: Sequence of 0s at the end (variable length, >=0).
  - Output_Structure:
      - Type: 1D array (same length as input).
      - Components:
          - New_Leading_Whites: Concatenation of input Leading_Whites and input Separator_Whites.
          - Main_Block: Same color and length as input Main_Block.
          - Blue_Marker: Same as input Blue_Marker.
          - Trailing_Whites: Same as input Trailing_Whites.
  - Transformation:
      - Identification: Locate the Blue_Marker (1).
      - Identification: Locate the two Separator_Whites (0, 0) immediately preceding the Blue_Marker.
      - Identification: Locate the Main_Block (contiguous non-0, non-1 pixels) immediately preceding the Separator_Whites.
      - Identification: Locate Leading_Whites preceding the Main_Block.
      - Identification: Locate Trailing_Whites following the Blue_Marker.
      - Action: Rearrange the identified components.
      - Rule: Output = Leading_Whites + Separator_Whites + Main_Block + Blue_Marker + Trailing_Whites.
  - Invariants:
      - Array length.
      - Color and length of the Main_Block.
      - Value and relative position (from end) of the Blue_Marker.
      - Value and relative positions (from end) of the Trailing_Whites.
  - Variants:
      - Color of the Main_Block.
      - Length of the Main_Block.
      - Number of Leading_Whites.
      - Number of Trailing_Whites.

Derived_Rule: The transformation effectively moves the two white pixels found just before the blue pixel to the very beginning of the array, shifting the main block two positions to the right relative to the start, while keeping the blue pixel and everything after it fixed relative to the end.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Parse the input 1D array to identify its distinct components based on pixel values and their sequence.
2.  Locate the single blue pixel (value 1).
3.  Identify the two white pixels (value 0) that are positioned immediately before the blue pixel. These are the "separator whites".
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor blue (1) and are located immediately before the separator whites. This is the "main block".
5.  Identify the sequence of white pixels (value 0) located at the beginning of the array, before the main block. These are the "leading whites".
6.  Identify the sequence of white pixels (value 0) located at the end of the array, after the blue pixel. These are the "trailing whites".
7.  Construct the output array by concatenating the identified components in the following order:
    a.  The leading whites.
    b.  The separator whites.
    c.  The main block.
    d.  The blue pixel.
    e.  The trailing whites.
8.  The resulting array is the output.
