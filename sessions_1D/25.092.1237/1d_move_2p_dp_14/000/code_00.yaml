Task: Shift a colored block based on specific delimiters.

Examples:
  - Input_Structure:
      - Type: 1D array
      - Components:
          - Leading_Whites: Sequence of 0s at the start (variable length, >=0).
          - Main_Block: Contiguous sequence of non-0, non-1 pixels (single color, variable length > 0).
          - Separator_Whites: Exactly two 0s immediately after Main_Block.
          - Blue_Marker: Exactly one 1 immediately after Separator_Whites.
          - Trailing_Whites: Sequence of 0s at the end (variable length, >=0).
  - Output_Structure:
      - Type: 1D array (same length as input).
      - Components:
          - New_Leading_Whites: Concatenation of input Leading_Whites and input Separator_Whites.
          - Main_Block: Same color and length as input Main_Block.
          - Blue_Marker: Same as input Blue_Marker.
          - Trailing_Whites: Same as input Trailing_Whites.
  - Transformation:
      - Identification: Locate the Blue_Marker (1).
      - Identification: Locate the two Separator_Whites (0, 0) immediately preceding the Blue_Marker.
      - Identification: Locate the Main_Block (contiguous non-0, non-1 pixels) immediately preceding the Separator_Whites.
      - Identification: Locate Leading_Whites preceding the Main_Block.
      - Identification: Locate Trailing_Whites following the Blue_Marker.
      - Action: Rearrange the identified components.
      - Rule: Output = Leading_Whites + Separator_Whites + Main_Block + Blue_Marker + Trailing_Whites.
  - Invariants:
      - Array length.
      - Color and length of the Main_Block.
      - Value and relative position (from end) of the Blue_Marker.
      - Value and relative positions (from end) of the Trailing_Whites.
  - Variants:
      - Color of the Main_Block.
      - Length of the Main_Block.
      - Number of Leading_Whites.
      - Number of Trailing_Whites.

Derived_Rule: The transformation effectively moves the two white pixels found just before the blue pixel to the very beginning of the array, shifting the main block two positions to the right relative to the start, while keeping the blue pixel and everything after it fixed relative to the end.
