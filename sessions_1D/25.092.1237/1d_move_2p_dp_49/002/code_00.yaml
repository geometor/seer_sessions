task_description: Shift a horizontal colored line within a 1D NumPy array to be immediately adjacent (left side) to a fixed gray pixel.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2 (represented as 1xN NumPy array)
  data_type: numpy.ndarray
  element_type: integer
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: colored_line
    type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    representation: sequence of identical integer values in the 1D array
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-gray (5) integer value (e.g., 7, 4, 2)
      length: variable (number of pixels in the segment)
    location:
      input: defined by start and end indices in the input array
      output: defined by shifted start and end indices in the output array
  - id: anchor_pixel
    type: single_pixel
    representation: specific integer value (5) at a specific index
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
    location:
      input: fixed index in the input array
      output: same fixed index as input in the output array

relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    object1: colored_line (rightmost pixel/index)
    object2: anchor_pixel (index)
    state:
      input: separated by one or more white (0) pixels (anchor index > line end index + 1)
      output: immediately adjacent (line end index == anchor index - 1)

actions:
  - type: horizontal_shift (array slice manipulation)
    target: colored_line
    parameters:
      direction: right (implied by index calculation)
      magnitude: calculated to achieve adjacency (anchor_index - 1 - original_line_end_index)
    constraints:
      - anchor_pixel remains stationary.
      - colored_line color and length remain constant.
      - background remains white.
      - operations are performed on NumPy arrays.
