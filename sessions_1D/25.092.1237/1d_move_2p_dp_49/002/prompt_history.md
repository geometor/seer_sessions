Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception of Task Elements

The input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays represented horizontally). Each grid contains:
1.  A background of white pixels (0).
2.  A single gray pixel (5).
3.  A contiguous horizontal line of pixels of a single color (orange, yellow, or red in the examples), which is neither white nor gray.

The transformation involves moving the horizontal line of colored pixels while keeping the gray pixel fixed. Specifically, the colored line shifts horizontally to the right until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left side of the gray pixel. The color, length, and orientation (horizontal) of the line remain unchanged. The gray pixel's position also remains unchanged.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: Shift a horizontal colored line to be adjacent to a fixed gray pixel.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 (represented as 1xN grid)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: colored_line
    type: contiguous_horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-gray (5) (e.g., orange(7), yellow(4), red(2))
      length: variable (9, 11, 8 in examples)
    location:
      input: variable start and end indices
      output: shifted start and end indices
  - id: anchor_pixel
    type: single_pixel
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
    location:
      input: fixed index
      output: same fixed index as input

relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    object1: colored_line (rightmost pixel)
    object2: anchor_pixel
    state:
      input: separated by one or more white (0) pixels
      output: immediately adjacent (object1 is directly to the left of object2)

actions:
  - type: horizontal_shift
    target: colored_line
    parameters:
      direction: right
      magnitude: calculated to achieve adjacency with anchor_pixel (anchor_pixel_index - colored_line_end_index - 1)
    constraints:
      - anchor_pixel remains stationary.
      - colored_line color and length remain constant.
      - background remains white.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize**: Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  **Identify Anchor**: Locate the single gray pixel (5) in the input grid and record its position (index). Place this gray pixel at the same position in the output grid.
3.  **Identify Line**: Locate the contiguous horizontal line of pixels having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not gray (5). Record this line's color, its starting position (index), and its ending position (index).
4.  **Calculate Shift**: Determine the target ending position for the line in the output grid. This position should be the index immediately to the left of the anchor pixel's position (i.e., `anchor_pixel_position - 1`).
5.  **Calculate New Start**: Determine the new starting position for the line by subtracting its length (minus 1) from the target ending position (`target_end_position - (original_line_end_position - original_line_start_position)`). Alternatively, calculate the shift amount (`shift = anchor_pixel_position - original_line_end_position - 1`) and add it to the original starting position (`new_start_position = original_line_start_position + shift`).
6.  **Place Line**: Draw the identified line onto the output grid using its original color, starting at the calculated new starting position and ending at the calculated target ending position.
7.  **Finalize**: The output grid now contains the background, the stationary anchor pixel, and the shifted colored line.

"""
Shift a horizontal colored line to be adjacent to a fixed gray pixel.

1. Identify the position of the single gray pixel (5), the 'anchor'.
2. Identify the contiguous horizontal line of a single color (not white 0, not gray 5). Record its color, start index, and end index.
3. Calculate the target end index for the line, which is the index immediately to the left of the anchor pixel (anchor_index - 1).
4. Calculate the new start index for the line based on its length and the target end index.
5. Create an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white 0).
6. Place the anchor pixel (gray 5) at its original position in the output grid.
7. Place the identified colored line at its new calculated position (new start index to target end index) in the output grid using its original color.
