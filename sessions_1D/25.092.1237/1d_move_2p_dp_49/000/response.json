Each grid contains:\n1.  A background of white pixels (0).\n2.  A single gray pixel (5).\n3.  A contiguous horizontal line of pixels of a single color (orange, yellow, or red in the examples), which is neither white nor gray.\n\nThe transformation involves moving the horizontal line of colored pixels while keeping the gray pixel fixed. Specifically, the colored line shifts horizontally to the right until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left side of the gray pixel. The color, length, and orientation (horizontal) of the line remain unchanged. The gray pixel's position also remains unchanged.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Place this gray pixel at the same position in the output grid.\n3.  **Identify Line**: Locate the contiguous horizontal line of pixels having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not gray (5). Record this line's color, its starting position (index), and its ending position (index).\n4.  **Calculate Shift**: Determine the target ending position for the line in the output grid. This position should be the index immediately to the left of the anchor pixel's position (i.e., `anchor_pixel_position - 1`).\n5.  **Calculate New Start**: Determine the new starting position for the line by subtracting its length (minus 1) from the target ending position (`target_end_position - (original_line_end_position - original_line_start_position)`). Alternatively, calculate the shift amount (`shift = anchor_pixel_position - original_line_end_position - 1`) and add it to the original starting position (`new_start_position = original_line_start_position + shift`).\n6.  **Place Line**: Draw the identified line onto the output grid using its original color, starting at the calculated new starting position and ending at the calculated target ending position.\n7.  **Finalize**: The output grid now contains the background, the stationary anchor pixel, and the shifted colored line."
