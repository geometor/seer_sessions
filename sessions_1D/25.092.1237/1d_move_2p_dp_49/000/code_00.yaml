task_description: Shift a horizontal colored line to be adjacent to a fixed gray pixel.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 (represented as 1xN grid)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: colored_line
    type: contiguous_horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-gray (5) (e.g., orange(7), yellow(4), red(2))
      length: variable (9, 11, 8 in examples)
    location:
      input: variable start and end indices
      output: shifted start and end indices
  - id: anchor_pixel
    type: single_pixel
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
    location:
      input: fixed index
      output: same fixed index as input

relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    object1: colored_line (rightmost pixel)
    object2: anchor_pixel
    state:
      input: separated by one or more white (0) pixels
      output: immediately adjacent (object1 is directly to the left of object2)

actions:
  - type: horizontal_shift
    target: colored_line
    parameters:
      direction: right
      magnitude: calculated to achieve adjacency with anchor_pixel (anchor_pixel_index - colored_line_end_index - 1)
    constraints:
      - anchor_pixel remains stationary.
      - colored_line color and length remain constant.
      - background remains white.
