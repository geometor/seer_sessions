Shift a horizontal colored line to be adjacent to a fixed gray pixel.

1. Identify the position of the single gray pixel (5), the 'anchor'.
2. Identify the contiguous horizontal line of a single color (not white 0, not gray 5). Record its color, start index, and end index.
3. Calculate the target end index for the line, which is the index immediately to the left of the anchor pixel (anchor_index - 1).
4. Calculate the new start index for the line based on its length and the target end index.
5. Create an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white 0).
6. Place the anchor pixel (gray 5) at its original position in the output grid.
7. Place the identified colored line at its new calculated position (new start index to target end index) in the output grid using its original color.
