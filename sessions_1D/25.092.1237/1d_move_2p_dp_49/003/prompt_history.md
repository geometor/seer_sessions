Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception of Task Elements

The input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays represented horizontally). Each grid contains:
1.  A background of white pixels (0).
2.  A single gray pixel (5).
3.  A contiguous horizontal line of pixels of a single color (orange, yellow, or red in the examples), which is neither white nor gray.

The transformation involves moving the horizontal line of colored pixels while keeping the gray pixel fixed. Specifically, the colored line shifts horizontally to the right until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left side of the gray pixel. The color, length, and orientation (horizontal) of the line remain unchanged. The gray pixel's position also remains unchanged.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: Shift a horizontal colored line to be adjacent to a fixed gray pixel.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 (represented as 1xN grid)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: colored_line
    type: contiguous_horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-gray (5) (e.g., orange(7), yellow(4), red(2))
      length: variable (9, 11, 8 in examples)
    location:
      input: variable start and end indices
      output: shifted start and end indices
  - id: anchor_pixel
    type: single_pixel
    properties:

    object1: colored_line (rightmost pixel)
    object2: anchor_pixel
    state:
      input: separated by one or more white (0) pixels
      output: immediately adjacent (object1 is directly to the left of object2)

actions:
  - type: horizontal_shift
    target: colored_line
    parameters:
      direction: right
      magnitude: calculated to achieve adjacency with anchor_pixel (anchor_pixel_index - colored_line_end_index - 1)
    constraints:
      - anchor_pixel remains stationary.
      - colored_line color and length remain constant.
      - background remains white.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize**: Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  **Identify Anchor**: Locate the single gray pixel (5) in the input grid and record its position (index). Place this gray pixel at the same position in the output grid.
3.  **Identify Line**: Locate the contiguous horizontal line of pixels having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not gray (5). Record this line's color, its starting position (index), and its ending position (index).
4.  **Calculate Shift**: Determine the target ending position for the line in the output grid. This position should be the index immediately to the left of the anchor pixel's position (i.e., `anchor_pixel_position - 1`).
5.  **Calculate New Start**: Determine the new starting position for the line by subtracting its length (minus 1) from the target ending position (`target_end_position - (original_line_end_position - original_line_start_position)`). Alternatively, calculate the shift amount (`shift = anchor_pixel_position - original_line_end_position - 1`) and add it to the original starting position (`new_start_position = original_line_start_position + shift`).
6.  **Place Line**: Draw the identified line onto the output grid using its original color, starting at the calculated new starting position and ending at the calculated target ending position.
7.  **Finalize**: The output grid now contains the background, the stationary anchor pixel, and the shifted colored line.

## Example 3:

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a colored horizontal line segment to be adjacent to a fixed gray anchor pixel. However, the implementation failed because it assumed the input grid data structure was a standard Python list, while it is actually a NumPy array. The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'` confirms this type mismatch.

The strategy to resolve this is to adapt the data handling parts of the code to use NumPy functions and indexing methods instead of standard Python list methods. The fundamental logic of identifying the anchor, the line, calculating the new position, and reconstructing the output remains the same.

*   The input grid is a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N), where N is the width.
*   The essential data is contained within the first (and only) row, which is a 1D NumPy array.
*   The anchor pixel (gray, 5) position remains unchanged between input and output.
*   The colored line segment (non-white, non-gray) retains its color and length.
*   The transformation shifts the line segment such that its rightmost pixel's index in the output is exactly one less than the anchor pixel's index.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: Shift a horizontal colored line within a 1D NumPy array to be immediately adjacent (left side) to a fixed gray pixel.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2 (represented as 1xN NumPy array)
  data_type: numpy.ndarray
  element_type: integer
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: colored_line
    type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    representation: sequence of identical integer values in the 1D array
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-gray (5) integer value (e.g., 7, 4, 2)
      length: variable (number of pixels in the segment)
    location:
      input: defined by start and end indices in the input array
      output: defined by shifted start and end indices in the output array
  - id: anchor_pixel
    type: single_pixel
    representation: specific integer value (5) at a specific index
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
    location:
      input: fixed index in the input array
      output: same fixed index as input in the output array

relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    object1: colored_line (rightmost pixel/index)
    object2: anchor_pixel (index)
    state:
      input: separated by one or more white (0) pixels (anchor index > line end index + 1)
      output: immediately adjacent (line end index == anchor index - 1)

actions:
  - type: horizontal_shift (array slice manipulation)
    target: colored_line
    parameters:
      direction: right (implied by index calculation)
      magnitude: calculated to achieve adjacency (anchor_index - 1 - original_line_end_index)
    constraints:
      - anchor_pixel remains stationary.
      - colored_line color and length remain constant.
      - background remains white.
      - operations are performed on NumPy arrays.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Input**: Receive a 2D NumPy array representing the grid (shape 1xN). Extract the first row (the 1D array of pixel values).
2.  **Identify Anchor**: Find the index (column position) of the gray pixel (value 5) in the 1D input array. Store this `anchor_index`.
3.  **Identify Line**:
    *   Find all indices where the pixel value is not white (0) and not gray (5).
    *   Determine the color of the line (the value at the first such index).
    *   Identify the starting index (`line_start_index`) as the minimum of these indices.
    *   Identify the ending index (`line_end_index`) as the maximum of these indices.
    *   Calculate the `line_length` (`line_end_index - line_start_index + 1`).
4.  **Calculate New Position**:
    *   Determine the target ending index for the line in the output array: `target_end_index = anchor_index - 1`.
    *   Determine the new starting index for the line: `new_start_index = target_end_index - line_length + 1`.
5.  **Construct Output**:
    *   Create a new 1D NumPy array of the same length as the input row, filled with the background color (white, 0).
    *   Place the anchor pixel (gray, 5) at the `anchor_index` in the new array.
    *   Fill the segment of the new array from `new_start_index` to `target_end_index` (inclusive) with the identified `line_color`.
6.  **Finalize**: Reshape the resulting 1D array back into a 2D array (shape 1xN) to match the required output format.
