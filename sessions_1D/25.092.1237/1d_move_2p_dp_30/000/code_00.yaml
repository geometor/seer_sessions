task_description: Shift a colored block horizontally while keeping a gray pixel fixed.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - object_type: colored_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels with the same color.
    properties:
      color: Any color except 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
      count: Exactly one per grid.
      shape: Horizontal line segment.
    actions:
      - action_type: horizontal_shift
        direction: right
        magnitude: 2 positions
  - object_type: fixed_pixel
    description: A single stationary pixel.
    properties:
      color: 5 (gray)
      count: Exactly one per grid.
    actions:
      - action_type: remain_stationary
relationships:
  - The colored_block moves independently of the fixed_pixel.
transformation_rule:
  - Identify the colored_block (non-white, non-gray).
  - Identify the position of the fixed_pixel (gray).
  - Create an output grid of the same size, filled with the background_color (white).
  - Place the fixed_pixel in the output grid at its original position.
  - Place the colored_block in the output grid, shifted 2 positions to the right from its original starting position.
