Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
2.  **Colors:** The grids contain white (0), gray (5), and one other color (green (3), red (2), or blue (1) in the examples).
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a color other than white or gray.
    *   There is always a single gray pixel (5).
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).
4.  **Transformation:** The key observation is the movement of the colored block.
    *   In `train_1`, the green block `3 3 3` moves from indices 3-5 to 5-7 (a shift of +2). The gray pixel at index 8 stays put.
    *   In `train_2`, the red block `2 2 2` moves from indices 0-2 to 2-4 (a shift of +2). The gray pixel at index 5 stays put.
    *   In `train_3`, the blue block `1 1 1 1 1 1` moves from indices 3-8 to 5-10 (a shift of +2). The gray pixel at index 11 stays put.
5.  **Rule:** The contiguous block of non-white, non-gray color shifts exactly two positions to the right. The single gray pixel remains in its original position. The background remains white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored block horizontally while keeping a gray pixel fixed.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - object_type: colored_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels with the same color.
    properties:
      color: Any color except 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
      count: Exactly one per grid.
      shape: Horizontal line segment.
    actions:
      - action_type: horizontal_shift
        direction: right
        magnitude: 2 positions
  - object_type: fixed_pixel
    description: A single stationary pixel.
    properties:
      color: 5 (gray)
      count: Exactly one per grid.
    actions:
      - action_type: remain_stationary
relationships:
  - The colored_block moves independently of the fixed_pixel.
transformation_rule:
  - Identify the colored_block (non-white, non-gray).
  - Identify the position of the fixed_pixel (gray).
  - Create an output grid of the same size, filled with the background_color (white).
  - Place the fixed_pixel in the output grid at its original position.
  - Place the colored_block in the output grid, shifted 2 positions to the right from its original starting position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find the starting index, ending index, and the sequence of colors of the contiguous block of pixels whose color is not white (0) and not gray (5).
3.  Iterate through the input grid to find the index of the gray (5) pixel.
4.  Place the gray (5) pixel into the output grid at the index found in step 3.
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block by adding 2 to its original starting index found in step 2.
6.  Place the sequence of colors of the colored block (found in step 2) into the output grid, starting at the new index calculated in step 5.
7.  Return the final output grid.
