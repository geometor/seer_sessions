The gray pixel at index 8 stays put.\n    *   In `train_2`, the red block `2 2 2` moves from indices 0-2 to 2-4 (a shift of +2). The gray pixel at index 5 stays put.\n    *   In `train_3`, the blue block `1 1 1 1 1 1` moves from indices 3-8 to 5-10 (a shift of +2). The gray pixel at index 11 stays put.\n5.  **Rule:** The contiguous block of non-white, non-gray color shifts exactly two positions to the right. The single gray pixel remains in its original position. The background remains white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
