            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core components (Main Block, Separator, Marker) and the fundamental action (swapping the Main Block and Separator). However, the provided code execution results indicate that the implementation failed to apply this transformation, returning the original input instead for all training examples. This strongly suggests that the pattern detection logic within the code (specifically, identifying the sequence of Main Block -> Separator -> Marker according to the defined rules) did not successfully match the input patterns, leading to an early exit before the transformation could be applied.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the pattern definition and implementation details:\n1.  Confirm the exact definition and relative positioning of the Marker, Separator, and Main Block.\n2.  Verify the constraints on the colors and contiguity for each component.\n3.  Ensure the identification of Leading and Trailing Background segments is correct.\n4.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts to be precise and unambiguous based on *all* training examples.\n5.  The core transformation logic (concatenating Leading BG + Separator + Main Block + Marker + Trailing BG) seems sound and consistent with the examples, assuming the components are correctly identified. The focus should be on robustly identifying these components.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's re-examine each example to confirm the pattern:\n\n*   **train\\_1:**\n    *   Input: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (len 25)\n    *   Marker (1): Index 18\n    *   Separator (0, 0): Indices 16, 17\n    *   Main Block (2s): Indices 0-15 (Color 2, Length 16)\n    *   Leading BG (0s): Indices < 0 (Empty)\n    *   Trailing BG (0s): Indices 19-24 (Length 6)\n    *   Output Construction: `[] + [0, 0] + [2]*16 + [1] + [0]*6` -> `[0, 0, 2, ..., 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected output)\n\n*   **train\\_2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (len 25)\n    *   Marker (1): Index 13\n    *   Separator (0, 0): Indices 11, 12\n    *   Main Block (7s): Indices 4-10 (Color 7, Length 7)\n    *   Leading BG (0s): Indices 0-3 (Length 4)\n    *   Trailing BG (0s): Indices 14-24 (Length 11)\n    *   Output Construction: `[0]*4 + [0, 0] + [7]*7 + [1] + [0]*11` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, ..., 7, 1, 0, ..., 0]` (Matches expected output)\n\n*   **train\\_3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]` (len 25)\n    *   Marker (1): Index 23\n    *   Separator (0, 0): Indices 21, 22\n    *   Main Block (8s): Indices 1-20 (Color 8, Length 20)\n    *   Leading BG (0s): Index 0 (Length 1)\n    *   Trailing BG (0s): Index 24 (Length 1)\n    *   Output Construction: `[0] + [0, 0] + [8]*20 + [1] + [0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 8, ..., 8, 1, 0]` (Matches expected output)\n\nThe pattern `[Leading BG] + [Main Block] + [Separator] + [Marker] + [Trailing BG]` consistently describes the input structure, and the transformation `[Leading BG] + [Separator] + [Main Block] + [Marker] + [Trailing BG]` consistently produces the output structure. The failure was likely in the code's pattern detection, not the conceptual understanding.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If not found, the pattern is invalid.\n2.  **Identify the Separator:** Check the two pixels immediately preceding the Marker's index. If they are not both white pixels (value 0), or if the Marker is too close to the start (index < 2), the pattern is invalid. Record the Separator sequence (`[0, 0]`) and its start index.\n3.  **Identify the Main Block:** Look at the pixel immediately preceding the Separator's start index.\n    *   Verify its color is not white (0) and not blue (1). If it is, the pattern is invalid.\n    *   Determine the contiguous sequence of this same color extending backwards from this position. This sequence is the Main Block. Record its content (color and length) and its start index. If no such block exists immediately before the Separator, the pattern is invalid.\n4.  **Identify Leading Background:** Extract the sequence of pixels from the beginning of the row up to (but not including) the Main Block's start index. This is the Leading Background (it might be empty).\n5.  **Identify Trailing Background:** Extract the sequence of pixels from the position immediately after the Marker's index to the end of the row. This is the Trailing Background (it might be empty).\n6.  **Construct the Output:** Create the output row by concatenating the identified components in the following order:\n    a.
