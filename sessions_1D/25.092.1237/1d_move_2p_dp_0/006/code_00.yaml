Grid:
  Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  Content: Pixels represented by integers 0-9.

Pattern_Components:
  - Component: Marker
    Identifier: The single blue pixel (value 1).
    Cardinality: Exactly one per grid.
  - Component: Separator
    Identifier: Two adjacent white pixels (value 0).
    Position: Must occur immediately before the Marker pixel.
    Cardinality: Exactly one instance, defined by its relation to the Marker.
  - Component: Main_Block
    Identifier: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of the same color.
    Constraints:
      - Color must NOT be white (0) or blue (1).
      - Must occur immediately before the Separator sequence.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per grid, defined by its relation to the Separator.
  - Component: Leading_Background
    Identifier: A (potentially empty) sequence of pixels.
    Constraints:
      - Comprises all pixels from the start of the grid up to the start of the Main_Block.
      - Expected to contain only white pixels (0) based on examples.
  - Component: Trailing_Background
    Identifier: A (potentially empty) sequence of pixels.
    Constraints:
      - Comprises all pixels from the position immediately after the Marker to the end of the grid.
      - Expected to contain only white pixels (0) based on examples.

Input_Structure:
  Arrangement: Leading_Background + Main_Block + Separator + Marker + Trailing_Background

Transformation_Rule:
  Action: Reorder components.
  Output_Structure: Leading_Background + Separator + Main_Block + Marker + Trailing_Background
  Invariance:
    - The content (pixels) of each identified component (Leading BG, Main Block, Separator, Marker, Trailing BG) is preserved.
    - The relative order of Leading BG, Marker, and Trailing BG is preserved.
    - The absolute positions of Leading BG start, Marker, and Trailing BG end relative to the grid boundaries are preserved.
  Change:
    - The Main Block and Separator swap their positions relative to each other and the surrounding components.
