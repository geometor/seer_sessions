Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

Each task example consists of a single row (1D grid) of pixels.
The key elements appear to be:
1.  A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (red in train_1, orange in train_2, azure in train_3). Let's call this the "main colored block".
2.  Immediately following this main colored block, there are always exactly two white pixels.
3.  Immediately following these two white pixels, there is always a single blue pixel.
4.  The rest of the pixels in the row are white. These can appear before the main colored block and/or after the blue pixel.

The transformation seems to involve rearranging the positions of the main colored block and the two white pixels that follow it. Specifically, the main colored block moves two positions to the right, and the two white pixels shift to occupy the two positions immediately preceding the new location of the main colored block. The blue pixel and all other white pixels (those initially before the main block and those after the blue pixel) remain in their original absolute positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Content: Pixels with colors (0-9)

Objects:
  - Type: Main_Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except white (0) and blue (1)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal segment
      - Variable: Color, Length, Start_Position
  - Type: Separator
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal segment
      - Fixed: Length (always 2 pixels)
      - Position: Immediately follows Main_Block
  - Type: Marker
    Properties:
      - Color: Blue (1)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Fixed: Color
      - Position: Immediately follows Separator
  - Type: Background
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Pixels or contiguous segments
      - Position: Can be before Main_Block and/or after Marker

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Main_Block -> Separator -> Marker are directly adjacent in sequence in the input.

Transformation:
  - Action: Positional Swap
    - Target1: Main_Block
    - Target2: Separator
    - Rule: The sequence [Main_Block, Separator] in the input becomes [Separator, Main_Block] in the output.
  - Invariance:
    - Background pixels before the original Main_Block maintain their absolute positions.
    - Marker pixel maintains its absolute position.
    - Background pixels after the Marker maintain their absolute positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single blue pixel (the "Marker"). Note its position.
2.  Identify the two white pixels immediately preceding the Marker (the "Separator").
3.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-blue pixels immediately preceding the Separator (the "Main Block"). Note its color, length, and starting position.
4.  Identify any white pixels preceding the Main Block ("Leading Background") and any white pixels following the Marker ("Trailing Background").
5.  Construct the output row by concatenating the following elements in order:
    a. The Leading Background pixels (if any).
    b. The Separator (two white pixels).
    c. The Main Block (using its original color and length).
    d. The Marker (the blue pixel).
    e. The Trailing Background pixels (if any).
    The resulting row is the output grid.
```python
"""
Identifies a sequence of [Main Block, Separator, Marker] in the input row,
where the Marker is a single blue pixel (1), the Separator is two adjacent
white pixels (0, 0), and the Main Block is a contiguous sequence of identical
pixels (neither white nor blue) preceding the Separator. The transformation
swaps the position of the Main Block and the Separator, keeping all other
pixels (leading white background, the marker, and trailing white background)
in their original absolute positions relative to the grid boundaries.

1. Find the index of the blue pixel (Marker, value 1).
2. Identify the two pixels immediately before the Marker; these are the Separator (value 0, 0).
3. Identify the contiguous block of identical, non-white, non-blue pixels immediately before the Separator; this is the Main Block.
4. Identify any white pixels before the Main Block (Leading Background).
5. Identify any white pixels after the Marker (Trailing Background).
6. Construct the output row by concatenating: Leading Background, Separator, Main Block, Marker, Trailing Background.

**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt correctly identified the core components (Main Block, Separator, Marker) and the fundamental action (swapping the Main Block and Separator). However, the provided code execution results indicate that the implementation failed to apply this transformation, returning the original input instead for all training examples. This strongly suggests that the pattern detection logic within the code (specifically, identifying the sequence of Main Block -> Separator -> Marker according to the defined rules) did not successfully match the input patterns, leading to an early exit before the transformation could be applied.

The strategy is to re-evaluate the pattern definition and implementation details:
1.  Confirm the exact definition and relative positioning of the Marker, Separator, and Main Block.
2.  Verify the constraints on the colors and contiguity for each component.
3.  Ensure the identification of Leading and Trailing Background segments is correct.
4.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts to be precise and unambiguous based on *all* training examples.
5.  The core transformation logic (concatenating Leading BG + Separator + Main Block + Marker + Trailing BG) seems sound and consistent with the examples, assuming the components are correctly identified. The focus should be on robustly identifying these components.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's re-examine each example to confirm the pattern:

*   **train\_1:**
    *   Input: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (len 25)
    *   Marker (1): Index 18
    *   Separator (0, 0): Indices 16, 17
    *   Main Block (2s): Indices 0-15 (Color 2, Length 16)
    *   Leading BG (0s): Indices < 0 (Empty)
    *   Trailing BG (0s): Indices 19-24 (Length 6)
    *   Output Construction: `[] + [0, 0] + [2]*16 + [1] + [0]*6` -> `[0, 0, 2, ..., 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected output)

*   **train\_2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (len 25)
    *   Marker (1): Index 13
    *   Separator (0, 0): Indices 11, 12
    *   Main Block (7s): Indices 4-10 (Color 7, Length 7)
    *   Leading BG (0s): Indices 0-3 (Length 4)
    *   Trailing BG (0s): Indices 14-24 (Length 11)
    *   Output Construction: `[0]*4 + [0, 0] + [7]*7 + [1] + [0]*11` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, ..., 7, 1, 0, ..., 0]` (Matches expected output)

*   **train\_3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]` (len 25)
    *   Marker (1): Index 23
    *   Separator (0, 0): Indices 21, 22
    *   Main Block (8s): Indices 1-20 (Color 8, Length 20)
    *   Leading BG (0s): Index 0 (Length 1)
    *   Trailing BG (0s): Index 24 (Length 1)
    *   Output Construction: `[0] + [0, 0] + [8]*20 + [1] + [0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 8, ..., 8, 1, 0]` (Matches expected output)

The pattern `[Leading BG] + [Main Block] + [Separator] + [Marker] + [Trailing BG]` consistently describes the input structure, and the transformation `[Leading BG] + [Separator] + [Main Block] + [Marker] + [Trailing BG]` consistently produces the output structure. The failure was likely in the code's pattern detection, not the conceptual understanding.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  Content: Pixels represented by integers 0-9.

Pattern_Components:
  - Component: Marker
    Identifier: The single blue pixel (value 1).
    Cardinality: Exactly one per grid.
  - Component: Separator
    Identifier: Two adjacent white pixels (value 0).
    Position: Must occur immediately before the Marker pixel.
    Cardinality: Exactly one instance, defined by its relation to the Marker.
  - Component: Main_Block
    Identifier: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of the same color.
    Constraints:
      - Color must NOT be white (0) or blue (1).
      - Must occur immediately before the Separator sequence.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per grid, defined by its relation to the Separator.
  - Component: Leading_Background
    Identifier: A (potentially empty) sequence of pixels.
    Constraints:
      - Comprises all pixels from the start of the grid up to the start of the Main_Block.
      - Expected to contain only white pixels (0) based on examples.
  - Component: Trailing_Background
    Identifier: A (potentially empty) sequence of pixels.
    Constraints:
      - Comprises all pixels from the position immediately after the Marker to the end of the grid.
      - Expected to contain only white pixels (0) based on examples.

Input_Structure:
  Arrangement: Leading_Background + Main_Block + Separator + Marker + Trailing_Background

Transformation_Rule:
  Action: Reorder components.
  Output_Structure: Leading_Background + Separator + Main_Block + Marker + Trailing_Background
  Invariance:
    - The content (pixels) of each identified component (Leading BG, Main Block, Separator, Marker, Trailing BG) is preserved.
    - The relative order of Leading BG, Marker, and Trailing BG is preserved.
    - The absolute positions of Leading BG start, Marker, and Trailing BG end relative to the grid boundaries are preserved.
  Change:
    - The Main Block and Separator swap their positions relative to each other and the surrounding components.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Marker:** Scan the input row to find the index of the single blue pixel (value 1). If not found, the pattern is invalid.
2.  **Identify the Separator:** Check the two pixels immediately preceding the Marker's index. If they are not both white pixels (value 0), or if the Marker is too close to the start (index < 2), the pattern is invalid. Record the Separator sequence (`[0, 0]`) and its start index.
3.  **Identify the Main Block:** Look at the pixel immediately preceding the Separator's start index.
    *   Verify its color is not white (0) and not blue (1). If it is, the pattern is invalid.
    *   Determine the contiguous sequence of this same color extending backwards from this position. This sequence is the Main Block. Record its content (color and length) and its start index. If no such block exists immediately before the Separator, the pattern is invalid.
4.  **Identify Leading Background:** Extract the sequence of pixels from the beginning of the row up to (but not including) the Main Block's start index. This is the Leading Background (it might be empty).
5.  **Identify Trailing Background:** Extract the sequence of pixels from the position immediately after the Marker's index to the end of the row. This is the Trailing Background (it might be empty).
6.  **Construct the Output:** Create the output row by concatenating the identified components in the following order:
    a. Leading Background
    b. Separator (`[0, 0]`)
    c. Main Block (content recorded in step 3)
    d. Marker (`[1]`)
    e. Trailing Background
7.  **Return Result:** Return the newly constructed row. If the pattern was deemed invalid at any step, return the original input row unchanged.
