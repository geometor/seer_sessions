Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Content: Pixels with colors (0-9)

Objects:
  - Type: Main_Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except white (0) and blue (1)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal segment
      - Variable: Color, Length, Start_Position
  - Type: Separator
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal segment
      - Fixed: Length (always 2 pixels)
      - Position: Immediately follows Main_Block
  - Type: Marker
    Properties:
      - Color: Blue (1)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Fixed: Color
      - Position: Immediately follows Separator
  - Type: Background
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Pixels or contiguous segments
      - Position: Can be before Main_Block and/or after Marker

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Main_Block -> Separator -> Marker are directly adjacent in sequence in the input.

Transformation:
  - Action: Positional Swap
    - Target1: Main_Block
    - Target2: Separator
    - Rule: The sequence [Main_Block, Separator] in the input becomes [Separator, Main_Block] in the output.
  - Invariance:
    - Background pixels before the original Main_Block maintain their absolute positions.
    - Marker pixel maintains its absolute position.
    - Background pixels after the Marker maintain their absolute positions.
