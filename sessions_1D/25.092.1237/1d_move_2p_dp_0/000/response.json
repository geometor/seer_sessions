            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nEach task example consists of a single row (1D grid) of pixels.\nThe key elements appear to be:\n1.  A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (red in train_1, orange in train_2, azure in train_3). Let's call this the \"main colored block\".\n2.  Immediately following this main colored block, there are always exactly two white pixels.\n3.  Immediately following these two white pixels, there is always a single blue pixel.\n4.  The rest of the pixels in the row are white. These can appear before the main colored block and/or after the blue pixel.\n\nThe transformation seems to involve rearranging the positions of the main colored block and the two white pixels that follow it. Specifically, the main colored block moves two positions to the right, and the two white pixels shift to occupy the two positions immediately preceding the new location of the main colored block. The blue pixel and all other white pixels (those initially before the main block and those after the blue pixel) remain in their original absolute positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
