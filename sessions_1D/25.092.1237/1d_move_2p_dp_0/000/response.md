Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

Each task example consists of a single row (1D grid) of pixels.
The key elements appear to be:
1.  A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (red in train_1, orange in train_2, azure in train_3). Let's call this the "main colored block".
2.  Immediately following this main colored block, there are always exactly two white pixels.
3.  Immediately following these two white pixels, there is always a single blue pixel.
4.  The rest of the pixels in the row are white. These can appear before the main colored block and/or after the blue pixel.

The transformation seems to involve rearranging the positions of the main colored block and the two white pixels that follow it. Specifically, the main colored block moves two positions to the right, and the two white pixels shift to occupy the two positions immediately preceding the new location of the main colored block. The blue pixel and all other white pixels (those initially before the main block and those after the blue pixel) remain in their original absolute positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Content: Pixels with colors (0-9)

Objects:
  - Type: Main_Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except white (0) and blue (1)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal segment
      - Variable: Color, Length, Start_Position
  - Type: Separator
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal segment
      - Fixed: Length (always 2 pixels)
      - Position: Immediately follows Main_Block
  - Type: Marker
    Properties:
      - Color: Blue (1)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Fixed: Color
      - Position: Immediately follows Separator
  - Type: Background
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Pixels or contiguous segments
      - Position: Can be before Main_Block and/or after Marker

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Main_Block -> Separator -> Marker are directly adjacent in sequence in the input.

Transformation:
  - Action: Positional Swap
    - Target1: Main_Block
    - Target2: Separator
    - Rule: The sequence [Main_Block, Separator] in the input becomes [Separator, Main_Block] in the output.
  - Invariance:
    - Background pixels before the original Main_Block maintain their absolute positions.
    - Marker pixel maintains its absolute position.
    - Background pixels after the Marker maintain their absolute positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single blue pixel (the "Marker"). Note its position.
2.  Identify the two white pixels immediately preceding the Marker (the "Separator").
3.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-blue pixels immediately preceding the Separator (the "Main Block"). Note its color, length, and starting position.
4.  Identify any white pixels preceding the Main Block ("Leading Background") and any white pixels following the Marker ("Trailing Background").
5.  Construct the output row by concatenating the following elements in order:
    a. The Leading Background pixels (if any).
    b. The Separator (two white pixels).
    c. The Main Block (using its original color and length).
    d. The Marker (the blue pixel).
    e. The Trailing Background pixels (if any).
    The resulting row is the output grid.
