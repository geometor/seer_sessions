Input_Type: 1D grid (list of integers)
Output_Type: 1D grid (list of integers) of the same size as input

Pattern_Elements:
  - Name: Marker
    Type: Object
    Properties:
      - Color: Blue (1)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Uniqueness: Assumed unique in the row
  - Name: Separator
    Type: Object
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal segment
      - Fixed_Length: 2 pixels
      - Relative_Position: Located immediately to the left (before) the Marker.
  - Name: Main_Block
    Type: Object
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except White(0) and Blue(1)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal segment of uniform color
      - Variable_Length: Yes
      - Relative_Position: Located immediately to the left (before) the Separator.
  - Name: Leading_Background
    Type: Object/Area
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal segment (can be empty)
      - Relative_Position: Located from the start of the grid up to the Main_Block.
  - Name: Trailing_Background
    Type: Object/Area
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Contiguous horizontal segment (can be empty)
      - Relative_Position: Located from the position after the Marker to the end of the grid.

Input_Structure:
  - Concatenation: [Leading_Background, Main_Block, Separator, Marker, Trailing_Background]

Transformation_Rule:
  - Action: Rearrangement / Swapping
  - Target_Elements: Main_Block, Separator
  - Invariant_Elements: Leading_Background, Marker, Trailing_Background
  - Output_Structure:
      - Concatenation: [Leading_Background, Separator, Main_Block, Marker, Trailing_Background]
  - Constraint: The transformation applies only if the complete input structure/pattern is found. Otherwise, the input is returned unchanged (implied failure mode).
