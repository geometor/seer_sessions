Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Content: Pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.

Objects:
  - Type: Main_Block
    Description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except white (0) and blue (1).
      - Shape: Horizontal segment.
      - Variable: Color, Length, Position depend on the specific example.
  - Type: Separator
    Description: Two adjacent white pixels immediately following the Main_Block.
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0).
      - Shape: Horizontal segment.
      - Fixed: Length (always 2 pixels).
      - Position: Immediately follows Main_Block in the input.
  - Type: Marker
    Description: A single blue pixel immediately following the Separator.
    Properties:
      - Color: Blue (1).
      - Shape: Single pixel.
      - Fixed: Color (always blue).
      - Position: Immediately follows Separator in the input.
  - Type: Background
    Description: White pixels not part of the Separator.
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0).
      - Shape: Zero or more individual pixels or contiguous segments.
      - Position: Can appear before the Main_Block (Leading Background) and/or after the Marker (Trailing Background).

Relationships_Input:
  - Adjacency: Elements appear in the sequence [Leading Background (optional)], [Main_Block], [Separator], [Marker], [Trailing Background (optional)].

Transformation:
  - Action: Swap Adjacent Objects
    - Object1: Main_Block
    - Object2: Separator
    - Rule: The relative order of the Main_Block and the Separator is reversed in the output.
    - Invariance: The position and content of the Leading Background, Marker, and Trailing Background remain unchanged relative to the grid boundaries.

Relationships_Output:
  - Adjacency: Elements appear in the sequence [Leading Background (optional)], [Separator], [Main_Block], [Marker], [Trailing Background (optional)].
