            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a simple cyclic shift by 2 positions was incorrect. The provided code consistently failed, producing outputs that differed from the expected outputs by exactly 2 pixels in each case, although the overall size and color counts were correct.\n\nThe key observation from analyzing the failures is the special role of the blue pixel (`1`). In all examples, the blue pixel's *absolute position* remains unchanged from input to output. The transformation seems to involve moving the two pixels immediately to the *left* of the blue pixel to the very beginning of the sequence. The remaining pixels (excluding the blue pixel and the two moved pixels) effectively shift right by two positions to accommodate the inserted pixels at the start.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Verify the location of the blue pixel (`1`) in all examples.\n2.  Verify that the two pixels immediately to the left of the blue pixel in the input correspond to the first two pixels in the output.\n3.  Refine the natural language program and the corresponding transformation logic based on this new understanding.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's gather specific data points for each example to confirm the hypothesis.\n"
