Task: Selective Pixel Relocation

Input_Features:
  - A single row (1D array) of pixels.
  - Pixel values range from 0 to 9, representing colors.
  - The row contains exactly one blue pixel (value 1).
  - The blue pixel is always located at an index of 2 or greater (based on examples).

Output_Features:
  - A single row of pixels with the same length as the input row.
  - Contains the same pixels (colors and counts) as the input row, but rearranged.

Identified_Objects:
  - Reference_Pixel: The blue pixel (value 1).
  - Pixels_To_Move: The two pixels immediately to the left of the Reference_Pixel in the input row.
  - Remaining_Pixels: All other pixels in the input row (excluding Pixels_To_Move and the Reference_Pixel).

Transformation_Details:
  - Action: Relocation and Shifting.
  - Step_1_Locate: Find the index (`blue_idx`) of the blue pixel (1) in the input row.
  - Step_2_Identify: Identify the two pixels at indices `blue_idx - 2` and `blue_idx - 1`.
  - Step_3_Extract: Conceptually remove these two pixels from the input row.
  - Step_4_Construct_Output:
    - Place the two extracted pixels at the beginning of the output row (indices 0 and 1).
    - Append all pixels from the input row that were originally to the *left* of the two extracted pixels.
    - Append all pixels from the input row that were originally *between* the extracted pixels and the blue pixel (this segment is empty in this specific rule).
    - Append the blue pixel itself.
    - Append all pixels from the input row that were originally to the *right* of the blue pixel.
  - Invariant: The absolute position (index) of the blue pixel remains unchanged from input to output.

Relationships:
  - The output is a permutation of the input row.
  - The first two pixels of the output row are determined by the two pixels immediately preceding the blue pixel in the input row.
  - The blue pixel acts as a fixed anchor point around which other pixels are rearranged.
