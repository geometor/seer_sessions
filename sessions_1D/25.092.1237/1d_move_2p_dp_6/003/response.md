Transforms the input grid row based on the position of the blue pixel (1).
The transformation involves moving the two pixels immediately to the left of the blue pixel 
to the very beginning of the row. The rest of the pixels are arranged such that 
the blue pixel maintains its original absolute index in the output row.
