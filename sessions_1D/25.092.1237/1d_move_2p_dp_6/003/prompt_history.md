## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a single row of pixels. Each example shows a one-dimensional array of colored pixels. The key elements are:

1.  **Input Grid:** A single row (1D array) of pixels with varying colors.
2.  **Output Grid:** A single row of pixels of the same length as the input.
3.  **Transformation:** The arrangement of pixels changes from input to output, but the set of colors and their counts remain the same. The transformation appears to be a positional shift of the entire sequence of pixels. Specifically, it looks like a rotation or cyclic shift.

By comparing the input and output in each example, it becomes clear that the entire row of pixels is shifted two positions to the right. Pixels shifted off the right end wrap around to the beginning of the row.

*   **Example 1:** `[2, 2, ..., 0, 0]` shifts right by 2 to become `[0, 0, 2, 2, ...]`.
*   **Example 2:** `[..., 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]` shifts right by 2 to become `[0, 0, ..., 5, 5, 0, 0, 1]`. The last two elements `[0, 0]` wrap around to the beginning. Oh, wait, that's not right. Let's re-examine.
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]` (length 17)
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0]` (length 17)
    *   Comparing elements:
        *   `input[0]` moves to `output[2]`
        *   `input[1]` moves to `output[3]`
        *   ...
        *   `input[15]` moves to `output[0]` (wrap around)
        *   `input[16]` moves to `output[1]` (wrap around)
    *   This confirms a cyclic shift right by 2 positions.
*   **Example 3:** `[0, 8, ..., 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` shifts right by 2 to become `[0, 0, 0, 8, ..., 0, 0, 1]`. The last two elements `[0, 0]` wrap around.
    *   Input: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (length 17)
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (length 17)
    *   Comparing elements:
        *   `input[0]` moves to `output[2]`
        *   ...
        *   `input[15]` moves to `output[0]`
        *   `input[16]` moves to `output[1]`
    *   This also confirms a cyclic shift right by 2 positions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Determine the length (number of pixels) of the input row.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length.
4.  For each pixel in the input row at index `i` (from 0 to length-1):
    a. Calculate the new index `j` by adding 2 to `i`.
    b. Apply the modulo operator with the row length to handle wrap-around: `j = (i + 2) % length`.
    c. Place the pixel from the input row at index `i` into the output row at index `j`.
5.  The newly constructed row is the final output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial hypothesis of a simple cyclic shift by 2 positions was incorrect. The provided code consistently failed, producing outputs that differed from the expected outputs by exactly 2 pixels in each case, although the overall size and color counts were correct.

The key observation from analyzing the failures is the special role of the blue pixel (`1`). In all examples, the blue pixel's *absolute position* remains unchanged from input to output. The transformation seems to involve moving the two pixels immediately to the *left* of the blue pixel to the very beginning of the sequence. The remaining pixels (excluding the blue pixel and the two moved pixels) effectively shift right by two positions to accommodate the inserted pixels at the start.

**Strategy:**
1.  Verify the location of the blue pixel (`1`) in all examples.
2.  Verify that the two pixels immediately to the left of the blue pixel in the input correspond to the first two pixels in the output.
3.  Refine the natural language program and the corresponding transformation logic based on this new understanding.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's gather specific data points for each example to confirm the hypothesis.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Selective Pixel Relocation

Input_Features:
  - A single row (1D array) of pixels.
  - Pixel values range from 0 to 9, representing colors.
  - The row contains exactly one blue pixel (value 1).
  - The blue pixel is always located at an index of 2 or greater (based on examples).

Output_Features:
  - A single row of pixels with the same length as the input row.
  - Contains the same pixels (colors and counts) as the input row, but rearranged.

Identified_Objects:
  - Reference_Pixel: The blue pixel (value 1).
  - Pixels_To_Move: The two pixels immediately to the left of the Reference_Pixel in the input row.
  - Remaining_Pixels: All other pixels in the input row (excluding Pixels_To_Move and the Reference_Pixel).

Transformation_Details:
  - Action: Relocation and Shifting.
  - Step_1_Locate: Find the index (`blue_idx`) of the blue pixel (1) in the input row.
  - Step_2_Identify: Identify the two pixels at indices `blue_idx - 2` and `blue_idx - 1`.
  - Step_3_Extract: Conceptually remove these two pixels from the input row.
  - Step_4_Construct_Output:
    - Place the two extracted pixels at the beginning of the output row (indices 0 and 1).
    - Append all pixels from the input row that were originally to the *left* of the two extracted pixels.
    - Append all pixels from the input row that were originally *between* the extracted pixels and the blue pixel (this segment is empty in this specific rule).
    - Append the blue pixel itself.
    - Append all pixels from the input row that were originally to the *right* of the blue pixel.
  - Invariant: The absolute position (index) of the blue pixel remains unchanged from input to output.

Relationships:
  - The output is a permutation of the input row.
  - The first two pixels of the output row are determined by the two pixels immediately preceding the blue pixel in the input row.
  - The blue pixel acts as a fixed anchor point around which other pixels are rearranged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Find the index of the unique blue pixel (value 1) within the input row. Let this index be `blue_idx`.
3.  Identify the two pixels located at indices `blue_idx - 2` and `blue_idx - 1`. Store these two pixels; these are the `moved_pixels`.
4.  Create a new list representing the intermediate state of the row by removing the `moved_pixels` from the input row. The blue pixel and all pixels to its right will shift left by two positions in this intermediate list, while pixels to the left of `moved_pixels` remain in place.
5.  Construct the final output row by concatenating the `moved_pixels` list (containing the two pixels from step 3) with the intermediate list created in step 4.
6.  The resulting row is the final output grid.
