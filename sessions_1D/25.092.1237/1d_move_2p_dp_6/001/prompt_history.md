## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a single row of pixels. Each example shows a one-dimensional array of colored pixels. The key elements are:

1.  **Input Grid:** A single row (1D array) of pixels with varying colors.
2.  **Output Grid:** A single row of pixels of the same length as the input.
3.  **Transformation:** The arrangement of pixels changes from input to output, but the set of colors and their counts remain the same. The transformation appears to be a positional shift of the entire sequence of pixels. Specifically, it looks like a rotation or cyclic shift.

By comparing the input and output in each example, it becomes clear that the entire row of pixels is shifted two positions to the right. Pixels shifted off the right end wrap around to the beginning of the row.

*   **Example 1:** `[2, 2, ..., 0, 0]` shifts right by 2 to become `[0, 0, 2, 2, ...]`.
*   **Example 2:** `[..., 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]` shifts right by 2 to become `[0, 0, ..., 5, 5, 0, 0, 1]`. The last two elements `[0, 0]` wrap around to the beginning. Oh, wait, that's not right. Let's re-examine.
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]` (length 17)
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0]` (length 17)
    *   Comparing elements:
        *   `input[0]` moves to `output[2]`
        *   `input[1]` moves to `output[3]`
        *   ...
        *   `input[15]` moves to `output[0]` (wrap around)
        *   `input[16]` moves to `output[1]` (wrap around)
    *   This confirms a cyclic shift right by 2 positions.
*   **Example 3:** `[0, 8, ..., 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` shifts right by 2 to become `[0, 0, 0, 8, ..., 0, 0, 1]`. The last two elements `[0, 0]` wrap around.
    *   Input: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (length 17)
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (length 17)
    *   Comparing elements:
        *   `input[0]` moves to `output[2]`
        *   ...
        *   `input[15]` moves to `output[0]`
        *   `input[16]` moves to `output[1]`
    *   This also confirms a cyclic shift right by 2 positions.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation

Input_Features:
  - A single row (1D array) of pixels.
  - Pixel values range from 0 to 9, representing colors.
  - Row length can vary.

Output_Features:
  - A single row of pixels with the same length as the input row.
  - Contains the same pixels (colors and counts) as the input row.

Transformation_Details:
  - Type: Positional Shift
  - Nature: Cyclic (Wrap-around)
  - Direction: Right
  - Magnitude: 2 positions
  - Elements_Affected: All pixels in the row are shifted simultaneously.

Relationships:
  - The output is a permutation of the input row.
  - The position of each pixel `p` at index `i` in the input moves to index `(i + 2) % length` in the output, where `length` is the number of pixels in the row.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Determine the length (number of pixels) of the input row.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length.
4.  For each pixel in the input row at index `i` (from 0 to length-1):
    a. Calculate the new index `j` by adding 2 to `i`.
    b. Apply the modulo operator with the row length to handle wrap-around: `j = (i + 2) % length`.
    c. Place the pixel from the input row at index `i` into the output row at index `j`.
5.  The newly constructed row is the final output grid.
