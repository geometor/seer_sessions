Task: Segment Reordering in a Pixel Row

Input_Features:
  - Object: A single row (1D array) of pixels.
  - Properties: Contains pixels of various colors (0-9). Includes at least one blue pixel (1). The blue pixel's index is always >= 2.
  - Structure: The row can be conceptually divided into four segments based on the blue pixel's position.

Output_Features:
  - Object: A single row of pixels.
  - Properties: Same length and same set of pixels (colors and counts) as the input row.
  - Structure: A reordering of the input row's segments.

Identified_Objects_And_Properties:
  - Input Row: The single list of integers provided as input.
  - Blue Pixel (1): A specific pixel value used as a reference point. Always present and located at index 2 or greater.
  - Preceding Pair: The two pixels located at indices `blue_idx - 2` and `blue_idx - 1` relative to the blue pixel's index (`blue_idx`) in the input row.
  - Initial Segment: The sequence of pixels from the start of the input row (index 0) up to, but not including, the Preceding Pair (indices 0 to `blue_idx - 3`). This segment can be empty if `blue_idx` is 2.
  - Final Segment: The sequence of pixels from the position immediately after the blue pixel (`blue_idx + 1`) to the end of the input row.

Actions_On_Objects:
  - Find: Locate the index (`blue_idx`) of the first occurrence of the blue pixel (1) in the input row.
  - Extract: Identify and isolate the four key segments: Preceding Pair, Initial Segment, Blue Pixel, Final Segment.
  - Concatenate: Assemble the output row by joining the extracted segments in a new order: [Preceding Pair] + [Initial Segment] + [Blue Pixel] + [Final Segment].

Relationships:
  - The length of the output row is equal to the length of the input row.
  - The index of the blue pixel (1) is the same in the output row as in the input row.
  - The output row is a permutation of the input row, constructed by rearranging specific segments defined relative to the blue pixel.
