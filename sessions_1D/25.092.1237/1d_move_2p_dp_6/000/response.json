            "text": "## Perception of Elements\n\nThe task involves transforming a single row of pixels. Each example shows a one-dimensional array of colored pixels. The key elements are:\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** A single row (1D array) of pixels with varying colors.\n2.  **Output Grid:** A single row of pixels of the same length as the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The arrangement of pixels changes from input to output, but the set of colors and their counts remain the same. The transformation appears to be a positional shift of the entire sequence of pixels. Specifically, it looks like a rotation or cyclic shift.\n\nBy comparing the input and output in each example, it becomes clear that the entire row of pixels is shifted two positions to the right. Pixels shifted off the right end wrap around to the beginning of the row.\n\n*   **Example 1:** `[2, 2, ..., 0, 0]` shifts right by 2 to become `[0, 0, 2, 2, ...]`.\n*   **Example 2:** `[..., 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]` shifts right by 2 to become `[0, 0, ..., 5, 5, 0, 0, 1]`. The last two elements `[0, 0]` wrap around to the beginning. Oh, wait, that's not right. Let's re-examine.\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]` (length 17)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0]` (length 17)\n    *   Comparing elements:\n        *   `input[0]` moves to `output[2]`\n        *   `input[1]` moves to `output[3]`\n        *   ...\n        *   `input[15]` moves to `output[0]` (wrap around)\n        *   `input[16]` moves to `output[1]` (wrap around)\n    *   This confirms a cyclic shift right by 2 positions.\n*   **Example 3:** `[0, 8, ..., 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` shifts right by 2 to become `[0, 0, 0, 8, ..., 0, 0, 1]`. The last two elements `[0, 0]` wrap around.\n    *   Input: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (length 17)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (length 17)\n    *   Comparing elements:\n        *   `input[0]` moves to `output[2]`\n        *   ...\n        *   `input[15]` moves to `output[0]`\n        *   `input[16]` moves to `output[1]`\n    *   This also confirms a cyclic shift right by 2 positions.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
