Task: Grid Transformation

Input_Features:
  - A single row (1D array) of pixels.
  - Pixel values range from 0 to 9, representing colors.
  - Row length can vary.

Output_Features:
  - A single row of pixels with the same length as the input row.
  - Contains the same pixels (colors and counts) as the input row.

Transformation_Details:
  - Type: Positional Shift
  - Nature: Cyclic (Wrap-around)
  - Direction: Right
  - Magnitude: 2 positions
  - Elements_Affected: All pixels in the row are shifted simultaneously.

Relationships:
  - The output is a permutation of the input row.
  - The position of each pixel `p` at index `i` in the input moves to index `(i + 2) % length` in the output, where `length` is the number of pixels in the row.
