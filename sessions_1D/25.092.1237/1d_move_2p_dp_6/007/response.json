The segment originally before these two pixels is placed \nafter them. The blue pixel and the segment following it retain their relative order after the initial segment.\nSpecifically, the output row is formed by concatenating:\n1. The two pixels immediately preceding the blue pixel in the input.\n2. The segment of pixels from the start of the input row up to the two preceding pixels.\n3. The blue pixel itself.\n4. The segment of pixels following the blue pixel in the input row.\nThe absolute index of the blue pixel remains unchanged from input to output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_pixel_index(row, pixel_value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the first occurrence of pixel_value in the row.\n\n    Args:\n        row (np.array): The row to search within.\n        pixel_value (int): The pixel value to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the pixel_value, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # np.where returns a tuple of arrays; we need the first element of the first array\n        # which contains the indices where the value matches.
