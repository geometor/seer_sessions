"""
Transforms the input grid row by reordering segments based on the position of the blue pixel (1).
The transformation involves identifying the blue pixel, taking the two pixels immediately to its left, 
and moving them to the beginning of the row. The segment originally before these two pixels is placed 
after them. The blue pixel and the segment following it retain their relative order after the initial segment.
Specifically, the output row is formed by concatenating:
1. The two pixels immediately preceding the blue pixel in the input.
2. The segment of pixels from the start of the input row up to the two preceding pixels.
3. The blue pixel itself.
4. The segment of pixels following the blue pixel in the input row.
The absolute index of the blue pixel remains unchanged from input to output.
