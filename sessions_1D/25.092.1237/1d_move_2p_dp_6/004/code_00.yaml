Task: Row Segment Reordering Based on Blue Pixel

Input_Features:
  - A single row (1D array) of pixels.
  - Contains exactly one blue pixel (value 1).
  - The blue pixel's index is always >= 2 in the training examples.

Output_Features:
  - A single row of pixels with the same length and same multiset of pixels as the input.
  - The pixel arrangement is altered based on the input blue pixel's position.

Key_Objects_And_Properties:
  - Blue_Pixel: The pixel with value 1. Its index in the input row is critical.
  - Preceding_Pair: The two pixels immediately to the left of the Blue_Pixel in the input row.
  - Initial_Segment: The contiguous block of pixels from the start of the input row up to (but not including) the Preceding_Pair.
  - Final_Segment: The contiguous block of pixels from the position immediately after the Blue_Pixel to the end of the input row.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identification: Locate the index (`blue_idx`) of the Blue_Pixel (1) in the input row.
  - Segmentation: Divide the input row into four parts relative to `blue_idx`:
    1. Initial_Segment: `input[0 : blue_idx - 2]`
    2. Preceding_Pair: `input[blue_idx - 2 : blue_idx]`
    3. Blue_Pixel: `input[blue_idx]`
    4. Final_Segment: `input[blue_idx + 1 :]`
  - Reordering: Construct the output row by concatenating these segments in a new order:
    `[Preceding_Pair] + [Initial_Segment] + [Blue_Pixel] + [Final_Segment]`
  - Position_Invariance: The absolute index of the Blue_Pixel remains the same in the output row as it was in the input row (`blue_idx`).

Assumptions:
  - The input row always contains exactly one blue pixel (1).
  - The index of the blue pixel is always 2 or greater.
