The output grid always has the same dimensions (length) as the input grid.\n2.  **Key Pixel:** The Maroon (9) pixel plays a critical role as a marker or pivot point within the row.\n3.  **Associated Pixels:** The two pixels immediately preceding the Maroon pixel seem intrinsically linked to the transformation. In all training examples, these are White (0) pixels.\n4.  **Segments:** The input row can be conceptually divided into three segments based on the Maroon pixel and its two preceding pixels:\n    *   The segment *before* the two preceding pixels (Prefix).\n    *   The two pixels *immediately preceding* the Maroon pixel (Pivot Precursors).\n    *   The segment *starting from* the Maroon pixel to the end (Suffix).\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves rearranging these segments. The Pivot Precursors move to the very beginning of the output row, followed by the original Prefix segment, and finally the original Suffix segment. The relative order of pixels within the Prefix and Suffix segments is maintained.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
