task_description: Rearrange segments of a 1D row based on the position of a specific marker pixel (Maroon).
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
persistent_elements:
  - All pixels from the input are present in the output.
  - The length of the row remains constant.
key_objects:
  - marker_pixel:
      color: Maroon (9)
      role: Defines segmentation points.
  - pivot_precursors:
      count: 2
      location: Pixels immediately preceding the marker_pixel.
      color: White (0) in examples, potentially variable.
      role: Become the start of the output row.
  - prefix_segment:
      location: All pixels from the start of the row up to (but not including) the pivot_precursors.
      role: Moved after pivot_precursors in the output.
  - suffix_segment:
      location: All pixels from the marker_pixel to the end of the row.
      role: Appended after the prefix_segment in the output.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the index of the marker_pixel (Maroon, 9).
  - segment: Divide the input row into three parts based on the marker_pixel's index:
      1. Pixels at index `marker_index - 2` and `marker_index - 1` (pivot_precursors).
      2. Pixels from index 0 to `marker_index - 3` (prefix_segment).
      3. Pixels from index `marker_index` to the end (suffix_segment).
  - rearrange: Construct the output row by concatenating:
      1. pivot_precursors
      2. prefix_segment
      3. suffix_segment
relationships:
  - positional: The transformation depends entirely on the position of the Maroon pixel.
  - sequential: The relative order of pixels within the prefix and suffix segments is preserved during rearrangement.
