task_description: Rearrange segments of a 1xN input grid based on the position of a specific marker pixel (Maroon, 9).
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1xN grid, i.e., a list containing one list).
persistent_elements:
  - All pixels from the input row are present in the output row.
  - The dimensions of the grid (1xN) remain constant.
key_objects:
  - marker_pixel:
      color: Maroon (9)
      role: Defines segmentation points within the single row. Must exist and not be at index 0 or 1.
  - pivot_precursors:
      count: 2
      location: Pixels at indices `marker_index - 2` and `marker_index - 1` relative to the marker_pixel in the input row.
      color: White (0) in observed examples, but the logic applies regardless of color.
      role: These two pixels become the start of the output row.
  - prefix_segment:
      location: All pixels from the start of the input row (index 0) up to index `marker_index - 3`. Can be empty if `marker_index` is 2.
      role: Moved to follow the pivot_precursors in the output row. Order preserved.
  - suffix_segment:
      location: All pixels from the marker_pixel (index `marker_index`) to the end of the input row.
      role: Appended after the prefix_segment in the output row. Order preserved.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the index (`marker_index`) of the marker_pixel (Maroon, 9) in the input row.
  - validate: Ensure `marker_index` is >= 2. If not, the transformation rule might not apply (consider returning input or error).
  - extract: Isolate the `pivot_precursors`, `prefix_segment`, and `suffix_segment` based on `marker_index`.
  - rearrange: Construct the output row by concatenating: `pivot_precursors` + `prefix_segment` + `suffix_segment`.
  - format: Ensure the output is returned as a 1xN grid (list containing the single output row).
relationships:
  - positional: The transformation logic is entirely dependent on the position of the Maroon pixel.
  - sequential: The relative order of pixels within the prefix and suffix segments is preserved during rearrangement.
