"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (row) by rearranging segments based on the position of a Maroon (9) pixel.

1. Finds the index `m` of the Maroon (9) pixel.
2. Identifies the two pixels immediately preceding the Maroon pixel (at indices `m-2` and `m-1`) as `pivot_precursors`.
3. Identifies the pixels from the start of the row up to index `m-3` as the `prefix_segment`.
4. Identifies the pixels from the Maroon pixel (index `m`) to the end of the row as the `suffix_segment`.
5. Constructs the output row by concatenating `pivot_precursors`, `prefix_segment`, and `suffix_segment` in that order.
