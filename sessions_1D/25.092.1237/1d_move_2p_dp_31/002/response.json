The function was designed to accept a `List[List[int]]` (representing a grid, even if it's just 1xN), while the error suggests the input might have been provided as a flat list or string during testing.\n\nThe core logic derived previously (identifying the Maroon pixel, segmenting the row based on its position and the two preceding pixels, and rearranging these segments) appears sound based on the visual inspection of the examples. The strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input/output format assumption (1xN grids).\n2.  Verify the segmentation and rearrangement logic programmatically against all examples using the correct data format.\n3.  Update the documentation (YAML, Natural Language Program) to be precise about the 1xN grid format.\n4.  The Python code itself seems logically correct based on the natural language description and should work once the input format issue is resolved in the testing environment.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's verify the segmentation and concatenation logic for each example using the correct `List[List[int]]` format.\n"
