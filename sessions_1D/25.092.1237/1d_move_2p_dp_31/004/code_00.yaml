task_description: Rearrange segments of a 1D row based on the position of a specific marker pixel (Maroon, 9).
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
persistent_elements:
  - All pixels from the input are present in the output, rearranged.
  - The length of the row remains constant.
key_objects:
  - marker_pixel:
      color: Maroon (9)
      role: Defines the primary segmentation point.
  - pivot_elements:
      count: 2
      location: The two pixels immediately preceding the marker_pixel (at indices m-2 and m-1, where m is the marker_pixel index).
      color: White (0) in all observed examples.
      role: These two pixels are moved to become the start of the output row.
  - prefix_segment:
      location: All pixels from the start of the row up to (but not including) the pivot_elements (indices 0 to m-3). Can be empty if m=2.
      role: This segment is placed immediately after the pivot_elements in the output row.
  - suffix_segment:
      location: All pixels from the marker_pixel to the end of the row (indices m to end).
      role: This segment is placed immediately after the prefix_segment in the output row.
actions:
  - locate: Find the index `m` of the first Maroon (9) pixel in the input row.
  - verify: Check if `m` is at least 2. If not, the transformation rule (as observed) cannot apply. (Considered an edge case or invalid input for this pattern).
  - extract_pivot: Identify the two pixels at indices `m-2` and `m-1`.
  - extract_prefix: Identify the pixels from index 0 up to `m-3`.
  - extract_suffix: Identify the pixels from index `m` to the end.
  - construct_output: Create the new row by concatenating the segments in the order: [extract_pivot] + [extract_prefix] + [extract_suffix].
relationships:
  - positional: The entire transformation hinges on the index `m` of the Maroon pixel.
  - sequential: The relative order of pixels *within* the prefix_segment and *within* the suffix_segment is preserved in the output.
