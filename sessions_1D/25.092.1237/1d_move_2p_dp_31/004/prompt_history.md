**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The task operates on single-row grids (1xN). The output grid always has the same dimensions (length) as the input grid.
2.  **Key Pixel:** The Maroon (9) pixel plays a critical role as a marker or pivot point within the row.
3.  **Associated Pixels:** The two pixels immediately preceding the Maroon pixel seem intrinsically linked to the transformation. In all training examples, these are White (0) pixels.
4.  **Segments:** The input row can be conceptually divided into three segments based on the Maroon pixel and its two preceding pixels:
    *   The segment *before* the two preceding pixels (Prefix).
    *   The two pixels *immediately preceding* the Maroon pixel (Pivot Precursors).
    *   The segment *starting from* the Maroon pixel to the end (Suffix).
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves rearranging these segments. The Pivot Precursors move to the very beginning of the output row, followed by the original Prefix segment, and finally the original Suffix segment. The relative order of pixels within the Prefix and Suffix segments is maintained.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange segments of a 1D row based on the position of a specific marker pixel (Maroon).
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
persistent_elements:
  - All pixels from the input are present in the output.
  - The length of the row remains constant.
key_objects:
  - marker_pixel:
      color: Maroon (9)
      role: Defines segmentation points.
  - pivot_precursors:
      count: 2
      location: Pixels immediately preceding the marker_pixel.
      color: White (0) in examples, potentially variable.
      role: Become the start of the output row.
  - prefix_segment:
      location: All pixels from the start of the row up to (but not including) the pivot_precursors.
      role: Moved after pivot_precursors in the output.
  - suffix_segment:
      location: All pixels from the marker_pixel to the end of the row.
      role: Appended after the prefix_segment in the output.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the index of the marker_pixel (Maroon, 9).
  - segment: Divide the input row into three parts based on the marker_pixel's index:
      1. Pixels at index `marker_index - 2` and `marker_index - 1` (pivot_precursors).
      2. Pixels from index 0 to `marker_index - 3` (prefix_segment).
      3. Pixels from index `marker_index` to the end (suffix_segment).
  - rearrange: Construct the output row by concatenating:
      1. pivot_precursors
      2. prefix_segment
      3. suffix_segment
relationships:
  - positional: The transformation depends entirely on the position of the Maroon pixel.
  - sequential: The relative order of pixels within the prefix and suffix segments is preserved during rearrangement.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input row.
2.  Find the index (position) of the Maroon (9) pixel within the row. Let this index be `m`.
3.  Identify the two pixels located at indices `m-2` and `m-1`. Store these two pixels as the `pivot_precursors`.
4.  Identify the sequence of pixels from the beginning of the row up to index `m-3`. Store this sequence as the `prefix_segment`. If `m` is less than 2, this segment might be empty.
5.  Identify the sequence of pixels starting from index `m` to the end of the row. Store this sequence as the `suffix_segment`.
6.  Construct the output row by concatenating the `pivot_precursors`, followed by the `prefix_segment`, followed by the `suffix_segment` in that order.
7.  Return the newly constructed output row.
