## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as single rows (1-dimensional grids).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color. Each input contains one contiguous block of a non-white, non-yellow color (magenta '6', red '2', or azure '8') and a single yellow ('4') pixel.
3.  **Key Objects:**
    *   **Background:** White pixels (0).
    *   **Movable Block:** A contiguous sequence of identical non-white, non-yellow pixels.
    *   **Marker Pixel:** A single yellow pixel (4).
4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation observed is a spatial shift.
    *   The "Movable Block" consistently shifts two positions to the right in the output grid compared to its position in the input grid.
    *   The "Marker Pixel" (yellow) remains in the exact same position (index) in the output grid as it was in the input grid.
    *   The background pixels (white) fill the remaining space, including the positions originally occupied by the shifted block.
5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three examples, involving different colors and lengths for the movable block and different positions for both the block and the marker.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the single yellow pixel (color 4) in the input grid and note its position (index).
3.  Place the yellow pixel at the exact same position (index) in the output grid.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not yellow (4). Note its color, length, and starting position (index).
5.  Calculate the new starting position for this block by adding 2 to its original starting position.
6.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new position. Ensure this placement overwrites any background pixels but respects the already placed yellow pixel if overlap occurs (although examples suggest no overlap happens). *Correction: Based on the examples, the yellow pixel seems to take precedence or the shift doesn't cause overlap. Let's refine: Place the yellow pixel first. Then, place the shifted block.*
7.  The output grid, now containing the stationary yellow pixel, the right-shifted block, and the background white pixels, is the final result.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The core issue arises from the mismatch between the data structure assumed by the previous `transform` function (a 1D list) and the actual data structure used in ARC tasks (typically 2D NumPy arrays, even if they represent a single row or column). The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms this, as NumPy arrays don't evaluate to a single boolean value in standard `if` conditions.

The strategy is to:
1.  Adapt the perception and implementation to handle 2D grids (NumPy arrays).
2.  Re-evaluate the object identification and transformation logic within the 2D context. Although the examples are effectively 1D, treating them as 1xN grids ensures compatibility with the ARC framework.
3.  Refine the helper functions and the main transform function to use 2D indexing (row, column).

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Dimensionality:** All inputs and outputs are 1x15 grids.
*   **Yellow Pixel:** The yellow pixel (color 4) is present in each input and maintains its exact (row, column) coordinates in the output.
    *   Example 1: (0, 12) -> (0, 12)
    *   Example 2: (0, 6) -> (0, 6)
    *   Example 3: (0, 8) -> (0, 8)
*   **Movable Block:** A single contiguous block of a non-white, non-yellow color exists in each input.
    *   Example 1: Color 6 (magenta), columns 6-9.
    *   Example 2: Color 2 (red), columns 1-3.
    *   Example 3: Color 8 (azure), columns 1-5.
*   **Transformation:** The movable block shifts exactly 2 columns to the right. The row index remains constant (0).
    *   Example 1: Columns 6-9 shift to 8-11 (Start column: 6 -> 8, shift = +2).
    *   Example 2: Columns 1-3 shift to 3-5 (Start column: 1 -> 3, shift = +2).
    *   Example 3: Columns 1-5 shift to 3-7 (Start column: 1 -> 3, shift = +2).
*   **Background:** White pixels (color 0) fill all other positions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept a 2D input grid (NumPy array).
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of the single yellow pixel (color 4) in the input grid.
4.  Place the yellow pixel (color 4) at the *same* (row, column) coordinates in the output grid.
5.  Iterate through the first row of the input grid to find the contiguous horizontal block of pixels whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* yellow (4). Record its color, its starting column index, and its ending column index (and thus its length).
6.  Calculate the new starting column index for this block by adding 2 to its original starting column index.
7.  Iterate from the new starting column index for the length of the block. For each column index in this range:
    a. Check if the column index is within the bounds of the grid's width.
    b. If it is within bounds, set the pixel at (row 0, calculated column index) in the *output* grid to the recorded color of the block. (This overwrites the initial background color).
8.  Return the completed output grid.
