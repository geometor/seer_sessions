## General Assessment

The core issue arises from the mismatch between the data structure assumed by the previous `transform` function (a 1D list) and the actual data structure used in ARC tasks (typically 2D NumPy arrays, even if they represent a single row or column). The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms this, as NumPy arrays don't evaluate to a single boolean value in standard `if` conditions.

The strategy is to:
1.  Adapt the perception and implementation to handle 2D grids (NumPy arrays).
2.  Re-evaluate the object identification and transformation logic within the 2D context. Although the examples are effectively 1D, treating them as 1xN grids ensures compatibility with the ARC framework.
3.  Refine the helper functions and the main transform function to use 2D indexing (row, column).

## Metrics and Observations

Let's analyze the examples assuming they are 1xN 2D grids.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Define the examples as NumPy arrays
train_examples = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0]])
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

    }

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Dimensionality:** All inputs and outputs are 1x15 grids.
*   **Yellow Pixel:** The yellow pixel (color 4) is present in each input and maintains its exact (row, column) coordinates in the output.
    *   Example 1: (0, 12) -> (0, 12)
    *   Example 2: (0, 6) -> (0, 6)
    *   Example 3: (0, 8) -> (0, 8)
*   **Movable Block:** A single contiguous block of a non-white, non-yellow color exists in each input.
    *   Example 1: Color 6 (magenta), columns 6-9.
    *   Example 2: Color 2 (red), columns 1-3.
    *   Example 3: Color 8 (azure), columns 1-5.
*   **Transformation:** The movable block shifts exactly 2 columns to the right. The row index remains constant (0).
    *   Example 1: Columns 6-9 shift to 8-11 (Start column: 6 -> 8, shift = +2).
    *   Example 2: Columns 1-3 shift to 3-5 (Start column: 1 -> 3, shift = +2).
    *   Example 3: Columns 1-5 shift to 3-7 (Start column: 1 -> 3, shift = +2).
*   **Background:** White pixels (color 0) fill all other positions.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Identify a contiguous horizontal block of non-white, non-yellow color and a single yellow pixel in a 1xN input grid. Shift the block two columns to the right, keep the yellow pixel stationary, and fill the rest with white background in the output grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D (observed as 1xN)
  background_color: 0 (white)

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of pixels in the first row with the same color, excluding white (0) and yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: Any color except 0 or 4.
      - contiguous: Yes, horizontally.
      - count: 1 per grid.
      - location: Defined by start and end column indices in row 0.
    actions:
      - type: shift
        direction: right (positive column direction)
        distance: 2 columns
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with yellow color (4).
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - count: 1 per grid
      - location: Defined by a specific (row, column) coordinate.
    actions:
      - type: remain_stationary
        description: Stays in the same (row, column) coordinate from input to output.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels with white color (0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
    actions:
      - type: fill
        description: Occupies all grid positions not taken by the marker_pixel or the shifted movable_block in the final output grid.

relationships:
  - The movable_block and marker_pixel are distinct entities within the grid.
  - The final positions are determined independently: the marker_pixel's coordinate is fixed based on the input, and the movable_block's position is calculated relative to its input position (specifically, its starting column index).
  - All action occurs within the single row (row 0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept a 2D input grid (NumPy array).
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of the single yellow pixel (color 4) in the input grid.
4.  Place the yellow pixel (color 4) at the *same* (row, column) coordinates in the output grid.
5.  Iterate through the first row of the input grid to find the contiguous horizontal block of pixels whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* yellow (4). Record its color, its starting column index, and its ending column index (and thus its length).
6.  Calculate the new starting column index for this block by adding 2 to its original starting column index.
7.  Iterate from the new starting column index for the length of the block. For each column index in this range:
    a. Check if the column index is within the bounds of the grid's width.
    b. If it is within bounds, set the pixel at (row 0, calculated column index) in the *output* grid to the recorded color of the block. (This overwrites the initial background color).
8.  Return the completed output grid.
