Okay, analyzing the provided examples for the task `train_1`, `train_2`, and `train_3`.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as single rows (1-dimensional grids).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color. Each input contains one contiguous block of a non-white, non-yellow color (magenta '6', red '2', or azure '8') and a single yellow ('4') pixel.
3.  **Key Objects:**
    *   **Background:** White pixels (0).
    *   **Movable Block:** A contiguous sequence of identical non-white, non-yellow pixels.
    *   **Marker Pixel:** A single yellow pixel (4).
4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation observed is a spatial shift.
    *   The "Movable Block" consistently shifts two positions to the right in the output grid compared to its position in the input grid.
    *   The "Marker Pixel" (yellow) remains in the exact same position (index) in the output grid as it was in the input grid.
    *   The background pixels (white) fill the remaining space, including the positions originally occupied by the shifted block.
5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three examples, involving different colors and lengths for the movable block and different positions for both the block and the marker.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Identify a contiguous block of non-white, non-yellow color and a single yellow pixel in a 1D input grid, then shift the block two positions to the right while keeping the yellow pixel stationary in the output grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: 0 (white)

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of pixels with the same color, excluding white (0) and yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: Any color except 0 or 4.
      - contiguous: Yes
      - count: 1 per grid
    actions:
      - type: shift
        direction: right
        distance: 2 positions
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with yellow color (4).
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - count: 1 per grid
    actions:
      - type: remain_stationary
        description: Stays in the same absolute position (index) from input to output.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels with white color (0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
    actions:
      - type: fill
        description: Occupies all positions not taken by the marker_pixel or the shifted movable_block.

relationships:
  - The movable_block and marker_pixel are distinct entities within the grid.
  - The final positions are determined independently: the marker_pixel's position is fixed based on the input, and the movable_block's position is calculated relative to its input position.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the single yellow pixel (color 4) in the input grid and note its position (index).
3.  Place the yellow pixel at the exact same position (index) in the output grid.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not yellow (4). Note its color, length, and starting position (index).
5.  Calculate the new starting position for this block by adding 2 to its original starting position.
6.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new position. Ensure this placement overwrites any background pixels but respects the already placed yellow pixel if overlap occurs (although examples suggest no overlap happens). *Correction: Based on the examples, the yellow pixel seems to take precedence or the shift doesn't cause overlap. Let's refine: Place the yellow pixel first. Then, place the shifted block.*
7.  The output grid, now containing the stationary yellow pixel, the right-shifted block, and the background white pixels, is the final result.
