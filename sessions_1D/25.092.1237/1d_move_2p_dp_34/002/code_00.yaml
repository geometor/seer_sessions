task_description: Identify a contiguous horizontal block of non-white, non-yellow color and a single yellow pixel in a 1xN input grid. Shift the block two columns to the right, keep the yellow pixel stationary, and fill the rest with white background in the output grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D (observed as 1xN)
  background_color: 0 (white)

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of pixels in the first row with the same color, excluding white (0) and yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: Any color except 0 or 4.
      - contiguous: Yes, horizontally.
      - count: 1 per grid.
      - location: Defined by start and end column indices in row 0.
    actions:
      - type: shift
        direction: right (positive column direction)
        distance: 2 columns
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with yellow color (4).
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - count: 1 per grid
      - location: Defined by a specific (row, column) coordinate.
    actions:
      - type: remain_stationary
        description: Stays in the same (row, column) coordinate from input to output.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels with white color (0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
    actions:
      - type: fill
        description: Occupies all grid positions not taken by the marker_pixel or the shifted movable_block in the final output grid.

relationships:
  - The movable_block and marker_pixel are distinct entities within the grid.
  - The final positions are determined independently: the marker_pixel's coordinate is fixed based on the input, and the movable_block's position is calculated relative to its input position (specifically, its starting column index).
  - All action occurs within the single row (row 0).
