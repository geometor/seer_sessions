Each input contains one contiguous block of a non-white, non-yellow color (magenta '6', red '2', or azure '8') and a single yellow ('4') pixel.\n3.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** White pixels (0).\n    *   **Movable Block:** A contiguous sequence of identical non-white, non-yellow pixels.\n    *   **Marker Pixel:** A single yellow pixel (4).\n4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation observed is a spatial shift.\n    *   The \"Movable Block\" consistently shifts two positions to the right in the output grid compared to its position in the input grid.\n    *   The \"Marker Pixel\" (yellow) remains in the exact same position (index) in the output grid as it was in the input grid.\n    *   The background pixels (white) fill the remaining space, including the positions originally occupied by the shifted block.\n5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three examples, involving different colors and lengths for the movable block and different positions for both the block and the marker.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the single yellow pixel (color 4) in the input grid and note its position (index).\n3.  Place the yellow pixel at the exact same position (index) in the output grid.\n4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not yellow (4). Note its color, length, and starting position (index).\n5.  Calculate the new starting position for this block by adding 2 to its original starting position.\n6.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new position. Ensure this placement overwrites any background pixels but respects the already placed yellow pixel if overlap occurs (although examples suggest no overlap happens). *Correction: Based on the examples, the yellow pixel seems to take precedence or the shift doesn't cause overlap. Let's refine: Place the yellow pixel first. Then, place the shifted block.*\n7.  The output grid, now containing the stationary yellow pixel, the right-shifted block, and the background white pixels, is the final result."
