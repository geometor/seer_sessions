task_description: Identify a contiguous block of non-white, non-yellow color and a single yellow pixel in a 1D input grid, then shift the block two positions to the right while keeping the yellow pixel stationary in the output grid.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: 0 (white)

objects:
  - id: movable_block
    description: A contiguous block of pixels with the same color, excluding white (0) and yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: Any color except 0 or 4.
      - contiguous: Yes
      - count: 1 per grid
    actions:
      - type: shift
        direction: right
        distance: 2 positions
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with yellow color (4).
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - count: 1 per grid
    actions:
      - type: remain_stationary
        description: Stays in the same absolute position (index) from input to output.
  - id: background
    description: Pixels with white color (0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
    actions:
      - type: fill
        description: Occupies all positions not taken by the marker_pixel or the shifted movable_block.

relationships:
  - The movable_block and marker_pixel are distinct entities within the grid.
  - The final positions are determined independently: the marker_pixel's position is fixed based on the input, and the movable_block's position is calculated relative to its input position.
