"""
Identifies four segments in the input 1D sequence: 
1. `prefix`: Pixels before the first contiguous block of non-white(0)/non-blue(1) color.
2. `main_block`: The first contiguous block of identical pixels with a color other than white(0) or blue(1).
3. `white_pair`: The first occurrence of the sequence [0, 0] (two adjacent white pixels).
4. `suffix`: Pixels after the `white_pair`.

The transformation swaps the positions of `main_block` and `white_pair`.
The output sequence is constructed by concatenating: `prefix`, `white_pair`, `main_block`, `suffix`.
