The previous code assumed the input was a 1D list.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input data structure (likely a 1xN 2D NumPy array based on the visual representation).\n2.  Modify the object identification and transformation logic to operate on the single row contained within the 2D input array.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect this structure and the required row extraction step.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's examine the structure of the input data.\n"
