task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D NumPy array
  grid_dimensions: 1 row, variable columns (15 in examples)
  relevant_colors:
    - white: 0
    - blue: 1
    - main_block_colors: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # Non-white, non-blue

identified_objects:
  - object: data_row
    description: The single row of the input grid containing all relevant pixels.
    source: Input grid[0]
  - object: main_block
    description: Located within the data_row. A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not white(0) or blue(1). Assumed to be the first such block encountered.
    properties: [color, length, start_index, end_index]
    count_per_example: 1
  - object: white_pair
    description: Located within the data_row. A contiguous sequence of exactly two white (0) pixels, i.e., [0, 0]. Assumed to be the first such pair encountered.
    properties: [start_index, end_index]
    count_per_example: 1
  - object: prefix
    description: Sequence of pixels in the data_row *before* the main_block. Can be empty.
  - object: suffix
    description: Sequence of pixels in the data_row *after* the white_pair. Contains the marker_pixel (blue 1).

relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency (input row)
    description: In all examples, the white_pair immediately follows the main_block. (main_block.end_index + 1 == white_pair.start_index)
  - type: transformation
    description: The data_row is segmented, and the main_block and white_pair segments swap positions. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, containing the rearranged row.

actions:
  - action: extract_row
    description: Get the first (and only) row from the input 2D NumPy array.
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [data_row]
  - action: segment_row
    description: Identify and extract the prefix, main_block, white_pair, and suffix sequences from the data_row.
    inputs: [data_row]
    outputs: [prefix, main_block, white_pair, suffix]
  - action: construct_output_row
    description: Concatenate the extracted segments in the order prefix, white_pair, main_block, suffix.
    inputs: [prefix, main_block, white_pair, suffix]
    concatenation_order: [prefix, white_pair, main_block, suffix]
    output: [output_row]
  - action: format_output_grid
    description: Create the final output grid (2D NumPy array) by placing the output_row as the single row.
    inputs: [output_row]
    outputs: [output_grid]
