            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format**: The examples are presented as 1D sequences of integers (colors). The length of the input sequence equals the length of the output sequence in all examples (length 15).\n2.  **Key Pixel Sequences**:\n    *   **Main Block**: Each input contains a contiguous block of identical pixels of a color that is *not* white (0) or blue (1). The color (azure '8', yellow '4', magenta '6') and length vary between examples.\n    *   **White Pair**: Each input contains exactly one instance of two adjacent white (0) pixels: `[0, 0]`.\n    *   **Marker Pixel**: Each input contains exactly one blue (1) pixel.\n    *   **Background/Other**: Other white (0) pixels exist, forming prefixes or parts of the suffix.\n3.  **Relative Positions (Input)**: In all provided examples, the `main_block` appears first, followed immediately by the `white_pair`, followed by the rest of the sequence containing the blue `marker_pixel`. There might be a white pixel prefix before the `main_block`.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of these identified sequences. The `main_block` shifts two positions to the right relative to its original starting position. The `white_pair` moves into the two positions immediately preceding the new location of the `main_block`. Elements before the original `main_block` (prefix) and elements after the `white_pair` (suffix) seem to maintain their relative order and content around this central swap.\n\n**Facts YAML**\n\n"
