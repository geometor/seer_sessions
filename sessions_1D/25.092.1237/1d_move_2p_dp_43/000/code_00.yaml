task_context:
  grid_representation: 1D sequence (single row)
  sequence_length: 15 (in examples)
  relevant_colors:
    - white: 0
    - blue: 1
    - main_block_colors: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # Non-white, non-blue

identified_objects:
  - object: main_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not 0 or 1.
    properties: [color, length, start_index]
    count_per_example: 1
  - object: white_pair
    description: A contiguous sequence of exactly two white (0) pixels, i.e., [0, 0].
    properties: [start_index]
    count_per_example: 1
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single blue (1) pixel.
    properties: [index]
    count_per_example: 1
  - object: prefix
    description: Sequence of pixels before the main_block. Can be empty.
  - object: suffix
    description: Sequence of pixels after the white_pair. Contains the marker_pixel.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency (input)
    description: In examples, white_pair immediately follows main_block. (main_block.end_index + 1 == white_pair.start_index)
  - type: transformation
    description: Input sequence is segmented and rearranged to form the output.

actions:
  - action: segment_input
    description: Identify and extract the prefix, main_block, white_pair, and suffix sequences from the input.
    inputs: [input_sequence]
    outputs: [prefix, main_block, white_pair, suffix]
  - action: construct_output
    description: Concatenate the extracted segments in a specific order.
    inputs: [prefix, main_block, white_pair, suffix]
    concatenation_order: [prefix, white_pair, main_block, suffix]
    output: [output_sequence]
