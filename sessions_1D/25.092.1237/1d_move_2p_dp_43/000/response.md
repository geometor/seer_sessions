Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Format**: The examples are presented as 1D sequences of integers (colors). The length of the input sequence equals the length of the output sequence in all examples (length 15).
2.  **Key Pixel Sequences**:
    *   **Main Block**: Each input contains a contiguous block of identical pixels of a color that is *not* white (0) or blue (1). The color (azure '8', yellow '4', magenta '6') and length vary between examples.
    *   **White Pair**: Each input contains exactly one instance of two adjacent white (0) pixels: `[0, 0]`.
    *   **Marker Pixel**: Each input contains exactly one blue (1) pixel.
    *   **Background/Other**: Other white (0) pixels exist, forming prefixes or parts of the suffix.
3.  **Relative Positions (Input)**: In all provided examples, the `main_block` appears first, followed immediately by the `white_pair`, followed by the rest of the sequence containing the blue `marker_pixel`. There might be a white pixel prefix before the `main_block`.
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of these identified sequences. The `main_block` shifts two positions to the right relative to its original starting position. The `white_pair` moves into the two positions immediately preceding the new location of the `main_block`. Elements before the original `main_block` (prefix) and elements after the `white_pair` (suffix) seem to maintain their relative order and content around this central swap.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Analyze the input sequence to identify four distinct, non-overlapping segments:
    a.  Find the contiguous block of identical pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1). Call this the `main_block`.
    b.  Find the contiguous sequence of two white pixels `[0, 0]`. Call this the `white_pair`.
    c.  Identify the sequence of pixels, if any, that appear *before* the `main_block`. Call this the `prefix`.
    d.  Identify the sequence of pixels that appear *after* the `white_pair`. Call this the `suffix`.
2.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating these four segments in the following order: `prefix`, `white_pair`, `main_block`, `suffix`.
3.  The resulting concatenated sequence is the final output.
