Identifies four segments in the row:\n    a. `prefix`: Pixels before the first contiguous block of non-white(0)/non-blue(1) color.\n    b. `main_block`: The first contiguous block of identical pixels with a color other than white(0) or blue(1).\n    c. `white_pair`: The first occurrence of the sequence [0, 0] (two adjacent white pixels).\n    d. `suffix`: Pixels after the `white_pair`.\n3. Swaps the positions of `main_block` and `white_pair`.\n4. Constructs the output row by concatenating: `prefix`, `white_pair`, `main_block`, `suffix`.\n5.
