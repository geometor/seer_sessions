Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Format**: The examples are presented as 1D sequences of integers (colors). The length of the input sequence equals the length of the output sequence in all examples (length 15).
2.  **Key Pixel Sequences**:
    *   **Main Block**: Each input contains a contiguous block of identical pixels of a color that is *not* white (0) or blue (1). The color (azure '8', yellow '4', magenta '6') and length vary between examples.
    *   **White Pair**: Each input contains exactly one instance of two adjacent white (0) pixels: `[0, 0]`.
    *   **Marker Pixel**: Each input contains exactly one blue (1) pixel.
    *   **Background/Other**: Other white (0) pixels exist, forming prefixes or parts of the suffix.
3.  **Relative Positions (Input)**: In all provided examples, the `main_block` appears first, followed immediately by the `white_pair`, followed by the rest of the sequence containing the blue `marker_pixel`. There might be a white pixel prefix before the `main_block`.
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of these identified sequences. The `main_block` shifts two positions to the right relative to its original starting position. The `white_pair` moves into the two positions immediately preceding the new location of the `main_block`. Elements before the original `main_block` (prefix) and elements after the `white_pair` (suffix) seem to maintain their relative order and content around this central swap.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Analyze the input sequence to identify four distinct, non-overlapping segments:
    a.  Find the contiguous block of identical pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1). Call this the `main_block`.
    b.  Find the contiguous sequence of two white pixels `[0, 0]`. Call this the `white_pair`.
    c.  Identify the sequence of pixels, if any, that appear *before* the `main_block`. Call this the `prefix`.
    d.  Identify the sequence of pixels that appear *after* the `white_pair`. Call this the `suffix`.
2.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating these four segments in the following order: `prefix`, `white_pair`, `main_block`, `suffix`.
3.  The resulting concatenated sequence is the final output.

## Example 3:

**Assessment and Strategy**

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" indicates that the input data is being treated as a multi-dimensional array (likely a 2D NumPy array representing the grid) where a single boolean value is expected (e.g., in an `if` condition). The previous code assumed the input was a 1D list.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input data structure (likely a 1xN 2D NumPy array based on the visual representation).
2.  Modify the object identification and transformation logic to operate on the single row contained within the 2D input array.
3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect this structure and the required row extraction step.

**Findings:**
*   The inputs and outputs are indeed 2D NumPy arrays with shape `(1, N)`, where N=15 in the examples.
*   The transformation operates entirely on the single row within the array.
*   The core logic of identifying the `prefix`, `main_block`, `white_pair`, and `suffix` segments and rearranging them as `prefix + white_pair + main_block + suffix` is correct, as manually verified for Example 1.
*   The error occurred because the previous code attempted to iterate over the 2D array directly instead of first extracting the single row.

task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D NumPy array
  grid_dimensions: 1 row, variable columns (15 in examples)
  relevant_colors:
    - white: 0
    - blue: 1
    - main_block_colors: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # Non-white, non-blue

identified_objects:
  - object: data_row
    description: The single row of the input grid containing all relevant pixels.
    source: Input grid[0]
  - object: main_block
    description: Located within the data_row. A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color C, where C is not white(0) or blue(1). Assumed to be the first such block encountered.
    properties: [color, length, start_index, end_index]
    count_per_example: 1
  - object: white_pair
    description: Located within the data_row. A contiguous sequence of exactly two white (0) pixels, i.e., [0, 0]. Assumed to be the first such pair encountered.
    properties: [start_index, end_index]
    count_per_example: 1
  - object: prefix
    description: Sequence of pixels in the data_row *before* the main_block. Can be empty.
  - object: suffix
    description: Sequence of pixels in the data_row *after* the white_pair. Contains the marker_pixel (blue 1).

relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency (input row)
    description: In all examples, the white_pair immediately follows the main_block. (main_block.end_index + 1 == white_pair.start_index)
  - type: transformation
    description: The data_row is segmented, and the main_block and white_pair segments swap positions. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, containing the rearranged row.

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Take the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array with shape `(1, N)`.
2.  Extract the single data row from the input grid (i.e., `input_grid[0]`).
3.  Analyze this `data_row` to identify four distinct, non-overlapping segments:
    a.  Find the first contiguous block of identical pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1). Call this the `main_block`.
    b.  Find the first contiguous sequence of exactly two white pixels `[0, 0]`. Call this the `white_pair`.
    c.  Identify the sequence of pixels, if any, that appear *before* the `main_block`. Call this the `prefix`.
    d.  Identify the sequence of pixels that appear *after* the `white_pair`. Call this the `suffix`.
4.  Construct the `output_row` by concatenating these four segments in the following order: `prefix`, `white_pair`, `main_block`, `suffix`.
5.  Create the final output grid by placing the `output_row` into a new 2D NumPy array with the same shape as the input grid `(1, N)`.
6.  Return the output grid.
