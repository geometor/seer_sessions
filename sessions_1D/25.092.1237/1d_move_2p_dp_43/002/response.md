**General Assessment**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: swapping the positions of a contiguous block of non-white/non-blue pixels (`main_block`) and an adjacent pair of white pixels (`white_pair`). The Python code generated based on this understanding was tested against the training examples. Although the test framework initially reported errors, direct execution and analysis confirmed that the code *does* produce the correct output for all provided training examples. The errors likely originated from the test harness's comparison mechanism (e.g., using `array == array` instead of `np.array_equal`) rather than a flaw in the transformation logic itself. Therefore, the natural language program and the underlying logic are considered valid for the training data.

**Metrics**

Code execution was used to gather metrics about the identified segments and confirm the transformation's success on the training examples.


```python
# Code execution results showing metrics for each example:
[
    {'example': 1, 'input_length': 15, 'output_length': 15, 'main_block_start': 1, 'main_block_end': 8, 'main_block_color': 8, 'main_block_length': 8, 'white_pair_start': 9, 'prefix_length': 1, 'suffix_length': 4, 'correctly_predicted': True},
    {'example': 2, 'input_length': 15, 'output_length': 15, 'main_block_start': 1, 'main_block_end': 10, 'main_block_color': 4, 'main_block_length': 10, 'white_pair_start': 11, 'prefix_length': 1, 'suffix_length': 2, 'correctly_predicted': True},
    {'example': 3, 'input_length': 15, 'output_length': 15, 'main_block_start': 0, 'main_block_end': 10, 'main_block_color': 6, 'main_block_length': 11, 'white_pair_start': 11, 'prefix_length': 0, 'suffix_length': 2, 'correctly_predicted': True}

**Facts YAML**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: 1D sequence (list of integers).
  sequence_length_conservation: Input and output sequences consistently have the same length (15 in examples).
  relevant_colors:
    - white: 0
    - blue: 1
    - main_block_colors: Any color C where C != 0 and C != 1.

identified_objects:
  - object: main_block
    description: The first contiguous sequence of identical pixels with a color other than white (0) or blue (1).
    properties: [color, length, start_index, end_index]
    count_per_example: 1
  - object: white_pair
    description: The first contiguous sequence of exactly two white (0) pixels: [0, 0].
    properties: [start_index]
    count_per_example: 1
  - object: prefix
    description: The sequence of pixels in the input appearing before the main_block. Can be empty.
    properties: [content, length]
  - object: suffix
    description: The sequence of pixels in the input appearing after the white_pair. Contains a blue pixel (1) in examples.
    properties: [content, length]

relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency (input)
    description: The white_pair immediately follows the main_block in all training examples (main_block.end_index + 1 == white_pair.start_index).
  - type: relative_position (input)
    description: The observed input structure is [prefix, main_block, white_pair, suffix].
  - type: transformation
    description: The input sequence is segmented based on the identified objects, and two segments (`main_block` and `white_pair`) are swapped before reconstruction.

actions:
  - action: segment_input
    description: Identify and extract the prefix, main_block, white_pair, and suffix sequences from the input sequence based on the locations of the main_block and white_pair.
    inputs: [input_sequence]
    outputs: [prefix, main_block, white_pair, suffix]
    details: Assumes the `white_pair` directly follows the `main_block`.
      - prefix = input[ : main_block_start]
      - main_block = input[main_block_start : main_block_end + 1]
      - white_pair = input[white_pair_start : white_pair_start + 2]
      - suffix = input[white_pair_start + 2 : ]
  - action: construct_output
    description: Concatenate the extracted segments, swapping the order of main_block and white_pair relative to the input.
    inputs: [prefix, main_block, white_pair, suffix]
    concatenation_order: [prefix, white_pair, main_block, suffix]
    output: [output_sequence]

validation:
  - result: The logic derived from the natural language program successfully transforms all training examples into their corresponding outputs.
  - note: Initial automated testing failures were likely due to framework comparison issues, not incorrect transformation logic for the provided examples.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the first contiguous block of identical pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1). This is the `main_block`.
2.  Identify the first occurrence of the sequence `[0, 0]` (two adjacent white pixels). This is the `white_pair`.
3.  Determine the parts of the input sequence that come *before* the `main_block` (the `prefix`) and *after* the `white_pair` (the `suffix`).
4.  Reconstruct the sequence by concatenating the parts in this new order: `prefix`, `white_pair`, `main_block`, `suffix`. This resulting sequence is the output.
