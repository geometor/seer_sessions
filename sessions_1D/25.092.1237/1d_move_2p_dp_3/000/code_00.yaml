task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: fills most of the array
  - type: object_sequence
    color: variable (non-white, non-green; e.g., red(2), orange(7), magenta(6))
    properties:
      - contiguous block of identical pixels
      - appears once per input
      - located to the left of the barrier
  - type: barrier
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - single pixel
      - appears once per input
      - located to the right of the object_sequence
  - type: gap
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - sequence of one or more pixels
      - located between the object_sequence and the barrier
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: object_sequence
    details: find the contiguous block of non-white, non-green pixels
  - action: identify
    target: barrier
    details: find the single green (3) pixel
  - action: identify
    target: gap
    details: find the white (0) pixels between the end of the object_sequence and the barrier
  - action: move
    target: object_sequence
    direction: right
    destination: immediately to the left of the barrier
  - action: move
    target: gap
    direction: left
    destination: fills the original starting position of the object_sequence relative to the gap size
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entity1: object_sequence
    entity2: barrier
    relation: object_sequence is always to the left of the barrier in the input.
  - type: spatial
    entity1: gap
    entity2: object_sequence
    entity3: barrier
    relation: gap is always located between the object_sequence and the barrier in the input.
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: object_sequence
    entity2: barrier
    relation: object_sequence becomes adjacent (left side) to the barrier in the output.
constraints:
  - The array is 1-dimensional.
  - There is exactly one object_sequence.
  - There is exactly one barrier pixel (green=3).
  - The object_sequence color is never white(0) or green(3).
