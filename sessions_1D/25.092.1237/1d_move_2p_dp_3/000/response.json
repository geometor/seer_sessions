The object sequence moves to the right, closing the gap between it and the barrier pixel. The white pixels that were originally in the gap seem to move to the left, filling the space previously occupied by the leftmost part of the object sequence. The relative positions of the barrier pixel and any white pixels before the object sequence or after the barrier pixel remain unchanged. It's like the object sequence \"slides\" right until it bumps into the green barrier, swapping places with the intervening white pixels.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
