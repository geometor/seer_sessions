```python
"""
Identifies a contiguous sequence of identical non-white(0), non-green(3) pixels (the 'object sequence') and a single green(3) pixel (the 'barrier') in a 1D input array.
Moves the object sequence immediately to the left of the barrier, shifting the white(0) pixels that were originally between them (the 'gap') to the position previously occupied by the start of the object sequence.
The relative order of pixels before the original object sequence position and after the barrier position remains unchanged.
