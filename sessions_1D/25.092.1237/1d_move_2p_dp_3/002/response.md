**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous attempt failed because it incorrectly assumed the input was a 1D list, while ARC tasks use 2D grids. The provided examples were likely flattened representations of these grids. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" arose because the code tried to apply list-based logic (like checking `if not object_info`) potentially on NumPy arrays or slices derived from a 2D structure, leading to boolean ambiguity.

The strategy is to:
1.  Treat the input as a 2D NumPy array.
2.  Identify the specific row within the 2D grid where the transformation needs to occur. This row will contain the characteristic pattern: a contiguous sequence of a single color (not white or green), followed by one or more white pixels (the gap), followed by a single green pixel (the barrier).
3.  Apply the previously defined 1D logic (find object, find barrier, find gap, rearrange segments) *only* to that specific row.
4.  Leave all other rows unchanged.
5.  Construct the output grid by combining the unchanged rows with the modified row.

**Metrics Gathering**

To confirm the 2D nature and dimensions, let's examine the inputs. We'll assume the provided flattened lists represent single rows within potentially larger, mostly white grids, or that the grid itself is just that single row. The code execution will help determine the actual structure passed to the function.

Let's analyze the structure of the first training example assuming it's a single row for now.

```
The metrics confirm the 1D logic holds for the rows provided: an object sequence (non-white/green) is followed by a gap of white pixels, which is followed by a green barrier pixel. The transformation swaps the object sequence and the gap. The examples provided likely represent the single active row within a larger 2D grid, or the entire grid is just 1xN. Assuming the more general case of finding the active row in a 2D grid seems safer.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index.
3.  For the current row, attempt to identify the following components in left-to-right order:
    a.  Find the first contiguous horizontal sequence of identical pixels whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* green (3). This is the "object sequence". If found, record its start and end column index and its color.
    b.  Find the index of the first green (3) pixel located *after* the end of the object sequence in the same row. This is the "barrier index".
    c.  If both an object sequence and a subsequent barrier index are found in the current row:
        i.  Define the "gap" as the sequence of pixels between the end of the object sequence and the barrier index.
        ii. Check if all pixels in the gap are white (0).
        iii. If all conditions (object sequence found, barrier found after object, gap is all white) are met, then this row is the "target row". Stop searching and record the index of this target row.
4.  If a target row was identified:
    a.  Extract the segments of the target row:
        *   `prefix`: Pixels from the start of the row up to (but not including) the object sequence's start column.
        *   `object_seq`: Pixels of the object sequence itself.
        *   `gap_seq`: Pixels of the gap sequence.
        *   `barrier_pixel`: The single green (3) pixel at the barrier index.
        *   `suffix`: Pixels from the column after the barrier index to the end of the row.
    b.  Construct the `modified_row` by concatenating these segments in the new order: `prefix` + `gap_seq` + `object_seq` + `barrier_pixel` + `suffix`.
    c.  Replace the corresponding row in the output grid (which was initially a copy of the input) with the `modified_row`.
5.  Return the output grid. If no target row matching all criteria was found, the original input grid (copied in step 1) is returned unchanged.
