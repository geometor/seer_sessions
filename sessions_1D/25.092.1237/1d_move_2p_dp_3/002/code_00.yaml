task_type: grid_manipulation_2d
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 2D
  - background_color: white (0) typically fills most cells
target_row_pattern:
  - description: A specific pattern exists in exactly one row of the input grid.
  - components:
    - type: object_sequence
      color: variable (non-white(0), non-green(3))
      properties:
        - contiguous horizontal block of identical pixels
        - located to the left of the barrier in the same row
    - type: gap
      color: white (0)
      properties:
        - contiguous horizontal block of one or more pixels
        - located between the object_sequence and the barrier in the same row
    - type: barrier
      color: green (3)
      properties:
        - single pixel
        - located to the right of the gap in the same row
inactive_rows:
  - description: All rows that do not match the target_row_pattern.
  - properties: Remain unchanged in the output.
actions:
  - action: identify_target_row
    details: Iterate through rows of the input grid to find the single row containing the object_sequence, gap, and barrier pattern in the correct order.
  - action: segment_target_row
    inputs: target_row
    outputs: prefix, object_sequence, gap, barrier_pixel, suffix
    details: Divide the target row into segments based on the identified components.
      - prefix: pixels before the object_sequence
      - object_sequence: the sequence itself
      - gap: the white pixels between object and barrier
      - barrier_pixel: the single green pixel
      - suffix: pixels after the barrier_pixel
  - action: rearrange_target_row
    inputs: prefix, object_sequence, gap, barrier_pixel, suffix
    outputs: modified_row
    details: Reconstruct the row by concatenating segments in the order -> prefix, gap, object_sequence, barrier_pixel, suffix.
  - action: construct_output_grid
    inputs: input_grid, modified_row, target_row_index
    outputs: output_grid
    details: Create a copy of the input grid and replace the row at target_row_index with the modified_row.
constraints:
  - Exactly one row in the input grid contains the full pattern (object, gap, barrier).
  - The object sequence is always to the left of the barrier in the target row.
  - The gap consists only of white (0) pixels.
