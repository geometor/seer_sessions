            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous attempt failed because it incorrectly assumed the input was a 1D list, while ARC tasks use 2D grids. The provided examples were likely flattened representations of these grids. The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" arose because the code tried to apply list-based logic (like checking `if not object_info`) potentially on NumPy arrays or slices derived from a 2D structure, leading to boolean ambiguity.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Treat the input as a 2D NumPy array.\n2.  Identify the specific row within the 2D grid where the transformation needs to occur. This row will contain the characteristic pattern: a contiguous sequence of a single color (not white or green), followed by one or more white pixels (the gap), followed by a single green pixel (the barrier).\n3.  Apply the previously defined 1D logic (find object, find barrier, find gap, rearrange segments) *only* to that specific row.\n4.  Leave all other rows unchanged.\n5.  Construct the output grid by combining the unchanged rows with the modified row.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nTo confirm the 2D nature and dimensions, let's examine the inputs. We'll assume the provided flattened lists represent single rows within potentially larger, mostly white grids, or that the grid itself is just that single row. The code execution will help determine the actual structure passed to the function.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the first training example assuming it's a single row for now.\n"
