Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Each example consists of a single row (a 1D array) of pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Key Elements:**
    *   **Background:** The dominant color is white (0).
    *   **Object:** There is always a contiguous sequence of a single non-white, non-green color (red=2, orange=7, magenta=6 in the examples).
    *   **Barrier:** There is always a single green (3) pixel located somewhere to the right of the object sequence.
    *   **Gap:** There are usually one or more white (0) pixels between the object sequence and the barrier pixel.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift. The object sequence moves to the right, closing the gap between it and the barrier pixel. The white pixels that were originally in the gap seem to move to the left, filling the space previously occupied by the leftmost part of the object sequence. The relative positions of the barrier pixel and any white pixels before the object sequence or after the barrier pixel remain unchanged. It's like the object sequence "slides" right until it bumps into the green barrier, swapping places with the intervening white pixels.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: fills most of the array
  - type: object_sequence
    color: variable (non-white, non-green; e.g., red(2), orange(7), magenta(6))
    properties:
      - contiguous block of identical pixels
      - appears once per input
      - located to the left of the barrier
  - type: barrier
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - single pixel
      - appears once per input
      - located to the right of the object_sequence
  - type: gap
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - sequence of one or more pixels
      - located between the object_sequence and the barrier
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: object_sequence
    details: find the contiguous block of non-white, non-green pixels
  - action: identify
    target: barrier
    details: find the single green (3) pixel
  - action: identify
    target: gap
    details: find the white (0) pixels between the end of the object_sequence and the barrier
  - action: move
    target: object_sequence
    direction: right
    destination: immediately to the left of the barrier
  - action: move
    target: gap
    direction: left
    destination: fills the original starting position of the object_sequence relative to the gap size
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entity1: object_sequence
    entity2: barrier
    relation: object_sequence is always to the left of the barrier in the input.
  - type: spatial
    entity1: gap
    entity2: object_sequence
    entity3: barrier
    relation: gap is always located between the object_sequence and the barrier in the input.
  - type: adjacency
    entity1: object_sequence
    entity2: barrier
    relation: object_sequence becomes adjacent (left side) to the barrier in the output.
constraints:
  - The array is 1-dimensional.
  - There is exactly one object_sequence.
  - There is exactly one barrier pixel (green=3).
  - The object_sequence color is never white(0) or green(3).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sequence of identical pixels that are not white (0) and not green (3). This is the "object sequence". Record its starting index, ending index, and length.
2.  Identify the index of the single green (3) pixel. This is the "barrier index".
3.  Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels located between the end of the object sequence (index `end_index + 1`) and the barrier index (`barrier_index - 1`). This is the "gap". Record its length.
4.  Construct the output array:
    a.  Copy the pixels from the start of the input array up to (but not including) the start index of the object sequence.
    b.  Append the gap pixels (the sequence of white pixels identified in step 3).
    c.  Append the object sequence.
    d.  Append the barrier pixel (green=3).
    e.  Append any remaining pixels from the input array (from index `barrier_index + 1` to the end).
5.  Return the constructed output array.
```python
"""
Identifies a contiguous sequence of identical non-white(0), non-green(3) pixels (the 'object sequence') and a single green(3) pixel (the 'barrier') in a 1D input array.
Moves the object sequence immediately to the left of the barrier, shifting the white(0) pixels that were originally between them (the 'gap') to the position previously occupied by the start of the object sequence.
The relative order of pixels before the original object sequence position and after the barrier position remains unchanged.
