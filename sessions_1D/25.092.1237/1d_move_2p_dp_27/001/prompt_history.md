Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (a single row). The length is consistently 9 pixels.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   'white' (0) appears to function as a background or empty space.
    *   'magenta' (6) appears in a fixed position relative to the transformation's end state, acting like a marker or target.
    *   Other colors ('blue' (1), 'orange' (7), 'red' (2)) form contiguous blocks.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   In each input, there's one contiguous block of a single color (blue, orange, or red). Let's call this the "Movable Object".
    *   There's always one 'magenta' (6) pixel. Let's call this the "Marker".
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with 'white' (0) pixels.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:**
    *   The Movable Object shifts its position horizontally (rightwards).
    *   The Marker pixel seems to maintain its absolute position in the grid across the transformation (index 7 in train_1, index 6 in train_2, index 5 in train_3 - wait, let me recheck the indices).
        *   Train 1: Input `1 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 0` (Marker at index 7) -> Output `0 0 1 1 1 1 1 6 0` (Marker at index 7)
        *   Train 2: Input `7 7 7 7 0 0 6 0 0` (Marker at index 6) -> Output `0 0 7 7 7 7 6 0 0` (Marker at index 6)
        *   Train 3: Input `2 2 2 0 0 6 0 0 0` (Marker at index 5) -> Output `0 0 2 2 2 6 0 0 0` (Marker at index 5)
    *   Correction: The Marker *does* maintain its absolute position.
    *   The key action seems to be moving the Movable Object rightwards until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the Marker pixel.
    *   The space initially occupied by the Movable Object, and any space it moves *over*, becomes 'white' (0). The space to the left of the moved object also becomes 'white'.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  size: [1, 9] # height, width for all examples

Objects:
  - type: Background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
  - type: Movable_Object
    properties:
      - contiguity: true
      - color: varies (non-white, non-magenta)
      - count: 1 per grid
  - type: Marker
    properties:
      - color_name: magenta
      - color_value: 6
      - shape: single pixel
      - count: 1 per grid
      - stability: position is fixed in the output relative to input

Relationships:
  - type: Spatial
    description: In the input, there is a gap (composed of 'white' pixels) between the right edge of the Movable_Object and the Marker pixel.
  - type: Interaction
    description: The Movable_Object shifts rightwards relative to the Marker.

Actions:
  - action: Identify
    target: Movable_Object (contiguous block of color != 0 and != 6)
    details: Note its color, start index, end index, and length.
  - action: Identify
    target: Marker (pixel with color 6)
    details: Note its index.
  - action: Calculate
    target: Gap_Size
    details: Count the number of 'white' pixels between the end index of the Movable_Object and the index of the Marker in the input.
  - action: Shift
    target: Movable_Object
    direction: right
    magnitude: equal to Gap_Size
    result: The right edge of the Movable_Object becomes adjacent (left) to the Marker pixel.
  - action: Fill
    target: All other positions in the grid
    details: Set pixel values to 'white' (0), except for the repositioned Movable_Object and the Marker.

Result:
  - state: The output grid contains the Movable_Object positioned immediately to the left of the Marker, with all other cells set to 'white'. The Marker retains its original absolute position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color ('white', 0).
2.  Locate the 'marker' pixel (color 'magenta', 6) in the input grid and record its position (index).
3.  Place the 'marker' pixel into the output grid at the same recorded position.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is neither 'white' (0) nor 'magenta' (6). This is the 'movable object'. Record its color and length.
5.  Determine the target end position for the 'movable object' in the output grid: it should be the position immediately to the left of the 'marker' pixel (marker index - 1).
6.  Determine the target start position for the 'movable object': target end position - length + 1.
7.  Place the 'movable object' (using its recorded color and length) into the output grid starting at the calculated target start position.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
