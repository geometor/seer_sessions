Locate the 'marker' pixel (color 'magenta', 6) in the input grid and record its position (index).\n3. Place the 'marker' pixel into the output grid at the same recorded position.\n4. Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is neither 'white' (0) nor 'magenta' (6). This is the 'movable object'. Record its color and length.\n5. Determine the target end position for the 'movable object' in the output grid: it should be the position immediately to the left of the 'marker' pixel (marker index - 1).\n6. Determine the target start position for the 'movable object': target end position - length + 1.\n7.
