Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  size: [1, 9] # height, width for all examples

Objects:
  - type: Background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
  - type: Movable_Object
    properties:
      - contiguity: true
      - color: varies (non-white, non-magenta)
      - count: 1 per grid
  - type: Marker
    properties:
      - color_name: magenta
      - color_value: 6
      - shape: single pixel
      - count: 1 per grid
      - stability: position is fixed in the output relative to input

Relationships:
  - type: Spatial
    description: In the input, there is a gap (composed of 'white' pixels) between the right edge of the Movable_Object and the Marker pixel.
  - type: Interaction
    description: The Movable_Object shifts rightwards relative to the Marker.

Actions:
  - action: Identify
    target: Movable_Object (contiguous block of color != 0 and != 6)
    details: Note its color, start index, end index, and length.
  - action: Identify
    target: Marker (pixel with color 6)
    details: Note its index.
  - action: Calculate
    target: Gap_Size
    details: Count the number of 'white' pixels between the end index of the Movable_Object and the index of the Marker in the input.
  - action: Shift
    target: Movable_Object
    direction: right
    magnitude: equal to Gap_Size
    result: The right edge of the Movable_Object becomes adjacent (left) to the Marker pixel.
  - action: Fill
    target: All other positions in the grid
    details: Set pixel values to 'white' (0), except for the repositioned Movable_Object and the Marker.

Result:
  - state: The output grid contains the Movable_Object positioned immediately to the left of the Marker, with all other cells set to 'white'. The Marker retains its original absolute position.
