            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (a single row). The length is consistently 9 pixels.\n2.  **Colors:**\n    *   'white' (0) appears to function as a background or empty space.\n    *   'magenta' (6) appears in a fixed position relative to the transformation's end state, acting like a marker or target.\n    *   Other colors ('blue' (1), 'orange' (7), 'red' (2)) form contiguous blocks.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   In each input, there's one contiguous block of a single color (blue, orange, or red). Let's call this the \"Movable Object\".\n    *   There's always one 'magenta' (6) pixel. Let's call this the \"Marker\".\n    *   The rest of the grid is filled with 'white' (0) pixels.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The Movable Object shifts its position horizontally (rightwards).\n    *   The Marker pixel seems to maintain its absolute position in the grid across the transformation (index 7 in train_1, index 6 in train_2, index 5 in train_3 - wait, let me recheck the indices).\n        *   Train 1: Input `1 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 0` (Marker at index 7) -> Output `0 0 1 1 1 1 1 6 0` (Marker at index 7)\n        *   Train 2: Input `7 7 7 7 0 0 6 0 0` (Marker at index 6) -> Output `0 0 7 7 7 7 6 0 0` (Marker at index 6)\n        *   Train 3: Input `2 2 2 0 0 6 0 0 0` (Marker at index 5) -> Output `0 0 2 2 2 6 0 0 0` (Marker at index 5)\n    *   Correction: The Marker *does* maintain its absolute position.\n    *   The key action seems to be moving the Movable Object rightwards until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the Marker pixel.\n    *   The space initially occupied by the Movable Object, and any space it moves *over*, becomes 'white' (0). The space to the left of the moved object also becomes 'white'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
