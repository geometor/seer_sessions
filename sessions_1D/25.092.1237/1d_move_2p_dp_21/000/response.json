In this example, the colors used are white (0), orange (7), and red (2).\n2.  **Structure:** The input consists of segments: an initial block of white pixels, a block of orange pixels, a short block of white pixels, a single red pixel, and a final white pixel.\n3.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   A contiguous block of a non-white color (orange, 7). This appears to be the main object.\n    *   A specific single pixel of another color (red, 2) that appears later in the sequence.\n    *   Background pixels (white, 0).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves rearranging segments of the input array. Specifically, the white pixels located *between* the main orange block and the red pixel are moved to the beginning of the array, immediately following the initial block of white pixels. The relative order of the orange block and the elements from the red pixel onwards is preserved.\n5.  **Conservation:** The total number of pixels and the count of each color remain the same between input and output. The transformation is a rearrangement (permutation of segments).\n\n## YAML Facts:\n\n"
