task_description: Rearrange segments of a 1D array based on identified patterns.

elements:
  - type: segment
    name: prefix_whites
    description: Contiguous block of white (0) pixels at the beginning of the input.
    example_value: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  - type: segment
    name: main_block
    description: The largest contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input.
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      length: 7
    example_value: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
  - type: segment
    name: intervening_whites
    description: Contiguous block of white (0) pixels located immediately after main_block and before the separator_pixel.
    properties:
      count: 2
    example_value: [0, 0]
  - type: pixel
    name: separator_pixel
    description: A specific pixel (red, 2) that marks the end of the section to consider for intervening_whites.
    properties:
      color: red (2)
    example_value: [2]
  - type: segment
    name: suffix
    description: The segment starting from the separator_pixel to the end of the input.
    example_value: [2, 0]

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: intervening_whites are positioned between the end of main_block and the start of separator_pixel.
  - type: relative_order
    description: In the output, the relative order of prefix_whites, intervening_whites, main_block, and suffix is maintained according to the transformation rule.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: prefix_whites, main_block, separator_pixel, intervening_whites, suffix
    description: Locate these segments/pixels within the input array.
  - action: move
    target: intervening_whites
    from: Position between main_block and separator_pixel.
    to: Position immediately after prefix_whites.
  - action: concatenate
    elements: [prefix_whites, intervening_whites, main_block, suffix]
    order: specified
    description: Assemble the output array by concatenating the identified and rearranged segments in the new order.

constraints:
  - The input is a 1D array.
  - A single red (2) pixel exists after the main_block.
  - White (0) pixels may exist between the main_block and the red pixel.
