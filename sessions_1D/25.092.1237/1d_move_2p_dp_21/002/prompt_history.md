## Perception of Elements:

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (or grids of height 1) of pixels represented by integers 0-9. In this example, the colors used are white (0), orange (7), and red (2).
2.  **Structure:** The input consists of segments: an initial block of white pixels, a block of orange pixels, a short block of white pixels, a single red pixel, and a final white pixel.
3.  **Key Objects:**
    *   A contiguous block of a non-white color (orange, 7). This appears to be the main object.
    *   A specific single pixel of another color (red, 2) that appears later in the sequence.
    *   Background pixels (white, 0).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves rearranging segments of the input array. Specifically, the white pixels located *between* the main orange block and the red pixel are moved to the beginning of the array, immediately following the initial block of white pixels. The relative order of the orange block and the elements from the red pixel onwards is preserved.
5.  **Conservation:** The total number of pixels and the count of each color remain the same between input and output. The transformation is a rearrangement (permutation of segments).

constraints:
  - The input is a 1D array.
  - A single red (2) pixel exists after the main_block.
  - White (0) pixels may exist between the main_block and the red pixel.
```


## Natural Language Program:

1.  Identify the initial contiguous block of white (0) pixels at the start of the input array (`prefix_whites`).
2.  Identify the largest contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input array (`main_block`).
3.  Identify the first occurrence of a red (2) pixel (`separator_pixel`) that appears *after* the `main_block`.
4.  Identify the block of white (0) pixels located strictly between the end of the `main_block` and the `separator_pixel` (`intervening_whites`). If no such white pixels exist, this block is empty.
5.  Identify the remaining part of the input array starting from the `separator_pixel` to the end (`suffix`).
6.  Construct the output array by concatenating the segments in the following order: `prefix_whites`, `intervening_whites`, `main_block`, `suffix`.
```python
"""
Identify segments in a 1D input array: initial white pixels (prefix_whites), the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (main_block), a specific separator pixel (red, 2) appearing after the main_block, and any white pixels located between the main_block and the separator pixel (intervening_whites). The remaining part from the separator pixel to the end is the suffix.
Construct the output array by rearranging these segments in the order: prefix_whites, intervening_whites, main_block, suffix.
