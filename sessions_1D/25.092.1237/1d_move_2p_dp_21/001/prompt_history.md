## Perception of Elements:

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (or grids of height 1) of pixels represented by integers 0-9. In this example, the colors used are white (0), orange (7), and red (2).
2.  **Structure:** The input consists of segments: an initial block of white pixels, a block of orange pixels, a short block of white pixels, a single red pixel, and a final white pixel.
3.  **Key Objects:**
    *   A contiguous block of a non-white color (orange, 7). This appears to be the main object.
    *   A specific single pixel of another color (red, 2) that appears later in the sequence.
    *   Background pixels (white, 0).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves rearranging segments of the input array. Specifically, the white pixels located *between* the main orange block and the red pixel are moved to the beginning of the array, immediately following the initial block of white pixels. The relative order of the orange block and the elements from the red pixel onwards is preserved.
5.  **Conservation:** The total number of pixels and the count of each color remain the same between input and output. The transformation is a rearrangement (permutation of segments).

## YAML Facts:


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange segments of a 1D array based on identified patterns.

elements:
  - type: segment
    name: prefix_whites
    description: Contiguous block of white (0) pixels at the beginning of the input.
    example_value: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  - type: segment
    name: main_block
    description: The largest contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input.
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      length: 7
    example_value: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
  - type: segment
    name: intervening_whites
    description: Contiguous block of white (0) pixels located immediately after main_block and before the separator_pixel.
    properties:
      count: 2
    example_value: [0, 0]
  - type: pixel
    name: separator_pixel
    description: A specific pixel (red, 2) that marks the end of the section to consider for intervening_whites.
    properties:
      color: red (2)
    example_value: [2]
  - type: segment
    name: suffix
    description: The segment starting from the separator_pixel to the end of the input.
    example_value: [2, 0]

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: intervening_whites are positioned between the end of main_block and the start of separator_pixel.
  - type: relative_order
    description: In the output, the relative order of prefix_whites, intervening_whites, main_block, and suffix is maintained according to the transformation rule.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: prefix_whites, main_block, separator_pixel, intervening_whites, suffix
    description: Locate these segments/pixels within the input array.
  - action: move
    target: intervening_whites
    from: Position between main_block and separator_pixel.
    to: Position immediately after prefix_whites.
  - action: concatenate
    elements: [prefix_whites, intervening_whites, main_block, suffix]
    order: specified
    description: Assemble the output array by concatenating the identified and rearranged segments in the new order.

constraints:
  - The input is a 1D array.
  - A single red (2) pixel exists after the main_block.
  - White (0) pixels may exist between the main_block and the red pixel.
```


## Natural Language Program:

1.  Identify the initial contiguous block of white (0) pixels at the start of the input array (`prefix_whites`).
2.  Identify the largest contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input array (`main_block`).
3.  Identify the first occurrence of a red (2) pixel (`separator_pixel`) that appears *after* the `main_block`.
4.  Identify the block of white (0) pixels located strictly between the end of the `main_block` and the `separator_pixel` (`intervening_whites`). If no such white pixels exist, this block is empty.
5.  Identify the remaining part of the input array starting from the `separator_pixel` to the end (`suffix`).
6.  Construct the output array by concatenating the segments in the following order: `prefix_whites`, `intervening_whites`, `main_block`, `suffix`.
