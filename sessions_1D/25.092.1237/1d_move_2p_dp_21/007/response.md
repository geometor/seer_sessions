```python
"""
Rearrange segments of a 1D input array based on identified patterns.
Specifically, it identifies:
1. An optional initial block of white pixels (prefix_whites).
2. The first contiguous block of non-white pixels following the prefix (main_block).
3. The first occurrence of a red (2) pixel after the main_block (separator_pixel).
4. An optional block of only white pixels located strictly between the main_block and the separator_pixel (intervening_whites).
5. The segment starting from the separator_pixel to the end (suffix).
The output is constructed by concatenating these segments in the order:
prefix_whites, intervening_whites, main_block, suffix.
