Scan the input grid to locate the unique, contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor azure (8). Record this block's color, its starting index, and its length.\n3. Scan the input grid to locate the unique azure (8) pixel. Record its index.\n4. Place the azure (8) pixel into the output grid at the exact same index it occupied in the input grid.\n5. Calculate the target starting index for the block identified in step 2 by adding 2 to its original starting index.\n6. Copy the block (using its recorded color and length) into the output grid, starting at the target index calculated in step 5. If placing the block causes it to extend beyond the boundary of the output grid, only place the parts of the block that fit within the grid; do not wrap around or resize the grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\n# Define color constants used in the logic\nWHITE = 0\nAZURE = 8\n\ndef find_movable_block(grid: np.ndarray) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of pixels whose color is not WHITE or AZURE.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A 1D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing (start_index, length, color) of the block as standard\n        Python integers, or None if no such block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_index = -1\n    length = 0\n    color = -1\n    in_block = False\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        # Check if the pixel color is neither WHITE nor AZURE\n        is_movable_pixel_color = (pixel != WHITE) and (pixel != AZURE)\n        if is_movable_pixel_color:\n            if not in_block:\n                # Start of a new block\n                start_index = i\n                color = pixel\n                length = 1\n                in_block = True\n            elif pixel == color:\n                # Continuation of the current block (same color)\n                length += 1\n            else:\n                # Found a different non-white/non-azure color - stop\n                # Assumes only one continuous block is relevant per the examples\n                 break\n        elif in_block:\n            # End of the block detected (encountered WHITE or AZURE after being in a block)\n            break\n    if start_index != -1:\n        # Return standard Python ints for compatibility\n        return int(start_index), int(length), int(color)\n    else:\n        # No block meeting the criteria was found\n        return None\n\ndef find_anchor_pixel(grid: np.ndarray) -> Optional[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the single AZURE pixel.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A 1D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        The index of the AZURE pixel as a standard Python integer,\n        or None if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        if pixel == AZURE:\n            return int(i) # Return standard Python int\n    return None # Anchor pixel not found\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation based on the identified rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list to numpy array for efficient processing\n    grid_np = np.array(input_grid)\n    grid_size = len(grid_np)\n\n    # 1.
