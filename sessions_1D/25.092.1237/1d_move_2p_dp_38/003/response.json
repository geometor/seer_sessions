Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, and fill it \n   completely with white (0) pixels.\n2. Scan the input grid to find the single, contiguous block of pixels that are \n   neither white (0) nor azure (8). Record the color, starting index, and \n   length of this block.\n3. Scan the input grid to find the index of the single azure (8) pixel.\n4. In the output grid, place the azure (8) pixel at the same index it \n   occupied in the input grid.\n5. Calculate the new starting index for the non-white/non-azure block by \n   adding 2 to its original starting index found in step 2.\n6. Copy the block (using its color and length found in step 2) into the \n   output grid, beginning at the new starting index calculated in step 5. \n   Ensure that the placement respects the grid boundaries; do not write pixels \n   beyond the end of the grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\n# Define color constants used in the logic\nWHITE = 0\nAZURE = 8\n\ndef find_movable_block(grid: np.ndarray) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of pixels whose color is not WHITE or AZURE.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A 1D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing (start_index, length, color) of the block,\n        or None if no such block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_index = -1\n    length = 0\n    color = -1\n    in_block = False\n\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        # Check if the pixel is part of the movable block\n        if pixel != WHITE and pixel != AZURE:\n            if not in_block:\n                # Start of a new block\n                start_index = i\n                color = pixel\n                length = 1\n                in_block = True\n            elif pixel == color:\n                # Continuation of the current block\n                length += 1\n            else:\n                # Found a different non-white/non-azure color - stop\n                # (assuming only one such block per the task examples)\n                 break\n        elif in_block:\n            # End of the block found (encountered WHITE or AZURE after being in a block)\n            break\n\n    if start_index != -1:\n        return start_index, length, color\n    else:\n        # No block found\n        return None\n\ndef find_anchor_pixel(grid: np.ndarray) -> Optional[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the AZURE pixel.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A 1D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        The index of the AZURE pixel, or None if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        if pixel == AZURE:\n            return i\n    return None # Anchor pixel not found\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list to numpy array for efficient processing\n    grid_np = np.array(input_grid)\n    grid_size = len(grid_np)\n\n    # 1.
