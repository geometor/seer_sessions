Scan the input grid to locate the unique, contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor azure (8). Record this block's color, its starting index, and its length.\n3. Scan the input grid to locate the unique azure (8) pixel. Record its index.\n4. Place the azure (8) pixel into the output grid at the exact same index it occupied in the input grid.\n5. Calculate the target starting index for the block identified in step 2 by adding 2 to its original starting index.\n6. Copy the block (using its recorded color and length) into the output grid, starting at the target index calculated in step 5. If placing the block causes it to extend beyond the boundary of the output grid, only place the parts of the block that fit within the grid; do not wrap around or resize the grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\n# Define color constants used in the logic\nWHITE = 0\nAZURE = 8\n\ndef find_movable_block(grid: np.ndarray) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of pixels whose color is not WHITE or AZURE.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A 1D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing (start_index, length, color) of the block as standard\n        Python integers, or None if no such block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_index = -1\n    length = 0\n    color = -1\n    in_block = False\n    # Iterate through the 1D grid to find the block\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        # Check if the pixel color qualifies it as part of the movable block\n        is_movable_pixel_color = (pixel != WHITE) and (pixel != AZURE)\n\n        if is_movable_pixel_color:\n            if not in_block:\n                # Mark the start of a new block\n                start_index = i\n                color = pixel\n                length = 1\n                in_block = True\n            elif pixel == color:\n                # Continue the current block\n                length += 1\n            else:\n                # Encountered a different non-WHITE/non-AZURE color; stop searching\n                # This assumes only one relevant block per grid based on examples\n                break\n        elif in_block:\n            # The block ended (encountered WHITE or AZURE)\n            break # Stop searching once the block ends\n\n    # If a block was found, return its details\n    if start_index != -1:\n        return int(start_index), int(length), int(color)\n    else:\n        # No suitable block was found\n        return None\n\ndef find_anchor_pixel(grid: np.ndarray) -> Optional[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the single AZURE pixel.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A 1D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        The index of the AZURE pixel as a standard Python integer,\n        or None if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Iterate through the grid to find the AZURE pixel\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(grid):\n        if pixel == AZURE:\n            return int(i) # Return the index once found\n    return None # Return None if AZURE pixel is not found\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation based on the identified rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list potentially representing a 1xN grid to a flattened 1D numpy array\n    grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int).flatten()\n    grid_size = len(grid_np)\n\n    # 1.
