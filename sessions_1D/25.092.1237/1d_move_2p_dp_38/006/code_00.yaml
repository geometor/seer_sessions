Grid:
  type: Conceptually 1D, represented as a list or potentially a 1xN 2D numpy array.
  size: 16 elements in training examples.
Objects:
  - type: Movable Block
    properties:
      - contiguous block of pixels
      - color: Identifiable as not being white (0) and not being azure (8). (e.g., yellow(4), green(3) in examples)
      - count: 1 per grid
    actions:
      - Shifted 2 positions to the right relative to its input position.
  - type: Anchor Pixel
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: 1 per grid
    actions:
      - Remains in the same position in the output grid as it was in the input grid.
  - type: Background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
    actions:
      - Fills the initial output grid.
      - Overwritten by the Anchor Pixel and the shifted Movable Block.
Relationships:
  - The Movable Block's shift is a fixed amount (2 positions right).
  - The Anchor Pixel's position is fixed.
  - The final position of the Movable Block respects grid boundaries (clipped if necessary, though not explicitly shown needed in examples).
Transformation Rule:
  - Identify the Movable Block (non-white, non-azure contiguous pixels) and its start index.
  - Identify the Anchor Pixel (azure) and its index.
  - Create a new grid filled with the background color (white).
  - Place the Anchor Pixel at its original index in the new grid.
  - Calculate the new start index for the Movable Block (original start index + 2).
  - Place the Movable Block at the new start index in the new grid, ensuring it stays within grid bounds.
