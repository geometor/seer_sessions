Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output are presented as 1D arrays. Given the ARC context, these likely represent 1xN grids. The length seems consistent across examples (16 cells).
2.  **Colors**: The grids use white (0), azure (8), and one other color per example (yellow (4) or green (3)).
3.  **Objects**:
    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white, non-azure color (yellow or green). Let's call this the "movable block".
    *   There is always exactly one azure (8) pixel. Let's call this the "anchor pixel".
    *   The remaining pixels are white (0), acting as the background.
4.  **Transformation**:
    *   Comparing input and output, the anchor pixel (azure) consistently stays in the same position.
    *   The movable block (yellow or green) shifts its position horizontally. In all examples, the block moves exactly two positions to the right.
    *   The white pixels fill the space vacated by the movable block and are overwritten at the block's new location.
5.  **Inferred Goal**: The task seems to be about identifying specific objects (a block and a single pixel) and applying a fixed positional shift to one object while keeping the other fixed.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  type: 1D array (likely 1xN grid)
  size: 16 elements in examples
Objects:
  - type: Movable Block
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - color: non-white (0) and non-azure (8) (e.g., yellow(4), green(3))
      - count: 1
    actions:
      - shift right by 2 positions
  - type: Anchor Pixel
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: 1
    actions:
      - remain stationary
  - type: Background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
    actions:
      - fill empty space
      - displaced by Movable Block movement
Relationships:
  - Movable Block's movement is independent of the Anchor Pixel's position.
  - The grid boundaries contain the objects after movement (no wrapping or clipping observed in examples).
Transformation Rule:
  - Identify the Movable Block and its start index.
  - Identify the Anchor Pixel and its index.
  - Create a new grid filled with the background color (white).
  - Place the Anchor Pixel at its original index in the new grid.
  - Place the Movable Block at its original start index + 2 in the new grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Find the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color, starting index, and length.
3.  Find the index of the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid.
4.  Place the azure (8) pixel into the output grid at the same index it occupied in the input grid.
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the non-white, non-azure block by adding 2 to its original starting index found in step 2.
6.  Place the block (using its color and length found in step 2) into the output grid, starting at the newly calculated index from step 5.
