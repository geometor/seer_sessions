"""
1. Create a new output grid having the exact same dimensions (length) as the input grid. Fill this output grid entirely with white (0) pixels.
2. Scan the input grid to locate the unique, contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor azure (8). Record this block's color, its starting index, and its length.
3. Scan the input grid to locate the unique azure (8) pixel. Record its index.
4. Place the azure (8) pixel into the output grid at the exact same index it occupied in the input grid.
5. Calculate the target starting index for the block identified in step 2 by adding 2 to its original starting index.
6. Copy the block (using its recorded color and length) into the output grid, starting at the target index calculated in step 5. If placing the block causes it to extend beyond the boundary of the output grid, only place the parts of the block that fit within the grid; do not wrap around or resize the grid.
