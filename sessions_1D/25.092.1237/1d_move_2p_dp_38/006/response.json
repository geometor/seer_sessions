            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code failed on all training examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in NumPy when a boolean array (resulting from a comparison like `array == value` or `array != value`) is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement).\n\nLooking at the `find_movable_block` function, the condition `is_movable_pixel_color = (pixel != WHITE) and (pixel != AZURE)` is evaluated. The error implies that `pixel` is not a scalar integer value as expected when iterating through a 1D array, but rather a NumPy array itself. This suggests that the input `grid_np` might be a 2D array (specifically, a 1xN array) instead of the assumed 1D array. Iterating over a 2D array yields its rows.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Input Shape:** Assume the input might be a 1xN 2D array.\n2.  **Modify Code:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly flatten the input array into a 1D array upon conversion from the input list. `grid_np = np.array(input_grid).flatten()` should resolve this.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Logic:** The core logic of identifying the movable block, anchor pixel, and performing the shift seems correct based on the initial analysis and should work once the array dimension issue is resolved.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nSince the code failed during execution on all examples, we cannot compare output metrics. The key metric is the consistent failure mode:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Failed - `ValueError` (ambiguous truth value)\n*   **Example 2:** Failed - `ValueError` (ambiguous truth value)\n*   **Example 3:** Failed - `ValueError` (ambiguous truth value)\n\n*Assumption Check (Simulated):*\nIf `input_grid` was `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`, then `grid_np = np.array(input_grid)` would result in `grid_np.shape` being `(1, 16)`. Iterating `for pixel in grid_np:` would yield `pixel = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` in the first (and only) iteration. The comparison `pixel != WHITE` would then become `[0, 0, ..., 0] != 0`, resulting in the boolean array `[False, False, False, False, False, True, True, True, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False]`. Using this boolean array directly in the `if` statement condition `if is_movable_pixel_color:` triggers the observed `ValueError`. Flattening the array first will fix this.\n\n**Facts**\n\nThe underlying facts derived from observing the input-output pairs remain unchanged, but we add a note about the data representation.\n\n"
