1. Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2. Find the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid whose color is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color, starting index, and length.
3. Find the index of the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid.
4. Place the azure (8) pixel into the output grid at the same index it occupied in the input grid.
5. Calculate the new starting index for the non-white, non-azure block by adding 2 to its original starting index found in step 2.
6. Place the block (using its color and length found in step 2) into the output grid, starting at the newly calculated index from step 5.
