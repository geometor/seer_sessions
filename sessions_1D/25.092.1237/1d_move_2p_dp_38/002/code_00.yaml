Grid:
  type: 1D array (linear sequence of pixels)
  size: 16 elements in training examples
Objects:
  - type: Movable Block
    properties:
      - contiguous sequence of pixels
      - color: not white (0) and not azure (8)
      - count: 1 per grid
      - variable length
    actions:
      - shift right by 2 positions relative to its starting index
  - type: Anchor Pixel
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: 1 per grid
      - single pixel
    actions:
      - remain stationary (occupies the same index in output as in input)
  - type: Background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
    actions:
      - fills the initial output grid
      - is overwritten by the Anchor Pixel and the shifted Movable Block
Relationships:
  - The Movable Block's shift is constant (+2 indices).
  - The Anchor Pixel's position determines its location in the output but does not influence the Movable Block's shift.
  - Grid boundaries constrain the placement of the shifted Movable Block (it does not wrap around). If the shift pushes part of the block beyond the grid boundary, that part is clipped.
Transformation Rule:
  - Identify the contiguous block of non-white(0), non-azure(8) pixels: note its color, start index, and length.
  - Identify the single azure(8) pixel: note its index.
  - Create a new grid of the same size, filled with white(0).
  - Place the azure(8) pixel in the new grid at its original index.
  - Calculate the target start index for the movable block (original start index + 2).
  - Place the identified block (using its color and length) into the new grid starting at the calculated target index, respecting grid boundaries.
