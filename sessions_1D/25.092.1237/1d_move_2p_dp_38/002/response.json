            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" typically arises in Python when a NumPy array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if some_array:` or `if array1 == array2:`). Given that the `transform` function itself seems logically sound for element-wise operations and assignments (scalar to slice is valid in NumPy), the error most likely occurred in the external testing code that compared the *entire* output array/list generated by the `transform` function against the expected output array/list. Standard Python equality (`==`) between lists works element-wise, but if the comparison involved NumPy arrays directly using `==`, it would produce a boolean array, triggering this error if used in an `if` statement.\n\nThe strategy is to maintain the current hypothesis: the task involves a 1D grid where a specific block shifts right by two positions, while an azure anchor pixel remains fixed. The code implements this logic. The reported error is likely external to the function's core logic. We will proceed with the existing understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics and Verification:**\n\nThe core logic involves finding two key elements and performing fixed operations. Let's re-verify the logic against the examples assuming a 1D grid structure.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Movable Block: Found at index 5, color 4, length 3.\n    *   Anchor Pixel: Found at index 10, color 8.\n    *   Transformation: Place color 8 at index 10. Place block of color 4, length 3 starting at index 5 + 2 = 7.\n    *   Result: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Matches Output: Yes.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0]`\n    *   Movable Block: Found at index 1, color 4, length 11.\n    *   Anchor Pixel: Found at index 14, color 8.\n    *   Transformation: Place color 8 at index 14. Place block of color 4, length 11 starting at index 1 + 2 = 3.\n    *   Result: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0]`\n    *   Matches Output: Yes.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Movable Block: Found at index 0, color 3, length 4.\n    *   Anchor Pixel: Found at index 6, color 8.\n    *   Transformation: Place color 8 at index 6. Place block of color 3, length 4 starting at index 0 + 2 = 2.\n    *   Result: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Matches Output: Yes.\n\nThe code logic correctly transforms all training examples based on the 1D interpretation.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
