Grid:
  type: 1D array (likely 1xN grid)
  size: 16 elements in examples
Objects:
  - type: Movable Block
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - color: non-white (0) and non-azure (8) (e.g., yellow(4), green(3))
      - count: 1
    actions:
      - shift right by 2 positions
  - type: Anchor Pixel
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: 1
    actions:
      - remain stationary
  - type: Background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
    actions:
      - fill empty space
      - displaced by Movable Block movement
Relationships:
  - Movable Block's movement is independent of the Anchor Pixel's position.
  - The grid boundaries contain the objects after movement (no wrapping or clipping observed in examples).
Transformation Rule:
  - Identify the Movable Block and its start index.
  - Identify the Anchor Pixel and its index.
  - Create a new grid filled with the background color (white).
  - Place the Anchor Pixel at its original index in the new grid.
  - Place the Movable Block at its original start index + 2 in the new grid.
