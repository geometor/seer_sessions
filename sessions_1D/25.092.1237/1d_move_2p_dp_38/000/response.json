            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output are presented as 1D arrays. Given the ARC context, these likely represent 1xN grids. The length seems consistent across examples (16 cells).\n2.  **Colors**: The grids use white (0), azure (8), and one other color per example (yellow (4) or green (3)).\n3.  **Objects**:\n    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white, non-azure color (yellow or green). Let's call this the \"movable block\".\n    *   There is always exactly one azure (8) pixel. Let's call this the \"anchor pixel\".\n    *   The remaining pixels are white (0), acting as the background.\n4.  **Transformation**:\n    *   Comparing input and output, the anchor pixel (azure) consistently stays in the same position.\n    *   The movable block (yellow or green) shifts its position horizontally. In all examples, the block moves exactly two positions to the right.\n    *   The white pixels fill the space vacated by the movable block and are overwritten at the block's new location.\n5.  **Inferred Goal**: The task seems to be about identifying specific objects (a block and a single pixel) and applying a fixed positional shift to one object while keeping the other fixed.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
