    details: |
      Calculate the number of background pixels (gap_size) between the rightmost pixel
      of the mover block and the target pixel.
      Shift the entire mover block rightwards by gap_size positions.

    actor: grid
    target_area: pixels originally occupied by the mover block before the shift
    details: |
      Change the color of the leftmost gap_size pixels originally occupied by the
      mover block to the background color (white).
