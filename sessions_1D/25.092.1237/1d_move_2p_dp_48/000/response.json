It seems to act as a fixed point or target.\n    *   A contiguous block of pixels of a single color (yellow, gray, or orange in the examples) is present. This block is not green or white. This appears to be the 'moving' element.\n    *   The rest of the grid is composed of white pixels (color 0), acting as the background.\n3.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation observed is the horizontal movement (shift to the right) of the non-green, non-white colored block.\n4.  **Movement Rule:** The colored block moves rightwards until its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left side of the green pixel. The gap of white pixels initially between the block and the green pixel is closed.\n5.  **Pixel Replacement:** The pixels originally occupied by the left part of the block before the shift become white pixels (background color) in the output. The relative positions of the green pixel and the block (block is to the left of green) are maintained. The size and color of the moving block and the green pixel remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (color 0) nor green (color 3). Note its color, start position, and end position. Call this the `moving_block`.\n3.  Calculate the gap size: `gap = position(target_pixel) - position(rightmost_pixel_of_moving_block) - 1`. This is the number of white pixels between the `moving_block` and the `target_pixel`.\n4.  Create the output row initially as a copy of the input row.\n5.  Shift the `moving_block` `gap` positions to the right in the output row. This means for each pixel in the `moving_block` at input position `i`, its new position in the output row is `i + gap`.\n6.  Fill the `gap` positions immediately to the left of the original `moving_block` start position with the background color (white, 0) in the output row. Specifically, change the pixels from the original `start_position` of the `moving_block` up to `start_position + gap - 1` to white (0)."
