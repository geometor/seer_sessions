Since all examples are 1xN grids, the function should extract the first (and only) row.\n2.  **Data Conversion:** Convert the extracted row into a standard Python list to allow the existing block-finding and manipulation logic to work correctly, as list slicing and concatenation are used.\n3.  **Output Formatting:** Ensure the function returns the result in the expected format, which is likely a NumPy array matching the original input dimensions (e.g., a 1xN array).\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's re-evaluate the examples assuming the input is a 1xN grid and we operate on the single row.\n\n"
