## Assessment and Strategy

The error `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array (likely 2D, representing the grid) as `input_grid`, but the logic inside attempted boolean comparisons (`grid[i] != 0`, `grid[i] == 0`) directly on the array structure rather than its elements or a flattened/selected row.

The core transformation logic identified previously (swapping the first non-white block with the immediately following white block within a single row) appears consistent with all three training examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle the input as a 2D NumPy array. Since all examples are 1xN grids, the function should extract the first (and only) row.
2.  **Data Conversion:** Convert the extracted row into a standard Python list to allow the existing block-finding and manipulation logic to work correctly, as list slicing and concatenation are used.
3.  **Output Formatting:** Ensure the function returns the result in the expected format, which is likely a NumPy array matching the original input dimensions (e.g., a 1xN array).

## Metrics

Let's re-evaluate the examples assuming the input is a 1xN grid and we operate on the single row.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid_list, output_grid_list):
    """Analyzes a single example to find blocks A and B and check consistency."""

    n = len(grid)
    metrics = {'input': grid, 'output': output_grid_list[0], 'n': n}

    start_A = -1
    end_A = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if grid[i] != 0:

        block_A_content = grid[start_A : end_A + 1]
        block_B_content = grid[start_B : end_B + 1]
        final_segment = grid[end_B + 1 :]
        reconstructed_output = initial_segment + block_B_content + block_A_content + final_segment
        metrics['reconstructed_output'] = reconstructed_output
        metrics['match'] = (reconstructed_output == metrics['output'])
    else:
        metrics['reconstructed_output'] = grid # No swap expected
        metrics['match'] = (grid == metrics['output'])

    return metrics

```
The code execution confirms that the logic of finding block A (first non-white sequence) and block B (immediately following white sequence) and swapping them correctly reconstructs the output for all three training examples when treating the input as a single row.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid (which is expected to be a 2D grid with exactly one row).
2.  Extract the single row of pixel data from the input grid into a 1-dimensional list or sequence.
3.  Scan this row from left to right to find the start and end indices of the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (pixels with values other than 0). Call this `block_A`.
4.  If no non-white pixels are found (`block_A` does not exist), return the original input grid unchanged.
5.  Determine the index immediately following the end of `block_A`. Check if this index is within the bounds of the row and if the pixel at this index is white (value 0).
6.  If the pixel immediately following `block_A` is white, find the end index of the contiguous block of white pixels starting from that position. Call this `block_B`.
7.  If `block_B` cannot be identified (either because there are no pixels after `block_A` or the pixel immediately following `block_A` is not white), return the original input grid unchanged.
8.  If both `block_A` and `block_B` are successfully identified:
    a.  Identify the segment of the row *before* `block_A` (`initial_segment`).
    b.  Identify the segment of the row *after* `block_B` (`final_segment`).
    c.  Construct a new row by concatenating the segments in the order: `initial_segment`, `block_B`'s content, `block_A`'s content, `final_segment`.
    d.  Create the output grid by placing this newly constructed row back into a 1xN grid structure, matching the input dimensions.
9.  Return the resulting grid.
