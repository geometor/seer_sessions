task_type: pixel_rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Input is technically 2D
operational_dimensionality: 1D # Operations occur on a single row
input_grid_constraints:
  height: 1 # All examples have height 1
transformation: positional_swap_within_row
objects:
  - type: pixel_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels within the row.
    attributes:
      - color_type: white (0) or non-white (!= 0)
      - position: start and end column index
      - length: number of pixels
identified_elements:
  - element: row_data
    description: The single row of pixels extracted from the input grid.
  - element: initial_segment
    description: Sequence of pixels in row_data preceding block_A. Can be empty.
  - element: block_A
    description: The first contiguous block of non-white pixels in row_data, scanning left-to-right.
  - element: block_B
    description: The contiguous block of white pixels in row_data immediately following block_A.
  - element: final_segment
    description: Sequence of pixels in row_data following block_B. Can be empty.
action:
  - type: swap
    operands: [block_A, block_B]
    condition: Both block_A and block_B must be identified, and block_B must start exactly at the column index following the end index of block_A within row_data.
input_structure: Assumed to be a 1xN grid.
row_structure_before_swap: '[initial_segment] [block_A] [block_B] [final_segment]'
row_structure_after_swap: '[initial_segment] [block_B] [block_A] [final_segment]'
invariants:
  - grid_dimensions (height and width)
  - pixel_colors (values)
  - pixel_counts (total number of each color)
edge_cases:
  - Grid contains only white pixels (no block_A -> no change).
  - Grid contains non-white pixels, but no white pixels immediately follow the first non-white block (no block_B -> no change).
  - Grid ends immediately after block_A (no block_B -> no change).
