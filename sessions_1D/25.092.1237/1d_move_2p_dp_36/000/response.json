The core operation involves identifying two specific adjacent blocks of pixels: the first contiguous block of non-white pixels and the immediately following contiguous block of white pixels. These two blocks swap their positions, while all other pixels retain their positions relative to this swapped pair.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
