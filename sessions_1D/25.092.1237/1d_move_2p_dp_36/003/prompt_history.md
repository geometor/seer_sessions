*   **Perception**: The task operates on single-row grids. The transformation rearranges pixels within the row without changing their colors or counts. The core operation involves identifying two specific adjacent blocks of pixels: the first contiguous block of non-white pixels and the immediately following contiguous block of white pixels. These two blocks swap their positions, while all other pixels retain their positions relative to this swapped pair.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## Assessment and Strategy

The error `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array (likely 2D, representing the grid) as `input_grid`, but the logic inside attempted boolean comparisons (`grid[i] != 0`, `grid[i] == 0`) directly on the array structure rather than its elements or a flattened/selected row.

The core transformation logic identified previously (swapping the first non-white block with the immediately following white block within a single row) appears consistent with all three training examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle the input as a 2D NumPy array. Since all examples are 1xN grids, the function should extract the first (and only) row.
2.  **Data Conversion:** Convert the extracted row into a standard Python list to allow the existing block-finding and manipulation logic to work correctly, as list slicing and concatenation are used.
3.  **Output Formatting:** Ensure the function returns the result in the expected format, which is likely a NumPy array matching the original input dimensions (e.g., a 1xN array).

The code execution confirms that the logic of finding block A (first non-white sequence) and block B (immediately following white sequence) and swapping them correctly reconstructs the output for all three training examples when treating the input as a single row.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid (which is expected to be a 2D grid with exactly one row).
2.  Extract the single row of pixel data from the input grid into a 1-dimensional list or sequence.
3.  Scan this row from left to right to find the start and end indices of the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (pixels with values other than 0). Call this `block_A`.
4.  If no non-white pixels are found (`block_A` does not exist), return the original input grid unchanged.
5.  Determine the index immediately following the end of `block_A`. Check if this index is within the bounds of the row and if the pixel at this index is white (value 0).
6.  If the pixel immediately following `block_A` is white, find the end index of the contiguous block of white pixels starting from that position. Call this `block_B`.
7.  If `block_B` cannot be identified (either because there are no pixels after `block_A` or the pixel immediately following `block_A` is not white), return the original input grid unchanged.
8.  If both `block_A` and `block_B` are successfully identified:
    a.  Identify the segment of the row *before* `block_A` (`initial_segment`).
    b.  Identify the segment of the row *after* `block_B` (`final_segment`).
    c.  Construct a new row by concatenating the segments in the order: `initial_segment`, `block_B`'s content, `block_A`'s content, `final_segment`.
    d.  Create the output grid by placing this newly constructed row back into a 1xN grid structure, matching the input dimensions.
9.  Return the resulting grid.
