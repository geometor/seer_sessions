Extracts the single row from the input grid.\n2. Scans the row from left to right to identify the first contiguous block of \n   non-white pixels (value != 0). Call this block_A.\n3. Identifies the contiguous block of white pixels (value == 0) immediately \n   following block_A. Call this block_B.\n4. If both block_A and block_B are found and are adjacent, swaps their positions \n   in the row.\n5. The segments of the row before block_A and after block_B remain in their \n   original relative positions.\n6. If block_A is not found, or if block_B does not immediately follow block_A, \n   the grid remains unchanged.\n7. Returns the transformed row within a 1xN grid structure.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\ndef find_first_non_white_block(row: List[int]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the start and end indices of the first contiguous non-white block.\"\"\"\n    n = len(row)\n    start_A = -1\n    end_A = -1\n\n    # Find the start index of block_A\n    for i in range(n):\n        if row[i] != 0:\n            start_A = i\n            break\n\n    # If no non-white pixels are found\n    if start_A == -1:\n        return None\n\n    # Find the end index of block_A (last contiguous non-white pixel)\n    for i in range(start_A, n):\n        if row[i] == 0:\n            end_A = i - 1\n            break\n        # If the block extends to the end of the grid\n        if i == n - 1:\n            end_A = i\n            \n    return start_A, end_A\n\ndef find_subsequent_white_block(row: List[int], start_search_index: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the start and end indices of the white block starting at start_search_index.\"\"\"\n    n = len(row)\n    start_B = start_search_index\n    end_B = -1\n\n    # Check if there's space for block_B and if it starts with a white pixel\n    if start_B >= n or row[start_B] != 0:\n        # No valid block_B found starting at this index\n        return None\n\n    # Find the end index of block_B (last contiguous white pixel starting at start_B)\n    for i in range(start_B, n):\n        if row[i] != 0:\n            end_B = i - 1\n            break\n        # If the block extends to the end of the grid\n        if i == n - 1:\n            end_B = i\n            \n    # end_B must be >= start_B if we found a white pixel at start_B\n    return start_B, end_B\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the block swapping transformation to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A NumPy array representing the 1xN input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A NumPy array representing the transformed 1xN grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate input shape (optional but good practice)\n    if input_grid.shape[0] != 1:\n        # Or raise an error, depending on expected behavior for invalid input\n        return input_grid \n\n    # Extract the single row and convert to a list\n    row = input_grid[0, :].tolist()\n    n = len(row)\n\n    # Handle empty row case\n    if n == 0:\n        return input_grid # Return original empty grid structure\n\n    # --- Step 1: Find the first non-white block (block_A) ---\n    block_A_indices = find_first_non_white_block(row)\n\n    # If no block_A is found, return the original grid\n    if block_A_indices is None:\n        return input_grid\n        \n    start_A, end_A = block_A_indices\n\n    # --- Step 2: Find the white block immediately following block_A (block_B) ---\n    # The search for block_B must start exactly at the position after block_A ends\n    block_B_indices = find_subsequent_white_block(row, start_search_index=end_A + 1)\n    \n    # If no block_B is found immediately following block_A, return the original grid\n    if block_B_indices is None:\n        return input_grid\n        \n    start_B, end_B = block_B_indices\n\n    # --- Step 3 & 4: Extract segments and reconstruct the output ---\n    # Extract the segment before block_A (might be empty)\n    initial_segment = row[0:start_A]\n    \n    # Extract the content of block_A\n    block_A_content = row[start_A : end_A + 1]\n    \n    # Extract the content of block_B\n    block_B_content = row[start_B : end_B + 1]\n    \n    # Extract the segment after block_B (might be empty)\n    final_segment = row[end_B + 1 :]\n\n    # Construct the new row by swapping block_A and block_B\n    output_row_list = initial_segment + block_B_content + block_A_content + final_segment\n    \n    # Convert the result back to a numpy array with the original shape\n    output_grid = np.array([output_row_list], dtype=input_grid.dtype)\n    \n    return output_grid\n```"
