            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains:\n1.  A background of white pixels (0).\n2.  A single contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white, non-maroon color (red '2' in train_1, gray '5' in train_2 and train_3).\n3.  A single maroon pixel (9) located to the right of the colored block, separated by some white pixels.\n\nThe transformation involves moving the colored block horizontally. Comparing input and output grids:\n*   The background white pixels change as the block moves.\n*   The colored block shifts its position to the right.\n*   The maroon pixel (9) remains in the same position.\n*   In all provided examples (train_1, train_2, train_3), the colored block shifts exactly 2 positions to the right. The block's right edge ends up adjacent to the maroon pixel in the output, but this adjacency seems to be a consequence of the initial setup and the fixed shift amount (2), rather than a rule like \"move until adjacent\".\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
