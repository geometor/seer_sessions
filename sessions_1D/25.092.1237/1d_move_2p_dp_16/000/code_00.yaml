task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
objects:
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    color: Non-white (0) and non-maroon (9). Only one such block per grid.
    examples:
      - train_1: color=red (2), length=3
      - train_2: color=gray (5), length=12
      - train_3: color=gray (5), length=15
  - type: marker
    description: A single pixel acting as a potential landmark.
    color: maroon (9)
    location: To the right of the 'block' object. Position is fixed relative to the grid.
  - type: background
    description: The remaining pixels.
    color: white (0)
actions:
  - action: horizontal_shift
    target_object: block
    direction: right
    distance: 2 pixels
    details: The block moves exactly 2 pixels to the right. The space it vacates becomes white (0). The pixels it moves into adopt the block's color.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    object1: block
    object2: marker
    relation: The block is initially to the left of the marker, separated by white pixels. After the shift, the block is closer to the marker. In the examples shown, the right edge of the shifted block becomes adjacent to the marker.
constraints:
  - The grid is always a single row.
  - There is exactly one non-white, non-maroon block.
  - There is exactly one maroon pixel.
  - The shift distance is constant (2) across examples.
