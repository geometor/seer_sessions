Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains:
1.  A background of white pixels (0).
2.  A single contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white, non-maroon color (red '2' in train_1, gray '5' in train_2 and train_3).
3.  A single maroon pixel (9) located to the right of the colored block, separated by some white pixels.

The transformation involves moving the colored block horizontally. Comparing input and output grids:
*   The background white pixels change as the block moves.
*   The colored block shifts its position to the right.
*   The maroon pixel (9) remains in the same position.
*   In all provided examples (train_1, train_2, train_3), the colored block shifts exactly 2 positions to the right. The block's right edge ends up adjacent to the maroon pixel in the output, but this adjacency seems to be a consequence of the initial setup and the fixed shift amount (2), rather than a rule like "move until adjacent".

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
objects:
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    color: Non-white (0) and non-maroon (9). Only one such block per grid.
    examples:
      - train_1: color=red (2), length=3
      - train_2: color=gray (5), length=12
      - train_3: color=gray (5), length=15
  - type: marker
    description: A single pixel acting as a potential landmark.
    color: maroon (9)
    location: To the right of the 'block' object. Position is fixed relative to the grid.
  - type: background
    description: The remaining pixels.
    color: white (0)
actions:
  - action: horizontal_shift
    target_object: block
    direction: right
    distance: 2 pixels
    details: The block moves exactly 2 pixels to the right. The space it vacates becomes white (0). The pixels it moves into adopt the block's color.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    object1: block
    object2: marker
    relation: The block is initially to the left of the marker, separated by white pixels. After the shift, the block is closer to the marker. In the examples shown, the right edge of the shifted block becomes adjacent to the marker.
constraints:
  - The grid is always a single row.
  - There is exactly one non-white, non-maroon block.
  - There is exactly one maroon pixel.
  - The shift distance is constant (2) across examples.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of pixels whose color is not white (0) and not maroon (9). Note its color, starting column index, and ending column index.
2.  Create a new grid identical to the input grid.
3.  Modify the new grid:
    a.  Change the pixels at the original location of the block (from its starting index to its ending index) to white (0).
    b.  Change the pixels starting from the original start index + 2 up to the original end index + 2 to the color of the identified block.
4.  The resulting grid is the output. (The maroon pixel and other white pixels remain unchanged relative to the grid boundaries).
