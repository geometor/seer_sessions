            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (arrays) of integers representing colors. All examples have a length of 16.\n2.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** The predominant color is white (0).\n    *   **Colored Block:** There is a contiguous block of a single color C, where C is not white (0) and not azure (8). In the examples, this block is blue (1) or magenta (6).\n    *   **Separator:** Immediately following the colored block, there are exactly two white (0) pixels.\n    *   **Marker:** Immediately following the two white pixels, there is a single azure (8) pixel.\n3.  **Structure:** The core structure seems to be `... [Colored Block] [0] [0] [8] ...`. The elements outside this specific sequence appear unchanged.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation focuses on rearranging the elements within the identified sequence `[Colored Block] [0] [0] [8]`.\n    *   The colored block shifts two positions to the right.\n    *   The azure (8) pixel remains in its position relative to the end of the sequence.\n    *   The two white (0) pixels that were originally between the colored block and the azure pixel move to occupy the two positions previously occupied by the start of the colored block.\n    *   Essentially, the sequence `Block | 0 | 0 | 8` is transformed into `0 | 0 | Block | 8`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to identify the contiguous block of a color that is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its starting index, ending index, and color.\n3.  Check if the two pixels immediately following the identified block are both white (0).\n4.  Check if the pixel immediately following these two white pixels is azure (8).\n5.  If steps 2, 3, and 4 successfully identify the pattern `[Colored Block] [0] [0] [8]`:\n    a.  Define the segment of the grid containing this pattern. Let the starting index of the Colored Block be `start_block`, the ending index be `end_block`, and the index of the azure pixel be `idx_azure`. The segment runs from `start_block` to `idx_azure`.\n    b.  Identify the two white pixels at indices `end_block + 1` and `end_block + 2`.\n    c.  Identify the Colored Block pixels from `start_block` to `end_block`.\n    d.  In the output grid, place the two white pixels (from input indices `end_block + 1`, `end_block + 2`) at indices `start_block` and `start_block + 1`.\n    e.  In the output grid, place the Colored Block pixels (from input indices `start_block` to `end_block`) starting at index `start_block + 2`.\n    f.  The azure (8) pixel at index `idx_azure` remains unchanged in its position within the segment (relative to the start, its position effectively shifts due to the insertion of the block, but absolute index remains same relative to the overall grid modification logic). Its new position relative to the start of the segment is now `start_block + 2 + length(Colored Block)`.\n6.  If the pattern is not found, the output grid remains identical to the input grid (although based on the examples, the pattern seems guaranteed).\n7.  Return the modified output grid."
