Grid:
  Type: 1D array of integers (colors)
  Size: Constant length (16 in examples)
Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Occurrence: Fills most of the grid.
  - Type: Colored Block
    Color: Any color except white (0) or azure (8)
    Property: Contiguous sequence of 1 or more pixels.
    Quantity: Exactly one per grid.
  - Type: Separator
    Color: white (0)
    Property: Exactly two contiguous pixels.
    Position: Immediately follows the Colored Block.
  - Type: Marker
    Color: azure (8)
    Property: Single pixel.
    Position: Immediately follows the Separator (the two white pixels).
Relationship:
  - Name: Target Sequence
    Definition: A sequence composed of the Colored Block, followed immediately by two white (0) pixels (Separator), followed immediately by the azure (8) pixel (Marker).
Action:
  - Name: Rearrange Target Sequence
    Input: The identified Target Sequence `[Block] [0] [0] [8]`
    Output: A new sequence `[0] [0] [Block] [8]`
    Effect: Replaces the original Target Sequence segment in the grid with the rearranged segment. Other grid pixels remain unchanged.
