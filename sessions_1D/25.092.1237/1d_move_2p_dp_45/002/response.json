            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly indicates that the `transform` function received NumPy arrays as input, not standard Python lists as assumed during the initial implementation. While the function attempted comparisons like `pixel != 0`, these comparisons are ambiguous when `pixel` itself is an array (which can happen if iterating over a multi-dimensional array incorrectly or if the input structure was misinterpreted).\n\nThe original analysis treated the input as a 1D array, and the transformation logic (`[Block C] [0] [0] [8]` -> `[0] [0] [Block C] [8]`) was derived based on this 1D view. This 1D transformation appears consistent across the examples when the grids are flattened.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the implementation to handle NumPy array inputs. The simplest approach is to flatten the input NumPy array into a 1D list at the beginning of the `transform` function and then apply the existing 1D logic. The final result should then be reshaped back into the original grid dimensions if necessary (though the testing framework might handle flattening/comparison automatically if the output is also flat). We need to confirm the grid dimensions. Assuming the length 16 corresponds to 4x4 grids, as is common in ARC.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the pattern identification and transformation on flattened versions of the examples, assuming they are 4x4 grids.\n\n"
