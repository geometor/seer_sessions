DataRepresentation:
  InputType: Grid (likely NumPy array)
  AssumeDimensions: 4x4 (based on length 16), but transformation operates on flattened 1D sequence.
Grid:
  Type: Flattened 1D sequence of integers (colors) derived from input grid.
  Size: 16 (in examples)
Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Occurrence: Fills most of the sequence.
  - Type: Colored Block
    Color: Any color C, where C is not white (0) and not azure (8).
    Property: Contiguous sequence of 1 or more pixels in the flattened representation.
    Quantity: Exactly one instance followed by the Separator and Marker pattern.
  - Type: Separator
    Color: white (0)
    Property: Exactly two contiguous pixels.
    Position: Immediately follows the Colored Block in the flattened sequence.
  - Type: Marker
    Color: azure (8)
    Property: Single pixel.
    Position: Immediately follows the Separator in the flattened sequence.
Relationship:
  - Name: Target Sequence
    Definition: A sequence composed of the Colored Block, followed immediately by two white (0) pixels (Separator), followed immediately by the azure (8) pixel (Marker). Looks like `[Block C] [0] [0] [8]` in the flattened 1D sequence.
Action:
  - Name: Rearrange Target Sequence
    Input: The identified Target Sequence `[Block C] [0] [0] [8]` within the flattened grid.
    Output: A new sequence `[0] [0] [Block C] [8]`.
    Effect: Replaces the original Target Sequence segment in the flattened grid representation with the rearranged segment. Other grid pixels remain unchanged relative to their position outside this segment.
OutputConstruction:
  - Method: Apply the rearrangement to the flattened input sequence. If the original input was 2D, reshape the modified flattened sequence back to the original dimensions. (Note: Reshaping might not be strictly necessary if the evaluation compares flattened outputs).
