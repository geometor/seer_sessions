Scan the 1D sequence to find the first occurrence of a pattern: a contiguous block of a single color C (where C is not white (0) and not azure (8)), immediately followed by two white (0) pixels, and then immediately by one azure (8) pixel. The pattern is `[Block C] [0] [0] [8]`.\n3. If this pattern is found:\n    a. Let the block start at index `start_block` and end at `end_block`.\n    b. Rearrange the segment from `start_block` to `end_block + 3` in the 1D sequence.\n    c. The new arrangement for this segment becomes `[0] [0] [Block C] [8]`.
