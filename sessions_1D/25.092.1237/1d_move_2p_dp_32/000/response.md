Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as single strings of numbers, but they represent 1-dimensional grids (rows) of pixels. The length of the grid seems consistent within each example pair but varies between examples (all seem to be length 30 in the training examples).
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8), and red (2). White seems to function as the background or empty space.
3.  **Key Elements:** Each input grid contains exactly one orange (7) pixel. To the left of the orange pixel, there is a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-orange color (magenta, azure, or red in the examples). Between this block and the orange pixel, there are one or more white (0) pixels (a gap). The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves moving the colored block horizontally. The orange pixel appears to remain in its original position. The colored block shifts to the right until its rightmost edge is immediately adjacent to the left side of the orange pixel. The white pixels that were originally between the block and the orange pixel are effectively moved to the left side of where the block started.
5.  **Object Identification:** The core objects are the single orange pixel and the contiguous block of another color. The white pixels form the background and the gap between the key objects.
6.  **Action:** The action is a translation (shift) of the colored block relative to the fixed orange pixel, closing the gap between them.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1 # Effectively 1D rows
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    count: 1
    role: landmark # Position appears fixed
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white (0), non-orange (7) # e.g., magenta(6), azure(8), red(2)
    count: 1
    role: moving_object
  - type: background_pixels
    color: white (0)
    role: background / space
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The colored block is always to the left of the orange pixel in the input.
  - type: spatial
    description: There is always a gap of one or more white pixels between the right end of the colored block and the orange pixel in the input.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: orange pixel
    result: location (index)
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous non-white, non-orange block
    result: location (start and end indices), content (color and pixels)
  - action: identify
    target: white pixels between block and orange pixel
    result: count (gap size)
  - action: move / shift
    target: colored block
    direction: right
    magnitude: equal to the count of white pixels in the gap
    constraint: final position is immediately adjacent (left) to the orange pixel
transformation_goal: Make the colored block adjacent to the left of the orange pixel by shifting the block rightwards, filling the original gap, and moving the gap pixels (whites) to the left of the block's original position.
output_grid_properties:
  - The orange pixel remains in its original position.
  - The colored block is positioned immediately to the left of the orange pixel.
  - The pixels that were originally in the gap between the block and the orange pixel are now located immediately to the left of the block's original starting position.
  - All other pixels (left of the original gap, right of the orange pixel) retain their original relative positions and colors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the index of the single orange (7) pixel.
3.  Scan the grid from left to right, stopping before the orange pixel's index, to find the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not orange (7). Record the start index, end index, and the color/pixels of this block.
4.  Calculate the number of white (0) pixels between the end index of the block and the index of the orange pixel. This is the `gap_size`.
5.  If `gap_size` is greater than 0:
    a.  Determine the new start index for the block: `new_block_start_index = block_start_index + gap_size`.
    b.  Determine the new end index for the block: `new_block_end_index = block_end_index + gap_size`.
    c.  Copy the pixels from the original block (from `block_start_index` to `block_end_index`) to the new location in the output grid (from `new_block_start_index` to `new_block_end_index`).
    d.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from the original `block_start_index` up to `new_block_start_index - 1` with white (0).
6.  Leave all other pixels (those before the original `block_start_index`, the orange pixel itself, and those after the orange pixel) unchanged from their positions in the input grid.
7.  Return the modified grid as the output.
