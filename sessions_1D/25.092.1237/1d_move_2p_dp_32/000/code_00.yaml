task_type: grid_transformation_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1 # Effectively 1D rows
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    count: 1
    role: landmark # Position appears fixed
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white (0), non-orange (7) # e.g., magenta(6), azure(8), red(2)
    count: 1
    role: moving_object
  - type: background_pixels
    color: white (0)
    role: background / space
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The colored block is always to the left of the orange pixel in the input.
  - type: spatial
    description: There is always a gap of one or more white pixels between the right end of the colored block and the orange pixel in the input.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: orange pixel
    result: location (index)
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous non-white, non-orange block
    result: location (start and end indices), content (color and pixels)
  - action: identify
    target: white pixels between block and orange pixel
    result: count (gap size)
  - action: move / shift
    target: colored block
    direction: right
    magnitude: equal to the count of white pixels in the gap
    constraint: final position is immediately adjacent (left) to the orange pixel
transformation_goal: Make the colored block adjacent to the left of the orange pixel by shifting the block rightwards, filling the original gap, and moving the gap pixels (whites) to the left of the block's original position.
output_grid_properties:
  - The orange pixel remains in its original position.
  - The colored block is positioned immediately to the left of the orange pixel.
  - The pixels that were originally in the gap between the block and the orange pixel are now located immediately to the left of the block's original starting position.
  - All other pixels (left of the original gap, right of the orange pixel) retain their original relative positions and colors.
