            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as single strings of numbers, but they represent 1-dimensional grids (rows) of pixels. The length of the grid seems consistent within each example pair but varies between examples (all seem to be length 30 in the training examples).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8), and red (2). White seems to function as the background or empty space.\n3.  **Key Elements:** Each input grid contains exactly one orange (7) pixel. To the left of the orange pixel, there is a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-orange color (magenta, azure, or red in the examples). Between this block and the orange pixel, there are one or more white (0) pixels (a gap). The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves moving the colored block horizontally. The orange pixel appears to remain in its original position. The colored block shifts to the right until its rightmost edge is immediately adjacent to the left side of the orange pixel. The white pixels that were originally between the block and the orange pixel are effectively moved to the left side of where the block started.\n5.  **Object Identification:** The core objects are the single orange pixel and the contiguous block of another color. The white pixels form the background and the gap between the key objects.\n6.  **Action:** The action is a translation (shift) of the colored block relative to the fixed orange pixel, closing the gap between them.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Determine the new end index for the block: `new_block_end_index = block_end_index + gap_size`.\n    c.  Copy the pixels from the original block (from `block_start_index` to `block_end_index`) to the new location in the output grid (from `new_block_start_index` to `new_block_end_index`).\n    d.
