This pixel acts as a fixed landmark.\n2.  Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white (0), non-orange (7) color located to the left of the orange pixel.\n3.  Determine the gap size, which is the number of white (0) pixels between the right end of the colored block and the orange pixel.\n4.  If a gap exists (gap size > 0), shift the colored block to the right by the gap size so that its rightmost pixel becomes adjacent to the left side of the orange pixel.\n5.  Fill the space originally occupied by the colored block (before the shift) with white (0) pixels.\n6.  Pixels before the original block position, the orange pixel itself, and pixels after the orange pixel remain unchanged. If there is no gap (gap size = 0), the grid remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_orange_pixel(grid: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the first orange (7) pixel.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        return grid.index(7)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1 # Should not happen based on examples\n\ndef find_colored_block(grid: List[int], search_limit: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the contiguous block of non-white(0), non-orange(7) color\n    before the search_limit.\n    Returns (start_index, end_index, color).\n    Returns (-1, -1, -1) if no such block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_start = -1\n    block_end = -1\n    block_color = -1\n\n    for i in range(search_limit):\n        pixel = grid[i]\n        if pixel != 0 and pixel != 7:\n            # Found the start of a potential block\n            if block_start == -1:\n                block_start = i\n                block_color = pixel\n            # Continue if the color matches the block color\n            elif pixel == block_color:\n                 pass # Already in a block\n            # Found a different color, block ended previously\n            else:\n                 block_end = i - 1\n                 break # Stop searching after the first block ends\n        # If we were in a block and hit a 0 or 7, the block ends\n        elif block_start != -1 and (pixel == 0 or pixel == 7):\n            block_end = i - 1\n            break # Stop searching after the first block ends\n\n    # If loop finished while still in a block (block reaches search_limit - 1)\n    if block_start != -1 and block_end == -1:\n        # Check if the last pixel examined was part of the block\n        if grid[search_limit - 1] == block_color:\n             block_end = search_limit - 1\n        # If the loop exited because the color changed just *before* the limit\n        # block_end might have been set correctly in the loop, otherwise\n        # handle the case where the block ends exactly at search_limit - 2\n        # (This logic seems complex, let's rethink)\n\n    # --- Simplified approach ---\n    block_start = -1\n    block_end = -1\n    block_color = -1\n    in_block = False\n    for i in range(search_limit):\n        pixel = grid[i]\n        if not in_block:\n            # Look for the start of a block\n            if pixel != 0 and pixel != 7:\n                block_start = i\n                block_color = pixel\n                in_block = True\n        else: # We are in_block\n            # Check if the block continues\n            if pixel == block_color:\n                continue # Still in the same block\n            else:\n                # Block ended at the previous pixel\n                block_end = i - 1\n                # We only care about the *first* block found\n                return block_start, block_end, block_color\n\n    # If the loop finishes while still in a block (block goes up to search_limit-1)\n    if in_block:\n        block_end = search_limit - 1\n        return block_start, block_end, block_color\n\n    # If no block was ever found\n    return -1, -1, -1\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid_list: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by shifting the colored block adjacent\n    to the orange pixel.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a mutable copy of the input\n    output_grid = list(input_grid_list)\n    grid_len = len(output_grid)\n\n    # 1.
