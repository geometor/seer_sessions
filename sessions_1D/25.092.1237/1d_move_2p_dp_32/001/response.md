Transformation Rule Description:

1.  Identify the single orange (7) pixel in the 1D input grid. This pixel acts as a fixed landmark.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white (0), non-orange (7) color located to the left of the orange pixel.
3.  Determine the gap size, which is the number of white (0) pixels between the right end of the colored block and the orange pixel.
4.  If a gap exists (gap size > 0), shift the colored block to the right by the gap size so that its rightmost pixel becomes adjacent to the left side of the orange pixel.
5.  Fill the space originally occupied by the colored block (before the shift) with white (0) pixels.
6.  Pixels before the original block position, the orange pixel itself, and pixels after the orange pixel remain unchanged. If there is no gap (gap size = 0), the grid remains unchanged.
