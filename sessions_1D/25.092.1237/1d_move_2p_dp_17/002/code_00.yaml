task_description: Shift a specific colored block right while keeping an anchor pixel fixed.
input_output_type: NumPy array representing a 1xN grid.
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 16] # Consistent across examples
  output: [1, 16] # Consistent across examples
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    identifier: The first contiguous sequence of pixels whose color is not white (0) and not azure (8).
    properties:
      - color: Variable (blue=1, red=2 observed), but uniform within the block.
      - length: Variable (7, 8, 4 observed).
      - start_index: Variable (always 1 in observed training examples).
    actions:
      - Shifted 2 positions to the right relative to its original start index.
  - type: anchor_pixel
    identifier: The single pixel with azure (8) color.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one per grid.
      - position: Variable (10, 11, 7 observed).
    actions:
      - Remains in its original position in the output grid.
  - type: background
    identifier: All pixels with white (0) color.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
    actions:
      - Fills all positions in the output grid not occupied by the shifted block or the anchor pixel.
constants:
  - shift_amount: 2
  - shift_direction: right
  - fixed_pixel_color: azure (8)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - excluded_block_colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
relationships:
  - The contiguous_block and anchor_pixel are distinct and do not overlap in the input or output.
  - The transformation targets the contiguous_block based on its properties (not white, not azure).
  - The background fills space around the other two object types.
