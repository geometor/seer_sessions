            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core logic identified in the initial analysis appears correct across all three training examples: identify a contiguous block of non-white, non-azure pixels, shift it two positions to the right, and keep the single azure pixel fixed. The failure occurred due to a technical incompatibility: the code assumed standard Python lists while the input grids are provided as NumPy arrays.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the helper functions and the main transformation function to correctly handle NumPy arrays using appropriate NumPy methods or compatible iteration techniques. The fundamental transformation rule remains unchanged.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples assuming NumPy array inputs.\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Input: `np.array([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])`\n    *   Output: `np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])`\n    *   Azure (8) index: `10` (remains `10` in output)\n    *   Block color: `1` (blue)\n    *   Block start index: `1`\n    *   Block length: `7`\n    *   Expected block start index in output: `1 + 2 = 3` (matches output)\n\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Input: `np.array([0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0])`\n    *   Output: `np.array([0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0])`\n    *   Azure (8) index: `11` (remains `11` in output)\n    *   Block color: `2` (red)\n    *   Block start index: `1`\n    *   Block length: `8`\n    *   Expected block start index in output: `1 + 2 = 3` (matches output)\n\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Input: `np.array([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])`\n    *   Output: `np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])`\n    *   Azure (8) index: `7` (remains `7` in output)\n    *   Block color: `1` (blue)\n    *   Block start index: `1`\n    *   Block length: `4`\n    *   Expected block start index in output: `1 + 2 = 3` (matches output)\n\nThe analysis confirms the transformation rule is consistent across all examples. The issue was purely the code's handling of the data type.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
