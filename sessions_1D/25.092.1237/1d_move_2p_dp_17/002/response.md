**General Assessment and Strategy**

The core logic identified in the initial analysis appears correct across all three training examples: identify a contiguous block of non-white, non-azure pixels, shift it two positions to the right, and keep the single azure pixel fixed. The failure occurred due to a technical incompatibility: the code assumed standard Python lists while the input grids are provided as NumPy arrays.

The strategy is to adapt the helper functions and the main transformation function to correctly handle NumPy arrays using appropriate NumPy methods or compatible iteration techniques. The fundamental transformation rule remains unchanged.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's re-examine the examples assuming NumPy array inputs.

*   **train_1:**
    *   Input: `np.array([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])`
    *   Output: `np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])`
    *   Azure (8) index: `10` (remains `10` in output)
    *   Block color: `1` (blue)
    *   Block start index: `1`
    *   Block length: `7`
    *   Expected block start index in output: `1 + 2 = 3` (matches output)

*   **train_2:**
    *   Input: `np.array([0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0])`
    *   Output: `np.array([0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0])`
    *   Azure (8) index: `11` (remains `11` in output)
    *   Block color: `2` (red)
    *   Block start index: `1`
    *   Block length: `8`
    *   Expected block start index in output: `1 + 2 = 3` (matches output)

*   **train_3:**
    *   Input: `np.array([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])`
    *   Output: `np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])`
    *   Azure (8) index: `7` (remains `7` in output)
    *   Block color: `1` (blue)
    *   Block start index: `1`
    *   Block length: `4`
    *   Expected block start index in output: `1 + 2 = 3` (matches output)

The analysis confirms the transformation rule is consistent across all examples. The issue was purely the code's handling of the data type.

**YAML Fact Document**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a specific colored block right while keeping an anchor pixel fixed.
input_output_type: NumPy array representing a 1xN grid.
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 16] # Consistent across examples
  output: [1, 16] # Consistent across examples
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    identifier: The first contiguous sequence of pixels whose color is not white (0) and not azure (8).
    properties:
      - color: Variable (blue=1, red=2 observed), but uniform within the block.
      - length: Variable (7, 8, 4 observed).
      - start_index: Variable (always 1 in observed training examples).
    actions:
      - Shifted 2 positions to the right relative to its original start index.
  - type: anchor_pixel
    identifier: The single pixel with azure (8) color.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - count: Exactly one per grid.
      - position: Variable (10, 11, 7 observed).
    actions:
      - Remains in its original position in the output grid.
  - type: background
    identifier: All pixels with white (0) color.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
    actions:
      - Fills all positions in the output grid not occupied by the shifted block or the anchor pixel.
constants:
  - shift_amount: 2
  - shift_direction: right
  - fixed_pixel_color: azure (8)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - excluded_block_colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
relationships:
  - The contiguous_block and anchor_pixel are distinct and do not overlap in the input or output.
  - The transformation targets the contiguous_block based on its properties (not white, not azure).
  - The background fills space around the other two object types.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid (a 1xN NumPy array).
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Find the index (position) of the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid. If found, place an azure (8) pixel at the *same* index in the output grid.
4.  Iterate through the input grid to find the first contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor azure (8). Record its starting index, length, and color.
5.  If such a block is found:
    *   Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
    *   Iterate from 0 up to the block's length. For each step `i`:
        *   Calculate the target index in the output grid: `new_start_index + i`.
        *   Check if the target index is within the bounds of the grid (`0 <= target_index < grid_width`).
        *   If within bounds, place the block's color at the target index in the output grid.
        *   If out of bounds, stop placing the rest of the block.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
