Okay, let's analyze the provided training example (`train_1`) for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids) of pixels represented by integers. In this case, the grid size is 1x16.
2.  **Colors:** The colors present are white (0), blue (1), and azure (8).
3.  **Objects:**
    *   In the input, there's a contiguous block of blue pixels (`[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`).
    *   There's a single azure pixel (8).
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing the input and output:
    *   The single azure pixel (8) remains in the *same position* (index 10 in the 0-based array).
    *   The contiguous block of blue pixels `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` has shifted to the right. Its starting position moves from index 1 to index 3. This is a shift of 2 positions.
    *   The white pixels (0) fill the space around the blue block and the azure pixel, adjusting for the blue block's movement.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a specific colored block while keeping another anchor pixel fixed.
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 16]
  output: [1, 16]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white, non-azure # e.g., blue (1) in train_1, red (2) in train_2
    properties:
      - Variable length and color (but consistent within a block).
      - Only one such block per grid.
    actions:
      - Shifted 2 positions to the right.
  - type: single_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - Always a single pixel.
      - Acts as a fixed anchor.
    actions:
      - Remains in its original position.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - Fills the remaining space.
    actions:
      - Rearranges to accommodate the shifted block and fixed pixel.
relationships:
  - The contiguous block and the azure pixel are distinct and do not overlap.
  - The transformation targets the contiguous block specifically, based on its relationship (or lack thereof) to the azure pixel.
constants:
  - shift_amount: 2
  - shift_direction: right
  - fixed_pixel_color: azure (8)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Locate the position (index) of the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid.
3.  Place an azure (8) pixel at the *same* position in the output grid.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8). Determine its starting position (index), length, and color.
5.  Calculate the new starting position for this block by adding 2 to its original starting position.
6.  Place this contiguous block (with its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new position.
