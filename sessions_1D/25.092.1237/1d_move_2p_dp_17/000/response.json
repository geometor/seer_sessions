In this case, the grid size is 1x16.\n2.  **Colors:** The colors present are white (0), blue (1), and azure (8).\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   In the input, there's a contiguous block of blue pixels (`[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`).\n    *   There's a single azure pixel (8).\n    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing the input and output:\n    *   The single azure pixel (8) remains in the *same position* (index 10 in the 0-based array).\n    *   The contiguous block of blue pixels `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` has shifted to the right. Its starting position moves from index 1 to index 3. This is a shift of 2 positions.\n    *   The white pixels (0) fill the space around the blue block and the azure pixel, adjusting for the blue block's movement.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
