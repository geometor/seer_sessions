task_description: Shift a specific colored block while keeping another anchor pixel fixed.
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 16]
  output: [1, 16]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white, non-azure # e.g., blue (1) in train_1, red (2) in train_2
    properties:
      - Variable length and color (but consistent within a block).
      - Only one such block per grid.
    actions:
      - Shifted 2 positions to the right.
  - type: single_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - Always a single pixel.
      - Acts as a fixed anchor.
    actions:
      - Remains in its original position.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - Fills the remaining space.
    actions:
      - Rearranges to accommodate the shifted block and fixed pixel.
relationships:
  - The contiguous block and the azure pixel are distinct and do not overlap.
  - The transformation targets the contiguous block specifically, based on its relationship (or lack thereof) to the azure pixel.
constants:
  - shift_amount: 2
  - shift_direction: right
  - fixed_pixel_color: azure (8)
