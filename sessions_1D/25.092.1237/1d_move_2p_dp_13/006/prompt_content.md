"""
Transforms a 1D grid by identifying five segments: leading white space, the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (mobile block), the white space separating the mobile block from the next non-white pixel (separating whitespace), the first non-white pixel after the mobile block (anchor pixel), and the trailing white space. The transformation reconstructs the grid by rearranging these segments in the order: separating whitespace, leading whitespace, mobile block, anchor pixel, trailing whitespace.

1.  Examine the input grid (a single row of pixels) from left to right.
2.  Identify the pixels constituting the "leading whitespace": the sequence of white (0) pixels from the start of the grid up to the first non-white pixel. If the grid starts with a non-white pixel, the leading whitespace is empty.
3.  Identify the "mobile block": the first contiguous sequence of one or more non-white pixels. Note its start and end positions.
4.  Identify the "anchor pixel": find the *first* non-white pixel that appears *after* the end of the mobile block. Note its value and position.
5.  Identify the "separating whitespace": the sequence of white (0) pixels located strictly between the end of the mobile block and the position of the anchor pixel. This sequence might be empty if the anchor pixel immediately follows the mobile block.
6.  Identify the "trailing whitespace": the sequence of white (0) pixels from the position immediately after the anchor pixel to the end of the grid. This sequence might be empty.
7.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the identified segments in the following order:
    a.  The separating whitespace.
    b.  The leading whitespace.
    c.  The mobile block pixels.
    d.  The anchor pixel.
    e.  The trailing whitespace.
8.  The resulting grid will have the same dimensions and the same count of each pixel color as the input grid, but the segments will be rearranged.
