## Perception of Elements:

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional grid of pixels based on the relative positions of colored elements. The input grid contains sequences of white pixels (0), a contiguous block of orange pixels (7), and a single maroon pixel (9). The output grid rearranges these elements while preserving the total count of each color and the overall grid size. The core transformation seems to involve shifting the orange block towards the maroon pixel, eliminating the white space between them, and relocating that white space to the beginning of the grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial

    description: In the input, the mobile_block is followed by separating_whitespace, which is followed by the anchor_pixel.
  - type: spatial

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: mobile_block
    criteria: Contiguous block of non-white pixels preceding the anchor_pixel.
  - action: identify
    target: anchor_pixel
    criteria: Single non-white pixel located to the right of the mobile_block.
  - action: identify
    target: separating_whitespace
    criteria: White pixels located between the mobile_block and the anchor_pixel.
  - action: relocate
    target: separating_whitespace
    destination: Prepend to the leading_whitespace at the beginning of the grid.
  - action: shift
    target: mobile_block
    direction: right
    magnitude: Number of pixels in separating_whitespace
    result: mobile_block becomes adjacent to anchor_pixel.
  - action: maintain_position
    target: anchor_pixel
    description: The anchor pixel's absolute position remains unchanged.
  - action: maintain_relative_position

## Natural Language Program:

1.  Identify the main contiguous block of non-white pixels (the "mobile block").
2.  Identify the single, different non-white pixel located to the right of the mobile block (the "anchor pixel").
3.  Identify the sequence of white pixels positioned directly between the end of the mobile block and the anchor pixel (the "separating whitespace").
4.  Count the number of pixels in the separating whitespace.
5.  Construct the output grid:
    a.  Place the separating whitespace at the beginning of the grid.
    b.  Append any white pixels that originally preceded the mobile block in the input grid.
    c.  Append the mobile block.
    d.  Append the anchor pixel.
    e.  Append any white pixels that originally followed the anchor pixel in the input grid.
```python

from typing import List, Tuple

"""
Transforms a 1D grid by relocating the white space between the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (mobile block) and the next non-white pixel (anchor pixel). This separating white space is moved to the beginning of the grid, effectively shifting the mobile block adjacent to the anchor pixel.

1. Identify the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (mobile block).
2. Identify the first non-white pixel appearing after the mobile block (anchor pixel).
3. Identify the sequence of white pixels between the mobile block and the anchor pixel (separating whitespace).
4. Construct the output grid by concatenating: separating whitespace, original leading whitespace, mobile block, anchor pixel, and original trailing whitespace.
