task_description: Relocates whitespace segments within a 1D grid based on object proximity.
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1xN (N=20 in examples)
  output: 1xN (Same as input)
objects:
  - object_id: leading_whitespace
    color: white (0)
    description: Sequence of zero or more white pixels at the start of the grid, preceding the mobile_block.
    location: Variable start (index 0), ends just before mobile_block.
  - object_id: mobile_block
    color: any non-white color(s)
    description: The first contiguous sequence of one or more non-white pixels in the grid. Can be monochromatic or potentially multi-colored (though examples only show monochromatic).
    location: Variable start and end. Identified by finding the first non-white pixel and continuing until the first white pixel is encountered.
  - object_id: separating_whitespace
    color: white (0)
    description: Sequence of zero or more white pixels located immediately after the mobile_block and before the anchor_pixel.
    location: Starts immediately after mobile_block ends, ends just before anchor_pixel.
  - object_id: anchor_pixel
    color: any non-white color
    description: The first single non-white pixel found after the mobile_block (and after any separating_whitespace). Acts as a positional reference. Must exist based on examples.
    location: Variable index, found by searching from the end of the mobile_block.
  - object_id: trailing_whitespace
    color: white (0)
    description: Sequence of zero or more white pixels located after the anchor_pixel, extending to the end of the grid.
    location: Starts immediately after anchor_pixel, ends at the last index of the grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: In the input, the sequence is leading_whitespace -> mobile_block -> separating_whitespace -> anchor_pixel -> trailing_whitespace. Some segments (like leading/separating/trailing whitespace) can be empty.
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: In the output, the sequence is separating_whitespace -> leading_whitespace -> mobile_block -> anchor_pixel -> trailing_whitespace. The mobile_block becomes directly adjacent to the anchor_pixel.
actions:
  - action: identify_segment
    target: mobile_block
    criteria: Find the start index of the first non-white pixel. Find the end index (exclusive) which is the index of the first white pixel encountered at or after the start index.
  - action: identify_segment
    target: anchor_pixel
    criteria: Find the index of the first non-white pixel at or after the end index of the mobile_block.
  - action: extract_segment
    target: leading_whitespace
    criteria: All pixels from the start of the grid up to the start index of the mobile_block.
  - action: extract_segment
    target: separating_whitespace
    criteria: All pixels from the end index of the mobile_block up to the index of the anchor_pixel.
  - action: extract_segment
    target: trailing_whitespace
    criteria: All pixels from the index immediately after the anchor_pixel to the end of the grid.
  - action: reconstruct_grid
    order: [separating_whitespace, leading_whitespace, mobile_block, [anchor_pixel], trailing_whitespace]
    description: Concatenate the identified and extracted segments in the specified new order to form the output grid.
