## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: moving the white space located between a primary block of non-white pixels and a subsequent single non-white pixel (anchor) to the beginning of the grid. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" likely stems from an incorrect condition within the `find_first_non_white_block` helper function. Specifically, the condition `(i > start_index and pixel != grid_1d[start_index])` was intended to detect the end of the block but incorrectly assumes the block must be monochromatic. It should only stop when a white pixel (`0`) is encountered after the block starts.

The strategy is to correct the logic for identifying the end of the "mobile block" to simply check for the first occurrence of a white pixel (`0`) after the block has started.

## Metrics

Let's re-evaluate the components based on the refined understanding for each example:

**Example 1:**
*   Input: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   Leading Whitespace: `[0, 0]` (Indices 0-1)
*   Mobile Block: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]` (Indices 2-10). Corrected logic: Starts at index 2 (non-white `7`). Ends at index 11 (first `0` encountered).
*   Anchor Pixel: `9` at index 13. Corrected logic: First non-white pixel after index 11 is `9` at index 13.
*   Separating Whitespace: `[0, 0]` (Indices 11-12). Pixels between mobile block end (11) and anchor index (13).
*   Trailing Whitespace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Indices 14-19). Pixels after anchor index (13).
*   Output Construction: Separating `[0, 0]` + Leading `[0, 0]` + Mobile `[7..7]` + Anchor `[9]` + Trailing `[0..0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches Expected Output)

**Example 2:**
*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]`
*   Leading Whitespace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Indices 0-8)
*   Mobile Block: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` (Indices 9-15). Corrected logic: Starts at index 9 (non-white `4`). Ends at index 16 (first `0` encountered).
*   Anchor Pixel: `9` at index 18. Corrected logic: First non-white pixel after index 16 is `9` at index 18.
*   Separating Whitespace: `[0, 0]` (Indices 16-17). Pixels between mobile block end (16) and anchor index (18).
*   Trailing Whitespace: `[0]` (Index 19). Pixels after anchor index (18).
*   Output Construction: Separating `[0, 0]` + Leading `[0..0]` + Mobile `[4..4]` + Anchor `[9]` + Trailing `[0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]` (Matches Expected Output)

**Example 3:**
*   Input: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]`
*   Leading Whitespace: `[]` (No leading white pixels)
*   Mobile Block: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` (Indices 0-15). Corrected logic: Starts at index 0 (non-white `4`). Ends at index 16 (first `0` encountered).
*   Anchor Pixel: `9` at index 18. Corrected logic: First non-white pixel after index 16 is `9` at index 18.
*   Separating Whitespace: `[0, 0]` (Indices 16-17). Pixels between mobile block end (16) and anchor index (18).
*   Trailing Whitespace: `[0]` (Index 19). Pixels after anchor index (18).
*   Output Construction: Separating `[0, 0]` + Leading `[]` + Mobile `[4..4]` + Anchor `[9]` + Trailing `[0]` = `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]` (Matches Expected Output)

The corrected logic holds true for all training examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first non-white pixel. This marks the start of the "mobile block".
2.  Continue scanning from the start of the mobile block to find the first white pixel (`0`). This marks the end (exclusive index) of the "mobile block". Extract the sequence of pixels constituting the mobile block.
3.  Identify the "leading whitespace" as all pixels from the beginning of the grid up to the start of the mobile block.
4.  Scan the grid starting from the end of the mobile block to find the next non-white pixel. This is the "anchor pixel". Record its value and index.
5.  Identify the "separating whitespace" as all pixels between the end of the mobile block and the index of the anchor pixel.
6.  Identify the "trailing whitespace" as all pixels from the index immediately following the anchor pixel to the end of the grid.
7.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the identified parts in the following order:
    a.  The separating whitespace.
    b.  The leading whitespace.
    c.  The mobile block.
    d.  The anchor pixel.
    e.  The trailing whitespace.
8.  The resulting sequence is the final output grid.
