"""
Transforms a 1D grid by relocating the white space between the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (mobile block) and the next non-white pixel (anchor pixel). This separating white space is moved to the beginning of the grid, effectively shifting the mobile block adjacent to the anchor pixel.

1. Identify the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (mobile block).
2. Identify the first non-white pixel appearing after the mobile block (anchor pixel).
3. Identify the sequence of white pixels between the mobile block and the anchor pixel (separating whitespace).
4. Construct the output grid by concatenating: separating whitespace, original leading whitespace, mobile block, anchor pixel, and original trailing whitespace.
