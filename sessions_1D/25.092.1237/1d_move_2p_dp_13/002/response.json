            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: moving the white space located between a primary block of non-white pixels and a subsequent single non-white pixel (anchor) to the beginning of the grid. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" likely stems from an incorrect condition within the `find_first_non_white_block` helper function. Specifically, the condition `(i > start_index and pixel != grid_1d[start_index])` was intended to detect the end of the block but incorrectly assumes the block must be monochromatic. It should only stop when a white pixel (`0`) is encountered after the block starts.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the logic for identifying the end of the \"mobile block\" to simply check for the first occurrence of a white pixel (`0`) after the block has started.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's re-evaluate the components based on the refined understanding for each example:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   Leading Whitespace: `[0, 0]` (Indices 0-1)\n*   Mobile Block: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]` (Indices 2-10). Corrected logic: Starts at index 2 (non-white `7`). Ends at index 11 (first `0` encountered).\n*   Anchor Pixel: `9` at index 13. Corrected logic: First non-white pixel after index 11 is `9` at index 13.\n*   Separating Whitespace: `[0, 0]` (Indices 11-12). Pixels between mobile block end (11) and anchor index (13).\n*   Trailing Whitespace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Indices 14-19). Pixels after anchor index (13).\n*   Output Construction: Separating `[0, 0]` + Leading `[0, 0]` + Mobile `[7..7]` + Anchor `[9]` + Trailing `[0..0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches Expected Output)\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]`\n*   Leading Whitespace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Indices 0-8)\n*   Mobile Block: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` (Indices 9-15). Corrected logic: Starts at index 9 (non-white `4`). Ends at index 16 (first `0` encountered).\n*   Anchor Pixel: `9` at index 18. Corrected logic: First non-white pixel after index 16 is `9` at index 18.\n*   Separating Whitespace: `[0, 0]` (Indices 16-17). Pixels between mobile block end (16) and anchor index (18).\n*   Trailing Whitespace: `[0]` (Index 19). Pixels after anchor index (18).\n*   Output Construction: Separating `[0, 0]` + Leading `[0..0]` + Mobile `[4..4]` + Anchor `[9]` + Trailing `[0]` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]` (Matches Expected Output)\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]`\n*   Leading Whitespace: `[]` (No leading white pixels)\n*   Mobile Block: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` (Indices 0-15). Corrected logic: Starts at index 0 (non-white `4`). Ends at index 16 (first `0` encountered).\n*   Anchor Pixel: `9` at index 18. Corrected logic: First non-white pixel after index 16 is `9` at index 18.\n*   Separating Whitespace: `[0, 0]` (Indices 16-17). Pixels between mobile block end (16) and anchor index (18).\n*   Trailing Whitespace: `[0]` (Index 19). Pixels after anchor index (18).\n*   Output Construction: Separating `[0, 0]` + Leading `[]` + Mobile `[4..4]` + Anchor `[9]` + Trailing `[0]` = `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]` (Matches Expected Output)\n\nThe corrected logic holds true for all training examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
