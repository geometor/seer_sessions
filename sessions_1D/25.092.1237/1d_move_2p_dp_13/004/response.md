## General Assessment:

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: identify a 'mobile block' of non-white pixels, an 'anchor pixel' (the next non-white pixel), and the 'separating whitespace' between them. The transformation involves moving this separating whitespace to the beginning of the grid.

The error reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") likely arose from the execution environment potentially using NumPy arrays, where element-wise comparisons yield boolean arrays instead of single booleans expected by standard Python `if` statements. Although the provided Python code used list operations and comparisons correctly on individual elements, ensuring the input is explicitly handled as a Python list (`list(input_grid[0])`) should prevent this ambiguity if NumPy arrays are passed internally.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the segmentation logic holds across all training examples by gathering metrics.
2.  Refine the implementation to explicitly convert the input row to a list, ensuring standard Python list operations.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for clarity and accuracy based on the metrics.

## Natural Language Program:

1.  Examine the input grid (a single row of pixels) from left to right.
2.  Identify the pixels constituting the "leading whitespace": the sequence of white (0) pixels from the start of the grid up to the first non-white pixel. If the grid starts with a non-white pixel, the leading whitespace is empty.
3.  Identify the "mobile block": the first contiguous sequence of one or more non-white pixels. Note its start and end positions.
4.  Identify the "anchor pixel": find the *first* non-white pixel that appears *after* the end of the mobile block. Note its value and position.
5.  Identify the "separating whitespace": the sequence of white (0) pixels located strictly between the end of the mobile block and the position of the anchor pixel. This sequence might be empty if the anchor pixel immediately follows the mobile block.
6.  Identify the "trailing whitespace": the sequence of white (0) pixels from the position immediately after the anchor pixel to the end of the grid. This sequence might be empty.
7.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the identified segments in the following order:
    a.  The separating whitespace.
    b.  The leading whitespace.
    c.  The mobile block pixels.
    d.  The anchor pixel.
    e.  The trailing whitespace.
8.  The resulting grid will have the same dimensions and the same count of each pixel color as the input grid, but the segments will be rearranged.
