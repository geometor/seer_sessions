task_description: Rearrange segments of a 1D grid by moving the white space between the first non-white block and the subsequent non-white pixel to the beginning of the grid.
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1xN (N=20 in examples)
  output: 1xN (N=20 in examples)
objects:
  - object_id: leading_whitespace
    color: white (0)
    description: Sequence of zero or more white pixels at the start of the input grid. (Length: 2, 9, 0 in examples)
    location: Indices from 0 up to (but not including) the start of the mobile_block.
  - object_id: mobile_block
    color: Any non-white color (orange=7, yellow=4 in examples)
    description: The first contiguous sequence of one or more non-white pixels. (Length: 9, 7, 16 in examples)
    location: Identified by its start and end indices.
  - object_id: separating_whitespace
    color: white (0)
    description: Sequence of zero or more white pixels immediately following the mobile_block and preceding the anchor_pixel. (Length: 2, 2, 2 in examples)
    location: Indices between the end of mobile_block and the index of anchor_pixel.
  - object_id: anchor_pixel
    color: Any non-white color (maroon=9 in all examples)
    description: The first non-white pixel found after the mobile_block. Its color might be different from the mobile_block.
    location: Specific index after the mobile_block and separating_whitespace.
  - object_id: trailing_whitespace
    color: white (0)
    description: Sequence of zero or more white pixels following the anchor_pixel to the end of the grid. (Length: 6, 1, 1 in examples)
    location: Indices from anchor_pixel index + 1 to the end of the grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: In the input, the segments appear in the order: [leading_whitespace], mobile_block, [separating_whitespace], anchor_pixel, [trailing_whitespace]. Brackets indicate optional segments (length >= 0).
  - type: relative_position
    description: The anchor_pixel is the *first* non-white pixel encountered *after* the mobile_block ends.
actions:
  - action: segment_identification
    description: Identify the five segments (leading_whitespace, mobile_block, separating_whitespace, anchor_pixel, trailing_whitespace) based on contiguous color patterns. Handle cases where leading or separating whitespace might be empty.
    steps:
      1. Find start and end of the first non-white block (mobile_block).
      2. Define leading_whitespace before the block start.
      3. Find the index of the first non-white pixel after the block end (anchor_pixel).
      4. Define separating_whitespace between block end and anchor index.
      5. Define trailing_whitespace after the anchor index.
  - action: reconstruction
    description: Assemble the output grid by rearranging the identified segments.
    order: separating_whitespace + leading_whitespace + mobile_block + [anchor_pixel] + trailing_whitespace.
