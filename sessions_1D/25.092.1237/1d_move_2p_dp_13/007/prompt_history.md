## Perception of Elements:

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional grid of pixels based on the relative positions of colored elements. The input grid contains sequences of white pixels (0), a contiguous block of orange pixels (7), and a single maroon pixel (9). The output grid rearranges these elements while preserving the total count of each color and the overall grid size. The core transformation seems to involve shifting the orange block towards the maroon pixel, eliminating the white space between them, and relocating that white space to the beginning of the grid.

## Natural Language Program:

1.  Identify the main contiguous block of non-white pixels (the "mobile block").
2.  Identify the single, different non-white pixel located to the right of the mobile block (the "anchor pixel").
3.  Identify the sequence of white pixels positioned directly between the end of the mobile block and the anchor pixel (the "separating whitespace").
4.  Count the number of pixels in the separating whitespace.
5.  Construct the output grid:
    a.  Place the separating whitespace at the beginning of the grid.
    b.  Append any white pixels that originally preceded the mobile block in the input grid.
    c.  Append the mobile block.
    d.  Append the anchor pixel.
    e.  Append any white pixels that originally followed the anchor pixel in the input grid.

"""
Transforms a 1D grid by relocating the white space between the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (mobile block) and the next non-white pixel (anchor pixel). This separating white space is moved to the beginning of the grid, effectively shifting the mobile block adjacent to the anchor pixel.

1. Identify the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (mobile block).
2. Identify the first non-white pixel appearing after the mobile block (anchor pixel).
3. Identify the sequence of white pixels between the mobile block and the anchor pixel (separating whitespace).
4. Construct the output grid by concatenating: separating whitespace, original leading whitespace, mobile block, anchor pixel, and original trailing whitespace.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The core logic identified in the previous phase appears correct based on manual analysis of the training examples. The transformation involves segmenting the 1D input grid into five parts: leading whitespace, the first non-white block (mobile block), the whitespace between the mobile block and the next non-white pixel (separating whitespace), that next non-white pixel (anchor pixel), and the trailing whitespace. The output is formed by rearranging these segments: separating whitespace + leading whitespace + mobile block + anchor pixel + trailing whitespace.

The error reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly suggests an issue with how the input data (potentially NumPy arrays within the list structure) is being handled in boolean contexts within the Python code, rather than a fundamental flaw in the transformation logic itself.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Ensure Robust Input Handling:** Modify the code to explicitly convert the input row `input_grid[0]` into a standard Python `list` at the beginning of the `transform` function. This prevents NumPy array ambiguity errors in subsequent list operations and comparisons. The last provided version of the code already incorporates `grid_1d = list(input_grid[0])`, which should address this.
2.  **Verify Segmentation Logic:** Use code execution to confirm that the helper functions (`find_first_non_white_block_indices`, `find_first_non_white_after_index`) correctly identify the start/end indices for the mobile block and the index for the anchor pixel in all training examples.
3.  **Confirm Segment Extraction:** Verify that the slicing operations correctly extract the five segments (leading whitespace, mobile block, separating whitespace, anchor pixel, trailing whitespace) based on the identified indices.
4.  **Validate Reconstruction:** Ensure the concatenation of these segments in the specified order produces the exact output grid for each training example.
5.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for maximum clarity and accuracy, reflecting the verified segmentation and rearrangement process.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the segmentation logic programmatically for each example.

```
The code execution confirms that the segmentation logic correctly identifies all five segments (leading whitespace, mobile block, separating whitespace, anchor pixel, trailing whitespace) for all three training examples. Furthermore, reconstructing the grid by concatenating these segments in the order `separating_whitespace + leading_whitespace + mobile_block + anchor_pixel + trailing_whitespace` successfully reproduces the expected output grid for each example. This strongly indicates the core transformation logic is correct and the previous execution error was due to input type handling.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Parse Input:** Treat the input grid as a single row (a 1D list) of pixels.
2.  **Identify Segments:** Scan the row from left to right and identify the following five consecutive segments:
    a.  **Leading Whitespace:** The initial sequence of zero or more white (0) pixels.
    b.  **Mobile Block:** The first contiguous sequence of one or more non-white (non-0) pixels.
    c.  **Separating Whitespace:** The sequence of zero or more white (0) pixels immediately following the Mobile Block.
    d.  **Anchor Pixel:** The single non-white (non-0) pixel immediately following the Separating Whitespace.
    e.  **Trailing Whitespace:** The final sequence of zero or more white (0) pixels following the Anchor Pixel, extending to the end of the row.
3.  **Handle Edge Cases:** If no Mobile Block is found (e.g., the grid is all white), or if no Anchor Pixel is found after the Mobile Block, the grid remains unchanged.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create the output row by concatenating the identified segments in a new order: Separating Whitespace, then Leading Whitespace, then Mobile Block, then Anchor Pixel, then Trailing Whitespace.
5.  **Format Output:** Ensure the output is presented in the same format as the input (a list containing a single list representing the row).
