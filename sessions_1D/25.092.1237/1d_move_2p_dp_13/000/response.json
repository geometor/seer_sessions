The input grid contains sequences of white pixels (0), a contiguous block of orange pixels (7), and a single maroon pixel (9). The output grid rearranges these elements while preserving the total count of each color and the overall grid size. The core transformation seems to involve shifting the orange block towards the maroon pixel, eliminating the white space between them, and relocating that white space to the beginning of the grid.\n\n## YAML Facts:\n\n"
