task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D grid based on object proximity.
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1x20
  output: 1x20
objects:
  - object_id: leading_whitespace
    color: white (0)
    location: Indices 0-1 in input, 0-3 in output
    description: Sequence of white pixels at the start of the grid.
  - object_id: mobile_block
    color: orange (7)
    pixels: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
    location: Indices 2-10 in input, 4-12 in output
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - object_id: separating_whitespace
    color: white (0)
    pixels: [0, 0]
    location: Indices 11-12 in input, absent between mobile_block and anchor_pixel in output (relocated to beginning)
    description: Sequence of white pixels between the mobile_block and the anchor_pixel.
  - object_id: anchor_pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    pixels: [9]
    location: Index 13 in both input and output
    description: A single non-white pixel, distinct from the mobile_block, acting as a positional reference.
  - object_id: trailing_whitespace
    color: white (0)
    location: Indices 14-19 in both input and output
    description: Sequence of white pixels at the end of the grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [mobile_block, separating_whitespace, anchor_pixel]
    description: In the input, the mobile_block is followed by separating_whitespace, which is followed by the anchor_pixel.
  - type: spatial
    between: [mobile_block, anchor_pixel]
    description: In the output, the mobile_block is immediately adjacent to the anchor_pixel.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: mobile_block
    criteria: Contiguous block of non-white pixels preceding the anchor_pixel.
  - action: identify
    target: anchor_pixel
    criteria: Single non-white pixel located to the right of the mobile_block.
  - action: identify
    target: separating_whitespace
    criteria: White pixels located between the mobile_block and the anchor_pixel.
  - action: relocate
    target: separating_whitespace
    destination: Prepend to the leading_whitespace at the beginning of the grid.
  - action: shift
    target: mobile_block
    direction: right
    magnitude: Number of pixels in separating_whitespace
    result: mobile_block becomes adjacent to anchor_pixel.
  - action: maintain_position
    target: anchor_pixel
    description: The anchor pixel's absolute position remains unchanged.
  - action: maintain_relative_position
    target: trailing_whitespace
    description: The trailing whitespace remains at the end of the grid.
