The transformation reconstructs the grid by rearranging these segments: the separating whitespace is moved to the beginning, followed by the original leading whitespace, the mobile block, the anchor pixel, and finally the trailing whitespace.\n\n1.  Scan the input grid to find the start and end indices of the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (the \"mobile block\").\n2.  Identify the \"leading whitespace\" as pixels before the mobile block start.\n3.  Scan from the end of the mobile block to find the index and value of the next non-white pixel (the \"anchor pixel\").\n4.  Identify the \"separating whitespace\" as the white pixels between the mobile block's end and the anchor pixel's index.\n5.  Identify the \"trailing whitespace\" as pixels after the anchor pixel.\n6.  Construct the output grid by concatenating: separating whitespace, leading whitespace, mobile block pixels, the anchor pixel, and trailing whitespace.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef find_first_non_white_block_indices(grid_1d: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start index (inclusive) and end index (exclusive) of the \n    first contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple[int, int]: (start_index, end_index).
