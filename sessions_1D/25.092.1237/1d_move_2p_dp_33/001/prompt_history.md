Okay, let's break down the transformation based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 1xN grids (essentially 1D arrays or rows). The size of the grid remains constant between input and output.
2.  **Key Colors/Objects:**
    *   **Background:** White pixels (0) seem to act as a background or padding.
    *   **Main Block:** There is always a contiguous block of a single color other than white (0) or maroon (9). In the examples, this is red (2) or magenta (6).
    *   **Target Pixel:** There is always a single maroon pixel (9).
3.  **Arrangement in Input:** The general structure in the input appears to be:
    *   An initial sequence of white pixels (prefix).
    *   The main block of non-white, non-maroon pixels.
    *   A sequence of white pixels (separator).
    *   The single maroon pixel (target).
    *   A final sequence of white pixels (suffix).
    `[Prefix Whites] [Main Block] [Separator Whites] [Target Pixel] [Suffix Whites]`
4.  **Arrangement in Output:** The structure changes in the output:
    *   The prefix whites and the separator whites are combined at the beginning.
    *   The main block immediately follows the combined white pixels.
    *   The target pixel (maroon) immediately follows the main block.
    *   The suffix whites remain at the end.
    `[Prefix Whites + Separator Whites] [Main Block] [Target Pixel] [Suffix Whites]`
5.  **Core Transformation:** The essential change is the relocation of the white pixels that were originally between the main block and the maroon pixel. These "separator" white pixels are moved to the start of the grid, effectively joining the original prefix white pixels. This results in the main block and the maroon pixel becoming adjacent. The relative order of the main block, the maroon pixel, and the suffix whites is preserved, as is the content of the main block itself.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the main contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor maroon (9).
2.  Identify the single maroon (9) pixel.
3.  Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels located immediately before the main block (prefix whites).
4.  Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels located immediately after the main block and before the maroon (9) pixel (separator whites).
5.  Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels located immediately after the maroon (9) pixel (suffix whites).
6.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the following elements in order: the prefix whites, the separator whites, the main block, the maroon (9) pixel, and the suffix whites.
