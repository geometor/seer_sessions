task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are 1xN grids
element_conservation:
  - color: white (0) # Number of white pixels is conserved
  - color: main_block_color (e.g., red(2), magenta(6)) # The main block itself is conserved
  - color: maroon (9) # The single maroon pixel is conserved
objects:
  - id: main_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels, color is not white(0) or maroon(9).
    properties:
      - color: varies (e.g., red(2), magenta(6))
      - contiguity: true
  - id: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel with color maroon(9).
  - id: prefix_whites
    description: Contiguous sequence of white(0) pixels at the beginning of the grid, preceding the main_block. Can be empty.
  - id: separator_whites
    description: Contiguous sequence of white(0) pixels located between the main_block and the target_pixel. Can be empty (though not in examples shown).
  - id: suffix_whites
    description: Contiguous sequence of white(0) pixels located after the target_pixel. Can be empty.

      The elements appear in the input grid in the order:
      prefix_whites, main_block, separator_whites, target_pixel, suffix_whites.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: main_block, target_pixel, prefix_whites, separator_whites, suffix_whites
    description: Locate these distinct segments within the input grid based on color and position relative to each other.
  - action: move
    element: separator_whites
    destination: Prepend to the prefix_whites.
  - action: reconstruct
    description: Assemble the output grid by concatenating the elements in the new order.
    new_order: [prefix_whites, separator_whites, main_block, target_pixel, suffix_whites]
