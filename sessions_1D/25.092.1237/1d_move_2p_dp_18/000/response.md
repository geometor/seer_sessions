Okay, let's analyze the provided example to understand the transformation.

### Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids). In this case, the size is 1x17.
2.  **Colors**: Three colors are present: white (0), orange (7), and blue (1).
3.  **Objects**:
    *   **Background**: White (0) pixels form the background.
    *   **Orange Block**: A contiguous block of orange (7) pixels exists. In the input, it's `7 7 7 7 7 7 7`.
    *   **Blue Marker**: A single blue (1) pixel exists.
4.  **Arrangement (Input)**: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 1 0]`
    *   The orange block starts at index 6 and ends at index 12 (length 7).
    *   The blue marker is at index 15.
    *   There are two white pixels between the orange block and the blue marker (at indices 13 and 14).
5.  **Arrangement (Output)**: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 1 0]`
    *   The orange block starts at index 8 and ends at index 14 (length 7).
    *   The blue marker is still at index 15.
    *   There are zero white pixels between the orange block and the blue marker; they are now adjacent.
6.  **Transformation**: The orange block has shifted two positions to the right. The blue marker and the grid dimensions remain unchanged. The shift appears purposeful: the orange block moves right until it becomes adjacent to the blue marker. The space originally occupied by the orange block (indices 6, 7) is filled with the background color (white).

### Facts


```yaml
Task: Move a block adjacent to a marker
Input: 1x17 grid
Output: 1x17 grid

Elements:
  - Background:
      Color: White (0)
      Role: Fills empty space
  - Movable_Block:
      Color: Orange (7)
      Shape: Contiguous horizontal line
      Input_Position: Indices 6-12
      Length: 7
      Role: Object to be moved
  - Marker_Pixel:
      Color: Blue (1)
      Shape: Single pixel
      Position: Index 15 (constant)
      Role: Target for adjacency

Relationships:
  - Input: Movable_Block is separated from Marker_Pixel by 2 Background pixels.
  - Output: Movable_Block is immediately to the left of (adjacent to) Marker_Pixel.

Action:
  - Type: Shift / Translation
  - Object: Movable_Block
  - Direction: Rightwards
  - Termination_Condition: Right edge of Movable_Block becomes adjacent to the left edge of Marker_Pixel.
  - Consequence: Original position of Movable_Block is filled with Background color.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the background color (typically white/0).
2.  Identify the unique 'marker' pixel (blue/1) and note its fixed position.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of a single color that is neither the background nor the marker (the 'movable block'). Note its color, starting position, and length.
4.  Determine the target end position for the movable block: it should be the position immediately to the left of the marker pixel.
5.  Calculate the target start position for the movable block based on its length and the target end position.
6.  Construct the output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with the background color.
7.  Place the marker pixel in the output grid at its original, fixed position.
8.  Place the movable block (using its identified color) in the output grid, starting at the calculated target start position and extending for its original length.
