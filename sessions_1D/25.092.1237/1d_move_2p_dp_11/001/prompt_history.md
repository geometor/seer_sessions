Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both 1D arrays (representing rows of a grid) containing integers from 0 to 9. Each example features:
1.  A background of white pixels (0).
2.  A single blue pixel (1).
3.  A contiguous block of pixels of another color (azure '8', green '3', orange '7').
4.  In the input, there is always a gap of two white pixels (0) between the right edge of the colored block and the single blue pixel.
5.  In the output, the colored block has shifted to the right, closing the gap so it is immediately adjacent to the left of the blue pixel.
6.  The blue pixel and all other white pixels maintain their absolute positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored block adjacent to a specific marker pixel.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills space
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    count: 1
    role: acts as a fixed anchor point for the transformation
  - type: colored_block
    color: non-white, non-blue (changes per example: 8, 3, 7)
    shape: contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1
    role: object to be moved
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: marker_pixel
    input_state: colored_block is to the left of marker_pixel, separated by a gap of two white pixels.
    output_state: colored_block is immediately to the left of (adjacent to) marker_pixel.
actions:
  - type: translation
    target: colored_block
    direction: right
    magnitude: determined by the gap size (always 2 in the examples)
    condition: Shift until adjacent to the marker_pixel.
invariants:
  - position of marker_pixel (blue)
  - position of all white pixels not part of the initial gap between the colored_block and marker_pixel
  - color and size of the colored_block
  - color of the marker_pixel
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single blue pixel (1) in the input row. Note its position.
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white, non-blue pixels located to the left of the blue pixel.
3.  Determine the number of white pixels (0) between the rightmost pixel of the colored block and the blue pixel. Let this number be `gap_size`.
4.  Create the output row, initially identical to the input row.
5.  Shift the identified colored block `gap_size` positions to the right in the output row. This involves:
    *   Changing the original positions occupied by the colored block to white (0).
    *   Changing the `gap_size` white pixels immediately to the left of the blue pixel to the color of the colored block.
    *   Changing the positions immediately to the right of the original colored block (which were previously white gap pixels) to the color of the colored block, effectively moving the block rightwards.
6.  Ensure the blue pixel and all other pixels remain unchanged from their input positions.
