Each example features:\n1.  A background of white pixels (0).\n2.  A single blue pixel (1).\n3.  A contiguous block of pixels of another color (azure '8', green '3', orange '7').\n4.  In the input, there is always a gap of two white pixels (0) between the right edge of the colored block and the single blue pixel.\n5.  In the output, the colored block has shifted to the right, closing the gap so it is immediately adjacent to the left of the blue pixel.\n6.  The blue pixel and all other white pixels maintain their absolute positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the number of white pixels (0) between the rightmost pixel of the colored block and the blue pixel. Let this number be `gap_size`.\n4.  Create the output row, initially identical to the input row.\n5.  Shift the identified colored block `gap_size` positions to the right in the output row.

Ensure the blue pixel and all other pixels remain unchanged from their input positions."
