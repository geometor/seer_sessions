task_description: Shift a colored block adjacent to a specific marker pixel.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills space
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    count: 1
    role: acts as a fixed anchor point for the transformation
  - type: colored_block
    color: non-white, non-blue (changes per example: 8, 3, 7)
    shape: contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1
    role: object to be moved
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entity1: colored_block
    entity2: marker_pixel
    input_state: colored_block is to the left of marker_pixel, separated by a gap of two white pixels.
    output_state: colored_block is immediately to the left of (adjacent to) marker_pixel.
actions:
  - type: translation
    target: colored_block
    direction: right
    magnitude: determined by the gap size (always 2 in the examples)
    condition: Shift until adjacent to the marker_pixel.
invariants:
  - position of marker_pixel (blue)
  - position of all white pixels not part of the initial gap between the colored_block and marker_pixel
  - color and size of the colored_block
  - color of the marker_pixel
