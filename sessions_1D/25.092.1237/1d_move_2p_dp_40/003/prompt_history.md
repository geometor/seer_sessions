Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 1D grids (arrays) of colored pixels, represented by integers 0-9. All examples have the same length (22 pixels).
2.  **Key Colors/Objects:**
    *   **Background:** Color `0` (white) acts as the background or empty space.
    *   **Marker:** Color `7` (orange) appears exactly once in each input and output. It seems to act as a positional marker or anchor.
    *   **Object:** There is a single contiguous block of another non-zero color (1-blue, 3-green, or 8-azure). This block varies in color and length between examples but remains the same color and length from input to output within an example. This block represents the primary 'object' being manipulated.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements in the 1D grid. The object block's position changes relative to the background and the marker. The final arrangement seems determined by characteristics of the input grid, specifically:
    *   The number of leading background pixels in the input.
    *   The number of background pixels immediately preceding the marker pixel (7).
    *   The object block itself.
    *   The marker pixel (7).
    *   The background pixels following the marker pixel.
4.  **Rule Synthesis:** The number of background pixels placed at the beginning of the output grid is the sum of the leading background pixels in the input and the background pixels immediately preceding the marker (7) in the input. The object block follows these initial background pixels, then the marker (7), and finally the background pixels that followed the marker in the input.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the background color (which is 0).
2.  Identify the unique marker color (which is 7).
3.  Identify the remaining non-background color; this is the object color.
4.  Locate the contiguous block of the object color in the input grid.
5.  Locate the position (index) of the marker color (7) in the input grid.
6.  Count the number of leading background pixels (`L`) at the beginning of the input grid (before any non-background pixel).
7.  Count the number of background pixels (`N`) immediately preceding the marker color (7) in the input grid.
8.  Count the number of background pixels (`T`) immediately following the marker color (7) until the end of the input grid.
9.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the following elements in order:
    a.  `L + N` background pixels.
    b.  The object block (identified in step 4).
    c.  The marker color pixel (7).
    d.  `T` background pixels (identified in step 8).
