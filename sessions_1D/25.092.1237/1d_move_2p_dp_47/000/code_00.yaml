task_description: Reorder sequence segments based on a specific marker pattern.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: The input and output are treated as 1D sequences of integers (colors).
  - type: color
    value: 0
    name: white
    role: Background element and part of the marker pattern.
  - type: color
    value: 8
    name: azure
    role: Part of the marker pattern.
  - type: color
    value: [1-7, 9] # Any color other than white or azure
    role: Form contiguous blocks that are repositioned.
objects:
  - id: marker_pair
    type: sequence_segment
    description: A pair of consecutive white pixels [0, 0].
    location: Immediately precedes an azure pixel (8).
  - id: marker_anchor
    type: pixel
    description: An azure pixel (8).
    location: Immediately follows the marker_pair.
  - id: leading_zeros
    type: sequence_segment
    description: An optional contiguous block of white pixels (0) at the beginning of the sequence.
  - id: shifting_block
    type: sequence_segment
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels located between the leading_zeros (or start of sequence) and the marker_pair.
  - id: trailing_elements
    type: sequence_segment
    description: All elements following the marker_anchor (8).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The marker_pair [0, 0] is immediately adjacent to and precedes the marker_anchor [8].
  - type: order
    description: The input sequence generally follows the order: [leading_zeros, shifting_block, marker_pair, marker_anchor, trailing_elements].
actions:
  - type: locate
    target: marker_pair ([0, 0]) and marker_anchor (8)
    condition: Find the first occurrence of the sequence [0, 0, 8].
  - type: identify
    target: leading_zeros
    description: Identify the segment from the start up to the last 0 before the shifting_block begins.
  - type: identify
    target: shifting_block
    description: Identify the segment between the leading_zeros and the marker_pair.
  - type: identify
    target: trailing_elements
    description: Identify the segment starting from the marker_anchor (8) to the end.
  - type: rearrange
    description: Construct the output sequence by concatenating segments in a new order.
