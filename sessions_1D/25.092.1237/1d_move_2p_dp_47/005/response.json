If this marker is not found, return the input list unchanged.\nIdentify the segment corresponding to the [white, white] part of the found marker. This is the slice input[i : i+2]. Call this the `marker_pair`.\nIdentify the segment containing all elements *starting from* the azure (8) pixel of the found marker sequence (i.e., from index i+2) to the end of the list. Call this the `trailing_elements`.\nIdentify the segment containing the initial contiguous block of white (0) pixels at the very beginning of the list. Find the index j of the last pixel in this initial block. If the list does not start with white, this block is empty, and j is effectively -1. Call the segment input[0 : j+1] the `leading_zeros`.\nIdentify the segment of the list that lies *between* the end of the leading_zeros and the start of the marker_pair. This segment starts at index j+1 and ends just before index i. Call this the `shifting_block` (input[j+1 : i]). Note that this block can be empty if j+1 is equal to i.\nConstruct the output list by concatenating the identified segments in the following specific order: leading_zeros + marker_pair + shifting_block + trailing_elements.\nReturn the constructed list as the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_subsequence_index(sequence: List[int], subsequence: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the starting index of the first occurrence of a subsequence within a sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: The main list to search within.\n        subsequence: The list to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        The starting index of the first occurrence of the subsequence, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(sequence) - len(subsequence) + 1):\n        if sequence[i:i + len(subsequence)] == subsequence:\n            return i\n    return -1 # Not found\n\ndef find_last_leading_zero_index(sequence: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the last leading zero (white pixel, value 0) in a sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: The list to search within.\n\n    Returns:\n        The index of the last leading zero, or -1 if the sequence doesn't start with zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    last_zero_index = -1\n    for i, val in enumerate(sequence):\n        if val == 0: # 0 represents white\n            last_zero_index = i\n        else:\n            # Stop as soon as the first non-zero element is encountered\n            break \n    return last_zero_index\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the rearrangement transformation based on the [0, 0, 8] marker.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A flat list representing the input grid's pixels.\n\n    Returns:\n        A flat list representing the transformed grid's pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The input is already a flat list, treat it as the sequence\n    sequence = input_grid\n    \n    # Define the marker sequence to search for\n    marker = [0, 0, 8] # white, white, azure\n    \n    # Step 2: Locate the first occurrence of the marker subsequence [0, 0, 8]\n    marker_start_index = find_subsequence_index(sequence, marker)\n    \n    # Handle cases where the marker might not be found\n    if marker_start_index == -1:\n        # As per the rule, return the original sequence if marker not found\n        return sequence \n\n    # Step 3: Identify the marker_pair segment [0, 0]\n    # This is the part of the sequence at marker_start_index and marker_start_index + 1\n    marker_pair = sequence[marker_start_index : marker_start_index + 2] \n\n    # Step 4: Identify the trailing_elements segment (starts from '8' at marker_start_index + 2)\n    trailing_elements = sequence[marker_start_index + 2 :]\n\n    # Step 5: Identify the leading_zeros segment\n    # Find the index 'j' of the last zero at the very beginning of the sequence\n    last_leading_zero_idx = find_last_leading_zero_index(sequence)\n    # Extract the leading zeros segment.
