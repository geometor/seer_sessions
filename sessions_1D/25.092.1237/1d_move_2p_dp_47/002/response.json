            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: locating a `[0, 0, 8]` marker and rearranging the sequence segments around it. The segments involved are: leading zeros, a block of non-zero/non-marker elements preceding the marker, the `[0, 0]` part of the marker, and the elements following the `[0, 0]` marker (starting with `8`).\n\nThe provided code, however, failed to produce the correct output, returning the input sequence unchanged. This suggests an implementation error rather than a fundamental misunderstanding of the rule. The likely causes are incorrect index calculation by the helper functions, incorrect slicing based on those indices, or an issue causing the function to bypass the transformation logic.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the output of the helper functions (`find_subsequence_index`, `find_last_leading_zero_index`) for each training example.\n2.  Verify the segments extracted using slicing based on the calculated indices.\n3.  Confirm the concatenation step correctly assembles the verified segments.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on verified understanding.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the intermediate steps for each example using the logic from the provided python code.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0]`\nExpected Output: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0]`\n"
