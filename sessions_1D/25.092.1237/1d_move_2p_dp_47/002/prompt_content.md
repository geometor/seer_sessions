Transformation Rule:
Treat the input as a flat sequence. Locate the first occurrence of the marker 
subsequence [white, white, azure] ([0, 0, 8]). Identify the block of 
non-white pixels immediately preceding this marker. Also, identify any block 
of leading white pixels at the start of the sequence. Rearrange the sequence 
so that the [white, white] part of the marker follows the leading white pixels, 
and the block of non-white pixels follows the [white, white] part. The azure 
pixel (8) and all subsequent elements retain their relative order after the 
rearranged segments.
