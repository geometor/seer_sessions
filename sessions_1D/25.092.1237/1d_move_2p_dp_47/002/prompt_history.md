Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are presented as flat lists of integers. Based on the length (21) and the nature of ARC tasks, these likely represent grids. Possible dimensions are 1x21, 3x7, 7x3, or 21x1. However, the transformation seems to operate sequentially on the flattened list, regardless of the 2D layout.
2.  **Colors:** The relevant colors are white (0), azure (8), and other colors (orange (7), green (3), yellow (4)) which form contiguous blocks.
3.  **Key Pattern:** A recurring pattern is the sequence `[white, white, azure]` (or `[0, 0, 8]`). This sequence acts as a marker.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves rearranging segments of the sequence relative to this `[0, 0, 8]` marker. Specifically, the `[0, 0]` part of the marker sequence is moved earlier in the sequence, just after any initial block of zeros. The block of non-zero numbers that originally preceded the `[0, 0]` marker is moved to the position immediately following the relocated `[0, 0]`. Elements after the `8` in the marker sequence remain in their relative order at the end.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Treat the input grid as a flat, one-dimensional sequence of color values.
2.  Locate the first occurrence of the subsequence `[white, white, azure]` (represented as `[0, 0, 8]`). Let the index of the first `white` in this subsequence be `i`.
3.  Identify the segment containing the `[white, white]` pair, which is `input[i : i+2]`. Call this the `marker_pair`.
4.  Identify the segment containing all elements *after* the `marker_pair`, starting from the `azure` pixel. This is `input[i+2 : end]`. Call this the `trailing_elements`.
5.  Identify the segment containing any contiguous block of `white` pixels (0) at the very beginning of the input sequence. Find the index `j` of the last `white` pixel in this initial block. If there are no initial `white` pixels, this block is empty, and `j` is effectively -1. Call this segment `input[0 : j+1]` the `leading_zeros`.
6.  Identify the segment between the `leading_zeros` and the `marker_pair`. This is `input[j+1 : i]`. Call this the `shifting_block`.
7.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the identified segments in the following order: `leading_zeros`, `marker_pair`, `shifting_block`, `trailing_elements`.
8.  Reshape the resulting flat sequence into the original grid dimensions if necessary (although the core logic appears 1D).
