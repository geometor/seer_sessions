White acts as a background or separator.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   There is a contiguous block of a single color (magenta, azure, or orange). Let's call this the \"colored block\".\n    *   There is a single maroon (9) pixel.\n    *   There are white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Spatial Relationships (Input):** In each input, the colored block is followed immediately by exactly two white (0) pixels, which are then followed immediately by the single maroon (9) pixel.\n5.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The relative order of the colored block and the maroon pixel is maintained.\n    *   The two white pixels originally located between the colored block and the maroon pixel are moved to the very beginning of the sequence.\n    *   This effectively makes the colored block and the maroon pixel adjacent in the output and shifts the entire pattern (colored block + maroon pixel) two positions to the right relative to the start of the original sequence.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
