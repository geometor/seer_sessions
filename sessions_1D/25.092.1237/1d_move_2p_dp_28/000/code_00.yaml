task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D
objects:
  - type: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white, non-maroon color.
    color_variable: Yes (magenta, azure, orange in examples)
    size_variable: Yes
  - type: separator
    description: Exactly two white (0) pixels.
    location_context: Immediately follows the 'colored_block'.
  - type: marker
    description: A single maroon (9) pixel.
    location_context: Immediately follows the 'separator'.
  - type: background
    description: White (0) pixels elsewhere in the sequence.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: the sequence pattern [colored_block, white, white, maroon]
  - action: move
    source: the two 'separator' white pixels
    destination: the beginning of the grid sequence
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    context: input
    elements: [colored_block, separator]
    description: The 'separator' immediately follows the 'colored_block'.
  - type: adjacency
    context: input
    elements: [separator, marker]
    description: The 'marker' immediately follows the 'separator'.
  - type: adjacency
    context: output
    elements: [colored_block, marker]
    description: The 'marker' immediately follows the 'colored_block'.
  - type: positional
    context: output vs input
    elements: [colored_block, marker]
    description: The combined [colored_block, marker] pattern appears shifted two positions to the right compared to the start of the 'colored_block' in the input, due to the moved white pixels at the start.
