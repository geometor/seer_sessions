Okay, let's break down the transformation rule for this task.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or can be treated as 1xN grids).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon (9), and one other varying color per example (magenta (6), azure (8), orange (7)). White acts as a background or separator.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   There is a contiguous block of a single color (magenta, azure, or orange). Let's call this the "colored block".
    *   There is a single maroon (9) pixel.
    *   There are white (0) pixels.
4.  **Spatial Relationships (Input):** In each input, the colored block is followed immediately by exactly two white (0) pixels, which are then followed immediately by the single maroon (9) pixel.
5.  **Transformation:**
    *   The relative order of the colored block and the maroon pixel is maintained.
    *   The two white pixels originally located between the colored block and the maroon pixel are moved to the very beginning of the sequence.
    *   This effectively makes the colored block and the maroon pixel adjacent in the output and shifts the entire pattern (colored block + maroon pixel) two positions to the right relative to the start of the original sequence.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D
objects:
  - type: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white, non-maroon color.
    color_variable: Yes (magenta, azure, orange in examples)
    size_variable: Yes
  - type: separator
    description: Exactly two white (0) pixels.
    location_context: Immediately follows the 'colored_block'.
  - type: marker
    description: A single maroon (9) pixel.
    location_context: Immediately follows the 'separator'.
  - type: background
    description: White (0) pixels elsewhere in the sequence.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: the sequence pattern [colored_block, white, white, maroon]
  - action: move
    source: the two 'separator' white pixels
    destination: the beginning of the grid sequence
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    context: input
    elements: [colored_block, separator]
    description: The 'separator' immediately follows the 'colored_block'.
  - type: adjacency
    context: input
    elements: [separator, marker]
    description: The 'marker' immediately follows the 'separator'.
  - type: adjacency
    context: output
    elements: [colored_block, marker]
    description: The 'marker' immediately follows the 'colored_block'.
  - type: positional
    context: output vs input
    elements: [colored_block, marker]
    description: The combined [colored_block, marker] pattern appears shifted two positions to the right compared to the start of the 'colored_block' in the input, due to the moved white pixels at the start.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input sequence to locate a pattern consisting of:
    *   A contiguous block of pixels of any color other than white (0) or maroon (9).
    *   Immediately followed by exactly two white (0) pixels.
    *   Immediately followed by a single maroon (9) pixel.
2.  Identify the two white pixels found between the colored block and the maroon pixel.
3.  Remove these two white pixels from their original position.
4.  Insert these two white pixels at the very beginning of the sequence.
5.  The rest of the sequence remains unchanged in its relative order.

Transformation Rule:

1. Scan the input sequence (a 1D list of integers) to locate a specific pattern.
2. The pattern consists of:
    a. A contiguous block of pixels of any color other than white (0) or maroon (9).
    b. Immediately followed by exactly two white (0) pixels.
    c. Immediately followed by a single maroon (9) pixel.
   This looks like [..., color, color, ..., color, 0, 0, 9, ...].
3. Identify the two white pixels that form the separator between the colored block and the maroon pixel.
4. Remove these two white pixels from their position in the sequence.
5. Insert these two white pixels at the very beginning of the sequence.
6. The relative order of all other pixels remains unchanged.
