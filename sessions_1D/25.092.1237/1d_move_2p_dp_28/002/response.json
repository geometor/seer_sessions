            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code execution resulted in the transformed output being identical to the input for all training examples. This indicates that the core transformation logic within the `transform` function was likely never executed, defaulting to returning the original input. This typically happens if the condition required to perform the transformation (finding the specific pattern `[..., color, 0, 0, 9, ...]`) was not met by the `find_pattern_indices` function.\n\nHowever, a manual review of the `find_pattern_indices` logic and the training examples suggests the function *should* have correctly identified the pattern and the indices of the two white separator pixels in each case.\n\nPossible reasons for the failure include:\n1.  **Input Data Type Mismatch:** The code was written assuming a 1D Python list (`List[int]`), but the ARC environment might provide the input as a 2D NumPy array (e.g., `[[0, 0, ...]]` for a 1xN grid). The function needs to handle this potential discrepancy.\n2.  **Execution Environment Issue:** There might have been an unseen error during the execution in the test harness.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Modify the code to robustly handle input as either a 1D list or a 1xN 2D NumPy array.\n2.  Use `tool_code` to re-verify the pattern-finding logic against the provided string inputs to confirm the core algorithm is sound.\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the input handling and ensure clarity.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to confirm the pattern finding works on the example data when treated as simple lists of integers derived from the strings.\n\n"
