## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code execution resulted in the transformed output being identical to the input for all training examples. This indicates that the core transformation logic within the `transform` function was likely never executed, defaulting to returning the original input. This typically happens if the condition required to perform the transformation (finding the specific pattern `[..., color, 0, 0, 9, ...]`) was not met by the `find_pattern_indices` function.

However, a manual review of the `find_pattern_indices` logic and the training examples suggests the function *should* have correctly identified the pattern and the indices of the two white separator pixels in each case.

Possible reasons for the failure include:
1.  **Input Data Type Mismatch:** The code was written assuming a 1D Python list (`List[int]`), but the ARC environment might provide the input as a 2D NumPy array (e.g., `[[0, 0, ...]]` for a 1xN grid). The function needs to handle this potential discrepancy.
2.  **Execution Environment Issue:** There might have been an unseen error during the execution in the test harness.

**Strategy:**
1.  Modify the code to robustly handle input as either a 1D list or a 1xN 2D NumPy array.
2.  Use `tool_code` to re-verify the pattern-finding logic against the provided string inputs to confirm the core algorithm is sound.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the input handling and ensure clarity.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's use `tool_code` to confirm the pattern finding works on the example data when treated as simple lists of integers derived from the strings.


``` python
import re

def find_pattern_indices_str(input_str: str) -> tuple[int, int] | None:
    """Finds pattern indices from a space-separated string representation."""
    try:
        input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]
        print(f"Input list (len={len(input_list)}): {input_list}")
        # Iterate through the list looking for the sequence [0, 0, 9]
        # The loop range needs to allow checking i, i+1, and i+2
        for i in range(len(input_list) - 2):
            # Check for the [0, 0, 9] sequence
            if input_list[i] == 0 and input_list[i+1] == 0 and input_list[i+2] == 9:
                # Check if the preceding pixel exists (i > 0)
                # and is part of the 'colored block' (not 0 and not 9)
                if i > 0 and input_list[i-1] != 0 and input_list[i-1] != 9:
                    print(f"-> Pattern [color({input_list[i-1]}), 0, 0, 9] found. Indices of zeros: ({i}, {i+1})")
                    return i, i + 1
        print("-> Pattern not found.")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing input string: {e}")
        return None

# Example 1
input_1 = "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
print("--- Verifying Example 1 ---")
find_pattern_indices_str(input_1)

# Example 2
input_2 = "8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 9 0"
print("\n--- Verifying Example 2 ---")
find_pattern_indices_str(input_2)

# Example 3
input_3 = "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0"
print("\n--- Verifying Example 3 ---")
find_pattern_indices_str(input_3)
```
```
--- Verifying Example 1 ---
Input list (len=29): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
-> Pattern [color(6), 0, 0, 9] found. Indices of zeros: (16, 17)

--- Verifying Example 2 ---
Input list (len=29): [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 0]
-> Pattern [color(8), 0, 0, 9] found. Indices of zeros: (25, 26)

--- Verifying Example 3 ---
Input list (len=29): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
-> Pattern [color(7), 0, 0, 9] found. Indices of zeros: (20, 21)

```
**Metrics Analysis:**
The `tool_code` execution confirms that the pattern-finding logic correctly identifies the target sequence `[color, 0, 0, 9]` and the indices of the two white pixels (`0`) within that sequence for all three training examples when treated as 1D lists.

*   Example 1: Pattern `[6, 0, 0, 9]` found, white pixel indices (16, 17).
*   Example 2: Pattern `[8, 0, 0, 9]` found, white pixel indices (25, 26).
*   Example 3: Pattern `[7, 0, 0, 9]` found, white pixel indices (20, 21).

This strongly suggests the issue in the previous run was related to input data type handling (expecting a 1D list but receiving a 2D array) rather than flawed logic. The transformation involves moving the identified pair of white pixels to the beginning of the sequence.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input, which might be a 1D list or a 1xN 2D grid. If it's a 2D grid, flatten it into a 1D sequence.
2.  Scan the 1D sequence to locate a specific pattern: a contiguous block of a single color (not white '0' and not maroon '9'), immediately followed by two white ('0') pixels, immediately followed by one maroon ('9') pixel.
3.  Identify the indices of the two white ('0') pixels that form the separator within this pattern.
4.  Create a new sequence. Start by adding two white ('0') pixels to the beginning of the new sequence.
5.  Append the portion of the original sequence that came *before* the identified separator white pixels to the new sequence.
6.  Append the portion of the original sequence that came *after* the identified separator white pixels (starting with the maroon '9' pixel) to the new sequence.
7.  Return the newly constructed sequence as the output (ensuring it matches the original format, likely a 1D list or equivalent representation).
