task_type: sequence_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid or flattened list)
input_format_assumption: May be 1D list or 2D NumPy array (1xN). Code should handle both.
objects:
  - type: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not maroon (9).
    color_variable: Yes (magenta, azure, orange in examples)
    size_variable: Yes
  - type: separator
    description: Exactly two adjacent white (0) pixels.
    location_context: Immediately follows the 'colored_block'.
  - type: marker
    description: A single maroon (9) pixel.
    location_context: Immediately follows the 'separator'.
  - type: background
    description: Other white (0) pixels not part of the 'separator'.
pattern_identified:
  - structure: [colored_block, separator (0, 0), marker (9)]
  - description: The specific sequence sought within the input.
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: The unique instance of the pattern [color, 0, 0, 9] where color is not 0 or 9.
  - action: identify
    target: The two white (0) pixels within the located pattern (the 'separator').
  - action: remove
    target: The identified 'separator' pixels from their original position.
  - action: insert
    target: The removed 'separator' pixels.
    destination: The beginning (index 0) of the sequence.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    context: input
    elements: [colored_block, separator]
    description: The 'separator' immediately follows the last pixel of the 'colored_block'.
  - type: adjacency
    context: input
    elements: [separator, marker]
    description: The 'marker' immediately follows the second pixel of the 'separator'.
  - type: adjacency
    context: output
    elements: [colored_block, marker]
    description: The 'marker' immediately follows the last pixel of the 'colored_block' due to the removal of the 'separator'.
  - type: positional_change
    elements: [separator]
    description: The two 'separator' pixels move from between 'colored_block' and 'marker' to the start of the sequence.
