Transformation Rule:

1. Scan the input sequence (a 1D list of integers) to locate a specific pattern.
2. The pattern consists of:
    a. A contiguous block of pixels of any color other than white (0) or maroon (9).
    b. Immediately followed by exactly two white (0) pixels.
    c. Immediately followed by a single maroon (9) pixel.
   This looks like [..., color, color, ..., color, 0, 0, 9, ...].
3. Identify the two white pixels that form the separator between the colored block and the maroon pixel.
4. Remove these two white pixels from their position in the sequence.
5. Insert these two white pixels at the very beginning of the sequence.
6. The relative order of all other pixels remains unchanged.
