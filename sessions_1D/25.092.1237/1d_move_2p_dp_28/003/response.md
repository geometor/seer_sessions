Transformation Rule:

1. Accept the input, which might be a 1D list or a 1xN 2D grid (like a NumPy array). If it's a 2D grid, flatten it into a 1D sequence.
2. Scan the 1D sequence to locate a specific pattern: a contiguous block of a single color (not white '0' and not maroon '9'), immediately followed by two white ('0') pixels, immediately followed by one maroon ('9') pixel.
3. Identify the indices of the two white ('0') pixels that form the separator within this pattern.
4. Create a new sequence. Start by adding two white ('0') pixels to the beginning of the new sequence.
5. Append the portion of the original sequence that came *before* the identified separator white pixels to the new sequence.
6. Append the portion of the original sequence that came *after* the identified separator white pixels (starting with the maroon '9' pixel) to the new sequence.
7. Return the newly constructed sequence as the output (as a 1D list).
