In the examples provided, they are 1x12.\n2.  **Colors**: The grids use white (0), blue (1), and one other color (magenta (6) or red (2)).\n3.  **Objects**:\n    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white, non-blue color (e.g., `6 6 6 6 6 6` or `2 2 2`). Let's call this the \"colored block\".\n    *   There is always exactly one blue (1) pixel.\n    *   The remaining pixels are white (0), acting as background.\n4.  **Transformation**:\n    *   Comparing input and output, the colored block appears to shift horizontally to the right.\n    *   The blue pixel remains in the exact same position in the output as it was in the input.\n    *   The amount of shift seems constant across examples.\n        *   Example 1: Magenta block starts at index 1 in input, index 3 in output (shift = +2).\n        *   Example 2: Red block starts at index 0 in input, index 2 in output (shift = +2).\n        *   Example 3: Magenta block starts at index 0 in input, index 2 in output (shift = +2).\n    *   The white pixels fill the space vacated by the colored block on the left and maintain the grid size.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
