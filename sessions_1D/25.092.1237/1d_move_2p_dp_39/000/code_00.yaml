task_description: Shift a colored block right by two positions, keeping a blue pixel fixed.
grid_properties:
  - dimension: 1D (row vector)
  - size: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x12)
objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A single contiguous block of pixels with the same color, which is not white (0) or blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the block (e.g., magenta(6), red(2)).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - initial_start_index: The starting column index in the input grid.
    actions:
      - shifts horizontally to the right by a fixed amount.
  - id: blue_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - index: The column index in the grid.
    actions:
      - remains stationary; its index does not change.
  - id: background_pixels
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
    actions:
      - fill the remaining grid cells not occupied by the colored_block or blue_pixel.
transformation:
  - type: shift
    target: colored_block
    direction: right
    magnitude: 2 positions
  - type: maintain_position
    target: blue_pixel
relationship:
  - The colored_block and blue_pixel occupy distinct positions in the grid.
  - In the output, the colored_block's new position is calculated relative to its input position, independent of the blue_pixel's position (other than ensuring no overlap).
constants:
  - shift_amount: 2
