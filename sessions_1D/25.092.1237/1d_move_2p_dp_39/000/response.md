Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Dimensionality**: The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (rows). In the examples provided, they are 1x12.
2.  **Colors**: The grids use white (0), blue (1), and one other color (magenta (6) or red (2)).
3.  **Objects**:
    *   There is always a single contiguous block of a non-white, non-blue color (e.g., `6 6 6 6 6 6` or `2 2 2`). Let's call this the "colored block".
    *   There is always exactly one blue (1) pixel.
    *   The remaining pixels are white (0), acting as background.
4.  **Transformation**:
    *   Comparing input and output, the colored block appears to shift horizontally to the right.
    *   The blue pixel remains in the exact same position in the output as it was in the input.
    *   The amount of shift seems constant across examples.
        *   Example 1: Magenta block starts at index 1 in input, index 3 in output (shift = +2).
        *   Example 2: Red block starts at index 0 in input, index 2 in output (shift = +2).
        *   Example 3: Magenta block starts at index 0 in input, index 2 in output (shift = +2).
    *   The white pixels fill the space vacated by the colored block on the left and maintain the grid size.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a colored block right by two positions, keeping a blue pixel fixed.
grid_properties:
  - dimension: 1D (row vector)
  - size: Constant between input and output (e.g., 1x12)
objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A single contiguous block of pixels with the same color, which is not white (0) or blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the block (e.g., magenta(6), red(2)).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - initial_start_index: The starting column index in the input grid.
    actions:
      - shifts horizontally to the right by a fixed amount.
  - id: blue_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - index: The column index in the grid.
    actions:
      - remains stationary; its index does not change.
  - id: background_pixels
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
    actions:
      - fill the remaining grid cells not occupied by the colored_block or blue_pixel.
transformation:
  - type: shift
    target: colored_block
    direction: right
    magnitude: 2 positions
  - type: maintain_position
    target: blue_pixel
relationship:
  - The colored_block and blue_pixel occupy distinct positions in the grid.
  - In the output, the colored_block's new position is calculated relative to its input position, independent of the blue_pixel's position (other than ensuring no overlap).
constants:
  - shift_amount: 2
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-blue pixels in the input grid. Record its color, its starting index (`start_index`), and its length (`block_length`).
3.  Identify the index (`blue_index`) of the single blue (1) pixel in the input grid.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the colored block in the output grid: `target_start_index = start_index + 2`.
5.  Place the identified colored block into the output grid, starting at `target_start_index` and extending for `block_length` pixels.
6.  Place the blue (1) pixel into the output grid at its original `blue_index`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
