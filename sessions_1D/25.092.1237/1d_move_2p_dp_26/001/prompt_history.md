Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 1-dimensional grids (represented as 1 row, multiple columns). The length of the grid appears consistent within each example pair (30 columns).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain primarily white pixels (0). There is always a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-yellow color (azure-8, orange-7, blue-1). There is also always exactly one yellow pixel (4).
3.  **Input Pattern:** In the input grids, the main colored block is followed by some white pixels, and then the single yellow pixel. Specifically, the yellow pixel appears 3 positions after the end of the main colored block in all training examples.
4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output grids, the main colored block has shifted its position. The yellow pixel's position relative to the *grid* remains unchanged compared to the input. However, its position relative to the *end* of the main colored block changes; in the output, the yellow pixel is immediately adjacent (1 position after) the end of the main colored block.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a shift of the main colored block. Comparing input and output start/end positions reveals the main colored block shifts exactly two positions to the right. The yellow pixel does *not* shift its absolute position within the grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify a contiguous block of a specific color and a single yellow pixel, then shift the block right while keeping the yellow pixel fixed.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
  size: Consistent within pairs (1x30 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: main_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and yellow (4).
    properties:
      color: Variable (azure-8, orange-7, blue-1 in examples)
      length: Variable
      position: Variable start and end indices.
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single yellow pixel (4).
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      count: Exactly 1 per grid.
      position: Variable index.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    object1: main_block
    object2: marker_pixel
    input_relation: In input grids, marker_pixel is located 3 positions to the right of the end index of main_block.
    output_relation: In output grids, marker_pixel is located 1 position to the right of the end index of main_block.

actions:
  - action: shift
    target: main_block
    details: Shift the entire block 2 positions to the right.
  - action: keep_fixed
    target: marker_pixel
    details: The absolute position (index) of the marker_pixel remains unchanged from input to output.

inferred_rule: The transformation involves shifting the main_block two cells to the right, while the marker_pixel retains its original absolute position within the grid. The background (white pixels) adjusts accordingly.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white - 0).
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of pixels that are not white (0) and not yellow (4). Record its color, starting column index, and ending column index.
3.  Identify the position (column index) of the single yellow pixel (4).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the main block by adding 2 to its original starting column index.
5.  Calculate the new ending column index for the main block by adding 2 to its original ending column index.
6.  Place the main block (using its original color and length) into the output grid at the new calculated start and end indices.
7.  Place the yellow pixel (4) into the output grid at its original column index (the same index it had in the input grid).
