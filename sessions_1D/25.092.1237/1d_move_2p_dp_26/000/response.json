            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 1-dimensional grids (represented as 1 row, multiple columns). The length of the grid appears consistent within each example pair (30 columns).\n2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain primarily white pixels (0). There is always a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-yellow color (azure-8, orange-7, blue-1). There is also always exactly one yellow pixel (4).\n3.  **Input Pattern:** In the input grids, the main colored block is followed by some white pixels, and then the single yellow pixel. Specifically, the yellow pixel appears 3 positions after the end of the main colored block in all training examples.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output grids, the main colored block has shifted its position. The yellow pixel's position relative to the *grid* remains unchanged compared to the input. However, its position relative to the *end* of the main colored block changes; in the output, the yellow pixel is immediately adjacent (1 position after) the end of the main colored block.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a shift of the main colored block. Comparing input and output start/end positions reveals the main colored block shifts exactly two positions to the right. The yellow pixel does *not* shift its absolute position within the grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
