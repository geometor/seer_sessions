task_description: Identify a contiguous block of a specific color and a single yellow pixel, then shift the block right while keeping the yellow pixel fixed.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
  size: Consistent within pairs (1x30 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - id: main_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and yellow (4).
    properties:
      color: Variable (azure-8, orange-7, blue-1 in examples)
      length: Variable
      position: Variable start and end indices.
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single yellow pixel (4).
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      count: Exactly 1 per grid.
      position: Variable index.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    object1: main_block
    object2: marker_pixel
    input_relation: In input grids, marker_pixel is located 3 positions to the right of the end index of main_block.
    output_relation: In output grids, marker_pixel is located 1 position to the right of the end index of main_block.

actions:
  - action: shift
    target: main_block
    details: Shift the entire block 2 positions to the right.
  - action: keep_fixed
    target: marker_pixel
    details: The absolute position (index) of the marker_pixel remains unchanged from input to output.

inferred_rule: The transformation involves shifting the main_block two cells to the right, while the marker_pixel retains its original absolute position within the grid. The background (white pixels) adjusts accordingly.
