            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be flattened representations of 5x5 grids. Each grid contains pixels of white (0), gray (5), and one other color (red=2, green=3, or yellow=4).\n2.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** The white pixels (0) form the background.\n    *   **Marker Object:** There is consistently a single gray pixel (5). Its position remains unchanged between the input and output.\n    *   **Moving Object:** There is a single contiguous block of another color (red, green, or yellow). This object's shape and color remain constant, but its position changes.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the movement of the colored block. Comparing the input and output, the colored block shifts its position. The gray pixel seems to be a fixed point, while the colored block moves relative to the overall grid structure. Specifically, when viewed as a 1D array (flattened grid), the colored block consistently shifts 2 positions to the right (index increases by 2).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Place the gray pixel (color 5) into the new sequence at its original index.\n7.  For each pixel in the colored block identified in step 4, calculate its new index by adding 2 to its original index.\n8.
