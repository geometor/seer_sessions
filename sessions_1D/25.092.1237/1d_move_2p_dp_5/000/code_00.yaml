task_context:
  grid_representation: flattened_1d_array # derived from consistent length 25 and 1D shift logic
  grid_dimensions: [5, 5] # inferred from length 25
  colors_present:
    - white (0) # Background
    - gray (5) # Stationary marker
    - variable_color (2, 3, or 4) # Moving object
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: marker
    color: gray (5)
    quantity: 1
    properties: [stationary]
  - type: moving_shape
    color: variable (non-white, non-gray)
    quantity: 1
    properties: [contiguous, maintains_shape, maintains_color]
transformation:
  action: shift_object_position
  target_object: moving_shape
  reference_object: marker (remains fixed)
  details:
    - representation: flattened_1d_array
    - shift_vector: +2 indices (rightward shift in 1D)
    - wrapping: assumed based on standard 1D indexing applied to 2D grid space
invariants:
  - grid_dimensions
  - color and position of the marker object (gray pixel)
  - color and shape (relative pixel arrangement) of the moving_shape object
variables:
  - color of the moving_shape object
  - initial position of the moving_shape object
  - position of the marker object
