Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be flattened representations of 5x5 grids. Each grid contains pixels of white (0), gray (5), and one other color (red=2, green=3, or yellow=4).
2.  **Objects:**
    *   **Background:** The white pixels (0) form the background.
    *   **Marker Object:** There is consistently a single gray pixel (5). Its position remains unchanged between the input and output.
    *   **Moving Object:** There is a single contiguous block of another color (red, green, or yellow). This object's shape and color remain constant, but its position changes.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the movement of the colored block. Comparing the input and output, the colored block shifts its position. The gray pixel seems to be a fixed point, while the colored block moves relative to the overall grid structure. Specifically, when viewed as a 1D array (flattened grid), the colored block consistently shifts 2 positions to the right (index increases by 2).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: flattened_1d_array # derived from consistent length 25 and 1D shift logic
  grid_dimensions: [5, 5] # inferred from length 25
  colors_present:
    - white (0) # Background
    - gray (5) # Stationary marker
    - variable_color (2, 3, or 4) # Moving object
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: marker
    color: gray (5)
    quantity: 1
    properties: [stationary]
  - type: moving_shape
    color: variable (non-white, non-gray)
    quantity: 1
    properties: [contiguous, maintains_shape, maintains_color]
transformation:
  action: shift_object_position
  target_object: moving_shape
  reference_object: marker (remains fixed)
  details:
    - representation: flattened_1d_array
    - shift_vector: +2 indices (rightward shift in 1D)
    - wrapping: assumed based on standard 1D indexing applied to 2D grid space
invariants:
  - grid_dimensions
  - color and position of the marker object (gray pixel)
  - color and shape (relative pixel arrangement) of the moving_shape object
variables:
  - color of the moving_shape object
  - initial position of the moving_shape object
  - position of the marker object
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the grid dimensions (e.g., 5x5).
2.  Flatten the input grid into a one-dimensional sequence of pixels.
3.  Locate the single gray pixel (color 5) and record its index.
4.  Locate the contiguous block of pixels belonging to the other non-white color (e.g., red, green, or yellow). Record the color and the indices occupied by this block.
5.  Create a new, empty (all white/0) sequence of the same length as the flattened input grid.
6.  Place the gray pixel (color 5) into the new sequence at its original index.
7.  For each pixel in the colored block identified in step 4, calculate its new index by adding 2 to its original index.
8.  Place the color of the block into the new sequence at each calculated new index.
9.  Reshape the new one-dimensional sequence back into the original grid dimensions (e.g., 5x5).
10. Output the resulting grid.
