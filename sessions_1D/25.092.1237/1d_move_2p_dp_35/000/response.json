White seems to be the background color.\n3.  **Objects:** In each input, there is a contiguous block of a single non-white color (yellow, azure, or blue) and a single, isolated red pixel (2). The rest of the grid is filled with the white background color.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** In all inputs, the colored block appears first (reading left-to-right), followed by some white pixels, and then the red pixel.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves shifting the colored block to the right. The red pixel also appears to maintain its position relative *after* the block. Specifically, the white space *between* the colored block and the red pixel in the input disappears in the output, making the block and the red pixel adjacent. The amount of shift corresponds exactly to the number of white pixels initially separating the block and the red pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Count the number of background pixels situated strictly between the end position of the moving block and the position of the marker pixel. Let this count be `N`.\n5.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color.\n6.  Calculate the new start position for the moving block by adding `N` to its original start position.\n7.  Place the moving block (using its original color and length) into the new grid starting at the calculated new start position.\n8.
