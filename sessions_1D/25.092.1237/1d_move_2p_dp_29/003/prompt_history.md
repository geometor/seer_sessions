*   **Perception**: The task operates on a single row (1D grid). The transformation involves rearranging segments of the row based on the position of a specific 'marker' pixel, which is green (3). A contiguous block of non-white pixels located to the left of the green pixel is identified. All white pixels (0) also located to the left of the green pixel are collected. In the output, these collected white pixels are placed first, followed by the identified non-white block, then the green pixel, and finally any pixels that were originally to the right of the green pixel. The relative order and content of the segment to the right of the green pixel remain unchanged. The core operation is a conditional rearrangement of elements preceding the green pixel, consolidating white space at the beginning and pushing the main colored block rightward until it's adjacent to the green pixel.

*   **Facts YAML**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: rearrangement_1d
    grid_dimensionality: 1
    elements:
      - pixels:
          colors_present: [white(0), red(2), green(3), yellow(4), azure(8)] # Based on all examples
          marker_pixel: green(3)
      - blocks:
          definition: contiguous sequence of same-colored pixels
          types:
            - white_block: consists of white(0) pixels
            - colored_block: consists of non-white, non-green pixels
    marker_properties:
      - color: green(3)
      - function: partition_marker
        description: Divides the grid into a left part and a right part (including the marker itself). The transformation primarily affects the left part.
    transformation:
      scope: affects only the part of the grid to the left of the green(3) marker.
      input_left_part:
        - identify: largest contiguous block of non-white pixels (main_block)
        - identify: all white(0) pixels (whitespace_pixels)
      output_left_part_construction:
        - place: all identified whitespace_pixels at the beginning.
        - append: the identified main_block.
      output_grid_construction:
        - concatenate: [output_left_part, green(3)_marker, original_right_part]
    relationships:
      - adjacency: used to define blocks and relative positions.
      - partitioning: the green(3) pixel acts as a separator.
    invariants:
      - the green(3) pixel itself does not change color or relative position concerning the right part of the grid.
      - the sequence and colors of pixels to the right of the green(3) pixel remain unchanged.
      - the content (colors and count) of the main_block remains unchanged, only its position shifts.
      - the total count of white(0) pixels remains unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Locate the green pixel (color 3) in the input row. If no green pixel exists, return the input unchanged (assumption based on observed pattern; needs confirmation if such cases exist).
    2.  Define the 'left part' of the row as all pixels strictly to the left of the green pixel.
    3.  Define the 'right part' of the row as all pixels strictly to the right of the green pixel.
    4.  Within the 'left part', identify the largest contiguous block of pixels that are not white (color 0). Call this the 'main block'. If there are multiple such blocks of the same largest size, select the rightmost one (based on examples). If no non-white block exists in the left part, the 'main block' is empty.
    5.  Count the total number of white pixels (color 0) present in the 'left part'.
    6.  Construct the output row:
        a.  Start with a sequence of white pixels (color 0) equal to the count obtained in step 5.
        b.  Append the 'main block' identified in step 4.
        c.  Append the green pixel (color 3).
        d.  Append the 'right part' identified in step 3, maintaining its original sequence of pixels.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: locating a green pixel (3), partitioning the row, identifying the largest non-white block and all white pixels to the left of the green pixel, and rearranging these elements. The Python code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input grid rows were standard Python lists and used list-specific methods (`index`, `count`) on NumPy arrays. The underlying logic described in the natural language program appears sound and consistent with the examples. The next step is to correct the implementation to handle NumPy arrays appropriately, likely by converting the relevant row/segments to lists when list methods are convenient or using NumPy's array manipulation functions.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Let's verify the assumptions about partitioning, block identification, and counts for each example.

```yaml
    task_type: rearrangement_1d
    grid_dimensionality: 1 # All examples are 1xN grids
    input_data_type: numpy_array # Code execution showed inputs are numpy arrays
    elements:
      - pixels:
          colors_present: [white(0), red(2), green(3), yellow(4), azure(8)] # Seen in examples
          marker_pixel: green(3)
          background_pixel: white(0)
      - blocks:
          definition: contiguous sequence of same-colored pixels
          types:
            - white_block: consists of white(0) pixels
            - colored_block: consists of non-white, non-green pixels
    marker_properties:
      - color: green(3)
      - function: partition_marker
        description: Divides the 1D grid into three parts - elements left of the marker, the marker itself, and elements right of the marker. The transformation exclusively modifies the arrangement of elements in the left part.
    transformation:
      scope: affects only the part of the grid to the left of the green(3) marker.
      input_left_part:
        - identify: largest contiguous block of non-white pixels (main_block). If multiple blocks have the same maximum length, select the rightmost one (the one ending closest to the green marker).
        - identify: all white(0) pixels (whitespace_pixels).
      output_left_part_construction:
        - place: all identified whitespace_pixels at the beginning of the left part's space.
        - append: the identified main_block immediately after the whitespace.
      output_grid_construction:
        - concatenate: [output_left_part, green(3)_marker, original_right_part]
    relationships:
      - adjacency: defines blocks and relative positions (left/right of marker).
      - partitioning: the green(3) pixel acts as a separator.
    invariants:
      - the green(3) pixel's value and its position relative to the right part remain unchanged.
      - the sequence and colors of pixels in the original right part remain unchanged.
      - the content (colors and count of pixels) of the main_block remains unchanged, only its position shifts.
      - the total count of white(0) pixels in the entire grid remains unchanged.
      - the total count of non-white, non-green pixels remains unchanged.
      - the grid dimensions remain unchanged.
    edge_cases:
      - if no green(3) pixel exists, the grid is returned unchanged (inferred, needs test case).
      - if the green(3) pixel is the first element, the left part is empty, and the output is just [green_pixel] + [right_part].
      - if the left part contains no non-white pixels, the 'main_block' is empty, and the output left part consists only of the collected white pixels.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to be a single row (1xN). Verify it's a single row; if not, return the input unchanged (or handle as error).
    2.  Locate the first occurrence of the green pixel (color 3) in the row. If no green pixel is found, return the input row unchanged.
    3.  Partition the row into three segments:
        *   `left_part`: All pixels strictly to the left of the green pixel.
        *   `marker`: The green pixel itself.
        *   `right_part`: All pixels strictly to the right of the green pixel.
    4.  Analyze the `left_part`:
        a.  Identify all contiguous blocks of pixels that are *not* white (color 0).
        b.  From these non-white blocks, select the 'main block': Choose the block with the greatest length. If there is a tie in length, choose the block that occurs furthest to the right (closest to the marker position). If no non-white blocks exist in the `left_part`, the 'main block' is considered empty.
        c.  Count the total number of white pixels (color 0) within the `left_part`.
    5.  Construct the new `output_row`:
        a.  Start with a sequence of white pixels (color 0), with a length equal to the count determined in step 4c.
        b.  Append the sequence of pixels representing the 'main block' identified in step 4b.
        c.  Append the `marker` (the green pixel, color 3).
        d.  Append the `right_part`, preserving its original sequence of pixels.
    6.  Return the `output_row` (formatted as a 1xN grid).
