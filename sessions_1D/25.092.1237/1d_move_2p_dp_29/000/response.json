The transformation involves rearranging segments of the row based on the position of a specific 'marker' pixel, which is green (3). A contiguous block of non-white pixels located to the left of the green pixel is identified. All white pixels (0) also located to the left of the green pixel are collected. In the output, these collected white pixels are placed first, followed by the identified non-white block, then the green pixel, and finally any pixels that were originally to the right of the green pixel. The relative order and content of the segment to the right of the green pixel remain unchanged. The core operation is a conditional rearrangement of elements preceding the green pixel, consolidating white space at the beginning and pushing the main colored block rightward until it's adjacent to the green pixel.\n\n*   **Facts YAML**:\n    "
