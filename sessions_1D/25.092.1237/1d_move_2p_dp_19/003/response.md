Transforms a 1xN input grid by identifying a contiguous block of a single color (not white 0 or maroon 9) and a single target pixel (maroon 9). The block is then shifted horizontally such that its rightmost pixel is immediately to the left of the target pixel in the output grid. The original position of the block is filled with white (0), and the target pixel and other background pixels retain their positions.
