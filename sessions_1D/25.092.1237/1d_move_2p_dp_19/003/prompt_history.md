*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays).
    *   Each input grid contains a contiguous block of pixels of a single color (e.g., blue, gray, yellow), distinct from white (0) and maroon (9).
    *   Each input grid also contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel.
    *   The remaining pixels are white (0).
    *   In the output grid, the contiguous block of colored pixels has shifted horizontally to the right.
    *   The final position of the block is such that its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left of the maroon (9) pixel.
    *   The original positions occupied by the colored block before the shift are replaced with white (0) pixels.
    *   The maroon pixel and all other white pixels remain in their original positions.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous analysis correctly identified the core logic: find a colored block (not white/maroon), find a maroon target pixel, and shift the block so it ends just before the target. However, the implementation failed because it assumed a 1D list/array input structure, while the actual inputs are 2D grids (specifically, 1xN). The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms that comparisons were being made on array slices or entire arrays where single boolean values were expected, a common issue when indexing 2D arrays as if they were 1D. The strategy is to adapt the code to correctly handle the 1xN input and output structure by extracting the relevant row, performing the logic on that 1D row, and then restructuring the result back into a 1xN grid.
