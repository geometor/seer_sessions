*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous analysis correctly identified the core logic: find a colored block (not white/maroon), find a maroon target pixel, and shift the block so it ends just before the target. However, the implementation failed because it assumed a 1D list/array input structure, while the actual inputs are 2D grids (specifically, 1xN). The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms that comparisons were being made on array slices or entire arrays where single boolean values were expected, a common issue when indexing 2D arrays as if they were 1D. The strategy is to adapt the code to correctly handle the 1xN input and output structure by extracting the relevant row, performing the logic on that 1D row, and then restructuring the result back into a 1xN grid.

    state_changes:
      - The identified block changes its column position (start and end indices) within the row.
      - The grid cells originally occupied by the block become white (0).
      - The target pixel remains in its original column index.
    constraints:
      - Input and output grids are always 1xN.
      - There is exactly one movable block per row.
      - There is exactly one target (maroon) pixel per row.
      - The block always moves rightwards relative to its original position.
      - The block fits entirely to the left of the target pixel in the output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the 1xN input grid.
    2.  Extract the single row from the input grid into a 1D sequence.
    3.  Initialize a new 1D output sequence (representing the output row) of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
    4.  Scan the extracted 1D input sequence to find the contiguous block of pixels that are not white (0) and not maroon (9). Record this block's color and length.
    5.  Scan the extracted 1D input sequence to find the column index of the maroon (9) pixel (the target index).
    6.  Calculate the target start column index for the block in the output sequence: `target_start_index = target_index - block_length`.
    7.  Fill the segment of the 1D output sequence from `target_start_index` up to (but not including) `target_index` with the recorded block color.
    8.  Set the pixel at the `target_index` in the 1D output sequence to maroon (9).
    9.  Construct the final 1xN output grid using the generated 1D output sequence as its single row.
    10. Return the 1xN output grid.
