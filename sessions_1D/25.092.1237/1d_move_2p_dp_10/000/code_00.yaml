task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: variable (magenta/6 in example 1, yellow/4 in example 2, red/2 in example 3)
      - shape: horizontal line segment (contiguous block in 1D)
      - length: variable, preserved during transformation
  - type: target_marker
    description: A single pixel acting as an anchor point.
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - count: exactly one per input
      - position: fixed relative to the array boundaries
transformation:
  action: reposition_object
  details: >
    The 'object' block is moved such that its rightmost pixel
    is positioned immediately to the left of the 'target_marker' pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: In the output, the right end of the 'object' is adjacent to the left side of the 'target_marker'.
constraints:
  - Array length is preserved.
  - Object color and length are preserved.
  - Target marker color and position are preserved.
  - All pixels not part of the repositioned object or the target marker become white (0) in the output.
