Okay, let's analyze the provided example pair.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (or single rows) of pixels represented by numbers 0-9.
*   **Key Colors:** The colors involved are white (0), magenta (6), and maroon (9).
*   **Objects:**
    *   In the input, there is a contiguous block of magenta pixels.
    *   There is a single maroon pixel.
    *   The rest of the pixels are white (background).
*   **Transformation:** The block of magenta pixels seems to shift its position. The maroon pixel remains in the same absolute position relative to the array boundaries. In the output, the right end of the magenta block is positioned immediately to the left of the maroon pixel. The length of the magenta block is preserved. Pixels that were originally occupied by the magenta block but are no longer covered after the shift become white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous block of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: variable (magenta/6 in example 1, yellow/4 in example 2, red/2 in example 3)
      - shape: horizontal line segment (contiguous block in 1D)
      - length: variable, preserved during transformation
  - type: target_marker
    description: A single pixel acting as an anchor point.
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - count: exactly one per input
      - position: fixed relative to the array boundaries
transformation:
  action: reposition_object
  details: >
    The 'object' block is moved such that its rightmost pixel
    is positioned immediately to the left of the 'target_marker' pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: In the output, the right end of the 'object' is adjacent to the left side of the 'target_marker'.
constraints:
  - Array length is preserved.
  - Object color and length are preserved.
  - Target marker color and position are preserved.
  - All pixels not part of the repositioned object or the target marker become white (0) in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output array of the same size as the input array, filling it with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input array to find the contiguous block of non-white pixels (the 'object'). Record its color and length.
3.  Scan the input array to find the single 'maroon' (9) pixel (the 'target'). Record its index (position).
4.  Place the 'target' pixel (maroon, 9) into the output array at its recorded index.
5.  Calculate the end position for the 'object' in the output array: `target_index - 1`.
6.  Calculate the start position for the 'object' in the output array: `(target_index - 1) - object_length + 1`, which simplifies to `target_index - object_length`.
7.  Fill the segment of the output array from the calculated start position to the calculated end position (inclusive) with the recorded color of the 'object'.
8.  Return the modified output array.
