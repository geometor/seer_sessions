Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: All examples use a 1x30 grid (a single row).
2.  **Pixel Colors**: The grids primarily contain white pixels (0).
3.  **Key Objects**:
    *   **Colored Block**: In each input grid, there is a contiguous horizontal block of a single color (magenta '6' in train\_1, blue '1' in train\_2, gray '5' in train\_3). This block is never white (0) or red (2).
    *   **Red Pixel**: Each input grid contains exactly one red pixel (2).
    *   **Background**: The remaining pixels are white (0).
4.  **Spatial Relationship**: The colored block always appears to the left of the red pixel in the input grid. There are always one or more white pixels between the end of the colored block and the red pixel.
5.  **Transformation**: Comparing input and output grids reveals a shift:
    *   The colored block moves two positions to the right. Its shape, size, and color remain unchanged.
    *   The red pixel remains in its original position.
    *   The white background pixels adjust to accommodate the shifted colored block, but otherwise remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Locate the contiguous block of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor red (2). Record its color, starting index, and ending index.
3.  Locate the single red pixel (2). Record its index.
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
5.  Place the red pixel (2) into the output grid at the same index it occupied in the input grid.
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the colored block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
7.  Calculate the new ending index for the colored block by adding 2 to its original ending index.
8.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from the new starting index to the new ending index (inclusive) with the original color of the colored block.
9.  The output is the newly constructed grid.
