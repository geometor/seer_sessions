task_description: "Shift a contiguous colored block (non-white, non-red) two positions to the right, keeping a single red pixel stationary."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # All examples are 1D (single row)
  max_width: 30
objects:
  - object_type: "colored_block"
    description: "A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels with the same color, excluding white (0) and red (2)."
    attributes:
      - color: (variable, e.g., 6, 1, 5)
      - length: (variable)
      - position: (variable start and end indices)
    count: 1 # Exactly one per grid
  - object_type: "marker_pixel"
    description: "A single pixel with a specific color."
    attributes:
      - color: 2 # Red
      - position: (variable index)
    count: 1 # Exactly one per grid
  - object_type: "background"
    description: "Pixels that are not part of the colored block or the marker pixel."
    attributes:
      - color: 0 # White
relationships:
  - type: "spatial"
    description: "The colored_block is located to the left of the marker_pixel in the input."
  - type: "spatial"
    description: "There are background pixels between the colored_block and the marker_pixel."
