This block is never white (0) or red (2).\n    *   **Red Pixel**: Each input grid contains exactly one red pixel (2).\n    *   **Background**: The remaining pixels are white (0).\n4.  **Spatial Relationship**: The colored block always appears to the left of the red pixel in the input grid. There are always one or more white pixels between the end of the colored block and the red pixel.\n5.  **Transformation**: Comparing input and output grids reveals a shift:\n    *   The colored block moves two positions to the right. Its shape, size, and color remain unchanged.\n    *   The red pixel remains in its original position.\n    *   The white background pixels adjust to accommodate the shifted colored block, but otherwise remain unchanged.\n\n## YAML Facts Documentation\n\n"

Calculate the new ending index for the colored block by adding 2 to its original ending index.\n8.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from the new starting index to the new ending index (inclusive) with the original color of the colored block.\n9.  The output is the newly constructed grid."
