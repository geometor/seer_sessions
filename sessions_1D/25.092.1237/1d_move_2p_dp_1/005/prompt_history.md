Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output are presented as 1D arrays or single-row grids. Each example features:
1.  A single red pixel (color 2).
2.  A contiguous block of pixels of a single color other than white (0) or red (2). This "colored block" varies in color (gray, blue, orange) and length across examples.
3.  White pixels (color 0) surrounding these elements.
4.  Crucially, in every input example, the colored block is positioned to the left of the red pixel, separated by exactly two white pixels.

The transformation involves rearranging these elements. Specifically, the colored block moves rightwards, closing the gap with the red pixel. The two white pixels that were originally between the colored block and the red pixel are repositioned to the immediate left of the colored block. The positions of all other white pixels (leading and trailing) and the red pixel remain unchanged relative to the start and end of the array, respectively. The core operation appears to be a positional swap between the colored block and the two adjacent white pixels to its right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Move a colored block to be adjacent to a target pixel.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Represented as a 1D array.
  - Objects:
    - Red_Pixel:
        Color: 2
        Count: 1
        Role: Target_Marker
    - Colored_Block:
        Color: Any color except 0 (white) and 2 (red)
        Property: Contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color.
        Position: Located to the left of the Red_Pixel.
        Count: 1
    - White_Separator_Pixels:
        Color: 0
        Count: 2
        Position: Located immediately between the right end of the Colored_Block and the Red_Pixel.
    - Background_Pixels:
        Color: 0
        Position: Elsewhere in the array (leading/trailing).

Relationships:
  - Spatial: `[Leading_Background..., Colored_Block, White_Separator_Pixel_1, White_Separator_Pixel_2, Red_Pixel, Trailing_Background...]`

Transformation:
  - Action: Rearrangement of segments.
  - Rule: Swap the position of the `Colored_Block` segment and the `White_Separator_Pixels` segment.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Rearranged 1D array.
  - Structure: `[Leading_Background..., White_Separator_Pixel_1, White_Separator_Pixel_2, Colored_Block, Red_Pixel, Trailing_Background...]`
  - Invariant:
    - The Red_Pixel maintains its position relative to the trailing background pixels.
    - The leading background pixels maintain their position relative to the start.
    - The content (colors and counts) of all segments remains the same, only their order changes.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the index of the single red pixel (value 2) in the input array.
2.  Identify the indices of the two white pixels (value 0) located immediately to the left of the red pixel. Let these be `white_sep_indices`.
3.  Starting from the pixel immediately to the left of the white separator pixels, search leftwards to find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels. This is the `colored_block`. Let its indices be `block_indices`.
4.  Identify the segment of the array *before* the `colored_block`. Let this be `leading_segment`.
5.  Identify the segment of the array *after* the red pixel. Let this be `trailing_segment`.
6.  Construct the output array by concatenating the segments in the following order:
    a.  `leading_segment`
    b.  The two white pixels from `white_sep_indices`.
    c.  The `colored_block` identified by `block_indices`.
    d.  The red pixel.
    e.  `trailing_segment`.
7.  Return the newly constructed array.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Input grid must be 1-dimensional.

## Example 2:
Error: Input grid must be 1-dimensional.

## Example 3:
Error: Input grid must be 1-dimensional.
**General Assessment:**

The primary error ("Input grid must be 1-dimensional") indicates a mismatch between the function's expectation (a 1D NumPy array) and the actual input format provided by the testing environment (likely a 2D NumPy array, even if it only has one row). The core transformation logic identified previously – swapping a colored block with two adjacent white pixels located to the left of a red pixel – appears conceptually sound based on the 1D representation of the examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the actual dimensions of the input grids.
2.  Adapt the code to handle 2D grids, specifically assuming the transformation occurs along the single row (axis 1).
3.  Refine the identification of segments (leading, block, separators, red, trailing) within the context of a 2D array's row.
4.  Reconstruct the output row using concatenation appropriate for NumPy arrays.

**Refined Metrics Gathering:**

The previous code failed because NumPy integer types (`int64`) are not directly JSON serializable. Let's convert them to standard Python integers before printing.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Dimensions:** All input and output examples are consistently 2D arrays with a shape of (1, N), confirming the need to handle 2D input.
*   **Red Pixel:** A single red pixel (2) is present in each input and output. Its column index remains the same after the transformation (24, 28, 24 respectively).
*   **Separators (Input):** In all inputs, exactly two white pixels (0) are found immediately to the left of the red pixel. Their column indices are `(red_col - 2, red_col - 1)`.
*   **Colored Block (Input):** A contiguous block of a single color (5, 1, or 7) is found immediately to the left of the separator pixels in each input.
*   **Structure (Input):** The structure `[Leading_White..., Colored_Block, Separator_1, Separator_2, Red_Pixel, Trailing_White...]` holds for the row in all inputs.
*   **Structure (Output):** The output analysis shows the red pixel retains its column index. The colored block is now located immediately to the left of the red pixel. The two separator pixels (identified as 0s) are now located immediately to the left of the colored block. *Correction*: The output separator identification logic in the script was slightly flawed; it should check `output_row[block_start_out - 2] == 0 and output_row[block_start_out - 1] == 0`. Visually confirming the output strings, the structure is `[Leading_White..., Separator_1, Separator_2, Colored_Block, Red_Pixel, Trailing_White...]`.
*   **Consistency:** The transformation rule appears consistent across all examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Swap a colored block with two adjacent white pixels preceding a marker pixel within a single-row grid.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N).
  - Objects:
    - Red_Pixel:
        Color: 2 (Red)
        Count: 1 per grid row.
        Role: Positional marker.
    - Colored_Block:
        Color: Any color except 0 (White) and 2 (Red).
        Property: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color within the row.
        Position: Located somewhere to the left of the Red_Pixel.
        Count: 1 per grid row.
    - White_Separator_Pixels:
        Color: 0 (White)
        Count: 2
        Property: Contiguous horizontal sequence.
        Position: Located immediately between the rightmost pixel of the Colored_Block and the Red_Pixel in the input row.
    - Background_Pixels:
        Color: 0 (White)
        Position: Elsewhere in the grid row (leading/trailing).

Relationships:
  - Spatial_Input: Within the single row (row 0), the elements appear in the order: `[Leading_Background..., Colored_Block, White_Separator_Pixel_1, White_Separator_Pixel_2, Red_Pixel, Trailing_Background...]`. Column indices increase from left to right.

Transformation:
  - Action: Rearrangement of segments within the row.
  - Scope: Operates only on row 0 of the 2D grid.
  - Rule: Swap the position of the segment corresponding to the `Colored_Block` with the segment corresponding to the `White_Separator_Pixels`.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D NumPy array with the same shape (1, N) as the input.
  - Structure: Within row 0, the elements are rearranged to: `[Leading_Background..., White_Separator_Pixel_1, White_Separator_Pixel_2, Colored_Block, Red_Pixel, Trailing_Background...]`.
  - Invariants:
    - The shape of the grid remains unchanged.
    - The color and column index of the Red_Pixel remain unchanged.
    - The colors and lengths of the Colored_Block and White_Separator_Pixels segments remain unchanged.
    - The content and relative order of Leading_Background and Trailing_Background pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a 2D NumPy array, assumed to have shape (1, N).
2.  Focus on the first (and only) row of the grid (index 0).
3.  Identify the column index (`red_col`) of the single red pixel (value 2) in the row.
4.  Verify that the two pixels immediately to the left of the red pixel (at column indices `red_col - 2` and `red_col - 1`) are both white (value 0). If not, the input structure is unexpected; handle appropriately (e.g., return input unchanged or raise error). Let the starting column index of these separators be `sep_start_col = red_col - 2`.
5.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-red pixels ending at column index `sep_start_col - 1`.
    a.  Determine the color (`block_color`) of the pixel at `sep_start_col - 1`.
    b.  Find the starting column index (`block_start_col`) of this block by searching leftwards from `sep_start_col - 1` while the pixel color remains `block_color`.
6.  Define the segments of the row based on their column indices:
    a.  `leading_segment`: From column 0 up to (but not including) `block_start_col`.
    b.  `colored_block_segment`: From column `block_start_col` up to (and including) `sep_start_col - 1`.
    c.  `white_separator_segment`: From column `sep_start_col` up to (but not including) `red_col`.
    d.  `red_pixel_segment`: The single pixel at column `red_col`.
    e.  `trailing_segment`: From column `red_col + 1` to the end of the row.
7.  Construct the new row by concatenating the segments in the modified order: `leading_segment`, `white_separator_segment`, `colored_block_segment`, `red_pixel_segment`, `trailing_segment`.
8.  Create the output 2D NumPy array by placing the newly constructed row as the first row.
9.  Return the output array.
