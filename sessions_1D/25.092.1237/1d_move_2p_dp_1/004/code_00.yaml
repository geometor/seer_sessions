Task: Swap a colored block with two adjacent white pixels preceding a marker pixel within a single-row grid.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N).
  - Objects:
    - Red_Pixel:
        Color: 2 (Red)
        Count: 1 per grid row.
        Role: Positional marker.
    - Colored_Block:
        Color: Any color except 0 (White) and 2 (Red).
        Property: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color within the row.
        Position: Located somewhere to the left of the Red_Pixel.
        Count: 1 per grid row.
    - White_Separator_Pixels:
        Color: 0 (White)
        Count: 2
        Property: Contiguous horizontal sequence.
        Position: Located immediately between the rightmost pixel of the Colored_Block and the Red_Pixel in the input row.
    - Background_Pixels:
        Color: 0 (White)
        Position: Elsewhere in the grid row (leading/trailing).

Relationships:
  - Spatial_Input: Within the single row (row 0), the elements appear in the order: `[Leading_Background..., Colored_Block, White_Separator_Pixel_1, White_Separator_Pixel_2, Red_Pixel, Trailing_Background...]`. Column indices increase from left to right.

Transformation:
  - Action: Rearrangement of segments within the row.
  - Scope: Operates only on row 0 of the 2D grid.
  - Rule: Swap the position of the segment corresponding to the `Colored_Block` with the segment corresponding to the `White_Separator_Pixels`.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D NumPy array with the same shape (1, N) as the input.
  - Structure: Within row 0, the elements are rearranged to: `[Leading_Background..., White_Separator_Pixel_1, White_Separator_Pixel_2, Colored_Block, Red_Pixel, Trailing_Background...]`.
  - Invariants:
    - The shape of the grid remains unchanged.
    - The color and column index of the Red_Pixel remain unchanged.
    - The colors and lengths of the Colored_Block and White_Separator_Pixels segments remain unchanged.
    - The content and relative order of Leading_Background and Trailing_Background pixels remain unchanged.
