Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output are presented as 1D arrays or single-row grids. Each example features:
1.  A single red pixel (color 2).
2.  A contiguous block of pixels of a single color other than white (0) or red (2). This "colored block" varies in color (gray, blue, orange) and length across examples.
3.  White pixels (color 0) surrounding these elements.
4.  Crucially, in every input example, the colored block is positioned to the left of the red pixel, separated by exactly two white pixels.

The transformation involves rearranging these elements. Specifically, the colored block moves rightwards, closing the gap with the red pixel. The two white pixels that were originally between the colored block and the red pixel are repositioned to the immediate left of the colored block. The positions of all other white pixels (leading and trailing) and the red pixel remain unchanged relative to the start and end of the array, respectively. The core operation appears to be a positional swap between the colored block and the two adjacent white pixels to its right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Move a colored block to be adjacent to a target pixel.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Represented as a 1D array.
  - Objects:
    - Red_Pixel:
        Color: 2
        Count: 1
        Role: Target_Marker
    - Colored_Block:
        Color: Any color except 0 (white) and 2 (red)
        Property: Contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color.
        Position: Located to the left of the Red_Pixel.
        Count: 1
    - White_Separator_Pixels:
        Color: 0
        Count: 2
        Position: Located immediately between the right end of the Colored_Block and the Red_Pixel.
    - Background_Pixels:
        Color: 0
        Position: Elsewhere in the array (leading/trailing).

Relationships:
  - Spatial: `[Leading_Background..., Colored_Block, White_Separator_Pixel_1, White_Separator_Pixel_2, Red_Pixel, Trailing_Background...]`

Transformation:
  - Action: Rearrangement of segments.
  - Rule: Swap the position of the `Colored_Block` segment and the `White_Separator_Pixels` segment.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Rearranged 1D array.
  - Structure: `[Leading_Background..., White_Separator_Pixel_1, White_Separator_Pixel_2, Colored_Block, Red_Pixel, Trailing_Background...]`
  - Invariant:
    - The Red_Pixel maintains its position relative to the trailing background pixels.
    - The leading background pixels maintain their position relative to the start.
    - The content (colors and counts) of all segments remains the same, only their order changes.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the index of the single red pixel (value 2) in the input array.
2.  Identify the indices of the two white pixels (value 0) located immediately to the left of the red pixel. Let these be `white_sep_indices`.
3.  Starting from the pixel immediately to the left of the white separator pixels, search leftwards to find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-white pixels. This is the `colored_block`. Let its indices be `block_indices`.
4.  Identify the segment of the array *before* the `colored_block`. Let this be `leading_segment`.
5.  Identify the segment of the array *after* the red pixel. Let this be `trailing_segment`.
6.  Construct the output array by concatenating the segments in the following order:
    a.  `leading_segment`
    b.  The two white pixels from `white_sep_indices`.
    c.  The `colored_block` identified by `block_indices`.
    d.  The red pixel.
    e.  `trailing_segment`.
7.  Return the newly constructed array.
