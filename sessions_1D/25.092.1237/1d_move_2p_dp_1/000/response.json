Each example features:\n1.  A single red pixel (color 2).\n2.  A contiguous block of pixels of a single color other than white (0) or red (2). This \"colored block\" varies in color (gray, blue, orange) and length across examples.\n3.  White pixels (color 0) surrounding these elements.\n4.  Crucially, in every input example, the colored block is positioned to the left of the red pixel, separated by exactly two white pixels.\n\nThe transformation involves rearranging these elements. Specifically, the colored block moves rightwards, closing the gap with the red pixel. The two white pixels that were originally between the colored block and the red pixel are repositioned to the immediate left of the colored block. The positions of all other white pixels (leading and trailing) and the red pixel remain unchanged relative to the start and end of the array, respectively. The core operation appears to be a positional swap between the colored block and the two adjacent white pixels to its right.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
