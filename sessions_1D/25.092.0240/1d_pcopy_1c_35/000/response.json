The transformation involves modifying sequences of the non-white color. Specifically, isolated instances of the non-white color C are expanded horizontally into a sequence of three C's (C C C), centered on the original pixel's position. Sequences that are already three pixels long (C C C) remain unchanged. White pixels remain white unless overwritten by an expanding non-white pixel.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

Iterate through each pixel of the input grid row from left to right (index `i`).\n    3.  Let the color of the current input pixel be `C`.\n    4.  If `C` is white (0), continue to the next pixel.\n    5.  If `C` is non-white:\n        a.  Check if the pixel is part of a horizontal sequence of three identical non-white pixels (C C C). Specifically, check if the pixel at `i-1` (if `i > 0`) and the pixel at `i+1` (if `i < width-1`) are both equal to `C`.\n        b.  If it *is* part of such a C C C sequence, copy the color `C` to the corresponding position `i` in the output grid.\n        c.  If it *is not* part of such a sequence (meaning it's an isolated C, or at the end of a shorter sequence), then set the pixels at positions `i-1` (if `i > 0`), `i`, and `i+1` (if `i < width-1`) in the output grid to color `C`. *Correction*: This step needs refinement based on the observation that only isolated pixels expand. Let's rephrase:\n    5.  If `C` is non-white:\n        a. Define `left_is_C` as true if `i > 0` and `input[i-1] == C`, false otherwise.\n        b. Define `right_is_C` as true if `i < width-1` and `input[i+1] == C`, false otherwise.\n        c. **Condition 1 (Isolated):** If *not* `left_is_C` and *not* `right_is_C`, this is an isolated pixel. In the output grid, set pixels at `max(0, i-1)`, `i`, and `min(width-1, i+1)` to color `C`.\n        d. **Condition 2 (Part of Triplet or Edge):** If `left_is_C` or `right_is_C` (meaning it's part of a sequence of 2 or 3 C's, or potentially longer, but the examples only show 1 or 3), copy the color `C` to the corresponding position `i` in the output grid. *Revisiting logic - the simplest is to handle the expansion first and then copy.*\n    \n    **Revised Natural Language Program**:\n    1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.\n    2. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid row from left to right (index `i`).\n    3. Let the color of the current input pixel be `C`.\n    4. If `C` is non-white:\n        a. Check if the pixel at `i` is isolated horizontally. This means its left neighbor (if `i > 0`) is not `C`, and its right neighbor (if `i < width-1`) is not `C`. (Treat boundary conditions as neighbors that are not `C`).\n        b. If the pixel at `i` *is* isolated, then modify the *output* grid by setting the color `C` at index `i`, and also at `i-1` (if `i > 0`) and `i+1` (if `i < width-1`).\n    5. Pixels in the output grid that are not modified by step 4b retain their original color from the input grid copy.\n    6. Return the modified output grid."
