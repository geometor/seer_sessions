Creates a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Iterates through each pixel of the input grid.\n3.  If a pixel is non-white (color C) and its immediate left and right neighbors \n    (if they exist within the grid bounds) are *not* color C, then this pixel \n    is considered \"isolated\".\n4.  For each isolated pixel found at index `i`, the corresponding pixel at `i` \n    in the output grid, as well as its left neighbor (`i-1`, if `i>0`) and \n    right neighbor (`i+1`, if `i<width-1`), are set to color C.\n5.  Pixels in the output grid that are not part of an expansion (i.e., \n    original white pixels or non-white pixels that were already adjacent to \n    pixels of the same color) retain their original color from the input grid copy.\n6.
