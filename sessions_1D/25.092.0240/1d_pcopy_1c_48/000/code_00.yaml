Objects:
  - type: Pixel Block
    properties:
      - color: Non-white (e.g., magenta, yellow)
      - size: Horizontal extent (e.g., 1 pixel wide, 3 pixels wide)
      - position: Coordinates within the grid
      - context: Adjacency to other pixels (especially horizontally)
  - type: Background
    properties:
      - color: White (0)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally (left/right neighbors).
  - Isolation: A non-white pixel is 'isolated' if its horizontal neighbors (within the grid bounds) are both white.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all non-white pixels.
  - Check Isolation: Determine if a non-white pixel is horizontally isolated.
  - Expand: If a non-white pixel is isolated, expand it into a 3-pixel horizontal block using its color. This involves changing the color of its immediate left and right white neighbors (if they exist within bounds).
  - Preserve: Non-white pixel blocks wider than 1 pixel are preserved without change. White background pixels not involved in expansion are preserved.

Transformation Goal:
  - Convert isolated single non-white pixels into 3-pixel wide horizontal blocks of the same color, while leaving existing wider blocks unchanged.
