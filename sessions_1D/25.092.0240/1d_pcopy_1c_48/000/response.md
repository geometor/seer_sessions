Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids in all examples are single rows (1xN dimensions).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color and one other non-white color per example (magenta '6' in train_1 and train_2, yellow '4' in train_3).
3.  **Input Objects:** The inputs contain non-white pixels that appear either as single, isolated pixels or as contiguous horizontal blocks of 3 pixels.
4.  **Output Objects:** In the outputs, the original 3-pixel blocks remain unchanged. The single, isolated non-white pixels from the input are transformed into 3-pixel horizontal blocks of the same color in the output.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies single non-white pixels that are surrounded horizontally by white pixels (or are at an edge next to a white pixel). These isolated pixels expand horizontally, changing their immediate left and right white neighbors (if they exist) to the pixel's color, resulting in a 3-pixel block. Non-white pixels that are already part of a block wider than one pixel are not affected. White pixels not adjacent to an expanding isolated pixel remain white.

**Facts**


```yaml
Objects:
  - type: Pixel Block
    properties:
      - color: Non-white (e.g., magenta, yellow)
      - size: Horizontal extent (e.g., 1 pixel wide, 3 pixels wide)
      - position: Coordinates within the grid
      - context: Adjacency to other pixels (especially horizontally)
  - type: Background
    properties:
      - color: White (0)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally (left/right neighbors).
  - Isolation: A non-white pixel is 'isolated' if its horizontal neighbors (within the grid bounds) are both white.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all non-white pixels.
  - Check Isolation: Determine if a non-white pixel is horizontally isolated.
  - Expand: If a non-white pixel is isolated, expand it into a 3-pixel horizontal block using its color. This involves changing the color of its immediate left and right white neighbors (if they exist within bounds).
  - Preserve: Non-white pixel blocks wider than 1 pixel are preserved without change. White background pixels not involved in expansion are preserved.

Transformation Goal:
  - Convert isolated single non-white pixels into 3-pixel wide horizontal blocks of the same color, while leaving existing wider blocks unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid, initialized as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid by its column index `c`.
3.  For the current pixel at `(0, c)`:
    a.  Check if the pixel's color is non-white (value > 0).
    b.  If it is non-white, check its horizontal neighbors:
        i.  Check the color of the pixel to the left (at `(0, c-1)`), considering boundary conditions (if `c=0`, assume the left neighbor is white).
        ii. Check the color of the pixel to the right (at `(0, c+1)`), considering boundary conditions (if `c` is the last column index, assume the right neighbor is white).
    c.  If both the left and right neighbors (considering boundaries) are white (value 0), then the current non-white pixel at `(0, c)` is isolated.
    d.  If the pixel at `(0, c)` is isolated:
        i.  Set the color of the pixel at `(0, c)` in the *output* grid to the color of the input pixel at `(0, c)`.
        ii. If a left neighbor exists (`c > 0`), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c-1)` in the *output* grid to the color of the input pixel at `(0, c)`.
        iii. If a right neighbor exists (`c < width - 1`), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c+1)` in the *output* grid to the color of the input pixel at `(0, c)`.
4.  Pixels in the output grid that were not explicitly modified in step 3d retain their original color from the input grid copy.
5.  Return the final output grid.
