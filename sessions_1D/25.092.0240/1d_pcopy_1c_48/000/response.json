The single, isolated non-white pixels from the input are transformed into 3-pixel horizontal blocks of the same color in the output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies single non-white pixels that are surrounded horizontally by white pixels (or are at an edge next to a white pixel). These isolated pixels expand horizontally, changing their immediate left and right white neighbors (if they exist) to the pixel's color, resulting in a 3-pixel block. Non-white pixels that are already part of a block wider than one pixel are not affected. White pixels not adjacent to an expanding isolated pixel remain white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

This involves changing the color of its immediate left and right white neighbors (if they exist within bounds).\n  - Preserve: Non-white pixel blocks wider than 1 pixel are preserved without change. White background pixels not involved in expansion are preserved.\n\nTransformation Goal:\n  - Convert isolated single non-white pixels into 3-pixel wide horizontal blocks of the same color, while leaving existing wider blocks unchanged.\n```"

Check the color of the pixel to the right (at `(0, c+1)`), considering boundary conditions (if `c` is the last column index, assume the right neighbor is white).\n    c.  If both the left and right neighbors (considering boundaries) are white (value 0), then the current non-white pixel at `(0, c)` is isolated.\n    d.

If a left neighbor exists (`c > 0`), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c-1)` in the *output* grid to the color of the input pixel at `(0, c)`.\n        iii. If a right neighbor exists (`c < width - 1`), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c+1)` in the *output* grid to the color of the input pixel at `(0, c)`.\n4.
