This involves changing the color of the immediate left and right white neighbors (if they exist within the grid bounds) to the color of the isolated pixel. \nNon-white pixels that are already part of a horizontal block wider than one pixel, and all other white pixels, remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport copy\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A list of lists representing the input grid.\n                                      Expected to be 1xN for this specific task.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a NumPy array for easier processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Get the dimensions (height should be 1 for this task)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # Initialize the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid\n    # Modifications will be made to this copy based on the input grid's state\n    output_np = np.copy(input_np)\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel of the input grid by its column index (row is always 0)\n    for c in range(width):\n        # Get the color of the current pixel from the original input grid\n        pixel_color = input_np[0, c]\n\n        # Check if the pixel is non-white (color > 0)\n        if pixel_color > 0:\n            # Check horizontal neighbors in the *input* grid, treating boundaries as white (0)\n            \n            # Determine the color of the left neighbor\n            left_neighbor_color = 0 # Assume white if at the left edge (c=0)\n            if c > 0:\n                left_neighbor_color = input_np[0, c-1]\n\n            # Determine the color of the right neighbor\n            right_neighbor_color = 0 # Assume white if at the right edge (c=width-1)\n            if c < width - 1:\n                right_neighbor_color = input_np[0, c+1]\n\n            # Determine if the current non-white pixel is isolated\n            is_isolated = (left_neighbor_color == 0) and (right_neighbor_color == 0)\n\n            # If the pixel is isolated, expand it in the *output* grid\n            if is_isolated:\n                # The pixel itself retains its color (already set by the copy)\n                # output_np[0, c] = pixel_color \n\n                # Change the left neighbor in the output grid if it exists within bounds\n                if c > 0:\n                    output_np[0, c-1] = pixel_color\n                \n                # Change the right neighbor in the output grid if it exists within bounds\n                if c < width - 1:\n                    output_np[0, c+1] = pixel_color\n\n    # Convert the final NumPy array back to a list of lists format\n    output_grid = output_np.tolist()\n    \n    return output_grid\n```"
