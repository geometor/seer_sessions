Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids in all examples are single rows (1xN dimensions).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color and one other non-white color per example (magenta '6' in train_1 and train_2, yellow '4' in train_3).
3.  **Input Objects:** The inputs contain non-white pixels that appear either as single, isolated pixels or as contiguous horizontal blocks of 3 pixels.
4.  **Output Objects:** In the outputs, the original 3-pixel blocks remain unchanged. The single, isolated non-white pixels from the input are transformed into 3-pixel horizontal blocks of the same color in the output.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies single non-white pixels that are surrounded horizontally by white pixels (or are at an edge next to a white pixel). These isolated pixels expand horizontally, changing their immediate left and right white neighbors (if they exist) to the pixel's color, resulting in a 3-pixel block. Non-white pixels that are already part of a block wider than one pixel are not affected. White pixels not adjacent to an expanding isolated pixel remain white.

**Facts**


```yaml
Objects:
  - type: Pixel Block
    properties:
      - color: Non-white (e.g., magenta, yellow)
      - size: Horizontal extent (e.g., 1 pixel wide, 3 pixels wide)
      - position: Coordinates within the grid
      - context: Adjacency to other pixels (especially horizontally)
  - type: Background
    properties:
      - color: White (0)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally (left/right neighbors).
  - Isolation: A non-white pixel is 'isolated' if its horizontal neighbors (within the grid bounds) are both white.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all non-white pixels.
  - Check Isolation: Determine if a non-white pixel is horizontally isolated.
  - Expand: If a non-white pixel is isolated, expand it into a 3-pixel horizontal block using its color. This involves changing the color of its immediate left and right white neighbors (if they exist within bounds).
  - Preserve: Non-white pixel blocks wider than 1 pixel are preserved without change. White background pixels not involved in expansion are preserved.

Transformation Goal:
  - Convert isolated single non-white pixels into 3-pixel wide horizontal blocks of the same color, while leaving existing wider blocks unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid, initialized as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid by its column index `c`.
3.  For the current pixel at `(0, c)`:
    a.  Check if the pixel's color is non-white (value > 0).
    b.  If it is non-white, check its horizontal neighbors:
        i.  Check the color of the pixel to the left (at `(0, c-1)`), considering boundary conditions (if `c=0`, assume the left neighbor is white).
        ii. Check the color of the pixel to the right (at `(0, c+1)`), considering boundary conditions (if `c` is the last column index, assume the right neighbor is white).
    c.  If both the left and right neighbors (considering boundaries) are white (value 0), then the current non-white pixel at `(0, c)` is isolated.
    d.  If the pixel at `(0, c)` is isolated:
        i.  Set the color of the pixel at `(0, c)` in the *output* grid to the color of the input pixel at `(0, c)`.
        ii. If a left neighbor exists (`c > 0`), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c-1)` in the *output* grid to the color of the input pixel at `(0, c)`.
        iii. If a right neighbor exists (`c < width - 1`), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c+1)` in the *output* grid to the color of the input pixel at `(0, c)`.
4.  Pixels in the output grid that were not explicitly modified in step 3d retain their original color from the input grid copy.
5.  Return the final output grid.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The error "too many values to unpack (expected 2)" during testing indicates an issue with how the input grid's dimensions are being handled, specifically at the line `height, width = input_np.shape`. The initial code assumed the input `input_grid` was a flat list and wrapped it in `np.array([input_grid])`. However, the standard ARC format provides input as a list of lists (e.g., `[[...]]` for a single row). Wrapping this again creates a 3D array `[[[...]]]` whose shape has three dimensions, causing the unpacking error.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the input handling to use `input_np = np.array(input_grid)` directly, assuming the input is already in the standard `list[list[int]]` format.
2.  Verify the dimensions using a tool call to confirm the 1xN structure observed visually.
3.  Keep the core transformation logic, as it correctly reflects the visual pattern of expanding isolated pixels horizontally within the row.
4.  Ensure the output is returned in the correct `list[list[int]]` format.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - All example grids are 1 row high (1xN).
  - Grids contain a background color (white, 0) and one other non-white color.

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - is_non_white: Boolean (color > 0).
  - type: Background
    properties:
      - color: White (0).
  - type: Non-White Pixel Group
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color (e.g., magenta, yellow).
      - extent: Contiguous horizontal block of pixels of the same non-white color.
      - size: Width of the block (number of pixels).
      - is_isolated_single: Boolean (size is 1 and both horizontal neighbors are white or boundary).

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are neighbors horizontally (left/right).
  - Isolation: A single non-white pixel is isolated if its left and right neighbors (within grid bounds) are both white. Boundary conditions are treated as white neighbors.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Analyze Neighbors: For each non-white pixel, check the color of its horizontal neighbors.
  - Check Isolation Condition: Determine if a non-white pixel meets the isolation criteria (single pixel flanked by white or boundaries).
  - Expand: If a non-white pixel is isolated, modify the corresponding output grid pixels: set the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors (if they exist within bounds) to the non-white pixel's color.
  - Preserve: If a non-white pixel is *not* isolated (i.e., it's part of a block wider than 1), its color and the color of its block are preserved in the output grid. White pixels not affected by expansion are also preserved.

Transformation Goal:
  - Transform a 1xN input grid into a 1xN output grid.
  - Expand every isolated single non-white pixel into a 3-pixel horizontal block of the same color.
  - Leave all other pixels (white background, non-white pixels already in blocks wider than 1) unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid (assumed to be a 2D list of lists, specifically 1xN for this task).
2.  Create a deep copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
3.  Get the dimensions (height, width) of the grid. Since height is known to be 1, focus on the width.
4.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to `width - 1` of the single row (row index `r = 0`).
5.  For the current pixel at `(0, c)` in the *input* grid:
    a.  Get the color `pixel_color` of this pixel.
    b.  If `pixel_color` is non-white (greater than 0):
        i.  Determine the color of the left neighbor: `left_color = 0` if `c == 0`, otherwise `left_color = input_grid[0][c-1]`.
        ii. Determine the color of the right neighbor: `right_color = 0` if `c == width - 1`, otherwise `right_color = input_grid[0][c+1]`.
        iii. Check if the current pixel is isolated: `is_isolated = (left_color == 0 and right_color == 0)`.
        iv. If `is_isolated` is true:
            1.  Set the color of the pixel at `(0, c)` in the *output* grid to `pixel_color`. (This might be redundant due to the copy, but ensures correctness).
            2.  If `c > 0` (a left neighbor exists), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c-1)` in the *output* grid to `pixel_color`.
            3.  If `c < width - 1` (a right neighbor exists), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c+1)` in the *output* grid to `pixel_color`.
6.  After iterating through all columns, return the modified output grid.
