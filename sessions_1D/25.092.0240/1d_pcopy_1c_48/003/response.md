"""
Transforms a 1-row input grid by expanding isolated non-white pixels into 3-pixel horizontal blocks.

The transformation rule identifies single non-white pixels (color > 0) in the input grid that are horizontally surrounded by white pixels (color 0) or grid boundaries. 
Each such isolated pixel is expanded into a 3-pixel horizontal block of the same color in the output grid. This involves changing the color of the immediate left and right white neighbors (if they exist within the grid bounds) to the color of the isolated pixel. 
Non-white pixels that are already part of a horizontal block wider than one pixel, and all other white pixels, remain unchanged.
