            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error \"too many values to unpack (expected 2)\" during testing indicates an issue with how the input grid's dimensions are being handled, specifically at the line `height, width = input_np.shape`. The initial code assumed the input `input_grid` was a flat list and wrapped it in `np.array([input_grid])`. However, the standard ARC format provides input as a list of lists (e.g., `[[...]]` for a single row). Wrapping this again creates a 3D array `[[[...]]]` whose shape has three dimensions, causing the unpacking error.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the input handling to use `input_np = np.array(input_grid)` directly, assuming the input is already in the standard `list[list[int]]` format.\n2.  Verify the dimensions using a tool call to confirm the 1xN structure observed visually.\n3.  Keep the core transformation logic, as it correctly reflects the visual pattern of expanding isolated pixels horizontally within the row.\n4.  Ensure the output is returned in the correct `list[list[int]]` format.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

Boundary conditions are treated as white neighbors.\n\nActions:\n  - Identify: Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid.\n  - Analyze Neighbors: For each non-white pixel, check the color of its horizontal neighbors.\n  - Check Isolation Condition: Determine if a non-white pixel meets the isolation criteria (single pixel flanked by white or boundaries).\n  - Expand: If a non-white pixel is isolated, modify the corresponding output grid pixels: set the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors (if they exist within bounds) to the non-white pixel's color.\n  - Preserve: If a non-white pixel is *not* isolated (i.e., it's part of a block wider than 1), its color and the color of its block are preserved in the output grid. White pixels not affected by expansion are also preserved.\n\nTransformation Goal:\n  - Transform a 1xN input grid into a 1xN output grid.\n  - Expand every isolated single non-white pixel into a 3-pixel horizontal block of the same color.\n  - Leave all other pixels (white background, non-white pixels already in blocks wider than 1) unchanged.\n```"
