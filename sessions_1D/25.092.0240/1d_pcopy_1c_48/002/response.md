**Assessment and Strategy**

The error "too many values to unpack (expected 2)" during testing indicates an issue with how the input grid's dimensions are being handled, specifically at the line `height, width = input_np.shape`. The initial code assumed the input `input_grid` was a flat list and wrapped it in `np.array([input_grid])`. However, the standard ARC format provides input as a list of lists (e.g., `[[...]]` for a single row). Wrapping this again creates a 3D array `[[[...]]]` whose shape has three dimensions, causing the unpacking error.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the input handling to use `input_np = np.array(input_grid)` directly, assuming the input is already in the standard `list[list[int]]` format.
2.  Verify the dimensions using a tool call to confirm the 1xN structure observed visually.
3.  Keep the core transformation logic, as it correctly reflects the visual pattern of expanding isolated pixels horizontally within the row.
4.  Ensure the output is returned in the correct `list[list[int]]` format.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - All example grids are 1 row high (1xN).
  - Grids contain a background color (white, 0) and one other non-white color.

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - is_non_white: Boolean (color > 0).
  - type: Background
    properties:
      - color: White (0).
  - type: Non-White Pixel Group
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color (e.g., magenta, yellow).
      - extent: Contiguous horizontal block of pixels of the same non-white color.
      - size: Width of the block (number of pixels).
      - is_isolated_single: Boolean (size is 1 and both horizontal neighbors are white or boundary).

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are neighbors horizontally (left/right).
  - Isolation: A single non-white pixel is isolated if its left and right neighbors (within grid bounds) are both white. Boundary conditions are treated as white neighbors.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Analyze Neighbors: For each non-white pixel, check the color of its horizontal neighbors.
  - Check Isolation Condition: Determine if a non-white pixel meets the isolation criteria (single pixel flanked by white or boundaries).
  - Expand: If a non-white pixel is isolated, modify the corresponding output grid pixels: set the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors (if they exist within bounds) to the non-white pixel's color.
  - Preserve: If a non-white pixel is *not* isolated (i.e., it's part of a block wider than 1), its color and the color of its block are preserved in the output grid. White pixels not affected by expansion are also preserved.

Transformation Goal:
  - Transform a 1xN input grid into a 1xN output grid.
  - Expand every isolated single non-white pixel into a 3-pixel horizontal block of the same color.
  - Leave all other pixels (white background, non-white pixels already in blocks wider than 1) unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid (assumed to be a 2D list of lists, specifically 1xN for this task).
2.  Create a deep copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
3.  Get the dimensions (height, width) of the grid. Since height is known to be 1, focus on the width.
4.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to `width - 1` of the single row (row index `r = 0`).
5.  For the current pixel at `(0, c)` in the *input* grid:
    a.  Get the color `pixel_color` of this pixel.
    b.  If `pixel_color` is non-white (greater than 0):
        i.  Determine the color of the left neighbor: `left_color = 0` if `c == 0`, otherwise `left_color = input_grid[0][c-1]`.
        ii. Determine the color of the right neighbor: `right_color = 0` if `c == width - 1`, otherwise `right_color = input_grid[0][c+1]`.
        iii. Check if the current pixel is isolated: `is_isolated = (left_color == 0 and right_color == 0)`.
        iv. If `is_isolated` is true:
            1.  Set the color of the pixel at `(0, c)` in the *output* grid to `pixel_color`. (This might be redundant due to the copy, but ensures correctness).
            2.  If `c > 0` (a left neighbor exists), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c-1)` in the *output* grid to `pixel_color`.
            3.  If `c < width - 1` (a right neighbor exists), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c+1)` in the *output* grid to `pixel_color`.
6.  After iterating through all columns, return the modified output grid.
