Grid Properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - All example grids are 1 row high (1xN).
  - Grids contain a background color (white, 0) and one other non-white color.

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - is_non_white: Boolean (color > 0).
  - type: Background
    properties:
      - color: White (0).
  - type: Non-White Pixel Group
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color (e.g., magenta, yellow).
      - extent: Contiguous horizontal block of pixels of the same non-white color.
      - size: Width of the block (number of pixels).
      - is_isolated_single: Boolean (size is 1 and both horizontal neighbors are white or boundary).

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are neighbors horizontally (left/right).
  - Isolation: A single non-white pixel is isolated if its left and right neighbors (within grid bounds) are both white. Boundary conditions are treated as white neighbors.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Analyze Neighbors: For each non-white pixel, check the color of its horizontal neighbors.
  - Check Isolation Condition: Determine if a non-white pixel meets the isolation criteria (single pixel flanked by white or boundaries).
  - Expand: If a non-white pixel is isolated, modify the corresponding output grid pixels: set the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors (if they exist within bounds) to the non-white pixel's color.
  - Preserve: If a non-white pixel is *not* isolated (i.e., it's part of a block wider than 1), its color and the color of its block are preserved in the output grid. White pixels not affected by expansion are also preserved.

Transformation Goal:
  - Transform a 1xN input grid into a 1xN output grid.
  - Expand every isolated single non-white pixel into a 3-pixel horizontal block of the same color.
  - Leave all other pixels (white background, non-white pixels already in blocks wider than 1) unchanged.
