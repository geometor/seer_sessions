Okay, let's break down the perception, facts, and the natural language program for this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are presented as 1D sequences of numbers (colors), likely representing a single row of a larger grid or just a 1D problem.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (Maroon=9, Gray=5, Orange=7).
3.  **Objects:** The key objects are contiguous horizontal blocks (runs) of the non-white color within the sequence.
4.  **Key Feature:** The length (or width) of these non-white blocks is crucial.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves modifying the lengths of these non-white blocks. Specifically, all blocks of the *same* non-white color are resized to match the length of the *longest* block of that color found in the input.
6.  **Resizing Mechanism:** The resizing appears to happen symmetrically around the center of the original block. Shorter blocks expand outwards, overwriting adjacent white pixels. The longest block remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Resizes all contiguous horizontal blocks of a specific non-white color to match the length of the longest block of that same color found in the input sequence.
data_format:
  type: 1D sequence (or single row grid)
  cell_values: Integers 0-9 representing colors.
objects:
  - object: color_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., Maroon, Gray, Orange).
      - start_index: The starting position (index) of the block in the sequence.
      - end_index: The ending position (index) of the block in the sequence.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
relationships:
  - relationship: intra_color_comparison
    description: All blocks of the same non-white color are compared based on their length.
    operands:
      - color_block (same non-white color)
    purpose: To find the maximum length among them.
actions:
  - action: find_dominant_color
    description: Identify the single non-white color present in the input sequence.
    output: target_color
  - action: find_blocks
    description: Locate all contiguous blocks of the target_color in the input sequence.
    input: input_sequence, target_color
    output: list_of_blocks (each with start_index, end_index, length)
  - action: find_max_length
    description: Determine the maximum length among the identified blocks.
    input: list_of_blocks
    output: max_len
  - action: resize_blocks
    description: >
      Generate the output sequence by creating new blocks corresponding to each original block,
      but with the calculated max_len, centered at the original block's center position.
    input: input_sequence_length, list_of_blocks, target_color, max_len
    output: output_sequence
    details: >
      Initialize an output sequence (same length as input) with white (0).
      For each original block:
      1. Calculate its center index: center = floor((start + end) / 2).
      2. Calculate the new start/end indices based on max_len and center:
         new_start = center - floor((max_len - 1) / 2)
         new_end = center + ceil((max_len - 1) / 2)
      3. Fill the output sequence from new_start to new_end with target_color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the non-white color (`target_color`) present in the input sequence.
2.  Find all distinct contiguous blocks of the `target_color` in the input sequence, noting their start and end positions.
3.  Calculate the length of each block and determine the maximum length (`max_len`) found among them.
4.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled entirely with the white color (0).
5.  For each identified block from the input sequence:
    a.  Calculate the central position (index) of the original block.
    b.  Determine the start and end indices for a new block of length `max_len`, centered at the calculated central position.
    c.  Fill the corresponding range of indices in the output sequence with the `target_color`.
6.  Return the completed output sequence.
