Specifically, all blocks of the *same* non-white color are resized to match the length of the *longest* block of that color found in the input.\n6.  **Resizing Mechanism:** The resizing appears to happen symmetrically around the center of the original block. Shorter blocks expand outwards, overwriting adjacent white pixels. The longest block remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
