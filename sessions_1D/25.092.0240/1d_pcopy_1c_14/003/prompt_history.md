*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids appear to be 1-dimensional arrays or single rows.
    *   Each grid contains objects composed of non-white pixels (maroon '9' or red '2') separated by white '0' pixels.
    *   In each example, there is one object that is larger (3 pixels wide) than the others (1 pixel wide). The color of the larger object is the same as the smaller objects within that example.
    *   The transformation seems to identify the largest object as a "pattern".
    *   It then finds all single-pixel objects of the *same color* as the pattern object.
    *   Each of these single-pixel objects is replaced by a copy of the pattern object.
    *   The replacement is centered: the copied pattern is placed such that its center pixel occupies the position of the original single pixel.
    *   The original pattern object and the background pixels remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Based on examples, appears effectively 1D
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: non-white (varies per example, e.g., maroon, red)
        properties:
          - size (pixel count)
          - position (indices)
    relationships:
      - pattern_object: The object with the largest size (pixel count). Assumed unique in these examples.
      - target_objects: Objects consisting of a single pixel with the same color as the pattern_object.
    actions:
      - identify: Find all non-white objects.
      - identify: Determine the pattern_object (largest).
      - identify: Find all target_objects (single pixel, same color as pattern).
      - replace: For each target_object, replace it with a copy of the pattern_object.
      - positioning: Center the copied pattern_object at the index of the original target_object.
      - preserve: Keep the original pattern_object and background pixels unchanged.
    constraints:
      - Replacement only occurs for single-pixel objects matching the pattern color.
      - The pattern object itself is not modified or replaced.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input grid to identify all contiguous objects of non-white pixels, noting their color, size (number of pixels), and position (indices).
    2.  Find the object with the largest size. Designate this as the `pattern_object`. Record its shape/pixel sequence and color.
    3.  Identify all objects that consist of exactly one pixel and have the same color as the `pattern_object`. Designate these as `target_objects`. Record their positions (indices).
    4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    5.  For each `target_object` identified in step 3:
        a.  Determine the index `i` of the `target_object`.
        b.  Determine the length `L` of the `pattern_object`.
        c.  Calculate the start index for the replacement: `start_index = i - floor(L / 2)`.
        d.  Calculate the end index for the replacement: `end_index = i + floor(L / 2)`.
        e.  Place the `pattern_object` into the output grid spanning the indices from `start_index` to `end_index`. Ensure boundary conditions are handled if necessary (though not apparent in these examples).
    6.  Return the modified output grid.

## Example 1:

## Example 2:
Error: list index out of range

## Example 3:
Error: list index out of range
*   **Assessment:**
    *   The core logic identified in the initial analysis (find largest object, find single pixels of the same color, replace single pixels with the centered pattern) appears consistent with all three training examples.
    *   The error `list index out of range` occurring consistently across all examples strongly suggests an issue with how the input data structure is handled at the very beginning of the `transform` function, before the main logic executes.
    *   The original code assumed the input `input_grid` is *always* a list containing at least one inner list (e.g., `[[row_data]]`). If the ARC framework sometimes passes an empty list `[]` or potentially a list representing a single row directly `[row_data]` (though less likely per ARC standards), the line `grid_1d_list = input_grid[0]` would fail.
    *   The strategy is to refine the initial input validation to handle edge cases like an empty input list `[]` before attempting to access `input_grid[0]`. The rest of the logic, including object finding and replacement, seems sound based on the examples provided.

Output Dimension: 1x33

Error Assessment:
The 'list index out of range' error likely occurs if `input_grid` is `[]`, causing `input_grid[0]` to fail.
Revised code should check `if not input_grid:` before accessing `input_grid[0]`.

```
*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (operationally, applied to the first row)
    input_format: Assumed list of lists (e.g., [[row_data]]). Requires validation for empty input `[]`.
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: non-white (varies per example: maroon(9), red(2))
        properties:
          - size (pixel count)
          - position (start and end indices)
          - color
    relationships:
      - pattern_object: The object with the largest size (pixel count) in the first row. Assumed unique.
      - target_objects: Objects in the first row consisting of a single pixel with the same color as the pattern_object.
    actions:
      - validate: Check if the input grid is a non-empty list containing at least one row (list).
      - select_row: Operate on the first row of the input grid.
      - identify: Find all contiguous non-white objects in the selected row.
      - identify: Determine the pattern_object (largest size). Store its color and pixel sequence.
      - identify: Find all target_objects (size 1, same color as pattern). Record their positions (indices).
      - copy: Create a copy of the selected input row for modification.
      - replace: For each target_object:
          - Calculate the placement range in the output row to center the pattern_object over the target_object's original index.
          - Handle boundary conditions: if the pattern placement extends beyond the grid edges, only place the part of the pattern that fits within the grid boundaries.
          - Overwrite the pixels in the calculated range of the output row with the corresponding pixels from the pattern_object sequence.
      - preserve: Keep the original pattern_object location and background pixels unchanged unless overwritten by a pattern replacement centered on a different target object.
      - format_output: Return the modified row within a list, maintaining the list-of-lists structure (e.g., [[modified_row_data]]).
    constraints:
      - Only operates on the first row if multiple rows were present.
      - Replacement only occurs for single-pixel objects matching the pattern color.
      - The original pattern object itself is not explicitly targeted for replacement (though parts might be overwritten if a target pixel is adjacent).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Validate the input grid: Ensure it is a list and contains at least one row (which is also a list). If not, handle appropriately (e.g., return an empty list or the input).
    2.  Select the first row of the input grid for processing.
    3.  Parse the selected row to identify all contiguous objects of non-white pixels, recording their color, size (number of pixels), and start/end indices.
    4.  If no non-white objects are found, return the input grid formatted as a list containing the original first row.
    5.  Find the object with the largest size among the identified objects. Designate this as the `pattern_object`. Record its pixel sequence and color.
    6.  Identify all objects that consist of exactly one pixel and have the same color as the `pattern_object`. Designate these as `target_objects`. Record their positions (indices).
    7.  Create a modifiable copy of the selected input row to serve as the output row.
    8.  For each `target_object` identified in step 6:
        a.  Get the index `i` of the `target_object`.
        b.  Get the length `L` of the `pattern_object` sequence.
        c.  Calculate the target start index for placing the pattern in the output row: `start_idx = i - floor(L / 2)`.
        d.  Calculate the target end index (exclusive): `end_idx = start_idx + L`.
        e.  Determine the portion of the `pattern_object` sequence and the corresponding portion of the output row that overlap within the valid grid boundaries (0 to row_length - 1).
        f.  Replace the pixels in the valid overlapping range of the output row with the corresponding pixels from the `pattern_object` sequence.
    9.  Return the modified output row, enclosed in a list, like `[[modified_row_data]]`.
