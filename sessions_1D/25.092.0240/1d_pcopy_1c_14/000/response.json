The color of the larger object is the same as the smaller objects within that example.\n    *   The transformation seems to identify the largest object as a \"pattern\".\n    *   It then finds all single-pixel objects of the *same color* as the pattern object.\n    *   Each of these single-pixel objects is replaced by a copy of the pattern object.\n    *   The replacement is centered: the copied pattern is placed such that its center pixel occupies the position of the original single pixel.\n    *   The original pattern object and the background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Designate this as the `pattern_object`. Record its shape/pixel sequence and color.\n    3.  Identify all objects that consist of exactly one pixel and have the same color as the `pattern_object`. Designate these as `target_objects`. Record their positions (indices).\n    4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n    5.
