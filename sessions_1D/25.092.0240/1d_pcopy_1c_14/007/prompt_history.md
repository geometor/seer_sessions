*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids appear to be 1-dimensional arrays or single rows.
    *   Each grid contains objects composed of non-white pixels (maroon '9' or red '2') separated by white '0' pixels.
    *   In each example, there is one object that is larger (3 pixels wide) than the others (1 pixel wide). The color of the larger object is the same as the smaller objects within that example.
    *   The transformation seems to identify the largest object as a "pattern".
    *   It then finds all single-pixel objects of the *same color* as the pattern object.
    *   Each of these single-pixel objects is replaced by a copy of the pattern object.
    *   The replacement is centered: the copied pattern is placed such that its center pixel occupies the position of the original single pixel.
    *   The original pattern object and the background pixels remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Based on examples, appears effectively 1D
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: non-white (varies per example, e.g., maroon, red)
        properties:
          - size (pixel count)
          - position (indices)
    relationships:
      - pattern_object: The object with the largest size (pixel count). Assumed unique in these examples.
      - target_objects: Objects consisting of a single pixel with the same color as the pattern_object.
    actions:
      - identify: Find all non-white objects.
      - identify: Determine the pattern_object (largest).
      - identify: Find all target_objects (single pixel, same color as pattern).
      - replace: For each target_object, replace it with a copy of the pattern_object.
      - positioning: Center the copied pattern_object at the index of the original target_object.
      - preserve: Keep the original pattern_object and background pixels unchanged.
    constraints:
      - Replacement only occurs for single-pixel objects matching the pattern color.
      - The pattern object itself is not modified or replaced.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input grid to identify all contiguous objects of non-white pixels, noting their color, size (number of pixels), and position (indices).
    2.  Find the object with the largest size. Designate this as the `pattern_object`. Record its shape/pixel sequence and color.
    3.  Identify all objects that consist of exactly one pixel and have the same color as the `pattern_object`. Designate these as `target_objects`. Record their positions (indices).
    4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    5.  For each `target_object` identified in step 3:
        a.  Determine the index `i` of the `target_object`.
        b.  Determine the length `L` of the `pattern_object`.
        c.  Calculate the start index for the replacement: `start_index = i - floor(L / 2)`.
        d.  Calculate the end index for the replacement: `end_index = i + floor(L / 2)`.
        e.  Place the `pattern_object` into the output grid spanning the indices from `start_index` to `end_index`. Ensure boundary conditions are handled if necessary (though not apparent in these examples).
    6.  Return the modified output grid.

"""
Processes the input grid row by row. For each row:
1. Identifies all contiguous blocks (objects) of non-white pixels.
2. Determines the largest object in the row, designating it as the 'pattern' for that row.
3. Finds all single-pixel objects within the same row that share the same color as the row's pattern.
4. Creates a copy of the row.
5. Replaces each identified single-pixel object in the copied row with a copy of the pattern, ensuring the pattern is centered over the original pixel's position.
6. Handles boundary conditions: if placing the pattern causes it to extend beyond the row's edges, the pattern is clipped accordingly.
7. The original pattern object location remains unchanged unless it is overwritten by a replacement centered on a different target pixel.
8. Returns a new grid composed of these potentially modified rows, having the same dimensions as the input grid.

**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by processing each row of the input grid independently. For each row, it identifies the largest contiguous block of non-white pixels (the "pattern"), finds all single pixels of the same color ("targets"), and replaces the targets with a centered copy of the pattern. The code includes logic for handling boundary conditions (clipping the pattern if it extends beyond the row edges).

However, the code failed on all training examples with a "list index out of range" error. This indicates a fundamental issue, likely related to:
1.  **Input Format Mismatch:** The code expects input as a list of lists (`list[list[int]]`). If the actual input during testing was different (e.g., a single list `list[int]`, an empty list `[]`, or a list of non-list elements), the indexing or iteration would fail.
2.  **Indexing Error:** Despite boundary checks, there might be a subtle flaw in calculating the source (`src_start`, `src_end`) or destination (`dest_start`, `dest_end`) slice indices, especially in edge cases (pattern or target at the very beginning or end of a row, empty rows, single-cell rows). NumPy slicing and Python list indexing behave differently, and errors could arise during conversion or assignment.
3.  **Array Data Type Issues:** If the input list of lists is ragged (rows of different lengths), `np.array(input_grid)` might create an array with `dtype=object`, which could cause unexpected behavior during slicing or assignment.

The strategy moving forward is to refine the understanding of the transformation rule based *only* on the visual examples and assume the core logic (row-wise pattern identification and replacement) is correct, while acknowledging the implementation failed. The natural language program and facts will be based on this core logic.

**Metrics:**

Based on the assumption that the inputs are processed row-by-row and the transformation applies as described:

| Example | Input Shape (assumed HxW) | Output Shape (assumed HxW) | Pattern Object (Row 0) | Target Objects (Row 0) | Transformation Applied? | Notes                                      |
| :------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| train_1 | 1x33                      | 1x33                       | `[9, 9, 9]` (size 3)   | `[9]` (size 1) at index 8 | Yes                     | Single target pixel replaced by pattern. |
| train_2 | 1x33                      | 1x33                       | `[2, 2, 2]` (size 3)   | `[2]` (size 1) at index 8 | Yes                     | Single target pixel replaced by pattern. |
| train_3 | 1x33                      | 1x33                       | `[2, 2, 2]` (size 3)   | `[2]` (size 1) at index 6, `[2]` (size 1) at index 12 | Yes | Two target pixels replaced by pattern.   |

The code execution confirms the metrics table analysis: the pattern is the largest block, and targets are single blocks of the same color.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D (processing is row-independent)
background_color: white (0)
scope: row-wise
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: non-white (varies per row and example)
    properties:
      - size (pixel count / width)
      - position (start_column, end_column)
      - color
relationships:
  - within_row:
      - pattern_object: The object with the largest size (width) in that row. (Assumption: unique largest object exists per row with relevant objects).
      - target_objects: Objects consisting of a single pixel (size=1) with the same color as the row's pattern_object.
actions:
  - for_each: row in the input grid:
      - identify: Find all contiguous non-white horizontal blocks (objects) in the row.
      - if: objects exist in the row:
          - identify: Determine the pattern_object (largest by size/width). Record its color and pixel sequence.
          - identify: Find all target_objects (size=1, same color as pattern). Record their column indices.
          - create: a copy of the current row for modification.
          - for_each: target_object in the row:
              - calculate: the placement range for the pattern sequence, centered on the target_object's column index.
              - clip: the placement range and the corresponding pattern sequence segment to fit within the row boundaries.
              - replace: the pixels in the copied row within the calculated destination range with the (potentially clipped) pattern sequence.
      - else: keep the original row unmodified.
  - construct: the output grid from the processed (or original) rows.
constraints:
  - Transformation is contained strictly within each row.
  - Only single-pixel objects matching the pattern's color are replaced.
  - The original pattern object itself is not explicitly preserved; it can be overwritten if a target replacement overlaps its position.
  - If multiple objects share the maximum size in a row, the behavior is undefined by these examples (assume one is chosen, e.g., the first encountered).
  - If no non-white objects exist in a row, the row remains unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
2.  For the current row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of non-white pixels. Record their color, size (width), start column, and end column.
3.  If no non-white objects are found in the row, keep the row as is and proceed to the next row.
4.  If objects are found, determine the object with the maximum size (width). This is the `pattern_object` for this row. Store its sequence of pixels and its color.
5.  Identify all objects in the same row that have a size of exactly 1 pixel and share the same color as the `pattern_object`. These are the `target_objects`. Store the column index of each `target_object`.
6.  Create a copy of the current row to serve as the output row.
7.  For each `target_object` identified:
    a.  Get the target column index `c`.
    b.  Get the width `W` of the `pattern_object`.
    c.  Calculate the starting column index for placing the pattern: `start_col = c - floor(W / 2)`.
    d.  Calculate the ending column index (exclusive) for placing the pattern: `end_col = start_col + W`.
    e.  Adjust `start_col`, `end_col`, and the segment of the `pattern_object` sequence to be used, clipping them to ensure they stay within the valid column boundaries (0 to width-1) of the grid.
    f.  Replace the pixels in the copied output row from the adjusted `start_col` to the adjusted `end_col` (exclusive) with the correspondingly clipped segment of the `pattern_object` sequence.
8.  After processing all target objects for the current row, replace the original row with the modified copied row.
9.  After processing all rows, return the complete modified grid.
