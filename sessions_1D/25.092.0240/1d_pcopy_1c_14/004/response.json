            "text": "## Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt failed with a `list index out of range` error on all training examples. The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic (find largest object, find single pixels of same color, replace with centered pattern) but incorrectly assumed the implementation details or the input structure might be simpler (purely 1D).\n\nThe `tool_code` execution confirmed that the training examples are indeed single-row grids (1xN). This means the `list index out of range` error likely stems from either:\n1.  An edge case in the input data handling (e.g., empty rows, unexpected grid formats not shown in examples) that wasn't properly caught by the validation logic.\n2.  A subtle bug in the indexing or slicing logic within the `find_objects_1d` or `transform` function, particularly around boundary conditions or object identification, that wasn't revealed by the manual trace but occurs in the execution environment.\n3.  A misunderstanding that the code should *only* handle 1-row inputs. A more robust interpretation of ARC tasks is that the logic derived from examples should generalize. Since all examples show the transformation occurring *within* a row, the generalization is likely to apply this logic independently to *each row* of a potentially multi-row input grid.\n\nThe strategy will be to refine the implementation to:\n*   Iterate through each row of the input grid.\n*   Apply the pattern-finding and replacement logic independently to each row.\n*   Ensure boundary condition handling during replacement is robust.\n*   Maintain clear separation between finding objects and performing transformations.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on `tool_code` execution:\n\n| Example   | Input Shape | Output Shape | Notes                                     |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------- |\n| train\\_1  | (1, 33)     | (1, 33)      | Pattern: `[9, 9, 9]`, Target: `[9]` at index 8 |\n| train\\_2  | (1, 33)     | (1, 33)      | Pattern: `[2, 2, 2]`, Target: `[2]` at index 8 |\n| train\\_3  | (1, 33)     | (1, 33)      | Pattern: `[2, 2, 2]`, Targets: `[2]` at indices 6 and 12 |\n\nAll examples provided are single-row grids. The transformation happens entirely within that row.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

For each `row` in the input grid, identified by its `row_index`:\n    a.  Create a copy of the `row` to potentially modify.\n    b.  Parse the current `row` to identify all contiguous objects of non-white pixels, noting their color, size (number of pixels), and position (start/end indices within the row). Store these as `row_objects`.\n    c.  If no `row_objects` are found in the current `row`, copy the original `row` to the `output_grid` at `row_index` and proceed to the next row.\n    d.  Find the object within `row_objects` that has the largest size. Designate this as the `pattern_object` for this row. Record its pixel sequence (`pattern_sequence`), color (`pattern_color`), and size (`pattern_size`). (Assume for now the largest object is unique per row based on examples).\n    e.  Identify all objects in `row_objects` that consist of exactly one pixel (`size == 1`) and have the same color as the `pattern_color`. Designate these as `target_objects` for this row. Record their starting positions (indices).\n    f.  Create a working copy of the current `row` (e.g., `output_row`).\n    g.  For each `target_object` identified in step 2.e, retrieve its index `target_index`:\n        i.  Calculate the ideal starting index (`start_index`) for placing the `pattern_sequence` so that its center pixel aligns with `target_index`. Use `start_index = target_index - floor(pattern_size / 2)`.\n        ii. Calculate the ideal ending index (`end_index`) as `start_index + pattern_size`.\n        iii. Determine the actual slice of `output_row` to modify (`dest_start` to `dest_end`) by clipping `start_index` and `end_index` to the valid bounds of the row (0 to length-1).\n        iv. Determine the corresponding slice of the `pattern_sequence` to use (`src_start` to `src_end`) based on how much clipping occurred in step 2.g.iii.\n        v. If the resulting destination slice is valid (i.e., `dest_start < dest_end`), replace the pixels in `output_row` from `dest_start` to `dest_end` with the pixels from `pattern_sequence` from `src_start` to `src_end`.\n    h.
