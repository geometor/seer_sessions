task_type: object_transformation_rowwise
grid_dimensionality: 2D (processing occurs independently per row)
background_color: white (0)
objects_per_row:
  - type: contiguous_block_1d
    color: non-white (varies per row/example)
    properties:
      - size (pixel count in the row)
      - position (start and end indices within the row)
      - color
relationships_per_row:
  - pattern_object: The object (contiguous_block_1d) with the largest size within that specific row. If ties, the first occurring might be the pattern (inferred, needs verification if examples with ties existed).
  - target_objects: Objects within the same row consisting of a single pixel and having the same color as the row's pattern_object.
actions_per_row:
  - identify: Find all non-white contiguous objects within the row.
  - identify: Determine the pattern_object (largest) for the row.
  - identify: Find all target_objects (single pixel, same color as row's pattern) for the row.
  - replace: For each target_object in the row, replace it in the output row with a copy of the row's pattern_object.
  - positioning: Center the copied pattern_object at the index of the original target_object within the row. Handle boundary clipping if the pattern extends beyond row limits.
  - preserve: Keep the original pattern_object location and background pixels unchanged in the output row, unless overwritten by a replacement operation centered on a different pixel.
global_structure:
  - independence: The transformation process is applied independently to each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding row of the output grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
