## Assessment

The previous code attempt failed with a `list index out of range` error on all training examples. The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic (find largest object, find single pixels of same color, replace with centered pattern) but incorrectly assumed the implementation details or the input structure might be simpler (purely 1D).

The `tool_code` execution confirmed that the training examples are indeed single-row grids (1xN). This means the `list index out of range` error likely stems from either:
1.  An edge case in the input data handling (e.g., empty rows, unexpected grid formats not shown in examples) that wasn't properly caught by the validation logic.
2.  A subtle bug in the indexing or slicing logic within the `find_objects_1d` or `transform` function, particularly around boundary conditions or object identification, that wasn't revealed by the manual trace but occurs in the execution environment.
3.  A misunderstanding that the code should *only* handle 1-row inputs. A more robust interpretation of ARC tasks is that the logic derived from examples should generalize. Since all examples show the transformation occurring *within* a row, the generalization is likely to apply this logic independently to *each row* of a potentially multi-row input grid.

The strategy will be to refine the implementation to:
*   Iterate through each row of the input grid.
*   Apply the pattern-finding and replacement logic independently to each row.
*   Ensure boundary condition handling during replacement is robust.
*   Maintain clear separation between finding objects and performing transformations.

## Metrics

Based on `tool_code` execution:

| Example   | Input Shape | Output Shape | Notes                                     |
| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| train\_1  | (1, 33)     | (1, 33)      | Pattern: `[9, 9, 9]`, Target: `[9]` at index 8 |
| train\_2  | (1, 33)     | (1, 33)      | Pattern: `[2, 2, 2]`, Target: `[2]` at index 8 |
| train\_3  | (1, 33)     | (1, 33)      | Pattern: `[2, 2, 2]`, Targets: `[2]` at indices 6 and 12 |

All examples provided are single-row grids. The transformation happens entirely within that row.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation_rowwise
grid_dimensionality: 2D (processing occurs independently per row)
background_color: white (0)
objects_per_row:
  - type: contiguous_block_1d
    color: non-white (varies per row/example)
    properties:
      - size (pixel count in the row)
      - position (start and end indices within the row)
      - color
relationships_per_row:
  - pattern_object: The object (contiguous_block_1d) with the largest size within that specific row. If ties, the first occurring might be the pattern (inferred, needs verification if examples with ties existed).
  - target_objects: Objects within the same row consisting of a single pixel and having the same color as the row's pattern_object.
actions_per_row:
  - identify: Find all non-white contiguous objects within the row.
  - identify: Determine the pattern_object (largest) for the row.
  - identify: Find all target_objects (single pixel, same color as row's pattern) for the row.
  - replace: For each target_object in the row, replace it in the output row with a copy of the row's pattern_object.
  - positioning: Center the copied pattern_object at the index of the original target_object within the row. Handle boundary clipping if the pattern extends beyond row limits.
  - preserve: Keep the original pattern_object location and background pixels unchanged in the output row, unless overwritten by a replacement operation centered on a different pixel.
global_structure:
  - independence: The transformation process is applied independently to each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding row of the output grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  For each `row` in the input grid, identified by its `row_index`:
    a.  Create a copy of the `row` to potentially modify.
    b.  Parse the current `row` to identify all contiguous objects of non-white pixels, noting their color, size (number of pixels), and position (start/end indices within the row). Store these as `row_objects`.
    c.  If no `row_objects` are found in the current `row`, copy the original `row` to the `output_grid` at `row_index` and proceed to the next row.
    d.  Find the object within `row_objects` that has the largest size. Designate this as the `pattern_object` for this row. Record its pixel sequence (`pattern_sequence`), color (`pattern_color`), and size (`pattern_size`). (Assume for now the largest object is unique per row based on examples).
    e.  Identify all objects in `row_objects` that consist of exactly one pixel (`size == 1`) and have the same color as the `pattern_color`. Designate these as `target_objects` for this row. Record their starting positions (indices).
    f.  Create a working copy of the current `row` (e.g., `output_row`).
    g.  For each `target_object` identified in step 2.e, retrieve its index `target_index`:
        i.  Calculate the ideal starting index (`start_index`) for placing the `pattern_sequence` so that its center pixel aligns with `target_index`. Use `start_index = target_index - floor(pattern_size / 2)`.
        ii. Calculate the ideal ending index (`end_index`) as `start_index + pattern_size`.
        iii. Determine the actual slice of `output_row` to modify (`dest_start` to `dest_end`) by clipping `start_index` and `end_index` to the valid bounds of the row (0 to length-1).
        iv. Determine the corresponding slice of the `pattern_sequence` to use (`src_start` to `src_end`) based on how much clipping occurred in step 2.g.iii.
        v. If the resulting destination slice is valid (i.e., `dest_start < dest_end`), replace the pixels in `output_row` from `dest_start` to `dest_end` with the pixels from `pattern_sequence` from `src_start` to `src_end`.
    h.  Place the final `output_row` into the `output_grid` at the current `row_index`.
3.  Return the completed `output_grid`.
