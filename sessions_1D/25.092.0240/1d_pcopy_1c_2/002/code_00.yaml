task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D grid (assumed 4x8 based on element count)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels with the same non-white color within a single row.
    properties:
      - color: (integer > 0) The color of the pixels in the segment.
      - location: (row_index, start_col_index) The starting position of the segment.
      - length: (integer >= 1) The number of pixels in the segment.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    context: Defines segments (pixels of the same color next to each other horizontally within a row).
  - type: spatial
    context: Checks pixels to the right of a segment within the same row for color and boundary conditions.
actions:
  - name: process_row
    input: input_grid_row, output_grid_row
    logic: |
      Identify all horizontal_segments in the input_grid_row.
      For each segment (color C, start_col S, length L):
        If L is 1:
          Check if S + 1 and S + 2 are valid column indices within the grid width.
          Check if input_grid_row[S + 1] is white (0).
          Check if input_grid_row[S + 2] is white (0).
          If all checks are true:
            Set output_grid_row[S + 1] = C
            Set output_grid_row[S + 2] = C
        Else (L > 1):
          No change needed for this segment (pixels are already copied).
processing_mode: Row-by-row. Evaluate conditions based on the input grid state, apply modifications to the output grid.
uncertainty: The output data provided for training examples 2 and 3 seems inconsistent with the transformation rule clearly derivable from example 1. The solution proceeds assuming the rule from example 1 is correct and the other examples' outputs might be erroneous in the prompt.
