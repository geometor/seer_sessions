Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids appear to be one-dimensional arrays or single rows from a larger 2D grid. All examples show a single sequence of numbers.
2.  **Colors:** The background color is consistently white (0). The significant colors involved are magenta (6), azure (8), and gray (5), varying across examples.
3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. These segments are separated by one or more white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to depend on the *length* of these non-white segments.
    *   Segments that are initially longer than one pixel (e.g., `6 6 6` in example 1, `8 8 8` in example 2, `5 5 5` in example 3) appear unchanged in the output.
    *   Segments that consist of a single pixel (e.g., the `6` at index 8 in example 1, the `8` at index 6 in example 2, the `5` at index 7 in example 3) are modified.
5.  **Modification Rule:** Single-pixel segments are extended to the right to become three-pixel segments of the same color. This extension overwrites the two pixels immediately to the right of the original single pixel, but *only* if those two pixels were originally white (0).
6.  **Independence:** The extension of one single-pixel segment does not seem to be blocked by the extension of another; the conditions for extension (presence of two white pixels to the right) are evaluated based on the *input* grid state.

**Facts**

          Set output_grid_row[segment.start_index + 2] = segment.color

        No change needed (segment is already copied to output).

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels within the input grid. For each segment, note its color, starting index, and length.
3.  Iterate through the identified segments.
4.  For each segment, check its length:
    a.  If the segment's length is exactly 1:
        i.  Determine the index `P` of this single pixel and its color `C`.
        ii. Check if positions `P+1` and `P+2` exist within the grid boundaries.
        iii. Check if the pixels at positions `P+1` and `P+2` in the *original input grid* are both white (color 0).
        iv. If both conditions (boundary and color checks) are met, update the *output grid* by setting the pixels at positions `P+1` and `P+2` to the color `C`.
    b.  If the segment's length is greater than 1, do nothing for this segment (it remains as copied initially).
5.  After processing all segments based on the input grid's state, return the final modified output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code attempted to expand single-pixel segments to the right based on the condition that the two pixels immediately to the right were white (0) in the input. The results show this logic is incorrect. The generated outputs consistently differ from the expected outputs precisely at the locations where these single pixels exist in the input.

Comparing the input and expected output reveals a different pattern:
- Single pixels in the input become the *center* of a three-pixel segment of the same color in the output.
- This transformation occurs only if the pixels immediately to the left *and* right of the single pixel in the input are both white (0).
- Segments in the input that are already longer than one pixel remain unchanged in the output.

The strategy is to:
1.  Identify all contiguous non-white segments in each row of the input.
2.  For segments of length 1, check their immediate left and right neighbors in the input grid.
3.  If both neighbors are white (0) and within bounds, replace the left neighbor, the pixel itself, and the right neighbor in the output grid with the segment's color.
4.  Copy all other pixels (including longer segments and pixels not involved in the expansion) directly from the input to the output.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the condition (single pixel flanked by white pixels) for each transformation point.

The analysis confirms the revised hypothesis: In all examples, the single non-white pixels that get expanded into a 1x3 segment are precisely those that have white (0) neighbors on both the immediate left and right in the input grid. The output shows the corresponding triplet `(left_neighbor, center, right_neighbor)` changed to the pixel's color.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D grid, processed row by row independently
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels with the same non-white color in a single row.
    properties:
      - color: (integer > 0) The color of the pixels in the segment.
      - row_index: (integer >= 0) The row where the segment resides.
      - start_col_index: (integer >= 0) The starting column index of the segment.
      - length: (integer >= 1) The number of pixels in the segment.
      - is_single_pixel: (boolean) True if length is 1.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency (horizontal)
    context: Defines segments and identifies immediate left/right neighbors.
    properties:
      - left_neighbor_color: Color of the pixel at (row_index, start_col_index - 1).
      - right_neighbor_color: Color of the pixel at (row_index, start_col_index + length). # For length=1, this is start_col_index + 1
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input_grid_row
    output: list of horizontal_segments (color, start_col, length)
  - name: process_segment
    input: segment, input_grid_row, output_grid_row
    logic: |
      Initialize output_grid_row as a copy of input_grid_row.
      If segment.is_single_pixel is True (length is 1):
        Let P be segment.start_col_index and C be segment.color.
        Check if P-1 and P+1 are valid column indices within the grid row.
        Check if input_grid_row[P-1] is white (0).
        Check if input_grid_row[P+1] is white (0).
        If all checks are true (in bounds and neighbors are white):
          Set output_grid_row[P-1] = C
          Set output_grid_row[P] = C  // This might be redundant if copying initially, but clarifies intent
          Set output_grid_row[P+1] = C
      Else (segment.length > 1):
        No change needed for this segment (it remains as copied initially).
processing_mode: Row-independent. Evaluate conditions based on input state, apply modifications to an output grid copy.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
3.  For the current row being processed:
    a.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels within that row of the *input* grid. Note their color, starting column index, and length.
    b.  Iterate through the identified segments for this row.
    c.  If a segment's length is exactly 1:
        i.  Let `C` be the color of the segment and `P` be its column index.
        ii. Check if the column index `P-1` (left neighbor) and `P+1` (right neighbor) are within the valid column boundaries of the grid.
        iii. Check if the pixel at `(row, P-1)` and the pixel at `(row, P+1)` in the *original input grid* are both white (color 0).
        iv. If both boundary and color conditions are met, update the *output grid* at the current row by setting the pixels at column indices `P-1`, `P`, and `P+1` to the color `C`.
    d.  If a segment's length is greater than 1, make no changes related to this segment (it remains as initially copied to the output grid).
4.  After processing all rows and all relevant segments within them, return the final modified output grid.
