```python
"""
Transforms a 2D input grid by modifying horizontal segments within each row independently.
The transformation identifies contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in each row
of the input grid. If a segment consists of only a single pixel, and that pixel is
flanked immediately to its left and right by white pixels (0) within the row boundaries,
then in the output grid, this single pixel and its two white neighbors are replaced
by a three-pixel segment of the original single pixel's color. Segments initially 
longer than one pixel, and single pixels not flanked by white pixels, remain unchanged 
in the output grid. The process is applied row by row, based on the state of the 
input grid.
