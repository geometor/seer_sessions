If a segment consists of only a single pixel, and that pixel is\nflanked immediately to its left and right by white pixels (0) within the row boundaries,\nthen in the output grid, this single pixel and its two white neighbors are replaced\nby a three-pixel segment of the original single pixel's color. Segments initially \nlonger than one pixel, and single pixels not flanked by white pixels, remain unchanged \nin the output grid. The process is applied row by row, based on the state of the \ninput grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef find_segments_in_row(row: np.ndarray) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in a 1D array (row).\n\n    Args:\n        row: A 1D numpy array representing a single row of the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a segment\n        (color, start_col_index, length).
