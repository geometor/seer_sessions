Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids appear to be one-dimensional arrays or single rows from a larger 2D grid. All examples show a single sequence of numbers.
2.  **Colors:** The background color is consistently white (0). The significant colors involved are magenta (6), azure (8), and gray (5), varying across examples.
3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. These segments are separated by one or more white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to depend on the *length* of these non-white segments.
    *   Segments that are initially longer than one pixel (e.g., `6 6 6` in example 1, `8 8 8` in example 2, `5 5 5` in example 3) appear unchanged in the output.
    *   Segments that consist of a single pixel (e.g., the `6` at index 8 in example 1, the `8` at index 6 in example 2, the `5` at index 7 in example 3) are modified.
5.  **Modification Rule:** Single-pixel segments are extended to the right to become three-pixel segments of the same color. This extension overwrites the two pixels immediately to the right of the original single pixel, but *only* if those two pixels were originally white (0).
6.  **Independence:** The extension of one single-pixel segment does not seem to be blocked by the extension of another; the conditions for extension (presence of two white pixels to the right) are evaluated based on the *input* grid state.

**Facts**

task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 1D array or independent rows of a 2D grid
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: (integer > 0) The color of the pixels in the segment.
      - location: (start_index, end_index) The starting and ending indices of the segment in the row.
      - length: (integer >= 1) The number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    context: Defines segments (pixels of the same color next to each other horizontally).
  - type: spatial
    context: Checks pixels to the right of a segment for color and boundary conditions.

    logic: |
      If segment.length is 1:
        Check if segment.start_index + 1 and segment.start_index + 2 are within grid bounds.
        Check if input_grid_row[segment.start_index + 1] is white (0).
        Check if input_grid_row[segment.start_index + 2] is white (0).
        If all checks are true:
          Set output_grid_row[segment.start_index + 1] = segment.color
          Set output_grid_row[segment.start_index + 2] = segment.color
      Else (segment.length > 1):
        No change needed (segment is already copied to output).
processing_mode: Parallel evaluation based on input state, followed by modification application.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels within the input grid. For each segment, note its color, starting index, and length.
3.  Iterate through the identified segments.
4.  For each segment, check its length:
    a.  If the segment's length is exactly 1:
        i.  Determine the index `P` of this single pixel and its color `C`.
        ii. Check if positions `P+1` and `P+2` exist within the grid boundaries.
        iii. Check if the pixels at positions `P+1` and `P+2` in the *original input grid* are both white (color 0).
        iv. If both conditions (boundary and color checks) are met, update the *output grid* by setting the pixels at positions `P+1` and `P+2` to the color `C`.
    b.  If the segment's length is greater than 1, do nothing for this segment (it remains as copied initially).
5.  After processing all segments based on the input grid's state, return the final modified output grid.

"""
Transforms a 2D input grid by modifying horizontal segments within each row independently.
Specifically, it identifies contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in each row.
If a segment consists of only a single pixel, the transformation attempts to extend it 
to the right into a 1x3 segment of the same color. This extension only occurs if the 
two pixels immediately to the right of the single pixel are within the grid boundaries 
and were both white (0) in the original input grid. Segments initially longer than 
one pixel are left unchanged. The process is applied row by row, based on the state
