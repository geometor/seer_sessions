            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids appear to be one-dimensional arrays or single rows from a larger 2D grid. All examples show a single sequence of numbers.\n2.  **Colors:** The background color is consistently white (0). The significant colors involved are magenta (6), azure (8), and gray (5), varying across examples.\n3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. These segments are separated by one or more white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to depend on the *length* of these non-white segments.\n    *   Segments that are initially longer than one pixel (e.g., `6 6 6` in example 1, `8 8 8` in example 2, `5 5 5` in example 3) appear unchanged in the output.\n    *   Segments that consist of a single pixel (e.g., the `6` at index 8 in example 1, the `8` at index 6 in example 2, the `5` at index 7 in example 3) are modified.\n5.  **Modification Rule:** Single-pixel segments are extended to the right to become three-pixel segments of the same color. This extension overwrites the two pixels immediately to the right of the original single pixel, but *only* if those two pixels were originally white (0).\n6.  **Independence:** The extension of one single-pixel segment does not seem to be blocked by the extension of another; the conditions for extension (presence of two white pixels to the right) are evaluated based on the *input* grid state.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
