task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 1D array or independent rows of a 2D grid
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: (integer > 0) The color of the pixels in the segment.
      - location: (start_index, end_index) The starting and ending indices of the segment in the row.
      - length: (integer >= 1) The number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    context: Defines segments (pixels of the same color next to each other horizontally).
  - type: spatial
    context: Checks pixels to the right of a segment for color and boundary conditions.
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input_grid_row
    output: list of all horizontal_segments (color, location, length)
  - name: process_segment
    input: segment, input_grid_row, output_grid_row
    logic: |
      If segment.length is 1:
        Check if segment.start_index + 1 and segment.start_index + 2 are within grid bounds.
        Check if input_grid_row[segment.start_index + 1] is white (0).
        Check if input_grid_row[segment.start_index + 2] is white (0).
        If all checks are true:
          Set output_grid_row[segment.start_index + 1] = segment.color
          Set output_grid_row[segment.start_index + 2] = segment.color
      Else (segment.length > 1):
        No change needed (segment is already copied to output).
processing_mode: Parallel evaluation based on input state, followed by modification application.
