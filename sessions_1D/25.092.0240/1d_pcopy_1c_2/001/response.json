Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.\n2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels within the input grid. For each segment, note its color, starting index, and length.\n3.  Iterate through the identified segments.\n4.  For each segment:\n    a.  If the segment's length is exactly 1:\n        i.  Get the index `P` of this single pixel and its color `C`.\n        ii. Check if positions `P+1` and `P+2` are within the grid boundaries.\n        iii. Check if the pixels at positions `P+1` and `P+2` in the *original input grid* are both white (color 0).\n        iv. If both boundary and color checks are met, update the *output grid* by setting the pixels at positions `P+1` and `P+2` to the color `C`.\n    b.  If the segment's length is greater than 1, no changes are made for this segment.\n5.
