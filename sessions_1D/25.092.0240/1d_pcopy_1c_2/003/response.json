This extension only occurs if the \ntwo pixels immediately to the right of the single pixel are within the grid boundaries \nand were both white (0) in the original input grid. Segments initially longer than \none pixel are left unchanged. The process is applied row by row, based on the state \nof the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef find_segments_in_row(row: np.ndarray) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in a 1D array (row).\n\n    Args:\n        row: A 1D numpy array representing a single row of the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a segment\n        (color, start_col_index, length).
