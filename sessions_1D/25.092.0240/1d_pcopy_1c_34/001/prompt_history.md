Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single rows (1-dimensional grids).
2.  **Colors:** Each example uses white (0) as a background and one other color (azure-8, orange-7, magenta-6). The specific non-white color changes between examples but is consistent within a single input-output pair.
3.  **Input Pattern:** The input row typically starts with a contiguous horizontal block of the non-white color. Following this block, there are often isolated single pixels of the *same* non-white color, separated by white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying the initial contiguous block of the non-white color. This block acts as a "pattern". Then, wherever a single pixel of that same non-white color appears later in the row, that single pixel and the pixels immediately following it are replaced by a copy of the initial pattern.
5.  **Pattern Replication:** The length of the replacement matches the length of the initial pattern. For instance, if the initial pattern is `8 8 8` (length 3), any subsequent single `8` found will cause the segment starting at that `8` and of length 3 to be replaced by `8 8 8`.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first non-white pixel. Let its color be `C` and its index be `start_index`.
3.  Determine the contiguous sequence of pixels starting at `start_index` that all have the color `C`. This sequence is the `pattern_sequence`. Let its length be `pattern_length`.
4.  Scan the input grid again, starting from the index *after* the end of the `pattern_sequence` (`start_index + pattern_length`).
5.  For each pixel encountered during this second scan:
    a.  If the pixel's color is `C` and it is an isolated instance (i.e., the pixel before it, if one exists, is white, and the pixel after it, if one exists within the original pattern block boundaries, is also white - though the "isolated" check might be simpler by just looking for color `C`), record its index as a `marker_index`.
    b.  Replace the segment in the *output grid* starting at `marker_index` and extending for `pattern_length` pixels with the `pattern_sequence`. Handle boundary conditions (ensure replacement doesn't go beyond the grid width).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
