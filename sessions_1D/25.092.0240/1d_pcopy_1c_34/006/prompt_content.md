```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on a pattern replication rule. 
It identifies the first contiguous sequence of a non-background (non-zero) color, designated as the 'pattern'. 
It then scans the grid starting immediately after this pattern. 
When a pixel matching the pattern's color ('marker pixel') is found at index `i`, 
it replaces the segment in an output grid (initially a copy of the input) 
starting one position *before* the marker pixel (at index `i-1`) 
and extending for the length of the original pattern (or until the grid boundary) 
with the pattern sequence itself. 
All replacements are performed on the output grid, referencing the original input grid for marker locations.
