task_description: Replace isolated single pixels with the initial contiguous pattern of the same color.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: pattern_block
    description: The first contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      color: Varies per example (e.g., azure, orange, magenta) but is consistent within an example.
      shape: Horizontal line segment.
      length: Variable (e.g., 3 pixels in all examples shown).
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: Isolated single pixels matching the color of the pattern_block.
    properties:
      color: Same as pattern_block.
      location: Appears after the pattern_block in the row, separated by white pixels.
actions:
  - name: identify_pattern
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: pattern_block_sequence, pattern_color, pattern_length, pattern_start_index
    description: Find the first sequence of connected non-white pixels. Record its color, length, and starting position.
  - name: identify_markers
    inputs: input_grid, pattern_color, pattern_start_index
    outputs: list_of_marker_indices
    description: Scan the input grid *after* the identified pattern_block for single pixels matching the pattern_color. Record their indices.
  - name: replicate_pattern
    inputs: input_grid, pattern_block_sequence, pattern_length, list_of_marker_indices
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. For each marker_index, replace the slice of the grid starting at marker_index and of length pattern_length with the pattern_block_sequence.
relationships:
  - type: color_match
    entities: [pattern_block, marker_pixel]
    description: Marker pixels must have the same color as the pattern block.
  - type: spatial_order
    entities: [pattern_block, marker_pixel]
    description: Marker pixels appear later in the row than the pattern block.
