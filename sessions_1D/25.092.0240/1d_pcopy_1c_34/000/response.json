The specific non-white color changes between examples but is consistent within a single input-output pair.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** The input row typically starts with a contiguous horizontal block of the non-white color. Following this block, there are often isolated single pixels of the *same* non-white color, separated by white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying the initial contiguous block of the non-white color. This block acts as a \"pattern\". Then, wherever a single pixel of that same non-white color appears later in the row, that single pixel and the pixels immediately following it are replaced by a copy of the initial pattern.\n5.  **Pattern Replication:** The length of the replacement matches the length of the initial pattern. For instance, if the initial pattern is `8 8 8` (length 3), any subsequent single `8` found will cause the segment starting at that `8` and of length 3 to be replaced by `8 8 8`.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
