task_description: Replace segments starting one position before marker pixels with the initial contiguous pattern of the same color.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  shape_train: [(1, 33), (1, 33), (1, 33)] # Represented as (height, width) even though 1D
  shape_test: Unknown
  background_color: white (0)
  unique_colors_per_example: 2 (background + one foreground color)
objects:
  - type: pattern_block
    description: The first contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Varies per example (e.g., azure-8, orange-7, magenta-6) but is consistent within an example.
      shape: Horizontal line segment.
      length: 3 pixels in all training examples.
      location: Starts at index 1 or 2 in training examples.
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: Single pixels matching the color of the pattern_block, appearing after the pattern_block.
    properties:
      color: Same as pattern_block.
      location: Appears at indices after the pattern_block ends (e.g., index 8, 14 for ex1; index 8 for ex2; index 6, 11 for ex3).
      count: Varies (1 or 2 in training examples).
actions:
  - name: initialize_output
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create a mutable copy of the input grid.
  - name: identify_pattern
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: pattern_sequence, pattern_color, pattern_length, pattern_end_index
    description: Find the first sequence of connected non-white pixels. Record its pixel values (sequence), color, length, and the index immediately after it ends.
  - name: identify_markers
    inputs: input_grid, pattern_color, pattern_end_index
    outputs: list_of_marker_indices
    description: Scan the input grid starting from pattern_end_index for pixels matching the pattern_color. Record their indices.
  - name: replicate_pattern_at_markers
    inputs: output_grid, pattern_sequence, pattern_length, list_of_marker_indices
    outputs: modified_output_grid
    description: For each marker_index, identify the replacement start index as `marker_index - 1`. Replace the slice of the output_grid starting at this `replacement_start_index` and extending for `pattern_length` (or until the grid boundary) with the `pattern_sequence`.
relationships:
  - type: color_match
    entities: [pattern_block, marker_pixel]
    description: Marker pixels must have the same color as the pattern block.
  - type: spatial_order
    entities: [pattern_block, marker_pixel]
    description: Marker pixels appear later in the row than the pattern block.
  - type: trigger
    entities: [marker_pixel, replicate_pattern_at_markers]
    description: The presence of a marker pixel triggers the pattern replication action.
  - type: offset_replacement
    entities: [marker_pixel, replicate_pattern_at_markers]
    description: The pattern replication starts at the index *before* the marker pixel's index.
