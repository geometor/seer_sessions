import numpy as np

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (represented as the first row of a 2D NumPy array) 
based on a pattern replication rule. 
It identifies the first contiguous sequence of a non-background (non-zero) color 
in the first row, designated as the 'pattern'. 
It then scans the row starting immediately after this pattern. 
When a pixel matching the pattern's color ('marker pixel') is found at index `i`, 
it replaces the segment in an output grid (initially a copy of the input) 
starting one position *before* the marker pixel (at index `i-1`) 
and extending for the length of the original pattern (or until the grid boundary) 
with the pattern sequence itself. 
All replacements are performed on the output grid's first row, referencing the 
original input grid's first row for marker locations. The output grid retains 
the original 2D shape.
