Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception:**

The input and output grids are one-dimensional (1x32). The transformation appears to operate on contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of non-white pixels. I observe two types of non-white objects in the inputs: single pixels and horizontal lines of three identical pixels. The core transformation seems to identify single non-white pixels and expand them horizontally into a line of three pixels of the same color, centered on the original pixel's position. Existing horizontal lines of three identical non-white pixels remain unchanged. White pixels are only changed if they become part of the expanded three-pixel line. The color of the pixels involved (blue, azure, gray) is preserved during the transformation.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - length: integer (observed lengths are 1 and 3)
      - position: start_index, end_index
background_color: white (0)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: non-white horizontal segments
    criteria: length == 1
  - action: replace
    source_object: non-white segment of length 1 at index `i` with color `c`
    target_object: non-white segment of length 3, color `c`, centered at index `i` (covering indices `i-1`, `i`, `i+1`)
  - action: preserve
    target: non-white horizontal segments
    criteria: length == 3
  - action: preserve
    target: white pixels (0)
    criteria: not part of a replacement action
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    details: The transformation depends on the position (index) and length of contiguous non-white segments. Adjacency is key for defining segments and performing the replacement.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally to identify contiguous segments of identical non-white pixels. Record their color, starting index, and length.
3.  Iterate through the identified segments.
4.  If a segment has a length of 1 (i.e., it's a single non-white pixel) at index `i` with color `c`:
    *   Check if the indices `i-1` and `i+1` are within the grid boundaries.
    *   Change the pixels in the output grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `c`.
5.  Segments with lengths other than 1 (specifically length 3 in the examples) are left unchanged (they are already copied in step 1).
6.  White pixels (0) remain unchanged unless they are overwritten during the expansion of a single pixel (step 4).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
