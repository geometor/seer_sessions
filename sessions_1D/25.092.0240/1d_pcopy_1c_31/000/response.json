The transformation appears to operate on contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of non-white pixels. I observe two types of non-white objects in the inputs: single pixels and horizontal lines of three identical pixels. The core transformation seems to identify single non-white pixels and expand them horizontally into a line of three pixels of the same color, centered on the original pixel's position. Existing horizontal lines of three identical non-white pixels remain unchanged. White pixels are only changed if they become part of the expanded three-pixel line. The color of the pixels involved (blue, azure, gray) is preserved during the transformation.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
