task_type: object_transformation
dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - length: integer (observed lengths are 1 and 3)
      - position: start_index, end_index
background_color: white (0)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: non-white horizontal segments
    criteria: length == 1
  - action: replace
    source_object: non-white segment of length 1 at index `i` with color `c`
    target_object: non-white segment of length 3, color `c`, centered at index `i` (covering indices `i-1`, `i`, `i+1`)
  - action: preserve
    target: non-white horizontal segments
    criteria: length == 3
  - action: preserve
    target: white pixels (0)
    criteria: not part of a replacement action
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    details: The transformation depends on the position (index) and length of contiguous non-white segments. Adjacency is key for defining segments and performing the replacement.
