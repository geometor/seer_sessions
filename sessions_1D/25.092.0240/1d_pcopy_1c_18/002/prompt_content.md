"""
Identifies an incomplete 'T' shape in the input grid and completes it.
The incomplete 'T' consists of a 3-pixel horizontal bar of a non-white color (C)
and a single pixel of the same color C directly below the center of the bar.
The transformation adds two more pixels of color C directly below the existing single-pixel stem,
forming a 3-pixel vertical stem. The background remains unchanged.
