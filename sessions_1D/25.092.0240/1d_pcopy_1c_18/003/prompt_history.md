*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain incomplete 'T' shapes made of a single non-white color (green or azure) against a white background.
    *   The incomplete 'T' consists of a 3-pixel horizontal bar and a single pixel of the same color directly below the center of the bar.
    *   The output grids show completed 'T' shapes, where the vertical stem is extended downwards to be 3 pixels long.
    *   The transformation involves identifying the incomplete 'T' pattern and adding two pixels of the same color below the existing stem pixel to complete the shape.
    *   The color of the 'T' shape is preserved from input to output.
    *   The background (white pixels) remains unchanged.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
    2.  Check if the pixel at (r, c) and its horizontal neighbors (r, c-1) and (r, c+1) form a 3-pixel horizontal line of the same non-white color (let this color be C).
    3.  If such a horizontal line is found, check if the pixel directly below the center pixel (r+1, c) also has the color C.
    4.  If both conditions are met, this identifies the incomplete 'T' shape.
    5.  Modify the grid by changing the color of the pixels at (r+2, c) and (r+3, c) to color C.
    6.  Return the modified grid as the output. (Note: Assumes only one such pattern per grid based on examples).

## General Assessment

The initial analysis incorrectly assumed the input data represented 2D grids and tried to apply a 2D pattern-matching logic ("T" shape completion). The code execution results clearly showed this assumption was wrong, as the code failed to modify the input arrays correctly, primarily due to misinterpreting the data structure and applying incorrect indexing logic (assuming 2D structure and looping based on height/width that didn't exist).

The key insight gained from the failed execution and re-examination of the raw data is that the inputs and outputs are **1D arrays (or lists)**, not 2D grids. The transformation rule operates on this 1D structure.

The revised strategy is to:
1.  Treat the input/output as 1D arrays.
2.  Identify the core pattern: a sequence of three identical non-white pixels (`C C C`).
3.  Identify all subsequent single occurrences of the same pixel value `C`.
4.  For each subsequent `C` at index `j`, modify its neighboring elements at `j-1` and `j+1` to become `C`.
5.  Handle boundary conditions for indices `j-1` and `j+1`.

## Metrics

  - Name: Trigger Pixel
    Color: Same color C as the CCC Pattern.
    Structure: An individual element with value C located at an index `j` *after* the CCC Pattern (j > i+2).
    Occurrence: Can be multiple instances per example.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identification:
      1. Find the first occurrence of a CCC Pattern (Color C, starting at index `i`).
      2. Find all Trigger Pixels (Color C) at indices `j` where `j > i+2`.
  - Action:
      1. For each identified Trigger Pixel at index `j`:
         - If index `j-1` is valid (>= 0), change the value at `j-1` to C.
         - If index `j+1` is valid (< array_length), change the value at `j+1` to C.
  - Result: The output array reflects these changes. Elements not part of the CCC Pattern, Trigger Pixels, or their modified neighbors remain unchanged. The values at `j-1` and `j+1` are overwritten with C, regardless of their original value (though they were always 0 in the examples).

Examples_Summary:
  - Example 1: C=3, CCC at [2,3,4]. Trigger at j=9. Changes at j-1=8 and j+1=10.
  - Example 2: C=8, CCC at [2,3,4]. Triggers at j=7, j=11, j=15. Changes at (6,8), (10,12), (14,16).
  - Example 3: C=3, CCC at [1,2,3]. Triggers at j=8, j=14. Changes at (7,9), (13,15).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input 1D array.
2.  Create a copy of the input array to store the output.
3.  Initialize variables `ccc_color = None` and `ccc_end_index = -1`.
4.  Iterate through the input array from the first element up to the third-to-last element (index `i` from 0 to length-3).
5.  At each index `i`, check if the element `input[i]` is non-white (not 0) AND `input[i] == input[i+1] == input[i+2]`.
6.  If this `C C C` pattern is found:
    a.  Store the color `C = input[i]` in `ccc_color`.
    b.  Store the end index `ccc_end_index = i + 2`.
    c.  Stop searching for the `C C C` pattern (assuming only the first one matters).
7.  If a `C C C` pattern was found (i.e., `ccc_color` is not `None`):
    a.  Iterate through the input array from index `j = ccc_end_index + 1` to the end of the array.
    b.  At each index `j`, check if `input[j]` is equal to `ccc_color`.
    c.  If it is (a Trigger Pixel is found):
        i.  Check if `j-1` is a valid index (i.e., `j-1 >= 0`). If yes, set `output[j-1] = ccc_color`.
        ii. Check if `j+1` is a valid index (i.e., `j+1 < length`). If yes, set `output[j+1] = ccc_color`.
8.  Return the modified output array.
