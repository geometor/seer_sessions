*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain incomplete 'T' shapes made of a single non-white color (green or azure) against a white background.
    *   The incomplete 'T' consists of a 3-pixel horizontal bar and a single pixel of the same color directly below the center of the bar.
    *   The output grids show completed 'T' shapes, where the vertical stem is extended downwards to be 3 pixels long.
    *   The transformation involves identifying the incomplete 'T' pattern and adding two pixels of the same color below the existing stem pixel to complete the shape.
    *   The color of the 'T' shape is preserved from input to output.
    *   The background (white pixels) remains unchanged.

    Generalization:
      Input_Objects:
        - Name: Incomplete T
          Color: Any non-white color (C)
          Structure: A 3-pixel horizontal segment of color C, and a single pixel of color C located at (row+1, col_center) relative to the horizontal segment at (row, col_center-1), (row, col_center), (row, col_center+1).
        - Name: Background
          Color: white
      Output_Objects:
        - Name: Completed T
          Color: C (same as input T)
          Structure: A 3-pixel horizontal segment of color C, and a 3-pixel vertical segment of color C located at (row+1, col_center), (row+2, col_center), (row+3, col_center).
        - Name: Background
          Color: white
      Action:
        - Find the incomplete 'T' pattern.
        - Identify its color (C) and the location of the single vertical stem pixel (r_stem, c_stem).
        - Change the color of the pixels at (r_stem+1, c_stem) and (r_stem+2, c_stem) to color C.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
    2.  Check if the pixel at (r, c) and its horizontal neighbors (r, c-1) and (r, c+1) form a 3-pixel horizontal line of the same non-white color (let this color be C).
    3.  If such a horizontal line is found, check if the pixel directly below the center pixel (r+1, c) also has the color C.
    4.  If both conditions are met, this identifies the incomplete 'T' shape.
    5.  Modify the grid by changing the color of the pixels at (r+2, c) and (r+3, c) to color C.
    6.  Return the modified grid as the output. (Note: Assumes only one such pattern per grid based on examples).
