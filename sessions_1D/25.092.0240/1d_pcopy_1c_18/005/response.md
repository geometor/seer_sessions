"""
Transforms a 1D array (represented as a single-row grid) based on a specific pattern:
1. Find the first occurrence of a sequence of three identical non-white elements (C C C).
2. Identify the color (C) and the end index of this sequence.
3. Find all subsequent elements in the original input array that have the same color C ("Trigger Pixels").
4. For each Trigger Pixel found at index 'j', change the elements in the output array at indices 'j-1' and 'j+1' to color C, provided these indices are within the array bounds. Pixels are only modified in the output array based on the original input's trigger pixels.
