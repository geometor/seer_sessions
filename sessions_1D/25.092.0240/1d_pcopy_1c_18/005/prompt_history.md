*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain incomplete 'T' shapes made of a single non-white color (green or azure) against a white background.
    *   The incomplete 'T' consists of a 3-pixel horizontal bar and a single pixel of the same color directly below the center of the bar.
    *   The output grids show completed 'T' shapes, where the vertical stem is extended downwards to be 3 pixels long.
    *   The transformation involves identifying the incomplete 'T' pattern and adding two pixels of the same color below the existing stem pixel to complete the shape.
    *   The color of the 'T' shape is preserved from input to output.
    *   The background (white pixels) remains unchanged.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
    2.  Check if the pixel at (r, c) and its horizontal neighbors (r, c-1) and (r, c+1) form a 3-pixel horizontal line of the same non-white color (let this color be C).
    3.  If such a horizontal line is found, check if the pixel directly below the center pixel (r+1, c) also has the color C.
    4.  If both conditions are met, this identifies the incomplete 'T' shape.
    5.  Modify the grid by changing the color of the pixels at (r+2, c) and (r+3, c) to color C.
    6.  Return the modified grid as the output. (Note: Assumes only one such pattern per grid based on examples).

**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt correctly identified the core pattern involving a sequence of three identical non-white colors (`C C C`) and subsequent 'trigger' pixels of the same color `C`. However, it failed during execution with a NumPy ambiguity error. This error is perplexing given the code structure which appears to handle 1D arrays and scalar comparisons correctly. It might stem from how the test harness interacts with the function or an unexpected input format variation not represented in the examples shown (e.g., receiving a multi-row grid despite examples being 1xN).

The strategy is to re-affirm the transformation logic based *strictly* on the input/output pairs, assuming they are representative, and generate a clear natural language program reflecting this logic. We will treat the inputs as 1D arrays (or single rows) as strongly suggested by the examples.

    Role: Preserved unless adjacent to a trigger pixel.
  - Name: CCC Pattern
    Structure: Same as input.
    Role: Preserved, unchanged.
  - Name: Trigger Pixels
    Structure: Same as input.
    Role: Preserved, unchanged.
  - Name: Modified Neighbors
    Structure: Pixels originally adjacent (index j-1, j+1) to Trigger Pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Changed to C (the color of the CCC Pattern and Trigger Pixels).
      - Location: Indices immediately preceding and succeeding Trigger Pixels.
    Role: Represents the result of the transformation.

Action/Transformation:
  1. Identify the first occurrence of a `C C C` pattern (where C != 0) in the input array. Note the color `C` and the end index `ccc_end_index`.
  2. Scan the input array *after* `ccc_end_index`.
  3. Find all "Trigger Pixels" which have the color `C`.
  4. For *each* Trigger Pixel found at index `j`:
     - Change the pixel at index `j-1` to color `C` (if `j-1` is a valid index).
     - Change the pixel at index `j+1` to color `C` (if `j+1` is a valid index).
  5. Copy all other pixels (including the original CCC pattern and the Trigger Pixels themselves) from the input to the output unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array (treated as a single row or 1D array).
2.  Find the first sequence of three identical non-white pixels (`C C C`) in the input array. Let the color be `C` and the index of the third pixel in the sequence be `ccc_end_index`. If no such sequence exists, return the unchanged output array.
3.  Iterate through the input array from index `ccc_end_index + 1` to the end.
4.  For each index `j` in this range, check if the pixel in the *input* array at index `j` has the color `C`.
5.  If `input_array[j]` equals `C` (i.e., it's a "trigger pixel"):
    a.  Check if the index `j-1` is valid (greater than or equal to 0). If valid, set the pixel at index `j-1` in the *output* array to color `C`.
    b.  Check if the index `j+1` is valid (less than the array length). If valid, set the pixel at index `j+1` in the *output* array to color `C`.
6.  After checking all potential trigger pixels, return the final output array.
