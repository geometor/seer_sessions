Context:
  - Task operates on 1D grids (represented as 1xN list of lists).
  - Background color is white (0).
  - Objects are sequences of non-white pixels.

Input_Objects:
  - Name: Source Array
    Type: 1D array (first row of the grid)
    Properties: Contains sequences of pixels.
  - Name: CCC Pattern
    Type: Sequence
    Structure: The first occurrence of three consecutive identical non-white pixels (C C C).
    Properties:
      - Color: C (a non-white color, e.g., green=3, azure=8)
      - Location: Defined by the index range [i, i+2] where the pattern occurs.
  - Name: Trigger Pixels
    Type: Individual Pixels
    Structure: Pixels located *after* the CCC Pattern in the Source Array.
    Properties:
      - Color: Must be the same color C as the CCC Pattern.
      - Location: Index j > i+2.

Output_Objects:
  - Name: Result Array
    Type: 1D array (same dimensions as Source Array)
    Content: Initially a copy of the Source Array, then modified based on Trigger Pixels.

Action:
  - Identify: Find the Color (C) and end index (k = i+2) of the first CCC Pattern in the Source Array.
  - Scan: Iterate through the Source Array at indices j > k.
  - Trigger: If a pixel at index j in the Source Array has color C (is a Trigger Pixel).
  - Modify: Change the color of the pixels at index j-1 and j+1 in the Result Array to C.
  - Constraints: Modifications only happen if indices j-1 and j+1 are within the bounds of the array. Modifications are based on the *original* Trigger Pixels found in the Source Array.
  - Finalize: The Result Array becomes the single row of the output grid.
