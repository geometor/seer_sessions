However, it failed during execution with a NumPy ambiguity error. This error is perplexing given the code structure which appears to handle 1D arrays and scalar comparisons correctly. It might stem from how the test harness interacts with the function or an unexpected input format variation not represented in the examples shown (e.g., receiving a multi-row grid despite examples being 1xN).\n\nThe strategy is to re-affirm the transformation logic based *strictly* on the input/output pairs, assuming they are representative, and generate a clear natural language program reflecting this logic. We will treat the inputs as 1D arrays (or single rows) as strongly suggested by the examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n"
