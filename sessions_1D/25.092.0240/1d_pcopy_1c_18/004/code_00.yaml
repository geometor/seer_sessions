Context:
  Task Type: 1D Array Transformation (based on single-row grid examples)
  Input Array: Contains sequences of colors (integers 0-9), including white (0).
  Output Array: Modified version of the input array, same length.

Input Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Role: Fills space, potentially modified near trigger pixels.
  - Name: CCC Pattern
    Structure: The first sequence of three identical non-white pixels (C C C).
    Properties:
      - Color: C (e.g., green=3, azure=8)
      - Location: Defined by the end index (`ccc_end_index`) of the sequence.
    Role: Defines the primary color C and the starting point for finding triggers.
  - Name: Trigger Pixels
    Structure: Individual pixels with color C located *after* the CCC Pattern.
    Properties:
      - Color: C (same as CCC Pattern)
      - Location: Index `j` > `ccc_end_index`.
    Role: Activates the transformation on adjacent pixels.

Output Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Role: Preserved unless adjacent to a trigger pixel.
  - Name: CCC Pattern
    Structure: Same as input.
    Role: Preserved, unchanged.
  - Name: Trigger Pixels
    Structure: Same as input.
    Role: Preserved, unchanged.
  - Name: Modified Neighbors
    Structure: Pixels originally adjacent (index j-1, j+1) to Trigger Pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Changed to C (the color of the CCC Pattern and Trigger Pixels).
      - Location: Indices immediately preceding and succeeding Trigger Pixels.
    Role: Represents the result of the transformation.

Action/Transformation:
  1. Identify the first occurrence of a `C C C` pattern (where C != 0) in the input array. Note the color `C` and the end index `ccc_end_index`.
  2. Scan the input array *after* `ccc_end_index`.
  3. Find all "Trigger Pixels" which have the color `C`.
  4. For *each* Trigger Pixel found at index `j`:
     - Change the pixel at index `j-1` to color `C` (if `j-1` is a valid index).
     - Change the pixel at index `j+1` to color `C` (if `j+1` is a valid index).
  5. Copy all other pixels (including the original CCC pattern and the Trigger Pixels themselves) from the input to the output unchanged.
