            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids appear to be one-dimensional arrays or single rows. All examples show a 1x32 grid.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (azure '8' or magenta '6').\n3.  **Input Pattern:** Each input starts with a white pixel (0) followed by a three-pixel sequence of a non-white color (e.g., `8 8 8` or `6 6 6`). This sequence appears to act as a template. Further along the row, there are one or more isolated single pixels of the *same* non-white color as the template. These isolated pixels are surrounded by white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve the isolated single non-white pixels. Each of these isolated pixels in the input is replaced in the output by a copy of the initial three-pixel template pattern. The replacement is centered on the original position of the isolated pixel.\n5.  **Preservation:** The initial template pattern at the beginning of the row (indices 1, 2, 3) remains unchanged in the output. The white pixels (0) that are not part of the replacement also remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the \"template pattern\": Look at the pixels at indices 1, 2, and 3 in the input grid. This three-pixel sequence is the template pattern. Note its color (let's call it C).\n3.  Scan the input grid starting from index 4 to find all \"target pixels\". A target pixel is a pixel that meets two conditions:\n    a.  Its color is C (the same color as the template pattern).\n    b.  Its immediate horizontal neighbors (at index - 1 and index + 1) are both white (0).\n4.  For each identified target pixel located at index `i`:\n    a.  Modify the output grid (which started as a copy of the input).\n    b.  Replace the pixel at index `i` in the output grid with color C.\n    c.  Replace the pixel at index `i-1` in the output grid with color C.\n    d.  Replace the pixel at index `i+1` in the output grid with color C.\n    (Essentially, copy the template pattern `C C C` into the output grid, centered at index `i`).\n5.
