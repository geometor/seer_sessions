task_type: pattern_replacement
grid_dimensionality: 1D # or 1xN 2D grid

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills most of the grid

  - element: template_pattern
    description: A sequence of three identical non-white pixels found near the start of the input grid.
    properties:
      - location: fixed, starts at index 1 (columns 1, 2, 3)
      - size: 3 pixels wide
      - color: consistent within the pattern (e.g., all azure '8' or all magenta '6')
      - count: 1 per input grid
    role: defines the pattern to be copied

  - element: target_pixel
    description: Isolated single pixels matching the color of the template_pattern.
    properties:
      - location: variable, occurs after the template_pattern
      - size: 1 pixel
      - color: same as template_pattern
      - context: must be surrounded by background pixels (white '0') horizontally.
      - count: one or more per input grid
    role: marks locations for pattern insertion

actions:
  - action: identify_template
    input: input_grid
    output: template_pattern (value and color)
    condition: located at indices [1, 2, 3]

  - action: identify_targets
    input: input_grid
    output: list of target_pixel locations (indices)
    condition: pixels match template_pattern color and are isolated (index > 3, input[index-1]==0, input[index+1]==0)

  - action: copy_paste_pattern
    source: template_pattern
    destination_grid: output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
    targets: identified target_pixel locations
    process: For each target location `i`, overwrite the output grid at indices `[i-1, i, i+1]` with the `template_pattern`.
    centering: The middle pixel of the copied pattern aligns with the original target_pixel location.

relationships:
  - relationship: color_match
    between: [template_pattern, target_pixel]
    details: The color of the target_pixels must be the same as the color of the pixels in the template_pattern.
  - relationship: positional
    between: [template_pattern, target_pixel]
    details: Target pixels always appear later in the grid than the template pattern.
  - relationship: isolation
    element: target_pixel
    details: Target pixels are horizontally adjacent only to background pixels.

output_construction:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify the template pattern (color C, pattern CCC) at indices 1, 2, 3.
  - step: Find all indices `i` where the input grid has value C, and input[i-1] and input[i+1] are 0.
  - step: For each such index `i`, modify the output grid by setting output[i-1]=C, output[i]=C, output[i+1]=C.
