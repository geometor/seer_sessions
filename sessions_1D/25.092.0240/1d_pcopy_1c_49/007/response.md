```python
"""
Transforms an input grid (expected as a 1xN 2D list) based on a pattern replacement rule.
1. Validates the input: Checks if the grid is a list containing exactly one inner list (representing the row), 
   if the row length is at least 4, and if the pattern [0, C, C, C] (where C is a non-zero color) exists 
   at indices 0-3.
2. If validation fails, returns an unmodified deep copy of the input grid.
3. If validation succeeds, identifies the 'active_color' C from index 1 of the row.
4. Creates a mutable copy of the input row (output_row).
5. Iterates through the input row indices 'i' from 1 up to 'width - 2'.
6. Finds all "target" indices 'i' that satisfy all of the following:
   a) i > 3 (the index is beyond the initial template pattern)
   b) The pixel at input_row[i] matches the active_color C.
   c) The pixel at input_row[i-1] is the background color (0).
   d) The pixel at input_row[i+1] is the background color (0).
7. For each target index 'i' found, modifies the output_row by setting the pixels at indices 
   i-1, i, and i+1 to the active_color C.
8. Returns the final modified output_row, wrapped in a list to conform to the 
   standard ARC grid format: [output_row].
