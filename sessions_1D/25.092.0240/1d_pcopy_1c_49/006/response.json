            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided Python code aims to implement the observed pattern: identify a `0 C C C` template at the start, find isolated `0 C 0` patterns later in the sequence, and replace them with `C C C`. The logic within the code appears to correctly reflect this interpretation based on a manual trace of the examples.\n\nHowever, the execution results show that the `transform` function consistently returned the *original input* instead of the modified output. The \"Pixels Off\" count in the results (2, 4, 6) corresponds exactly to the number of background pixels (0s) that *should* have been changed to the active color `C` (one `0` on each side of the target `C`) in each example. This strongly suggests:\n\n1.  The core logic (identify template `C`, find `0 C 0`, replace with `C C C`) is likely correct.\n2.  The test harness correctly compared the function's output to the *expected* output, calculating the differing pixels.\n3.  The function, as executed by the harness, failed to perform the replacement step (`output_row[i-1] = active_color`, etc.). The most likely reason is that the `if` condition controlling this replacement never evaluated to `True` during the test execution, despite manual tracing indicating it should have.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to trust the initial analysis and the \"Pixels Off\" metric, assuming they point towards the correct transformation. The failure likely lies in a subtle implementation detail or an execution environment issue not apparent from the code snippet alone. We will proceed by refining the documentation (YAML facts and Natural Language Program) based on the confirmed pattern, assuming the core logic is correct but needs careful implementation. We will use `tool_code` to verify grid properties and color counts to ensure our understanding of the examples is sound.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
