    Transforms the input grid based on a pattern replacement rule.
    1. Identifies a 3-pixel template pattern (e.g., C C C) starting at index 1
       in the input row. The color C is noted.
    2. Scans the rest of the input row (from index 4 onwards) for 'target' pixels.
    3. A target pixel is a pixel with color C that is surrounded by the
       background color (white, 0) on both its left and right sides.
    4. For each target pixel found at index 'i', the output grid (initially a
       copy of the input) is modified by replacing the pixels at indices
       i-1, i, and i+1 with the template color C.
    5. The initial template pattern at indices 1, 2, 3 remains unchanged.
