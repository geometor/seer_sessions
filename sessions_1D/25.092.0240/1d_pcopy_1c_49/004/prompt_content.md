```python
import copy

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on a pattern replacement rule.
    1. Accepts the input grid, expected as a list containing a single list 
       representing one row (e.g., [[0, 8, 8, 8, ...]]). Extracts this 
       inner list as the input_row.
    2. Creates a modifiable copy of the input_row called output_row.
    3. Checks if the input_row is long enough (at least 4 elements) and if 
       the pattern 0 C C C (where C is a non-zero color) exists at the 
       beginning (indices 0, 1, 2, 3).
    4. If the initial pattern is found, identifies the template_color C 
       (the color at index 1).
    5. If the initial pattern is not found or the row is too short, returns 
       the original input grid unmodified.
    6. Iterates through the input_row using an index i, starting from index 1 
       and going up to the second-to-last index (length - 2).
    7. For each index i, checks if it represents a "target pixel" based on 
       the following conditions:
        a. The pixel at input_row[i] has the template_color C.
        b. The pixel to its left (input_row[i-1]) is the background color (white, 0).
        c. The pixel to its right (input_row[i+1]) is the background color (white, 0).
        d. The index i is greater than 3 (to ensure it's not part of the original 
           template pattern 0 C C C).
    8. If all target conditions are met for index i:
        a. Modifies the output_row.
        b. Sets the color of the pixel at index i-1 in output_row to C.
        c. Sets the color of the pixel at index i in output_row to C.
        d. Sets the color of the pixel at index i+1 in output_row to C.
    9. After iterating through all possible indices, wraps the final output_row 
       into a list to conform to the standard 2D grid format: output_grid = [output_row].
    10. Returns the output_grid.
