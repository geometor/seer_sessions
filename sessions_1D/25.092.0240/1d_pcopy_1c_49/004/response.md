## General Assessment

The core transformation logic identified previously – finding an initial template pattern `0 C C C` and replacing isolated occurrences of `0 C 0` (where `C` is the template color) with `C C C` – appears correct and is confirmed by the detailed metrics analysis. The reported "list index out of range" error on the first code version (`code_00.py`) is anomalous given the code's apparent boundary checks. This suggests a potential discrepancy between the assumed input format (`[[row]]`) and the format actually used during testing, or a very subtle edge case missed in analysis.

## Strategy

The strategy is to proceed with the confirmed logic but ensure the implementation is robust against potential input variations and explicitly handles boundary conditions based on the standard ARC grid format (`List[List[int]]` containing one row). We will refine the natural language program and subsequent code based on the successful analysis performed using the `analyze_example` tool.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: pattern_replacement
grid_dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN)

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Default fill color, used for isolating target pixels.

  - element: template_marker
    description: A specific 4-pixel sequence at the very beginning of the input row.
    properties:
      - location: fixed, indices [0, 1, 2, 3]
      - structure: [background_color(0), color_C, color_C, color_C] where color_C is non-background (not 0).
      - color: The non-background color (color_C) determines the active color for the task.
      - count: Exactly 1 per valid input grid.
    role: Defines the active color (C) and implies the replacement pattern ([C, C, C]).

  - element: target_signature
    description: A specific 3-pixel sequence occurring after the template_marker.
    properties:
      - location: variable, centered at index `i` where `i` must be > 3.
      - structure: [background_color(0), color_C, background_color(0)]
      - color: Must use the same color_C identified from the template_marker.
      - count: Zero or more per input grid.
    role: Identifies locations where the replacement should occur.

actions:
  - action: validate_input_and_identify_color
    input: input_grid (expected: [[row]])
    output: active_color (color_C) or failure indication.
    preconditions:
      - input_grid is a list containing exactly one list (the row).
      - The row has length >= 4.
      - row[0] is 0.
      - row[1] is not 0.
      - row[1], row[2], row[3] are identical.
    process: If preconditions met, return row[1] as color_C. Otherwise, indicate failure.

  - action: find_targets
    input: input_row, active_color (color_C)
    output: list of target center indices `i`.
    condition: Iterate `i` from index 1 to length-2. Target found if `i > 3` AND `input_row[i] == color_C` AND `input_row[i-1] == 0` AND `input_row[i+1] == 0`.

  - action: apply_replacement
    input: output_row (copy of input_row), target_indices, active_color (color_C)
    output: modified output_row
    process: For each target index `i` found, set `output_row[i-1]`, `output_row[i]`, and `output_row[i+1]` to color_C.

relationships:
  - relationship: color_dependency
    between: [template_marker, target_signature]
    details: The non-background color C identified in the template_marker must match the central color in any valid target_signature.
  - relationship: positional_separation
    between: [template_marker, target_signature]
    details: Target signatures must appear strictly after the template_marker (center index i > 3).

output_construction:
  - step: Validate the input grid structure ([[row]]) and the presence/structure of the template_marker [0, C, C, C] at indices 0-3 (where C != 0).
  - step: If validation fails, return an unmodified deep copy of the input_grid.
  - step: If validation passes, identify the active_color C from the template_marker.
  - step: Create a mutable copy of the input row, called output_row.
  - step: Find all target indices `i` such that `i > 3` and the sequence `[0, C, 0]` exists at indices `[i-1, i, i+1]` in the input row.
  - step: For each identified target index `i`, modify the output_row by setting the values at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to C.
  - step: Package the final output_row into a list: `output_grid = [output_row]`.
  - step: Return the output_grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid. Verify it's a list containing exactly one inner list (the `input_row`).
2.  Check if the `input_row` is valid: it must have at least 4 elements, start with `[0, C, C, C]` where `C` is a color other than 0, and colors at indices 1, 2, and 3 must be identical.
3.  If the `input_row` is not valid according to step 2, return a completely unchanged copy of the original input grid.
4.  If valid, identify the color `C` (the `active_color`) from index 1 of the `input_row`.
5.  Create a new list, `output_row`, as a copy of the `input_row`.
6.  Examine the `input_row` to find all locations that match the "target signature": look for indices `i` such that:
    a.  `i` is greater than 3.
    b.  The pixel at `input_row[i]` has the `active_color` C.
    c.  The pixel at `input_row[i-1]` is white (0).
    d.  The pixel at `input_row[i+1]` is white (0).
7.  For every index `i` that satisfies all conditions in step 6:
    a.  Modify the `output_row`.
    b.  Set the pixel at index `i-1` in `output_row` to the `active_color` C.
    c.  Set the pixel at index `i` in `output_row` to the `active_color` C.
    d.  Set the pixel at index `i+1` in `output_row` to the `active_color` C.
8.  After checking all possible indices and making necessary modifications, create the final `output_grid` by wrapping the `output_row` in a list: `[output_row]`.
9.  Return the `output_grid`.
