**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the core logic: differentiating between single-pixel objects and multi-pixel objects. Multi-pixel objects are preserved, which is correct across all examples. The error lies specifically in the transformation applied to single-pixel objects. The code expands the single pixel `(r, c)` into a 1x3 line starting at `(r, c)` and extending to `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)`. However, the comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` reveals that the single pixel `(r, c)` should become the *center* of the 1x3 line, spanning `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c)`, and `(r, c+1)`.

**Strategy:**

1.  Confirm the exact pixel differences for each example using code execution.
2.  Update the description of the `transform_single_pixel_objects` action in the YAML facts to reflect the corrected expansion rule (centered 1x3 line).
3.  Rewrite the Natural Language Program step 3.b to describe the centered expansion accurately, including boundary checks for the left neighbor `(r, c-1)`.

**Metrics Gathering:**

``` python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(grid1_str, grid2_str):
    grid1 = np.array(eval(grid1_str.replace(' ', ', ')))
    grid2 = np.array(eval(grid2_str.replace(' ', ', ')))

    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return {"match": False, "error": "Shape mismatch"}

    diff_indices = np.where(grid1 != grid2)
    diff_count = len(diff_indices[0])
    
    diff_details = []
    for r, c in zip(*diff_indices):
      diff_details.append({
          "coord": (int(r), int(c)),
          "grid1_val": int(grid1[r, c]),
          "grid2_val": int(grid2[r, c])
      })

    return {
        "match": diff_count == 0,
        "pixels_off": diff_count,
        "diff_details": diff_details
    }
