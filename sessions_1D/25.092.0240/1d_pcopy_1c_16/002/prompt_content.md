"""
Transforms an input grid by identifying objects (connected non-white pixels).
If an object consists of exactly one pixel, it is expanded into a 1x3 horizontal line 
of the same color, starting at the original pixel's position and extending to the right 
(within grid bounds). Objects consisting of more than one pixel are left unchanged.
The background remains white unless overwritten by the expansion.
