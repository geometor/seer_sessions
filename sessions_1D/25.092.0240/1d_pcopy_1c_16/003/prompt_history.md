*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves modifying input grids containing various colored shapes on a white background.
    *   The primary colors observed are maroon (9), red (2), and azure (8), always on a white (0) background.
    *   Shapes appear as contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
    *   The transformation specifically targets isolated, single non-white pixels.
    *   Larger shapes (composed of more than one pixel) remain unchanged in the output.
    *   Isolated single pixels are expanded horizontally to the right, forming a 1x3 line of the original pixel's color. The original pixel becomes the leftmost pixel of this new line.
    *   The background remains white, except where overwritten by the expanded pixels.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Modify grid based on the size of colored objects.
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: shape
        properties:
          - color: non-white (e.g., maroon, red, azure)
          - connectivity: contiguous pixels (including diagonals)
          - size: number of pixels in the shape
    actions:
      - name: identify_objects
        description: Find all connected components of non-white pixels.
      - name: filter_objects
        criteria: Identify objects composed of exactly one pixel.
      - name: transform_single_pixel_objects
        description: Replace the single pixel with a 1x3 horizontal line of the same color, starting at the original pixel's location and extending rightwards.
        constraints: Respect grid boundaries; do not extend beyond the right edge.
      - name: preserve_larger_objects
        description: Copy objects composed of more than one pixel directly from input to output without change.
      - name: preserve_background
        description: Maintain white background pixels unless overwritten by the transformation.
    relationships:
      - The transformation rule depends solely on the size (pixel count) of each distinct colored object.
      - Single-pixel objects trigger expansion.
      - Multi-pixel objects are preserved.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid identical in size and background color (white) to the input grid.
    2.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a group of one or more contiguous pixels (sharing a side or corner) of the same non-white color.
    3.  For each identified object:
        a.  Count the number of pixels that make up the object.
        b.  If the object consists of exactly one pixel:
            i.  Determine the row `r`, column `c`, and color `clr` of this pixel.
            ii. In the output grid, color the pixel at `(r, c)` with `clr`.
            iii. If column `c+1` is within the grid bounds, color the pixel at `(r, c+1)` with `clr`.
            iv. If column `c+2` is within the grid bounds, color the pixel at `(r, c+2)` with `clr`.
        c.  If the object consists of more than one pixel:
            i.  Copy all pixels belonging to this object from their original positions in the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
    4.  Return the final output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the core logic: differentiating between single-pixel objects and multi-pixel objects. Multi-pixel objects are preserved, which is correct across all examples. The error lies specifically in the transformation applied to single-pixel objects. The code expands the single pixel `(r, c)` into a 1x3 line starting at `(r, c)` and extending to `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)`. However, the comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` reveals that the single pixel `(r, c)` should become the *center* of the 1x3 line, spanning `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c)`, and `(r, c+1)`.

**Strategy:**

1.  Confirm the exact pixel differences for each example using code execution.
2.  Update the description of the `transform_single_pixel_objects` action in the YAML facts to reflect the corrected expansion rule (centered 1x3 line).
3.  Rewrite the Natural Language Program step 3.b to describe the centered expansion accurately, including boundary checks for the left neighbor `(r, c-1)`.
