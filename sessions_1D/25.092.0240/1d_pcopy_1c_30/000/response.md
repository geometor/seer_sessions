Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Dimensionality:** The input and output grids are consistently one-dimensional (single rows).
2.  **Color Usage:** Each example uses white (0) as the background and one other primary color (azure-8, orange-7, or blue-1). The primary color is consistent between the input and output of a single example pair.
3.  **Input Structure:** The input row contains the primary color appearing in potentially disconnected segments. There seems to be an initial, longer segment (contiguous block) of the primary color, followed by one or more isolated single pixels of the same color, separated by white pixels.
4.  **Output Structure:** In the output row, the initial longer segment remains unchanged. However, the locations corresponding to the isolated single pixels in the input have been replaced by a replication of the *initial longer segment*. The replication appears centered on the position of the original isolated pixel.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies the first contiguous block of the non-white color. This block serves as a "pattern". It then finds all *isolated* single pixels of that same color. Each isolated pixel acts as an anchor point, and the pattern is copied into the output grid, centered at the anchor point's position, overwriting the original content in that span.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Replicate Pattern at Markers

Input:
  Type: Grid (1D row vector)
  Content:
    - Background_Pixel: White (0)
    - Primary_Color_Pixel: A single non-white color (e.g., Azure-8, Orange-7, Blue-1)
    - Objects:
      - Background: Contiguous areas of white pixels.
      - Primary_Color_Segments: Occurrences of the primary color. These can be:
        - Pattern_Segment: The first contiguous block (>= 1 pixel) of the primary color found scanning left-to-right.
        - Marker_Pixels: Single, isolated pixels of the primary color (neighbors are white).

Output:
  Type: Grid (1D row vector)
  Content:
    - Derived from the input grid.
    - The Pattern_Segment from the input remains in its original position.
    - The areas around the Marker_Pixels are modified.

Transformation:
  Action: Replication and Centered Placement
  Steps:
    1. Identify the Primary_Color.
    2. Find the first contiguous block of the Primary_Color in the input; this is the Pattern_Segment. Record its sequence of colors (the pattern) and its length.
    3. Initialize the Output grid as a copy of the Input grid.
    4. Iterate through the Input grid to find all Marker_Pixels (isolated primary color pixels).
    5. For each Marker_Pixel found at index `i`:
       a. Calculate the placement start index in the Output grid: `start_idx = i - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.
       b. Place the recorded pattern (from step 2) into the Output grid, starting at `start_idx` and extending for `pattern_length`. Overwrite existing pixels in the Output grid. Ensure operations stay within grid boundaries.
  Relationship: The shape of the first color block dictates the shape that replaces isolated single color pixels later in the row. The position of the isolated pixels determines the center point for placing the replacement pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the non-white color (`target_color`) present in the input row.
2.  Scan the input row from left to right and find the first sequence of one or more adjacent `target_color` pixels. Record this sequence as the `pattern` and note its `pattern_length`.
3.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial `output_row`.
4.  Iterate through the `input_row` using an index `i` from 0 to length-1.
5.  At each index `i`, check if the pixel `input_row[i]` is the `target_color`.
6.  If `input_row[i]` is the `target_color`, check if it is an "isolated marker":
    *   The pixel to the left (`input_row[i-1]`, if `i > 0`) must *not* be the `target_color`.
    *   The pixel to the right (`input_row[i+1]`, if `i < length-1`) must *not* be the `target_color`.
    *   Handle boundary cases: if `i` is 0, only check the right neighbor; if `i` is length-1, only check the left neighbor.
7.  If the pixel at index `i` is confirmed to be an isolated marker:
    *   Calculate the starting index for writing the pattern into the `output_row`: `start_index = i - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.
    *   For each element `p` in the `pattern` (from index `j = 0` to `pattern_length - 1`):
        *   Calculate the target index in the `output_row`: `target_index = start_index + j`.
        *   If `target_index` is a valid index within the `output_row` bounds (0 <= `target_index` < length):
            *   Set `output_row[target_index]` equal to the pattern element `pattern[j]`.
8.  After checking all indices in the `input_row`, return the final `output_row`.
