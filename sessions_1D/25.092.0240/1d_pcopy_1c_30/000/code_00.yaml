Task: Replicate Pattern at Markers

Input:
  Type: Grid (1D row vector)
  Content:
    - Background_Pixel: White (0)
    - Primary_Color_Pixel: A single non-white color (e.g., Azure-8, Orange-7, Blue-1)
    - Objects:
      - Background: Contiguous areas of white pixels.
      - Primary_Color_Segments: Occurrences of the primary color. These can be:
        - Pattern_Segment: The first contiguous block (>= 1 pixel) of the primary color found scanning left-to-right.
        - Marker_Pixels: Single, isolated pixels of the primary color (neighbors are white).

Output:
  Type: Grid (1D row vector)
  Content:
    - Derived from the input grid.
    - The Pattern_Segment from the input remains in its original position.
    - The areas around the Marker_Pixels are modified.

Transformation:
  Action: Replication and Centered Placement
  Steps:
    1. Identify the Primary_Color.
    2. Find the first contiguous block of the Primary_Color in the input; this is the Pattern_Segment. Record its sequence of colors (the pattern) and its length.
    3. Initialize the Output grid as a copy of the Input grid.
    4. Iterate through the Input grid to find all Marker_Pixels (isolated primary color pixels).
    5. For each Marker_Pixel found at index `i`:
       a. Calculate the placement start index in the Output grid: `start_idx = i - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.
       b. Place the recorded pattern (from step 2) into the Output grid, starting at `start_idx` and extending for `pattern_length`. Overwrite existing pixels in the Output grid. Ensure operations stay within grid boundaries.
  Relationship: The shape of the first color block dictates the shape that replaces isolated single color pixels later in the row. The position of the isolated pixels determines the center point for placing the replacement pattern.
