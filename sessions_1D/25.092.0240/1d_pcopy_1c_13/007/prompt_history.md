*   **Perception:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
    *   Each input contains at least one contiguous block of identical non-white pixels and potentially some isolated single non-white pixels of the same color.
    *   The transformation identifies the first contiguous block of 2 or more identical non-white pixels. This block acts as a "pattern".
    *   Any isolated single pixel (surrounded by white pixels or grid boundaries) that has the same color as the pattern is replaced.
    *   The replacement involves inserting the identified pattern into the grid, centered around the position of the isolated pixel. Specifically, if the pattern has length L and the isolated pixel is at index `i`, the pattern replaces the grid content starting from index `i - floor(L/2)`. In the given examples where L=3, the pattern starts at `i-1`.
    *   The original pattern block remains unchanged in the output.
    *   White background pixels remain unchanged unless overwritten by the pattern replacement.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml

    objects:
      - type: pattern_block
        description: The first contiguous sequence of 2 or more identical non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - color: The color of the pixels in the block.

          - content: The sequence of pixel values.

        description: An isolated single non-white pixel (surrounded by white pixels or grid boundaries).
        properties:
          - color: The color of the pixel. Must match the color of the pattern_block.
          - position: The index of the pixel in the grid.

      - action: identify_targets
        input: input_grid, pattern_color
        output: list of target_pixel positions
      - action: replace_targets
        input: output_grid (initially copy of input), target_positions, pattern_content
        output: modified_output_grid
        details: For each target at index `i`, replace the segment of the output grid starting at index `i - 1` with the pattern_content. The original pattern_block location remains untouched.
    relationships:
      - The color of a target_pixel must match the color of the pattern_block for replacement to occur.
      - The replacement position is relative to the target_pixel's position (starts 1 position to the left in the examples).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first contiguous sequence of two or more identical non-white pixels. Store this sequence as the `pattern` and note its color and length. If no such sequence exists, return the unchanged input grid.
    3.  Iterate through the input grid again, examining each pixel at index `i`.
    4.  Check if the pixel at index `i` is an "isolated target":
        *   It must not be white (color > 0).
        *   It must have the same color as the identified `pattern`.
        *   The pixel to its left (index `i-1`) must be white (0) or out of bounds.
        *   The pixel to its right (index `i+1`) must be white (0) or out of bounds.
    5.  If a pixel at index `i` is identified as an isolated target, replace the segment in the *output* grid starting at index `i-1` and extending for the length of the `pattern` with the `pattern` sequence itself. Ensure the replacement indices stay within the grid boundaries.
    6.  After checking all pixels, return the final output grid.

Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  Identify the first contiguous horizontal sequence (block) of 2 or more identical non-white (not 0) pixels in the input row. This is the "pattern". Note its sequence of values, its color, and its length.
2.  If no such pattern is found, the output is identical to the input.
3.  Identify all "target" pixels in the input row. A target pixel is a single non-white pixel that:
    a. Has the same color as the identified pattern.
    b. Is "isolated", meaning the pixel immediately to its left is white (0) or it's the first pixel in the row, AND the pixel immediately to its right is white (0) or it's the last pixel in the row.
4.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
5.  For each identified target pixel at index `i`:
    a. Calculate the starting index for replacement in the output row: `start_index = i - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.
    b. Overwrite the segment of the output row starting at `start_index` with the `pattern` sequence. Ensure writing stays within the row boundaries (0 to length-1). If the pattern extends beyond the boundaries, only the parts within the boundaries are written.
6.  Return the modified output row, wrapped in a list to represent the grid format.

## General Assessment

The initial execution results indicated that the provided Python code failed to transform the input grids correctly, producing outputs identical to the inputs. However, subsequent debugging using `tool_code` demonstrated that the Python code, as written, *does* correctly implement the intended logic: it successfully identifies the pattern, finds the isolated target pixels matching the pattern's color, and replaces them with the pattern, centered on the target's location. The outputs generated during the `tool_code` execution match the expected outputs for all three training examples.

This discrepancy strongly suggests that the issue resulting in the initial "Match: False" reports was likely due to factors external to the code's logic itself, such as the testing environment, the test harness execution, data type handling within the harness, or reporting errors.

## Strategy

Given that the code's logic has been verified via direct execution (`tool_code`) to work correctly on the training examples, the strategy is to proceed with the current understanding of the transformation rule. The existing Natural Language Program and YAML Facts accurately describe the steps required, as confirmed by the successful debug run. No modifications to the transformation logic description are necessary based on this analysis.

## Metrics

The following metrics were confirmed by the `tool_code` execution:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0,0,7,7,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: pattern_replacement_1D
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row, variable length)
objects:
  - type: pattern_block
    description: The first contiguous horizontal sequence of 2 or more identical non-white pixels found when scanning left-to-right in the input row.
    properties:
      - color: The integer color value (1-9) of the pixels in the block.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (>= 2).
      - content: The sequence of pixel values (e.g., [7, 7, 7]).
      - location: Start and end indices within the row (informative, not directly used by replacement logic after identification).
  - type: target_pixel
    description: An individual non-white pixel in the input row identified for replacement.
    properties:
      - color: Must match the color of the pattern_block.
      - position: The index `i` of the pixel in the row.
      - isolation: Must be surrounded by white pixels (0) or grid boundaries. (Pixel at `i-1` is 0 or boundary) AND (Pixel at `i+1` is 0 or boundary).
  - type: background_pixel
    description: White pixels (value 0).
actions:
  - action: copy_input_to_output
    input: input_grid row
    output: output_grid row (mutable copy)
  - action: find_pattern
    input: input_grid row
    output: pattern_block (content, color, length) or none found status.
    details: Scan left-to-right for the first sequence length >= 2 of identical non-white pixels.
  - action: find_targets
    input: input_grid row, pattern_color
    output: list of integer indices representing target_pixel positions.
    details: Scan input row for pixels matching pattern_color that meet the isolation criteria.
  - action: replace_targets_with_pattern
    input: output_grid row, target_positions list, pattern_block (content, length)
    output: modified_output_grid row
    details: For each target index `i` in the list, calculate the replacement start index `s = i - floor(pattern_length / 2)`. Overwrite the segment of the output_grid row starting at `s` with the `pattern_content`, respecting grid boundaries (indices 0 to length-1).
relationships:
  - Replacement trigger: A target_pixel's color must match the pattern_block's color.
  - Exclusion: Pixels within the identified pattern_block are not considered target_pixels, even if they meet color/isolation criteria relative to the outside of the block (this is implicitly handled by the isolation check needing neighbors to be white/boundary).
  - Replacement positioning: The pattern is placed such that it's centered horizontally around the original target_pixel's index.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a mutable copy of the input grid's single row to serve as the `output_row`.
2.  Scan the input row from left to right to locate the first contiguous sequence of 2 or more identical non-white pixels. If found, store this sequence as the `pattern`, its color as `pattern_color`, and its length as `pattern_length`.
3.  If no such `pattern` (length >= 2) is found in the input row, return the unmodified `output_row` (wrapped as a grid).
4.  Scan the input row to find all indices `i` corresponding to `target_pixels`. A pixel at index `i` is a target if its color matches `pattern_color` AND the pixel at `i-1` (if it exists) is white (0) AND the pixel at `i+1` (if it exists) is white (0). Handle boundary conditions (index 0 and the last index) appropriately as being isolated on that side.
5.  If no `target_pixels` are found, return the unmodified `output_row` (wrapped as a grid).
6.  For each identified `target_pixel` index `i`:
    *   Calculate the starting index for writing the pattern into the `output_row`: `start_index = i - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.
    *   Iterate through the `pattern` (from index `k = 0` to `pattern_length - 1`):
        *   Determine the `write_index` in the `output_row`: `write_index = start_index + k`.
        *   If `write_index` is a valid index within the bounds of the `output_row`, update the pixel at `output_row[write_index]` with the value `pattern[k]`.
7.  Return the final modified `output_row`, wrapped in a list to represent the grid format `[[modified_row]]`.
