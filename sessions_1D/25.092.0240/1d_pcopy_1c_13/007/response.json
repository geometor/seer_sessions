Create a mutable copy of the input grid's single row to serve as the `output_row`.\n2.  Scan the input row from left to right to locate the first contiguous sequence of 2 or more identical non-white pixels (value > 0). If found, store this sequence as the `pattern`, its color as `pattern_color`, and its length as `pattern_length`.\n3.  If no such `pattern` (length >= 2) is found in the input row, return the unmodified `output_row` (wrapped as a grid).\n4.  Scan the input row to find all indices `i` corresponding to `target_pixels`. A pixel at index `i` is a target if its color matches `pattern_color` AND the pixel at `i-1` (if it exists) is white (0) AND the pixel at `i+1` (if it exists) is white (0). Handle boundary conditions (index 0 and the last index) appropriately as being isolated on that side.\n5.  If no `target_pixels` are found, return the unmodified `output_row` (wrapped as a grid).\n6.  For each identified `target_pixel` index `i`:\n    *   Calculate the starting index for writing the pattern into the `output_row`: `start_index = i - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.\n    *   Iterate through the `pattern` (from index `k = 0` to `pattern_length - 1`):\n        *   Determine the `write_index` in the `output_row`: `write_index = start_index + k`.\n        *   If `write_index` is a valid index within the bounds of the `output_row`, update the pixel at `output_row[write_index]` with the value `pattern[k]`.\n7.  Return the final modified `output_row`, wrapped in a list to represent the grid format `[[modified_row]]`.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_first_pattern(grid_row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous sequence of 2 or more identical non-white pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_row: A list of integers representing the input row.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (pattern, pattern_color, pattern_length) where:\n        -
