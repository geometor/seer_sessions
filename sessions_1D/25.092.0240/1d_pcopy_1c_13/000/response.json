This block acts as a \"pattern\".\n    *   Any isolated single pixel (surrounded by white pixels or grid boundaries) that has the same color as the pattern is replaced.\n    *   The replacement involves inserting the identified pattern into the grid, centered around the position of the isolated pixel. Specifically, if the pattern has length L and the isolated pixel is at index `i`, the pattern replaces the grid content starting from index `i - floor(L/2)`. In the given examples where L=3, the pattern starts at `i-1`.\n    *   The original pattern block remains unchanged in the output.\n    *   White background pixels remain unchanged unless overwritten by the pattern replacement.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
