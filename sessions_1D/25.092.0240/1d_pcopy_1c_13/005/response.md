Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  Identify the first contiguous horizontal sequence (block) of 2 or more identical non-white (not 0) pixels in the input row. This is the "pattern". Note its sequence of values, its color, and its length.
2.  If no such pattern is found, the output is identical to the input.
3.  Identify all "target" pixels in the input row. A target pixel is a single non-white pixel that:
    a. Has the same color as the identified pattern.
    b. Is "isolated", meaning the pixel immediately to its left is white (0) or it's the first pixel in the row, AND the pixel immediately to its right is white (0) or it's the last pixel in the row.
4.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
5.  For each identified target pixel at index `i`:
    a. Calculate the starting index for replacement in the output row: `start_index = i - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.
    b. Overwrite the segment of the output row starting at `start_index` with the `pattern` sequence. Ensure writing stays within the row boundaries (0 to length-1). If the pattern extends beyond the boundaries, only the parts within the boundaries are written.
6.  Return the modified output row, wrapped in a list to represent the grid format.
