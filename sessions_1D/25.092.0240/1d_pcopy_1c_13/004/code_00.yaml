task_type: pattern_replacement_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_output_relation: Input row is transformed into an output row of the same dimensions.
objects:
  - type: pattern_block
    description: The first contiguous horizontal sequence of 2 or more identical non-white pixels found when scanning from left to right.
    properties:
      - content: The list of pixel color values forming the pattern.
      - color: The single color value of the pixels in the pattern.
      - length: The number of pixels in the pattern sequence (>= 2).
      - location: The starting and ending indices in the input row.
  - type: target_pixel
    description: A single non-white pixel intended for replacement.
    properties:
      - color: Must match the color of the pattern_block.
      - location: Its index `i` in the input row.
      - context: Must be "isolated" - the pixel to the left (index `i-1`) is white (0) or boundary, AND the pixel to the right (index `i+1`) is white (0) or boundary.
  - type: background_pixel
    description: White pixels (value 0).
actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    input: input_grid_row
    output: output_grid_row (initially an identical copy)
  - action: identify_pattern
    input: input_grid_row
    output: pattern_block (content, color, length) or None if not found.
  - action: identify_targets
    input: input_grid_row, pattern_color
    output: list of indices of target_pixels. Returns empty list if no pattern or no targets found.
  - action: replace_targets
    input: output_grid_row, list_of_target_indices, pattern_content, pattern_length
    output: modified_output_grid_row
    details: For each target index `i` in the list:
             1. Calculate replacement start index: `start = i - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.
             2. Iterate `k` from 0 to `pattern_length - 1`.
             3. Calculate write index: `write_idx = start + k`.
             4. If `write_idx` is within the bounds of the output row (0 <= write_idx < row_length), set `output_grid_row[write_idx] = pattern_content[k]`.
final_output_format: The modified output_grid_row wrapped in a list (e.g., `[[...output row values...]]`).
