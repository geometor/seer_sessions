"""
Transforms the input grid by horizontally expanding isolated non-white pixels.

An isolated non-white pixel is defined as a pixel with a color other than 0 (white) 
whose immediate left and right neighbors within the same row are either outside 
the grid boundaries or are white (color 0).

For each identified isolated pixel in the input grid:
1. The pixel itself in the output grid retains its original color.
2. The pixel to its immediate left (if within bounds) in the output grid is changed to the isolated pixel's color.
3. The pixel to its immediate right (if within bounds) in the output grid is changed to the isolated pixel's color.

The process identifies all isolated pixels based on the original input grid state 
before applying any changes to the output grid. The output grid starts as a copy 
of the input grid and is then modified based on these identified pixels.
