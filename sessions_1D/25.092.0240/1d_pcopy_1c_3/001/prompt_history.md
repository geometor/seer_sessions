Okay, I will analyze the provided examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Each example consists of an input grid and an output grid. The grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9, where 0 is white and others are colors.
2.  **Colors:** The examples use white (0) as the background and one primary non-white color per example (orange 7, green 3, gray 5).
3.  **Key Change:** The transformation involves expanding certain non-white pixels horizontally.
4.  **Pattern:** Non-white pixels that appear "isolated" horizontally (surrounded by white pixels or grid edges within the same row) in the input are expanded into a 1x3 horizontal block of the same color in the output.
5.  **Context:** The expansion seems to depend only on the immediate horizontal neighbors within the same row.
6.  **Objects:** We can identify individual non-white pixels and horizontal blocks of non-white pixels.
7.  **Stability:** Existing 1x3 blocks of a single color in the input appear unchanged in the output. White background pixels also remain white unless overwritten by an expansion.
8.  **Simultaneity:** The expansion appears to be determined based on the state of the *input* grid for all potential expansion points simultaneously. The output grid reflects all these expansions. For instance, if two isolated pixels are separated by one white pixel, both will attempt to expand, potentially overwriting the central white pixel (the specific outcome of overlaps isn't shown in these examples, but the rule implies the pixel closest to the expansion center 'wins' or they both write the same color).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Horizontally expand isolated non-white pixels into 1x3 blocks.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
    properties:
      - height: number of rows
      - width: number of columns
  - element: pixel
    description: A cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - color: Integer value (0=white, 1-9=non-white).
  - element: isolated_pixel
    definition: A non-white pixel P at (r, c) in the input grid.
    condition: >
      Pixel P is isolated if its left neighbor (r, c-1) is white (0) or doesn't exist (c=0),
      AND its right neighbor (r, c+1) is white (0) or doesn't exist (c=width-1).
  - element: expansion_target
    definition: A 1x3 horizontal area centered on an isolated pixel.
    components:
      - center: The position (r, c) of the isolated pixel.
      - left: The position (r, c-1), if c > 0.
      - right: The position (r, c+1), if c < width-1.

actions:
  - action: find_isolated_pixels
    description: Iterate through the input grid to identify all pixels that meet the 'isolated_pixel' condition.
    input: input_grid
    output: List of isolated pixel positions and their colors.
  - action: apply_expansion
    description: For each identified isolated pixel, update the corresponding 1x3 expansion target area in the output grid with the isolated pixel's color.
    input: isolated_pixel_info (position, color), output_grid
    output: Modified output_grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: horizontal_neighborhood
    description: Defines the relationship between a pixel and its immediate left and right neighbors in the same row.
  - relationship: isolation_check
    description: Uses the horizontal_neighborhood to determine if a non-white pixel is isolated based on neighbor colors or grid boundaries.

transformation_logic:
  - step: Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all 'isolated pixels' by examining each non-white pixel in the *input* grid and checking its horizontal neighbors (or boundary conditions) according to the isolation definition.
  - step: For each isolated pixel found at position (r, c) with color C in the input grid:
      - Set the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to color C.
      - If column c > 0, set the pixel at (r, c-1) in the *output* grid to color C.
      - If column c < width-1, set the pixel at (r, c+1) in the *output* grid to color C.
  - step: Return the final state of the output grid after processing all isolated pixels from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with an output grid that is an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all non-white pixels.
3.  For each non-white pixel found at position (row, column) with color `C` in the input grid:
    a.  Determine if the position to its immediate left (row, column-1) is either outside the grid boundary or contains a white pixel (color 0) in the input grid.
    b.  Determine if the position to its immediate right (row, column+1) is either outside the grid boundary or contains a white pixel (color 0) in the input grid.
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, then this pixel at (row, column) is considered "horizontally isolated".
4.  For every pixel identified as "horizontally isolated" in step 3:
    a.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at the isolated position (row, column) to `C`.
    b.  In the output grid, if the position (row, column-1) exists (i.e., column > 0), change its color to `C`.
    c.  In the output grid, if the position (row, column+1) exists (i.e., column < grid_width - 1), change its color to `C`.
5.  The final output grid, after applying all these changes based on the isolated pixels found in the original input grid, is the result of the transformation.
