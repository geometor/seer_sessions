            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Each example consists of an input grid and an output grid. The grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9, where 0 is white and others are colors.\n2.  **Colors:** The examples use white (0) as the background and one primary non-white color per example (orange 7, green 3, gray 5).\n3.  **Key Change:** The transformation involves expanding certain non-white pixels horizontally.\n4.  **Pattern:** Non-white pixels that appear \"isolated\" horizontally (surrounded by white pixels or grid edges within the same row) in the input are expanded into a 1x3 horizontal block of the same color in the output.\n5.  **Context:** The expansion seems to depend only on the immediate horizontal neighbors within the same row.\n6.  **Objects:** We can identify individual non-white pixels and horizontal blocks of non-white pixels.\n7.  **Stability:** Existing 1x3 blocks of a single color in the input appear unchanged in the output. White background pixels also remain white unless overwritten by an expansion.\n8.  **Simultaneity:** The expansion appears to be determined based on the state of the *input* grid for all potential expansion points simultaneously. The output grid reflects all these expansions. For instance, if two isolated pixels are separated by one white pixel, both will attempt to expand, potentially overwriting the central white pixel (the specific outcome of overlaps isn't shown in these examples, but the rule implies the pixel closest to the expansion center 'wins' or they both write the same color).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
