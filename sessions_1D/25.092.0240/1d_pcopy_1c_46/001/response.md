"""
Identifies isolated non-white pixels in a 1xN input grid. An isolated pixel is 
defined as a non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are white (0) 
or are grid boundaries. Each identified isolated pixel of color C is expanded 
into a horizontal block of three pixels of color C in the output grid, centered 
at the original pixel's position. Pixels already part of a horizontal sequence 
of two or more non-white pixels of the same color remain unchanged. The output 
grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
