            "text": "*   **Perception**: The task operates on input grids that are always a single row (1xN). The transformation involves modifying these rows based on the arrangement of non-white pixels. Specifically, it identifies non-white pixels that are \"isolated\" horizontally, meaning their immediate left and right neighbors are white (color 0) or are grid boundaries. When an isolated pixel of a certain color is found, it is expanded into a horizontal block of three pixels of that same color, centered at the original pixel's position. Pixels that are already part of a horizontal sequence of two or more pixels of the same color are not changed. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts YAML**:\n    "
