Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples use single-row input and output grids, which likely represent flattened 2D grids. We need to infer the original dimensions or assume a standard format if not provided explicitly. However, looking at the pattern of zeros and non-zeros, it seems more likely these are already 1D representations of some process, or perhaps small grids where only one row is relevant or modified significantly. Let's re-examine assuming they *are* 1D slices or simplified representations.
    *   **Re-evaluation:** The examples show patterns like `7 7 7`, `7 0 0`, `7 0 0` changing to `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`. This strongly suggests a 2D structure where the input is sparse and the output fills in a shape based on the input structure. The single line format is likely just a compact representation. I need to parse these into 2D grids first. Assuming they are space-separated values for a single row is incorrect. Let's assume these are flattened representations of grids. How to determine the width/height?
    *   **Hypothesis:** The number of elements is 33 in all examples. 33 is not easily factorizable into common small grid dimensions (like 3x11, 11x3). This is unusual for ARC. Let me re-read the prompt carefully. Ah, the prompt doesn't explicitly state the *input format* representation, just that ARC uses 2D grids. The examples provided might be *part* of a larger grid or represented row-by-row. Let's assume the examples are just single rows for now and see if a pattern emerges.

2.  **Color Presence:** Each example features white pixels (0) and one other dominant color (7: orange, 9: maroon, 2: red).
3.  **Input Pattern:** In each input, there's a contiguous block of the dominant color (e.g., `7 7 7`, `9 9 9`, `2 2 2`). Following this block, there are instances of the dominant color appearing individually, separated by white pixels.
4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output, the sections that had isolated dominant colors in the input are filled in to match the initial contiguous block. For example, where the input had `7 0 0`, the output has `7 7 7`, replicating the pattern `7 7 7` found earlier in the input.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to be:
    *   Find the first contiguous block of the non-white color. This block acts as a "pattern" or "template".
    *   Find subsequent occurrences of the *start* of this pattern (i.e., the first pixel of the block).
    *   Wherever the start of the pattern is found later in the row, replace the following pixels (the number of pixels matching the length of the original pattern block) with the pattern itself.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (represented as a single row or sequence).
2.  Identify the primary non-white color (let's call it `C`).
3.  Scan the input row from the beginning to find the first sequence of one or more contiguous pixels of color `C`. Let this sequence be the `template_pattern` and its length be `L`.
4.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
5.  Continue scanning the input row *after* the initial `template_pattern`.
6.  For each subsequent pixel encountered:
    *   If the pixel's color is `C`:
        *   Check if there are at least `L` pixels remaining in the row starting from the current position.
        *   If yes, replace the next `L` pixels in the *output row* (starting from the current position) with the `template_pattern`.
        *   Advance the scanning position by `L` steps to avoid processing pixels within the newly replaced segment immediately.
    *   If the pixel's color is not `C`, continue scanning to the next pixel.
7.  Return the modified output row.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The initial code failed because the transformation logic was incorrectly implemented. Although the template pattern identification seemed correct, the application phase did not modify the grid as expected, resulting in the output being identical to the input. The core issue identified through re-analysis is that the code was checking for the trigger pixel in the `output_grid` (which it was intended to modify) rather than the `input_grid`. Furthermore, the precise mechanism of replacement needed refinement: the trigger pixel itself should be the start of the segment replaced by the template pattern, not skipped over.

The strategy is to correct the transformation logic:
1.  Identify the template pattern, its color (`C`), length (`L`), and end index (`E`) from the **input grid**.
2.  Initialize the **output grid** as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Iterate through the **input grid** starting from index `E + 1`.
4.  If a pixel at index `i` in the **input grid** matches the template color `C`:
    a. Check if the template pattern fits (i.e., `i + L` is within the grid bounds).
    b. If it fits, replace the segment in the **output grid** starting at index `i` and of length `L` with the template pattern.
    c. Advance the scanning index `i` by `L` to avoid re-processing the newly inserted pattern immediately.
5.  If the pixel does not match `C`, advance the scanning index `i` by 1.
6.  Return the modified **output grid**.

This revised approach uses the input grid for scanning and triggering, applies the replacement correctly to the output grid, and advances the index appropriately.

      Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
      Scan the input_grid starting from the index after template_end_index.
      If a pixel at index `i` in the input_grid matches template_color (a trigger_pixel):
      Check if the template pattern fits (i.e., `i + template_length` <= grid length).
      If it fits, replace the segment in output_grid from index `i` to `i + template_length - 1` with the template_pattern.
      Advance the scanning index `i` by template_length steps.
      If the pixel does not match or the pattern doesn't fit, advance the scanning index `i` by 1 step.
      Return the final output_grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (represented as a 1D sequence/array of pixels).
2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Scan the input grid to find the first contiguous sequence of non-white pixels. This is the `template_pattern`. Record its color (`template_color`), its length (`template_length`), and the index where it ends (`template_end_index`).
4.  If no non-white pixels are found (no template), return the initial output grid (which is a copy of the input).
5.  Initialize a scanning index `current_index` to `template_end_index + 1`.
6.  While `current_index` is less than the length of the grid:
    a. Check the pixel at `current_index` in the **input grid**.
    b. If this pixel's color matches the `template_color`:
        i.  Check if there is enough space remaining in the grid to place the `template_pattern` starting at `current_index` (i.e., if `current_index + template_length` is less than or equal to the grid length).
        ii. If there is enough space, replace the segment of the **output grid** starting at `current_index` and of length `template_length` with the `template_pattern`.
        iii. Advance `current_index` by `template_length`.
        iv. Continue to the next iteration of the while loop (step 6).
    c. If the pixel color does not match `template_color` or if the pattern did not fit in step 6.b.i:
        i.  Increment `current_index` by 1.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
