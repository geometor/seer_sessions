Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples use single-row input and output grids, which likely represent flattened 2D grids. We need to infer the original dimensions or assume a standard format if not provided explicitly. However, looking at the pattern of zeros and non-zeros, it seems more likely these are already 1D representations of some process, or perhaps small grids where only one row is relevant or modified significantly. Let's re-examine assuming they *are* 1D slices or simplified representations.
    *   **Re-evaluation:** The examples show patterns like `7 7 7`, `7 0 0`, `7 0 0` changing to `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`. This strongly suggests a 2D structure where the input is sparse and the output fills in a shape based on the input structure. The single line format is likely just a compact representation. I need to parse these into 2D grids first. Assuming they are space-separated values for a single row is incorrect. Let's assume these are flattened representations of grids. How to determine the width/height?
    *   **Hypothesis:** The number of elements is 33 in all examples. 33 is not easily factorizable into common small grid dimensions (like 3x11, 11x3). This is unusual for ARC. Let me re-read the prompt carefully. Ah, the prompt doesn't explicitly state the *input format* representation, just that ARC uses 2D grids. The examples provided might be *part* of a larger grid or represented row-by-row. Let's assume the examples are just single rows for now and see if a pattern emerges.

2.  **Color Presence:** Each example features white pixels (0) and one other dominant color (7: orange, 9: maroon, 2: red).
3.  **Input Pattern:** In each input, there's a contiguous block of the dominant color (e.g., `7 7 7`, `9 9 9`, `2 2 2`). Following this block, there are instances of the dominant color appearing individually, separated by white pixels.
4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output, the sections that had isolated dominant colors in the input are filled in to match the initial contiguous block. For example, where the input had `7 0 0`, the output has `7 7 7`, replicating the pattern `7 7 7` found earlier in the input.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to be:
    *   Find the first contiguous block of the non-white color. This block acts as a "pattern" or "template".
    *   Find subsequent occurrences of the *start* of this pattern (i.e., the first pixel of the block).
    *   Wherever the start of the pattern is found later in the row, replace the following pixels (the number of pixels matching the length of the original pattern block) with the pattern itself.

      If a pixel matches the template_color, replace the segment of the row starting
      at that pixel and having length equal to template_length with the template_pattern.
      Ensure the replacement does not go beyond the bounds of the row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (represented as a single row or sequence).
2.  Identify the primary non-white color (let's call it `C`).
3.  Scan the input row from the beginning to find the first sequence of one or more contiguous pixels of color `C`. Let this sequence be the `template_pattern` and its length be `L`.
4.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
5.  Continue scanning the input row *after* the initial `template_pattern`.
6.  For each subsequent pixel encountered:
    *   If the pixel's color is `C`:
        *   Check if there are at least `L` pixels remaining in the row starting from the current position.
        *   If yes, replace the next `L` pixels in the *output row* (starting from the current position) with the `template_pattern`.
        *   Advance the scanning position by `L` steps to avoid processing pixels within the newly replaced segment immediately.
    *   If the pixel's color is not `C`, continue scanning to the next pixel.
7.  Return the modified output row.
