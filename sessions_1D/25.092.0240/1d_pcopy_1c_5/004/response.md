**General Assessment & Strategy**

The initial code failed because the transformation logic was incorrectly implemented. Although the template pattern identification seemed correct, the application phase did not modify the grid as expected, resulting in the output being identical to the input. The core issue identified through re-analysis is that the code was checking for the trigger pixel in the `output_grid` (which it was intended to modify) rather than the `input_grid`. Furthermore, the precise mechanism of replacement needed refinement: the trigger pixel itself should be the start of the segment replaced by the template pattern, not skipped over.

The strategy is to correct the transformation logic:
1.  Identify the template pattern, its color (`C`), length (`L`), and end index (`E`) from the **input grid**.
2.  Initialize the **output grid** as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Iterate through the **input grid** starting from index `E + 1`.
4.  If a pixel at index `i` in the **input grid** matches the template color `C`:
    a. Check if the template pattern fits (i.e., `i + L` is within the grid bounds).
    b. If it fits, replace the segment in the **output grid** starting at index `i` and of length `L` with the template pattern.
    c. Advance the scanning index `i` by `L` to avoid re-processing the newly inserted pattern immediately.
5.  If the pixel does not match `C`, advance the scanning index `i` by 1.
6.  Return the modified **output grid**.

This revised approach uses the input grid for scanning and triggering, applies the replacement correctly to the output grid, and advances the index appropriately.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (represented as a 1D sequence/array of pixels).
2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Scan the input grid to find the first contiguous sequence of non-white pixels. This is the `template_pattern`. Record its color (`template_color`), its length (`template_length`), and the index where it ends (`template_end_index`).
4.  If no non-white pixels are found (no template), return the initial output grid (which is a copy of the input).
5.  Initialize a scanning index `current_index` to `template_end_index + 1`.
6.  While `current_index` is less than the length of the grid:
    a. Check the pixel at `current_index` in the **input grid**.
    b. If this pixel's color matches the `template_color`:
        i.  Check if there is enough space remaining in the grid to place the `template_pattern` starting at `current_index` (i.e., if `current_index + template_length` is less than or equal to the grid length).
        ii. If there is enough space, replace the segment of the **output grid** starting at `current_index` and of length `template_length` with the `template_pattern`.
        iii. Advance `current_index` by `template_length`.
        iv. Continue to the next iteration of the while loop (step 6).
    c. If the pixel color does not match `template_color` or if the pattern did not fit in step 6.b.i:
        i.  Increment `current_index` by 1.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
