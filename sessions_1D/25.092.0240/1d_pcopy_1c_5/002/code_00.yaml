    description: >
      Create a copy of the input_array.
      Iterate through the input array starting *after* the template_end_index.
      If a pixel matches the template_color (trigger_pixel), replace the segment
      in the *copied array* starting at that trigger_pixel's index and having
      length equal to template_length with the template_pattern.
      Ensure the replacement segment stays within the array bounds.
      Advance the iteration index past the newly replaced segment.
      Return the modified copied array.
