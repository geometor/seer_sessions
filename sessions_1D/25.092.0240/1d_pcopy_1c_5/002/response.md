**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern-replacement logic based on the first contiguous non-white block acting as a template. The examples showed this template being reapplied later in the sequence wherever the starting color of the template appeared. The simulation of this 1D logic matched all training examples perfectly.

The error reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") strongly indicated that the execution environment passed the input as a NumPy array, not a standard Python list as the initial code's type hints suggested (`List[int]`). While the 1D logic was correct, the implementation likely failed due to type mismatches or attempting list-specific operations on a NumPy array, or perhaps incorrectly handling a 2D array that was expected to be 1D.

The strategy is to adapt the implementation to explicitly handle 1D NumPy arrays, ensuring all operations (copying, slicing, comparison, assignment) are compatible.

**Metrics:**

Code execution was used to parse the input/output strings and confirm their structure.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Recreate the input data as strings
input_str_1 = "0 0 7 7 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
input_str_2 = "0 0 9 9 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
input_str_3 = "0 2 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"

output_str_1 = "0 0 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
output_str_2 = "0 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
output_str_3 = "0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"

# Parse strings into numpy arrays
input_1 = np.array([int(x) for x in input_str_1.split()], dtype=int)
input_2 = np.array([int(x) for x in input_str_2.split()], dtype=int)
input_3 = np.array([int(x) for x in input_str_3.split()], dtype=int)

output_1 = np.array([int(x) for x in output_str_1.split()], dtype=int)
output_2 = np.array([int(x) for x in output_str_2.split()], dtype=int)
output_3 = np.array([int(x) for x in output_str_3.split()], dtype=int)

# Print shapes, sizes, and unique non-zero colors
print(f"Example 1 Input Shape: {input_1.shape}, Size: {input_1.size}, Non-zero Color: {np.unique(input_1[input_1 != 0])}")
print(f"Example 1 Output Shape: {output_1.shape}, Size: {output_1.size}")
print(f"Example 2 Input Shape: {input_2.shape}, Size: {input_2.size}, Non-zero Color: {np.unique(input_2[input_2 != 0])}")
print(f"Example 2 Output Shape: {output_2.shape}, Size: {output_2.size}")
print(f"Example 3 Input Shape: {input_3.shape}, Size: {input_3.size}, Non-zero Color: {np.unique(input_3[input_3 != 0])}")
print(f"Example 3 Output Shape: {output_3.shape}, Size: {output_3.size}")
```
```
Example 1 Input Shape: (33,), Size: 33, Non-zero Color: [7]
Example 1 Output Shape: (33,), Size: 33
Example 2 Input Shape: (33,), Size: 33, Non-zero Color: [9]
Example 2 Output Shape: (33,), Size: 33
Example 3 Input Shape: (33,), Size: 33, Non-zero Color: [2]
Example 3 Output Shape: (33,), Size: 33

```
**Findings:**

*   All inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (vectors) of length 33.
*   Each example uses white (0) and exactly one other color (7: orange, 9: maroon, 2: red).
*   The transformation logic identified previously (find first non-white block, use as template, replace subsequent occurrences triggered by the template's first color) holds true for all examples when applied to the 1D array.
*   The error likely occurred because the code expected a `List[int]` but received a `numpy.ndarray`, causing issues despite the logic being sound for a 1D sequence.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, represented as a 1D NumPy array.
2.  Scan the input array to find the first non-white pixel. This marks the start of the `template_pattern`.
3.  Identify the color (`template_color`) and determine the full extent of the contiguous block of this color. Record the sequence of colors in this block (`template_pattern`) and its length (`template_length`). Note the index where this initial pattern ends (`template_end_index`).
4.  If no non-white pixels are found, return a copy of the input array.
5.  Create a mutable copy of the input array (`output_array`).
6.  Initialize a scanning index `current_index` to `template_end_index + 1`.
7.  While `current_index` is within the bounds of the array:
    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `output_array[current_index]`.
    b.  If this color matches the `template_color`:
        i.  Check if the `template_pattern` (of length `template_length`) can fit within the `output_array` starting at `current_index` (i.e., if `current_index + template_length <= array_length`).
        ii. If it fits, replace the slice `output_array[current_index : current_index + template_length]` with the `template_pattern`.
        iii.Advance the `current_index` by `template_length` (to move past the segment just replaced).
        iv. Continue to the next iteration of the while loop (step 7).
    c.  If the color does not match `template_color`, increment `current_index` by 1.
8.  Return the modified `output_array`.
