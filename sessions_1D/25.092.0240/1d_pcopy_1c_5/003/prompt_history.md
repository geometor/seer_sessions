Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples use single-row input and output grids, which likely represent flattened 2D grids. We need to infer the original dimensions or assume a standard format if not provided explicitly. However, looking at the pattern of zeros and non-zeros, it seems more likely these are already 1D representations of some process, or perhaps small grids where only one row is relevant or modified significantly. Let's re-examine assuming they *are* 1D slices or simplified representations.
    *   **Re-evaluation:** The examples show patterns like `7 7 7`, `7 0 0`, `7 0 0` changing to `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`. This strongly suggests a 2D structure where the input is sparse and the output fills in a shape based on the input structure. The single line format is likely just a compact representation. I need to parse these into 2D grids first. Assuming they are space-separated values for a single row is incorrect. Let's assume these are flattened representations of grids. How to determine the width/height?
    *   **Hypothesis:** The number of elements is 33 in all examples. 33 is not easily factorizable into common small grid dimensions (like 3x11, 11x3). This is unusual for ARC. Let me re-read the prompt carefully. Ah, the prompt doesn't explicitly state the *input format* representation, just that ARC uses 2D grids. The examples provided might be *part* of a larger grid or represented row-by-row. Let's assume the examples are just single rows for now and see if a pattern emerges.

2.  **Color Presence:** Each example features white pixels (0) and one other dominant color (7: orange, 9: maroon, 2: red).
3.  **Input Pattern:** In each input, there's a contiguous block of the dominant color (e.g., `7 7 7`, `9 9 9`, `2 2 2`). Following this block, there are instances of the dominant color appearing individually, separated by white pixels.
4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output, the sections that had isolated dominant colors in the input are filled in to match the initial contiguous block. For example, where the input had `7 0 0`, the output has `7 7 7`, replicating the pattern `7 7 7` found earlier in the input.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to be:
    *   Find the first contiguous block of the non-white color. This block acts as a "pattern" or "template".
    *   Find subsequent occurrences of the *start* of this pattern (i.e., the first pixel of the block).
    *   Wherever the start of the pattern is found later in the row, replace the following pixels (the number of pixels matching the length of the original pattern block) with the pattern itself.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (represented as a single row or sequence).
2.  Identify the primary non-white color (let's call it `C`).
3.  Scan the input row from the beginning to find the first sequence of one or more contiguous pixels of color `C`. Let this sequence be the `template_pattern` and its length be `L`.
4.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
5.  Continue scanning the input row *after* the initial `template_pattern`.
6.  For each subsequent pixel encountered:
    *   If the pixel's color is `C`:
        *   Check if there are at least `L` pixels remaining in the row starting from the current position.
        *   If yes, replace the next `L` pixels in the *output row* (starting from the current position) with the `template_pattern`.
        *   Advance the scanning position by `L` steps to avoid processing pixels within the newly replaced segment immediately.
    *   If the pixel's color is not `C`, continue scanning to the next pixel.
7.  Return the modified output row.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern-replacement logic based on the first contiguous non-white block acting as a template. The examples showed this template being reapplied later in the sequence wherever the starting color of the template appeared. The simulation of this 1D logic matched all training examples perfectly.

The error reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") strongly indicated that the execution environment passed the input as a NumPy array, not a standard Python list as the initial code's type hints suggested (`List[int]`). While the 1D logic was correct, the implementation likely failed due to type mismatches or attempting list-specific operations on a NumPy array, or perhaps incorrectly handling a 2D array that was expected to be 1D.

The strategy is to adapt the implementation to explicitly handle 1D NumPy arrays, ensuring all operations (copying, slicing, comparison, assignment) are compatible.

**Metrics:**

Code execution was used to parse the input/output strings and confirm their structure.

**Findings:**

*   All inputs and outputs are 1D arrays (vectors) of length 33.
*   Each example uses white (0) and exactly one other color (7: orange, 9: maroon, 2: red).
*   The transformation logic identified previously (find first non-white block, use as template, replace subsequent occurrences triggered by the template's first color) holds true for all examples when applied to the 1D array.
*   The error likely occurred because the code expected a `List[int]` but received a `numpy.ndarray`, causing issues despite the logic being sound for a 1D sequence.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, represented as a 1D NumPy array.
2.  Scan the input array to find the first non-white pixel. This marks the start of the `template_pattern`.
3.  Identify the color (`template_color`) and determine the full extent of the contiguous block of this color. Record the sequence of colors in this block (`template_pattern`) and its length (`template_length`). Note the index where this initial pattern ends (`template_end_index`).
4.  If no non-white pixels are found, return a copy of the input array.
5.  Create a mutable copy of the input array (`output_array`).
6.  Initialize a scanning index `current_index` to `template_end_index + 1`.
7.  While `current_index` is within the bounds of the array:
    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `output_array[current_index]`.
    b.  If this color matches the `template_color`:
        i.  Check if the `template_pattern` (of length `template_length`) can fit within the `output_array` starting at `current_index` (i.e., if `current_index + template_length <= array_length`).
        ii. If it fits, replace the slice `output_array[current_index : current_index + template_length]` with the `template_pattern`.
        iii.Advance the `current_index` by `template_length` (to move past the segment just replaced).
        iv. Continue to the next iteration of the while loop (step 7).
    c.  If the color does not match `template_color`, increment `current_index` by 1.
8.  Return the modified `output_array`.
