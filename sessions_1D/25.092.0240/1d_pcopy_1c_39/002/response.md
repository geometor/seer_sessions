## General Assessment

The initial code failed because it only extended existing segments in place. The analysis of the failed examples revealed that the transformation involves not just resizing segments to the maximum width found in the input, but also adjusting the starting positions of all segments except the first one (leftmost). The segments subsequent to the first are shifted one position to the left before being drawn with the maximum width. The output grid is essentially reconstructed based on these adjusted positions and the maximum width.

**Observations from Metrics:**
*   All inputs are 1x32 grids.
*   Each input has exactly one non-white color.
*   Each input contains multiple horizontal segments of the non-white color.
*   One segment in the input is always wider than the others (width 3 vs width 1 in examples). This wider segment is the first (leftmost) segment in all examples.
*   The maximum width found in the input dictates the width of *all* segments in the output.
*   The start position of the first input segment is preserved in the output.
*   The start positions of all subsequent input segments are shifted one position to the left in the output.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid.
3.  Scan the input grid horizontally from left to right to find all contiguous segments (sequences of 1 or more pixels) of this non-white color. Record the starting index and width of each segment in the order they appear.
4.  Determine the maximum width (`max_width`) among all the identified segments.
5.  Iterate through the recorded segments based on their order of appearance (left-to-right).
6.  For the *first* segment encountered (the leftmost one):
    *   Determine its starting index (`start_index`) from the input.
    *   In the output grid, fill the pixels from `start_index` to `start_index + max_width - 1` with the non-white color.
7.  For *each subsequent* segment encountered:
    *   Determine its starting index (`start_index`) from the input.
    *   Calculate the *shifted* starting index for the output: `shifted_start_index = start_index - 1`.
    *   In the output grid, fill the pixels from `shifted_start_index` to `shifted_start_index + max_width - 1` with the non-white color (ensure indices stay within grid bounds).
8.  Return the newly constructed output grid.
