            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code failed because it only extended existing segments in place. The analysis of the failed examples revealed that the transformation involves not just resizing segments to the maximum width found in the input, but also adjusting the starting positions of all segments except the first one (leftmost). The segments subsequent to the first are shifted one position to the left before being drawn with the maximum width. The output grid is essentially reconstructed based on these adjusted positions and the maximum width.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Row                                                              | Output Row                                                             | Non-White Color | Input Segments (Start, Width) | Max Width | Output Segments (Start, Width) | Start Pos Match | All Output Widths = Max Width |\n| :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------- | :----------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------- |\n| 1       | `[0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0...`                                 | `[0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0...`                             | 3               | `(1,3), (7,1), (11,1), (15,1)` | 3         | `(1,3), (6,3), (10,3), (14,3)` | No              | Yes                           |\n| 2       | `[0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0...`                         | `[0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0...`                     | 2               | `(2,3), (9,1), (15,1), (19,1)` | 3         | `(2,3), (8,3), (14,3), (18,3)` | No              | Yes                           |\n| 3       | `[0,0,9,9,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,9,0,0...`                                 | `[0,0,9,9,9,0,0,9,9,9,0,0,9,9,9,0,0...`                             | 9               | `(2,3), (8,1), (13,1)`        | 3         | `(2,3), (7,3), (12,3)`         | No              | Yes                           |\n\n**Observations from Metrics:**\n*   All inputs are 1x32 grids.\n*   Each input has exactly one non-white color.\n*   Each input contains multiple horizontal segments of the non-white color.\n*   One segment in the input is always wider than the others (width 3 vs width 1 in examples).
