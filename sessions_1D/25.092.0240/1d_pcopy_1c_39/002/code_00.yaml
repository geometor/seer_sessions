task_type: object_reconstruction
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    color: variable (non-white, e.g., green, red, maroon)
    properties:
      - width: integer (number of contiguous pixels)
      - position: integer (starting column index)
      - order: integer (relative position from left, 1st, 2nd, etc.)
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    attribute: width
    description: One segment is typically wider than others in the input (the first segment in examples).
  - type: identity
    attribute: color
    description: All non-white segments within a single example share the same color.
  - type: spatial
    attribute: position
    description: Segments are spatially ordered from left to right.
actions:
  - name: identify_non_white_color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - name: find_segments
    input: input_grid, non_white_color
    output: list_of_segments (each with start_index and width)
    description: Locate all contiguous horizontal segments of the identified non-white color, maintaining their left-to-right order.
  - name: find_max_width
    input: list_of_segments
    output: maximum_width
    description: Calculate the maximum width among all identified segments.
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    input: grid_width, list_of_segments, maximum_width, non_white_color, background_color
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Create a new grid of the same dimensions initialized with the background color.
      Identify the first segment (leftmost) from the input list.
      Draw this segment in the output grid starting at its original input start_index with the maximum_width.
      For each subsequent segment from the input list, determine its shifted start index (original_start_index - 1).
      Draw these subsequent segments in the output grid starting at their shifted start index with the maximum_width.
transformation_goal: >
  Reconstruct the grid such that all segments have the same width (equal to the maximum width found in the input).
  The first segment retains its original start position. All subsequent segments are shifted one position to the left relative to their original start position.
