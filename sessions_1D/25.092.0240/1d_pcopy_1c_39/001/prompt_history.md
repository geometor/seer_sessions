Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

The input and output are both single-row grids (1xN). Each input grid contains a background color (white, 0) and segments of a single non-white color (green, red, or maroon in the examples). In each input, there appears to be one initial horizontal segment of the non-white color that is wider (3 pixels wide in all examples) than subsequent occurrences of the same color, which appear as single pixels (1 pixel wide).

The transformation seems to involve identifying the non-white color and the width of its widest contiguous horizontal segment in the input. Then, all other segments (specifically, the single pixels) of that same non-white color are extended horizontally to the right until they match the width of the widest segment. The background pixels and the pixels of the initially widest segment remain unchanged in their position and color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    color: variable (non-white, e.g., green, red, maroon)
    properties:
      - width: integer (number of contiguous pixels)
      - position: integer (starting column index)
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    attribute: width
    description: One segment is typically wider than others in the input.
  - type: identity
    attribute: color
    description: All non-white segments within a single example share the same color.
actions:
  - name: identify_non_white_color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - name: find_segments
    input: input_grid, non_white_color
    output: list_of_segments (each with position and width)
    description: Locate all contiguous horizontal segments of the identified non-white color.
  - name: find_max_width
    input: list_of_segments
    output: maximum_width
    description: Calculate the maximum width among all identified segments.
  - name: extend_segments
    input: input_grid, list_of_segments, maximum_width, non_white_color
    output: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input. For each segment shorter than the maximum width, extend it to the right by adding pixels of the non_white_color until its width equals maximum_width. Ensure extension does not overwrite existing parts of other segments or go beyond grid boundaries (though not explicitly needed based on examples). Preserve positions of segments.
transformation_goal: Make all non-white segments have the same width, determined by the widest segment in the input.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid.
3.  Scan the input grid horizontally to find all contiguous segments (sequences of 1 or more pixels) of this non-white color. Record the starting position and width of each segment.
4.  Determine the maximum width among all the identified segments.
5.  Iterate through the identified segments.
6.  For each segment whose width is less than the maximum width:
    *   Starting from the pixel immediately to the right of the segment's last pixel in the output grid, change the color of the required number of pixels (maximum width - current width) to the non-white color.
7.  Return the modified grid as the output.
