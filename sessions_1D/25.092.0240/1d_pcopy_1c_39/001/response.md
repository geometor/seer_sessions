"""
Identify the single non-white color in the input grid (which is 1xN).
Find all contiguous horizontal segments of this non-white color.
Determine the maximum width among these segments.
Extend all segments shorter than the maximum width to the right, 
filling the necessary number of pixels with the non-white color until they reach the maximum width.
The background pixels and the originally widest segment(s) remain unchanged.
