"""
Reconstructs the 1xN grid based on identified non-white segments from the input.
1. Find the single non-white color and all its contiguous horizontal segments in the input row, recording their start index and width in order.
2. Determine the maximum width among these segments.
3. Create a new output row initialized with the background color (0).
4. Draw the first segment found in the input into the output row, starting at its original input start index, but using the calculated maximum width.
5. For each subsequent segment found in the input:
    a. Calculate a shifted start index by subtracting 1 from its original input start index.
    b. Draw the segment into the output row, starting at the shifted start index, using the calculated maximum width.
6. Return the reconstructed row wrapped in a list.
