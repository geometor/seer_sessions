task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    color: variable (non-white, e.g., green, red, maroon)
    properties:
      - width: integer (number of contiguous pixels)
      - position: integer (starting column index)
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    attribute: width
    description: One segment is typically wider than others in the input.
  - type: identity
    attribute: color
    description: All non-white segments within a single example share the same color.
actions:
  - name: identify_non_white_color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - name: find_segments
    input: input_grid, non_white_color
    output: list_of_segments (each with position and width)
    description: Locate all contiguous horizontal segments of the identified non-white color.
  - name: find_max_width
    input: list_of_segments
    output: maximum_width
    description: Calculate the maximum width among all identified segments.
  - name: extend_segments
    input: input_grid, list_of_segments, maximum_width, non_white_color
    output: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input. For each segment shorter than the maximum width, extend it to the right by adding pixels of the non_white_color until its width equals maximum_width. Ensure extension does not overwrite existing parts of other segments or go beyond grid boundaries (though not explicitly needed based on examples). Preserve positions of segments.
transformation_goal: Make all non-white segments have the same width, determined by the widest segment in the input.
