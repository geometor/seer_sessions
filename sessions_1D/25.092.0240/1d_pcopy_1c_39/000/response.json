Each input grid contains a background color (white, 0) and segments of a single non-white color (green, red, or maroon in the examples). In each input, there appears to be one initial horizontal segment of the non-white color that is wider (3 pixels wide in all examples) than subsequent occurrences of the same color, which appear as single pixels (1 pixel wide).\n\nThe transformation seems to involve identifying the non-white color and the width of its widest contiguous horizontal segment in the input. Then, all other segments (specifically, the single pixels) of that same non-white color are extended horizontally to the right until they match the width of the widest segment. The background pixels and the pixels of the initially widest segment remain unchanged in their position and color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
