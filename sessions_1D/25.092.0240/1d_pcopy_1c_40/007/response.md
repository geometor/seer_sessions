"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid (provided as a NumPy array) by finding the first 
contiguous horizontal sequence of a non-white color (the 'template segment'). 
Then, it scans the rest of the row. Whenever a pixel matching the template's 
color is found (a 'trigger pixel') in the original input row, it replaces the 
pixels in the output grid starting at the trigger pixel's location with a copy 
of the template segment. The copying handles boundary conditions, truncating the 
template if it exceeds the grid width. The scan index is advanced past the newly 
copied segment to prevent re-triggering within it. The output is returned as a 
standard Python list of lists.
