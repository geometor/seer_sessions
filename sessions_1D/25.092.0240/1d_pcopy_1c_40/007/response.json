Whenever a pixel matching the template's \ncolor is found (a 'trigger pixel') in the original input row, it replaces the \npixels in the output grid starting at the trigger pixel's location with a copy \nof the template segment. The copying handles boundary conditions, truncating the \ntemplate if it exceeds the grid width. The scan index is advanced past the newly \ncopied segment to prevent re-triggering within it. The output is returned as a \nstandard Python list of lists.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_first_non_white_segment(row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous segment of non-white pixels (color != 0) in a row.\n\n    Args:\n        row: A list of integers representing a row of pixels.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing:\n        - template_segment (list): The sequence of pixels in the segment.\n        - segment_color (int): The color of the segment.\n        - end_col (int): The column index immediately following the segment.\n        Returns (None, -1, -1) if no non-white segment is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_col = -1\n    segment_color = -1\n    row_length = len(row)\n    \n    # Find the start of the first non-white segment\n    for i in range(row_length):\n        if row[i] != 0: \n            start_col = i\n            segment_color = row[i]\n            break\n            \n    # If no non-white pixel was found, return indicator values\n    if start_col == -1:\n        return None, -1, -1\n        \n    # Find the end of the contiguous segment of the same color\n    end_col = start_col\n    while end_col < row_length and row[end_col] == segment_color:\n        end_col += 1\n        \n    # Extract the template segment\n    template_segment = row[start_col:end_col]\n    \n    return template_segment, segment_color, end_col\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the template replication transformation to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A NumPy array representing the input grid (expected 1xN).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Input Validation and Initialization ---\n    # Check if input is a NumPy array\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, np.ndarray):\n        # If not numpy, maybe it's already list of lists?
