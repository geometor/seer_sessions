task_type: pattern_replication_1d
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # Effectively 1D (single row)
  size_constancy: true # Input and output dimensions are identical
color_properties:
  background_color: white # 0
  active_colors: 1 # Only one non-white color per task instance
  color_constancy: true # The non-white color remains the same between input and output
components:
  - role: template_segment
    element: horizontal_contiguous_block
    location: first occurrence of non-white color sequence
    properties:
      - color: the single non-white color present
      - length: variable (3 in examples)
  - role: trigger_pixel
    element: pixel
    location: any occurrence of the non-white color *after* the template_segment ends
    properties:
      - color: must match the template_segment color
actions:
  - name: identify_template
    inputs: input_row
    outputs: template_segment (list of colors), template_color (int), end_index_of_template (int)
    description: Scan the input row from left to right to find the first sequence of connected non-white pixels. Record the sequence, its color, and the index immediately following it.
  - name: replicate_template
    inputs: input_row, output_row (initially a copy of input), template_segment, template_color, start_scan_index (end_index_of_template)
    outputs: modified_output_row
    description: Iterate through the input row starting from start_scan_index. If a pixel matches the template_color, overwrite the output row starting at that pixel's index with the template_segment. Handle boundary conditions (truncation if template exceeds row end). Advance the scan index past the newly written segment to avoid re-triggering within it.
constraints:
  - Operates only on single-row grids (1xN).
  - Assumes exactly one non-white color exists in the input.
  - Replication starts exactly at the trigger pixel's index.
  - Overwrites existing pixels in the output row.
