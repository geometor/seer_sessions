Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  The inputs and outputs are single rows (1-dimensional grids).
2.  Each example features one non-white color (yellow, green, or red) interspersed with white pixels.
3.  The first occurrence of the non-white color forms a contiguous segment (e.g., `4 4 4`, `3 3 3`, `2 2 2`).
4.  Subsequent occurrences of the *same* non-white color in the input appear as single pixels.
5.  In the output, these subsequent single pixels are replaced by copies of the *first* segment found in the input.
6.  The positions of the white pixels (value 0) are preserved unless overwritten by the replication of the non-white segment.
7.  The overall length of the row remains the same.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: pattern_replication_1d
components:
  - role: background
    element: pixel
    color: white # 0
    properties: static, unless overwritten
  - role: primary_object
    element: segment # contiguous sequence of non-white pixels
    color: variable (yellow, green, red in examples)
    location: first occurrence defines the template
    properties:
      - shape: defined by its length and color
      - name: template_segment
  - role: trigger_object
    element: pixel
    color: same as primary_object
    location: subsequent occurrences after the template_segment
    properties:
      - triggers replication action
actions:
  - name: identify_template
    inputs: input_row
    outputs: template_segment (color, shape/sequence), end_index_of_template
    description: Find the first contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
  - name: replicate_template
    inputs: input_row, output_row (initially copy of input), template_segment, end_index_of_template
    outputs: modified_output_row
    description: Iterate through the input row starting after the template segment. When a pixel matching the template color is found, overwrite the corresponding section in the output row with the template_segment.
constraints:
  - assumes only one non-white color per input row
  - replication starts at the index of the trigger pixel
  - replication overwrites existing pixels in the output row
  - replication length is determined by the template_segment length
  - replication should handle boundary conditions (though not explicitly tested in examples, implies truncation if needed)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output row as an identical copy of the input row.
2.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the first pixel that is not white. Let its color be `C` and its position (index) be `start_index`.
3.  Continue scanning from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous sequence of pixels with color `C`. Let the position immediately after this sequence be `end_index`.
4.  Define the 'template sequence' as the segment of the input row from `start_index` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
5.  Iterate through the input row, starting from position `end_index`.
6.  For each position `i` from `end_index` to the end of the row:
    *   If the pixel at input position `i` has color `C`:
        *   Copy the 'template sequence' into the output row, starting at position `i`. If the template sequence extends beyond the row boundary, copy only the part that fits within the row.
7.  Return the final output row.
