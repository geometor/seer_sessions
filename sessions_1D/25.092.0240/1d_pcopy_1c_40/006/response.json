            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code implementation correctly identified the core logic of the task: finding a template segment (the first contiguous block of non-white color) and replicating it at the locations of subsequent single pixels of the same color. However, the code failed during execution because it was not robust to the input data type provided by the ARC testing environment, which uses NumPy arrays rather than standard Python lists. The error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` indicates that a boolean check was performed directly on a NumPy array slice (likely in the input validation part: `if not input_grid[0]:`), which is disallowed.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the code to explicitly handle NumPy arrays. This can be done either by converting the input NumPy array (or relevant slices) to Python lists before processing or by using NumPy-specific methods for checks and operations (e.g., checking array emptiness with `.size == 0` instead of `if not array:`). Converting to lists is often simpler for this kind of element-wise logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's confirm the input structure and types using the provided examples. We'll simulate receiving the input as a NumPy array, as is common in the ARC environment.\n\n"
