import copy

"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by finding the first contiguous horizontal sequence 
of a non-white color (the 'template segment'). Then, it scans the rest of the 
row. Whenever a pixel matching the template's color is found (a 'trigger pixel') 
in the original input row, it replaces the pixels in the output grid starting 
at the trigger pixel's location with a copy of the template segment. The copying 
handles boundary conditions, truncating the template if it exceeds the grid width. 
The scan index is advanced past the newly copied segment to prevent re-triggering 
within it. The input is always expected to be a list containing a single list 
(representing the 1xN grid).
