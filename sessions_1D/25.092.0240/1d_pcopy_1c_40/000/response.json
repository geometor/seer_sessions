Each example features one non-white color (yellow, green, or red) interspersed with white pixels.\n3.  The first occurrence of the non-white color forms a contiguous segment (e.g., `4 4 4`, `3 3 3`, `2 2 2`).\n4.  Subsequent occurrences of the *same* non-white color in the input appear as single pixels.\n5.  In the output, these subsequent single pixels are replaced by copies of the *first* segment found in the input.\n6.  The positions of the white pixels (value 0) are preserved unless overwritten by the replication of the non-white segment.\n7.  The overall length of the row remains the same.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
