task_type: pattern_replication_1d
components:
  - role: background
    element: pixel
    color: white # 0
    properties: static, unless overwritten
  - role: primary_object
    element: segment # contiguous sequence of non-white pixels
    color: variable (yellow, green, red in examples)
    location: first occurrence defines the template
    properties:
      - shape: defined by its length and color
      - name: template_segment
  - role: trigger_object
    element: pixel
    color: same as primary_object
    location: subsequent occurrences after the template_segment
    properties:
      - triggers replication action
actions:
  - name: identify_template
    inputs: input_row
    outputs: template_segment (color, shape/sequence), end_index_of_template
    description: Find the first contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
  - name: replicate_template
    inputs: input_row, output_row (initially copy of input), template_segment, end_index_of_template
    outputs: modified_output_row
    description: Iterate through the input row starting after the template segment. When a pixel matching the template color is found, overwrite the corresponding section in the output row with the template_segment.
constraints:
  - assumes only one non-white color per input row
  - replication starts at the index of the trigger pixel
  - replication overwrites existing pixels in the output row
  - replication length is determined by the template_segment length
  - replication should handle boundary conditions (though not explicitly tested in examples, implies truncation if needed)
