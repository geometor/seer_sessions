```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by finding the first contiguous horizontal sequence 
of a non-white color (the 'template segment'). Then, it scans the rest of the 
row. Whenever a pixel matching the template's color is found (a 'trigger pixel'), 
it replaces the pixels in the output grid starting at the trigger pixel's 
location with a copy of the template segment. The copying handles boundary 
conditions, truncating the template if it exceeds the grid width. The input is 
always a list containing a single list (representing the 1xN grid).
