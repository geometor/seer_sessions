            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (a single row).\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1). Non-white colors seem to be treated similarly.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation appears to involve expanding isolated non-white pixels horizontally. Specifically, if a non-white pixel is surrounded immediately to its left and right by white pixels, those white neighbors are changed to match the color of the central non-white pixel.\n4.  **Object Identification:** We can consider individual non-white pixels or contiguous blocks of non-white pixels as objects. The transformation specifically targets single non-white pixels that are isolated horizontally.\n5.  **No Change Condition:** Existing blocks of non-white pixels (like `9 9 9` or `1 1 1` in the inputs) and non-white pixels adjacent to other non-white pixels remain unchanged by this specific rule. White pixels not adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel also remain unchanged.\n6.  **Independence:** The expansion rule seems to apply independently to each isolated pixel based on the *original* input state. Changes do not cascade or depend on other changes made during the transformation process.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
