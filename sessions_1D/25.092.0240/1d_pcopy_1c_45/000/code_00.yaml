GridType: 1D (single row)
Colors:
  - Background: White (0)
  - Active: Non-white (e.g., Maroon(9), Blue(1))
Objects:
  - Type: Isolated non-white pixel
    Properties:
      - Color C (where C != 0)
      - Position i
      - Left Neighbor (i-1): White (0)
      - Right Neighbor (i+1): White (0)
  - Type: Non-white block (>= 2 adjacent non-white pixels)
    Properties: Unaffected by the primary rule.
  - Type: Non-isolated non-white pixel (adjacent to another non-white pixel)
    Properties: Unaffected by the primary rule.
Action:
  - Name: Horizontal Expansion
  - Trigger: An isolated non-white pixel C at index i.
  - Effect: Change the color of pixels at i-1 and i+1 to C in the output grid.
Relationship:
  - The transformation of a pixel depends on its own color and the colors of its immediate left and right neighbors in the input grid.
  - Boundary conditions: The rule applies only to pixels that have both a left and a right neighbor (i.e., not the first or last pixel).
Output Grid Generation:
  - Start with a copy of the input grid.
  - Apply the expansion rule based on the input grid configuration to modify the copied grid.
