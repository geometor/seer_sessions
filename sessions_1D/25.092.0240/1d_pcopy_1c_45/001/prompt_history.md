Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (a single row).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1). Non-white colors seem to be treated similarly.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation appears to involve expanding isolated non-white pixels horizontally. Specifically, if a non-white pixel is surrounded immediately to its left and right by white pixels, those white neighbors are changed to match the color of the central non-white pixel.
4.  **Object Identification:** We can consider individual non-white pixels or contiguous blocks of non-white pixels as objects. The transformation specifically targets single non-white pixels that are isolated horizontally.
5.  **No Change Condition:** Existing blocks of non-white pixels (like `9 9 9` or `1 1 1` in the inputs) and non-white pixels adjacent to other non-white pixels remain unchanged by this specific rule. White pixels not adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel also remain unchanged.
6.  **Independence:** The expansion rule seems to apply independently to each isolated pixel based on the *original* input state. Changes do not cascade or depend on other changes made during the transformation process.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
GridType: 1D (single row)
Colors:
  - Background: White (0)
  - Active: Non-white (e.g., Maroon(9), Blue(1))
Objects:
  - Type: Isolated non-white pixel
    Properties:
      - Color C (where C != 0)
      - Position i
      - Left Neighbor (i-1): White (0)
      - Right Neighbor (i+1): White (0)
  - Type: Non-white block (>= 2 adjacent non-white pixels)
    Properties: Unaffected by the primary rule.
  - Type: Non-isolated non-white pixel (adjacent to another non-white pixel)
    Properties: Unaffected by the primary rule.
Action:
  - Name: Horizontal Expansion
  - Trigger: An isolated non-white pixel C at index i.
  - Effect: Change the color of pixels at i-1 and i+1 to C in the output grid.
Relationship:
  - The transformation of a pixel depends on its own color and the colors of its immediate left and right neighbors in the input grid.
  - Boundary conditions: The rule applies only to pixels that have both a left and a right neighbor (i.e., not the first or last pixel).
Output Grid Generation:
  - Start with a copy of the input grid.
  - Apply the expansion rule based on the input grid configuration to modify the copied grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Examine each pixel in the input grid, excluding the very first and very last pixels.
3.  For a pixel at index `i` (where `1 <= i < length - 1`):
    a.  Let `C` be the color of the pixel at index `i` in the input grid.
    b.  Check if `C` is not white (0).
    c.  Check if the pixel at index `i-1` in the input grid is white (0).
    d.  Check if the pixel at index `i+1` in the input grid is white (0).
    e.  If all conditions (b, c, and d) are true, then update the output grid by setting the color of the pixel at index `i-1` to `C` and the color of the pixel at index `i+1` to `C`.
4.  After checking all applicable pixels, return the final output grid.
