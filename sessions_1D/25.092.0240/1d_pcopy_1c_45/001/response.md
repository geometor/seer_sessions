    Transforms the input grid according to the following rule:
    Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    Examine each pixel in the input grid's single row, excluding the very first and very last pixels.
    For a pixel at index `i` (where `1 <= i < length - 1`):
      a. Let `C` be the color of the pixel at index `i` in the input grid.
      b. Check if `C` is not white (0).
      c. Check if the pixel at index `i-1` in the input grid is white (0).
      d. Check if the pixel at index `i+1` in the input grid is white (0).
      e. If all conditions (b, c, and d) are true, then update the output grid by setting the 
         color of the pixel at index `i-1` to `C` and the color of the pixel at 
         index `i+1` to `C`.
    After checking all applicable pixels, return the final output grid.
    The transformation operates on a single row.
