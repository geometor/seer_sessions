*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output data are presented as single rows (1D grids) of pixels.
    *   The examples contain white background pixels (0) and groups of non-white pixels.
    *   Two types of non-white objects appear in the inputs:
        *   Horizontal blocks of three consecutive pixels of the same color (e.g., `2 2 2`, `9 9 9`, `4 4 4`).
        *   Single, isolated non-white pixels (e.g., `0 2 0`, `0 9 0`, `0 4 0`).
    *   The transformation seems to involve modifying the single, isolated non-white pixels while leaving the blocks of three unchanged.
    *   Specifically, each single non-white pixel in the input is expanded into a horizontal block of three pixels of the same color in the output, centered at the original pixel's position.
    *   The existing blocks of three in the input are preserved in the output.
    *   The transformation applies independently to each non-white pixel/group based on whether it's isolated or already part of a block of three.

      - name: copy_background
        input: background_pixel in input_grid
        output: corresponding background_pixel in output_grid, unless overwritten by an expansion.
    transformation_rule:
      - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
      - If a pixel is non-white:
        - Check its left and right neighbors.
        - If both neighbors (within bounds) have the same color as the current pixel, it's part of an existing block of three (or larger, but examples only show three); do nothing (it's already copied).
        - If the pixel is non-white but *not* part of a block of three (i.e., it's isolated or at the edge of a smaller block), treat it as a 'single' pixel needing expansion.
        - For such a single pixel at index `i` with color `C`:
          - Change the pixel at index `i-1` (if within bounds) to color `C` in the output grid.
          - Ensure the pixel at index `i` is color `C` in the output grid.
          - Change the pixel at index `i+1` (if within bounds) to color `C` in the output grid.
    notes: The process should handle boundary conditions carefully (pixels at index 0 or the last index). The logic implicitly assumes that only single pixels or blocks of exactly three appear, not blocks of two or blocks larger than three.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create an output grid initially identical to the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid by its index `i`.
    3.  If the pixel at index `i` in the input grid is non-white (color `C`):
        a.  Check if this pixel is *not* part of a horizontal block of three identical colors. This means checking if the pixel at `i-1` (if `i>0`) is *not* color `C` OR if the pixel at `i+1` (if `i < width-1`) is *not* color `C`.
        b.  If the condition in step 3a is true (the pixel is isolated or part of a block smaller than three):
            i.  Set the pixel at index `i` in the output grid to color `C`.
            ii. If `i > 0`, set the pixel at index `i-1` in the output grid to color `C`.
            iii. If `i < width-1` (where `width` is the total number of pixels), set the pixel at index `i+1` in the output grid to color `C`.
    4.  Pixels that are part of an original block of three, and all white pixels that are not overwritten by the expansion process, remain unchanged from their initial copy.
    5.  Return the modified output grid.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
*   **Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that the `input_grid` provided to the `transform` function is a `numpy` array, not a standard Python list of lists as assumed in the initial code. Operations like `if input_grid:` or direct element comparison might behave differently with numpy arrays.
    *   The core logic identified (expanding isolated non-white pixels into blocks of three) appears consistent with the examples.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Confirm the input data type using `tool_code`.
        2.  Rewrite the code to correctly handle `numpy` arrays, using appropriate indexing and comparison methods.
        3.  Ensure the logic correctly identifies "isolated" pixels versus pixels already part of a block of three within the numpy array context.

    notes: The core logic targets only non-white pixels that are isolated (surrounded by white or boundaries). Pixels already part of larger blocks in the input are effectively preserved because the condition for expansion isn't met, and the initial copy ensures they are present in the output unless overwritten by an adjacent expansion (which shouldn't happen based on the examples).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input as a 2D numpy array with shape (1, width).
    2.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the initial output array.
    3.  Get the width (number of columns) of the array.
    4.  Iterate through each column index `j` from 0 to `width - 1`.
    5.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `input[0, j]`.
    6.  If the color `C` is not white (i.e., `C > 0`):
        a.  Determine if the pixel to the left (at `j-1`) is white or if `j` is the first column (index 0).
        b.  Determine if the pixel to the right (at `j+1`) is white or if `j` is the last column (index `width - 1`).
        c.  If both the left condition (white or boundary) and the right condition (white or boundary) are true, then this pixel is considered "single".
        d.  If the pixel is "single":
            i.  Ensure the pixel at `output[0, j]` is set to color `C`.
