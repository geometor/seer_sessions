```python
import numpy as np

"""
Expands single non-white pixels within a 1D numpy array (represented as shape (1, width)) 
into horizontal blocks of three, keeping existing blocks of three or more unchanged.

A pixel is considered 'single' if it is non-white and both its horizontal neighbors 
(within the array bounds) are white (0).
The expansion involves setting the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors 
(if they exist within bounds) to the color of the single pixel in the output array.
Pixels that are already part of a block (i.e., have at least one non-white neighbor of the same color) 
or are white are initially copied and only modified if they become part of an expansion of a nearby single pixel.
