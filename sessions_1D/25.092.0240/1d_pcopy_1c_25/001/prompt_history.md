*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output data are presented as single rows (1D grids) of pixels.
    *   The examples contain white background pixels (0) and groups of non-white pixels.
    *   Two types of non-white objects appear in the inputs:
        *   Horizontal blocks of three consecutive pixels of the same color (e.g., `2 2 2`, `9 9 9`, `4 4 4`).
        *   Single, isolated non-white pixels (e.g., `0 2 0`, `0 9 0`, `0 4 0`).
    *   The transformation seems to involve modifying the single, isolated non-white pixels while leaving the blocks of three unchanged.
    *   Specifically, each single non-white pixel in the input is expanded into a horizontal block of three pixels of the same color in the output, centered at the original pixel's position.
    *   The existing blocks of three in the input are preserved in the output.
    *   The transformation applies independently to each non-white pixel/group based on whether it's isolated or already part of a block of three.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Expand single non-white pixels into horizontal blocks of three, keeping existing blocks of three unchanged.
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    objects:
      - type: background_pixel
        color: white (0)
      - type: colored_pixel
        color: non-white (1-9)
        states:
          - single: A colored pixel surrounded by white pixels or grid boundaries.
          - block_of_three: Three consecutive pixels of the same non-white color.
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally.
      - type: grouping
        description: Consecutive pixels of the same color form groups.
    actions:
      - name: identify_objects
        input: input_grid
        output: locations and types of single colored pixels and blocks of three.
      - name: preserve_block
        input: block_of_three in input_grid
        output: corresponding block_of_three in output_grid
      - name: expand_single
        input: single colored_pixel in input_grid at index i
        output: block_of_three of the same color in output_grid at indices i-1, i, i+1.
      - name: copy_background
        input: background_pixel in input_grid
        output: corresponding background_pixel in output_grid, unless overwritten by an expansion.
    transformation_rule:
      - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
      - If a pixel is non-white:
        - Check its left and right neighbors.
        - If both neighbors (within bounds) have the same color as the current pixel, it's part of an existing block of three (or larger, but examples only show three); do nothing (it's already copied).
        - If the pixel is non-white but *not* part of a block of three (i.e., it's isolated or at the edge of a smaller block), treat it as a 'single' pixel needing expansion.
        - For such a single pixel at index `i` with color `C`:
          - Change the pixel at index `i-1` (if within bounds) to color `C` in the output grid.
          - Ensure the pixel at index `i` is color `C` in the output grid.
          - Change the pixel at index `i+1` (if within bounds) to color `C` in the output grid.
    notes: The process should handle boundary conditions carefully (pixels at index 0 or the last index). The logic implicitly assumes that only single pixels or blocks of exactly three appear, not blocks of two or blocks larger than three.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create an output grid initially identical to the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid by its index `i`.
    3.  If the pixel at index `i` in the input grid is non-white (color `C`):
        a.  Check if this pixel is *not* part of a horizontal block of three identical colors. This means checking if the pixel at `i-1` (if `i>0`) is *not* color `C` OR if the pixel at `i+1` (if `i < width-1`) is *not* color `C`.
        b.  If the condition in step 3a is true (the pixel is isolated or part of a block smaller than three):
            i.  Set the pixel at index `i` in the output grid to color `C`.
            ii. If `i > 0`, set the pixel at index `i-1` in the output grid to color `C`.
            iii. If `i < width-1` (where `width` is the total number of pixels), set the pixel at index `i+1` in the output grid to color `C`.
    4.  Pixels that are part of an original block of three, and all white pixels that are not overwritten by the expansion process, remain unchanged from their initial copy.
    5.  Return the modified output grid.
