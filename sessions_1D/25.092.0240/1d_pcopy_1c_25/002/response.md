*   **Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that the `input_grid` provided to the `transform` function is a `numpy` array, not a standard Python list of lists as assumed in the initial code. Operations like `if input_grid:` or direct element comparison might behave differently with numpy arrays.
    *   The core logic identified (expanding isolated non-white pixels into blocks of three) appears consistent with the examples.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Confirm the input data type using `tool_code`.
        2.  Rewrite the code to correctly handle `numpy` arrays, using appropriate indexing and comparison methods.
        3.  Ensure the logic correctly identifies "isolated" pixels versus pixels already part of a block of three within the numpy array context.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Let's check the data types and shapes of the inputs.
``` python
    import numpy as np

    # Example 1
    input_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    output_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

    # Example 2
    input_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    output_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

    # Example 3
    input_3 = np.array([[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    output_3 = np.array([[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

    print(f"Example 1 Input Type: {type(input_1)}, Shape: {input_1.shape}")
    print(f"Example 1 Output Type: {type(output_1)}, Shape: {output_1.shape}")
    print(f"Example 2 Input Type: {type(input_2)}, Shape: {input_2.shape}")
    print(f"Example 2 Output Type: {type(output_2)}, Shape: {output_2.shape}")
    print(f"Example 3 Input Type: {type(input_3)}, Shape: {input_3.shape}")
    print(f"Example 3 Output Type: {type(output_3)}, Shape: {output_3.shape}")
```
```
Example 1 Input Type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>, Shape: (1, 32)
Example 1 Output Type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>, Shape: (1, 32)
Example 2 Input Type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>, Shape: (1, 32)

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Expand single non-white pixels within a 1D numpy array into horizontal blocks of three, keeping existing blocks of three unchanged.
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 2D numpy array with shape (1, width))
    input_output_type: numpy.ndarray
    objects:
      - type: background_pixel
        color: white (0)
      - type: colored_pixel
        color: non-white (1-9)
        states:
          - single: A colored pixel whose horizontal neighbors (within bounds) are both white (0).
          - block_member: A colored pixel that has at least one horizontal neighbor (within bounds) of the same color. Specifically, existing blocks of three are identified.
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally within the single row of the numpy array.
      - type: grouping
        description: Consecutive pixels of the same color form groups.
    actions:
      - name: identify_single_pixels
        input: input_array (shape 1xN)
        output: indices of non-white pixels where both neighbors are white (0) or out of bounds.
      - name: preserve_existing_pixels
        input: input_array
        output: initial output_array (copy of input_array)
      - name: expand_single
        input: index `j` of a single colored_pixel (color `C`) in the input_array.
        output: modification of the output_array setting indices `j-1` (if >0), `j`, and `j+1` (if < width-1) to color `C`.
    transformation_rule:
      - Create an output numpy array as a copy of the input numpy array.
      - Iterate through the columns (pixels) `j` from 0 to width-1 of the single row in the input array.
      - Let `color` be the value at input_array[0, j].
      - If `color` is non-white ( > 0):
        - Check the left neighbor: `is_left_white` is true if `j == 0` or `input_array[0, j-1] == 0`.
        - Check the right neighbor: `is_right_white` is true if `j == width-1` or `input_array[0, j+1] == 0`.
        - If both `is_left_white` and `is_right_white` are true:
          - This pixel is "single". Expand it in the output array:
            - Set `output_array[0, j] = color`.
            - If `j > 0`, set `output_array[0, j-1] = color`.
            - If `j < width-1`, set `output_array[0, j+1] = color`.
      - Return the modified output array.
    notes: The core logic targets only non-white pixels that are isolated (surrounded by white or boundaries). Pixels already part of larger blocks in the input are effectively preserved because the condition for expansion isn't met, and the initial copy ensures they are present in the output unless overwritten by an adjacent expansion (which shouldn't happen based on the examples).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input as a 2D numpy array with shape (1, width).
    2.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the initial output array.
    3.  Get the width (number of columns) of the array.
    4.  Iterate through each column index `j` from 0 to `width - 1`.
    5.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `input[0, j]`.
    6.  If the color `C` is not white (i.e., `C > 0`):
        a.  Determine if the pixel to the left (at `j-1`) is white or if `j` is the first column (index 0).
        b.  Determine if the pixel to the right (at `j+1`) is white or if `j` is the last column (index `width - 1`).
        c.  If both the left condition (white or boundary) and the right condition (white or boundary) are true, then this pixel is considered "single".
        d.  If the pixel is "single":
            i.  Ensure the pixel at `output[0, j]` is set to color `C`.
            ii. If `j` is not the first column (`j > 0`), set the pixel at `output[0, j-1]` to color `C`.
            iii. If `j` is not the last column (`j < width - 1`), set the pixel at `output[0, j+1]` to color `C`.
    7.  After iterating through all columns, return the modified output array.
