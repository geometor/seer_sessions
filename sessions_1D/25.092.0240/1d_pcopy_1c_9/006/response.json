            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed due to a Python/NumPy type error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.\" This typically arises when a comparison intended for scalars (like `pixel == pattern_color`) or a boolean check in an `if` statement inadvertently involves a NumPy array instead of a single boolean value.\n\nDebugging revealed that while the core logic of finding the pattern and replacing isolated pixels was sound, the handling of input types (list vs. NumPy array) within the helper function `find_first_pattern_1d` and the main `transform` function was inconsistent, leading to potential comparisons between incompatible types (e.g., scalar vs. array, or array vs. array where a single boolean was expected).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Refine the helper function (`find_first_pattern_1d_robust`) to explicitly handle both list and NumPy array inputs, ensuring it always returns standard Python types (list for the pattern segment, scalar integer for the color).\n2.  Maintain the main `transform` function's logic using standard Python lists for clarity and safety, by explicitly converting the input row to a list at the beginning.\n3.  The underlying transformation logic described in the YAML and natural language program remains valid. The focus is on correcting the implementation details.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nMetrics gathering confirmed the `find_first_pattern_1d` function's logic was mostly correct but sensitive to input types. The robust version addresses this.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Pattern `[2, 2, 2]` (color 2, len 3) found at index 1. Target: `2` at index 6. Output replaces `output[5:8]` with `[2, 2, 2]`.\n*   **Example 2:** Pattern `[6, 6, 6]` (color 6, len 3) found at index 1. Targets: `6` at index 8, `6` at index 12. Output replaces `output[7:10]` and `output[11:14]` with `[6, 6, 6]`.\n*   **Example 3:** Pattern `[4, 4, 4]` (color 4, len 3) found at index 1. Target: `4` at index 8. Output replaces `output[7:10]` with `[4, 4, 4]`.\n\nThe core transformation remains consistent across examples.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Scan the original input grid row from left (index 0) to right (`W-1`) to find the *first* contiguous sequence of one or more non-white pixels.\n3.  Record this sequence as the `pattern_segment` (a list of pixel values), its color as `pattern_color` (an integer), its length as `pattern_length`, and its start and end indices (`pattern_start_idx`, `pattern_end_idx` exclusive) in the original input row.\n4.  If no `pattern_segment` is found (e.g., the row is all white), return the `output_row` as is.\n5.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to `W-1` of the original input row.\n6.  Skip the current index `c` if it falls within the range of the original `pattern_segment` (i.e., if `pattern_start_idx <= c < pattern_end_idx`).\n7.  Check if the pixel at index `c` in the original input row has the `pattern_color`.\n8.  If the color matches, check if this pixel is horizontally isolated:\n    *   Check the left neighbor: Is `c` index 0 OR is the pixel at `c-1` white (0)?\n    *   Check the right neighbor: Is `c` index `W-1` OR is the pixel at `c+1` white (0)?\n9.  If the pixel at `c` matches `pattern_color` AND it is horizontally isolated (both left and right checks are true), then it is a `target_pixel`.\n10.
