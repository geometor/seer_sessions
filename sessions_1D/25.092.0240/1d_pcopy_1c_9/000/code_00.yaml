task_description: Replace isolated pixels of a specific color with the first encountered contiguous segment of that same color, centering the segment on the isolated pixel's position.

elements:
  - element_type: grid
    properties:
      - description: Input and output are 1D grids (rows) of the same size.
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element_type: object
    description: Pattern Segment
    properties:
      - identification: The first contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
      - color: Varies per example (red, magenta, yellow).
      - shape: Always a 1x3 segment in the examples (e.g., [color, color, color]).
      - role: Defines the pattern to be replicated.
      - persistence: Remains unchanged in the output.

  - element_type: object
    description: Target Pixel
    properties:
      - identification: A single non-white pixel whose horizontal neighbors are white (0) or grid boundaries.
      - color: Must match the color of the Pattern Segment.
      - location: Varies within the grid.
      - role: Marks the locations for replacement.

actions:
  - action_type: find
    description: Locate the Pattern Segment (first non-white contiguous horizontal block) and its color.
    inputs:
      - input grid
    outputs:
      - pattern_segment (pixel sequence)
      - pattern_color
      - pattern_length

  - action_type: find
    description: Locate all Target Pixels (isolated pixels matching pattern_color).
    inputs:
      - input grid
      - pattern_color
    outputs:
      - list_of_target_locations (indices)

  - action_type: replace
    description: Replace pixels in the output grid based on target locations.
    details: For each target_location (column index 'c'), place the pattern_segment onto the grid such that it is centered horizontally at 'c'. The placement starts at column 'c - floor(pattern_length / 2)'.
    inputs:
      - target_locations
      - pattern_segment
      - pattern_length
      - input grid (or a copy)
    outputs:
      - output grid

relationships:
  - type: color_match
    description: Target Pixels must have the same color as the Pattern Segment.
  - type: spatial
    description: Target Pixels are isolated horizontally (neighbors are white or boundary).
  - type: transformation
    description: Target Pixels are replaced by the Pattern Segment, centered at the target location.

invariants:
  - The original Pattern Segment's location and pixels remain unchanged.
  - White (0) pixels remain unchanged unless overwritten by a replacement action.
  - Pixels that are neither part of the original Pattern Segment nor part of a replacement area remain unchanged.
