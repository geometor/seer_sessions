            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples use 1-dimensional grids (rows). The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n2.  **Color Palette:** Each example uses white (0) and one other color (red=2, magenta=6, yellow=4).\n3.  **Key Features:**\n    *   **Pattern Segment:** In each input, there is a contiguous horizontal segment of 3 identical non-white pixels (e.g., `2 2 2`, `6 6 6`, `4 4 4`). This seems to be the defining pattern. It's always the first non-white group encountered.\n    *   **Target Pixels:** Elsewhere in the input row, there are isolated single pixels of the *same* non-white color as the pattern segment. These single pixels are surrounded horizontally by white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replacing the isolated single target pixels. The original pattern segment remains untouched. The white pixels also remain untouched unless they are overwritten during the replacement.\n5.  **Replacement Mechanism:** Each target pixel is replaced by a *copy* of the pattern segment. The replacement seems to be centered horizontally on the position of the original target pixel. Since the pattern segment has length 3, the replacement overwrites the target pixel and its immediate left and right neighbors.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid row from left to right to find the first sequence of one or more connected non-white pixels. Store this sequence as the `pattern_segment` and note its color (`pattern_color`) and length (`pattern_length`).\n3.  Iterate through each column index `c` of the input grid row.\n4.  Check if the pixel at index `c` in the input grid matches the `pattern_color` AND if it is isolated horizontally (i.e., the pixel at `c-1` is white or off-grid, AND the pixel at `c+1` is white or off-grid).\n5.  If both conditions in step 4 are true, this pixel is a `target_pixel`. Calculate the starting column index for the replacement: `start_col = c - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.\n6.  Place the `pattern_segment` onto the *output* grid, starting at `start_col` and extending for `pattern_length` columns, overwriting any existing values in the output grid at those positions. Ensure the placement stays within the grid's column boundaries.\n7.  After checking all columns, return the final output grid."
