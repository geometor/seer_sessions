Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples use 1-dimensional grids (rows). The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
2.  **Color Palette:** Each example uses white (0) and one other color (red=2, magenta=6, yellow=4).
3.  **Key Features:**
    *   **Pattern Segment:** In each input, there is a contiguous horizontal segment of 3 identical non-white pixels (e.g., `2 2 2`, `6 6 6`, `4 4 4`). This seems to be the defining pattern. It's always the first non-white group encountered.
    *   **Target Pixels:** Elsewhere in the input row, there are isolated single pixels of the *same* non-white color as the pattern segment. These single pixels are surrounded horizontally by white (0) pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replacing the isolated single target pixels. The original pattern segment remains untouched. The white pixels also remain untouched unless they are overwritten during the replacement.
5.  **Replacement Mechanism:** Each target pixel is replaced by a *copy* of the pattern segment. The replacement seems to be centered horizontally on the position of the original target pixel. Since the pattern segment has length 3, the replacement overwrites the target pixel and its immediate left and right neighbors.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Replace isolated pixels of a specific color with the first encountered contiguous segment of that same color, centering the segment on the isolated pixel's position.

elements:
  - element_type: grid
    properties:
      - description: Input and output are 1D grids (rows) of the same size.
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element_type: object
    description: Pattern Segment
    properties:
      - identification: The first contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
      - color: Varies per example (red, magenta, yellow).
      - shape: Always a 1x3 segment in the examples (e.g., [color, color, color]).
      - role: Defines the pattern to be replicated.
      - persistence: Remains unchanged in the output.

  - element_type: object
    description: Target Pixel
    properties:
      - identification: A single non-white pixel whose horizontal neighbors are white (0) or grid boundaries.
      - color: Must match the color of the Pattern Segment.
      - location: Varies within the grid.
      - role: Marks the locations for replacement.

actions:
  - action_type: find
    description: Locate the Pattern Segment (first non-white contiguous horizontal block) and its color.
    inputs:
      - input grid
    outputs:
      - pattern_segment (pixel sequence)
      - pattern_color
      - pattern_length

  - action_type: find
    description: Locate all Target Pixels (isolated pixels matching pattern_color).
    inputs:
      - input grid
      - pattern_color
    outputs:
      - list_of_target_locations (indices)

  - action_type: replace
    description: Replace pixels in the output grid based on target locations.
    details: For each target_location (column index 'c'), place the pattern_segment onto the grid such that it is centered horizontally at 'c'. The placement starts at column 'c - floor(pattern_length / 2)'.
    inputs:
      - target_locations
      - pattern_segment
      - pattern_length
      - input grid (or a copy)
    outputs:
      - output grid

relationships:
  - type: color_match
    description: Target Pixels must have the same color as the Pattern Segment.
  - type: spatial
    description: Target Pixels are isolated horizontally (neighbors are white or boundary).
  - type: transformation
    description: Target Pixels are replaced by the Pattern Segment, centered at the target location.

invariants:
  - The original Pattern Segment's location and pixels remain unchanged.
  - White (0) pixels remain unchanged unless overwritten by a replacement action.
  - Pixels that are neither part of the original Pattern Segment nor part of a replacement area remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid row from left to right to find the first sequence of one or more connected non-white pixels. Store this sequence as the `pattern_segment` and note its color (`pattern_color`) and length (`pattern_length`).
3.  Iterate through each column index `c` of the input grid row.
4.  Check if the pixel at index `c` in the input grid matches the `pattern_color` AND if it is isolated horizontally (i.e., the pixel at `c-1` is white or off-grid, AND the pixel at `c+1` is white or off-grid).
5.  If both conditions in step 4 are true, this pixel is a `target_pixel`. Calculate the starting column index for the replacement: `start_col = c - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.
6.  Place the `pattern_segment` onto the *output* grid, starting at `start_col` and extending for `pattern_length` columns, overwriting any existing values in the output grid at those positions. Ensure the placement stays within the grid's column boundaries.
7.  After checking all columns, return the final output grid.
