Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify the first contiguous horizontal segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid row. This is the 'pattern segment'. Note its color, length, and start/end indices.
2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid row.
4.  If a pixel has the same color as the pattern segment AND it is horizontally isolated (its left and right neighbors are white (0) or grid boundaries) AND it is *not* part of the original pattern segment identified in step 1, then it is a 'target pixel'.
5.  For each target pixel found at column index 'c', replace the corresponding segment in the *output* grid with the 'pattern segment'. The replacement should be centered horizontally at index 'c'. This means the pattern segment will overwrite the pixels in the output grid starting from column `c - floor(pattern_length / 2)` for `pattern_length` columns. Handle boundary conditions where the pattern might extend beyond the grid edges.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
