Identify the first contiguous horizontal segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid row. This is the 'pattern segment'. Note its color, length, and start/end indices.\n2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid row.\n4.  If a pixel has the same color as the pattern segment AND it is horizontally isolated (its left and right neighbors are white (0) or grid boundaries) AND it is *not* part of the original pattern segment identified in step 1, then it is a 'target pixel'.\n5.  For each target pixel found at column index 'c', replace the corresponding segment in the *output* grid with the 'pattern segment'. The replacement should be centered horizontally at index 'c'. This means the pattern segment will overwrite the pixels in the output grid starting from column `c - floor(pattern_length / 2)` for `pattern_length` columns. Handle boundary conditions where the pattern might extend beyond the grid edges.\n6.  Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_first_pattern(grid_row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels in a 1D array.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_row (np.array): A 1D numpy array representing the grid row.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (pattern_segment, pattern_color, pattern_length, start_index, end_index)\n               Returns (None, -1, 0, -1, -1) if no pattern is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    pattern_segment = None\n    pattern_color = -1\n    pattern_length = 0\n    start_index = -1\n    end_index = -1\n    width = len(grid_row)\n\n    in_pattern = False\n    for j in range(width):\n        pixel = grid_row[j]\n        if not in_pattern and pixel != 0:\n            # Start of a new pattern\n            in_pattern = True\n            start_index = j\n            pattern_color = pixel\n        elif in_pattern:\n            if pixel != pattern_color:\n                # End of the pattern\n                end_index = j # exclusive index\n                pattern_segment = grid_row[start_index:end_index]\n                pattern_length = len(pattern_segment)\n                return pattern_segment, pattern_color, pattern_length, start_index, end_index\n            elif j == width - 1:\n                 # Pattern ends at the edge of the grid\n                 end_index = width # exclusive index\n                 pattern_segment = grid_row[start_index:end_index]\n                 pattern_length = len(pattern_segment)\n                 return pattern_segment, pattern_color, pattern_length, start_index, end_index\n\n\n    # If the loop finishes and we were in a pattern (single pixel pattern at end)\n    # This case is actually covered by the elif j == width - 1 case above\n    # If no non-zero pixel was found at all\n    if not in_pattern:\n        return None, -1, 0, -1, -1\n\n    # This return should ideally not be reached due to logic inside loop,\n    # but included for completeness if edge cases missed.\n    # This handles case where pattern is the very last pixel and loop finishes\n    if in_pattern and end_index == -1: # Should be caught by j == width - 1 check\n        end_index = width\n        pattern_segment = grid_row[start_index:end_index]\n        pattern_length = len(pattern_segment)\n        return pattern_segment, pattern_color, pattern_length, start_index, end_index\n\n    return None, -1, 0, -1, -1 # Default if no pattern\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): A 2D list representing the grid.\n                                     Expected to be 1xN for this specific task.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    # Assuming input is always 1xN based on examples\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return []\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_np = np.copy(input_np)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # --- This task specifically works on a single row ---\n    if height != 1:\n        # Handle unexpected input dimensions if necessary,\n        # but for now, assume height is 1 based on examples.\n        # For generality, could loop through rows, but problem seems 1D.\n         pass # Or raise error, or adapt logic for 2D\n\n    grid_row = input_np[0]\n    output_row = output_np[0]\n\n    # 1.
