"""
Transformation Rule:
Identifies the first contiguous horizontal segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid row (the 'pattern segment').
Finds all isolated pixels (horizontally surrounded by white/0 or boundaries) outside the original pattern segment that match the pattern's color.
Replaces these isolated pixels in an output grid copy by centering the pattern segment over the isolated pixel's original location.
Assumes the input grid is a single row (1xN).
