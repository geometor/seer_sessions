            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement the observed transformation rule: identify a pattern (first contiguous non-white block), find isolated pixels matching the pattern's color, and replace those isolated pixels (and their neighborhood) with a centered copy of the pattern. The logic appears sound based on the visual examples.\n\nHowever, the code consistently failed on all training examples with the error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This strongly suggests that somewhere in the code, a NumPy array is being used in a context that requires a single boolean value (e.g., `if some_array:` or an implicit boolean conversion during a comparison). Despite reviewing the code, the exact location of this error isn't immediately obvious, as comparisons seem to be scalar (`pixel == pattern_color`) and array usages (`pattern_segment[i]`) don't appear in boolean contexts.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Maintain the core logic derived from the visual examples, as the understanding of the transformation seems correct.\n2.  Re-examine the implementation details, particularly interactions with NumPy arrays.\n3.  Modify the code to explicitly ensure scalar values are used in boolean comparisons, potentially using `.item()` on NumPy scalar types, to prevent the ambiguous truth value error.\n4.  Focus on the `find_first_pattern` and the pixel iteration/replacement loop within `transform` as the most likely sources of the error.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nNo code execution is needed to gather metrics, as the previous attempt failed consistently.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Failed (Ambiguous truth value error)\n*   **Example 2:** Failed (Ambiguous truth value error)\n*   **Example 3:** Failed (Ambiguous truth value error)\n*   **Success Rate:** 0/3\n\nThe consistent error type across all examples points to a fundamental issue in how NumPy arrays or their elements are handled in boolean contexts within the implementation, rather than a failure specific to the data in one example.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\nThe initial YAML description accurately captures the perceived elements and actions. The error appears to be in the implementation rather than the understanding, so the YAML remains unchanged.\n\n"

The implementation needs correction, but the description remains valid.\n\n1.  Create a copy of the input grid row to serve as the output grid row.\n2.  Scan the input grid row from left to right to find the first contiguous sequence of non-white pixels. Store this sequence as the `pattern_segment`, its color as `pattern_color`, its length as `pattern_length`, and its start and end column indices (`pattern_start_idx`, `pattern_end_idx`).\n3.  If no `pattern_segment` is found, return the unmodified copy of the input grid row.\n4.  Iterate through each column index `c` of the input grid row.\n5.  Skip the current index `c` if it falls within the range of the original `pattern_segment` (from `pattern_start_idx` up to, but not including, `pattern_end_idx`).\n6.  Check if the pixel at index `c` in the input grid row has the `pattern_color`.\n7.  If the color matches, check if the pixel is horizontally isolated:\n    *   The pixel to the left (at `c-1`) must be white (0) or `c` must be the first column (index 0).\n    *   The pixel to the right (at `c+1`) must be white (0) or `c` must be the last column.\n8.  If the pixel at index `c` matches the `pattern_color` AND is horizontally isolated AND is not part of the original pattern segment, then it is a `target_pixel`.\n9.  For each `target_pixel` found at index `c`, calculate the starting column index for replacement in the *output* grid row: `start_col = c - floor(pattern_length / 2)`.\n10. Place the `pattern_segment` onto the *output* grid row, starting at `start_col`. For each pixel in the `pattern_segment`, overwrite the pixel in the output grid row at the corresponding column index (`start_col + i`, where `i` is the index within the pattern). Ensure writing stays within the grid row's boundaries.\n11. After checking all columns, return the modified output grid row (within the original grid structure, likely a list containing this single row)."
