**Assessment**

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" consistently occurred across all training examples when executing the previous code attempt. This error typically arises in Python when a NumPy array containing multiple elements is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:` or `bool(array)`).

Given that the core logic (find pattern, find isolated targets, replace centered pattern) appears correct when traced against the examples, the error likely stems from a subtle interaction with NumPy arrays, potentially:
1.  The `find_first_pattern` function returning an unexpected result (e.g., an empty array slice that behaves strangely in comparisons) in some edge case.
2.  The comparison `if pattern_segment is None:` behaving unexpectedly with NumPy array slices (although usually robust).
3.  An unforeseen issue within the replacement loop logic when interacting with NumPy array views or assignments.

The strategy is to
