Identify the first contiguous horizontal segment of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid row. This is the 'pattern segment'. Note its color, length, and start/end indices.\n2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid row.\n4.  If a pixel has the same color as the pattern segment AND it is horizontally isolated (its left and right neighbors are white (0) or grid boundaries) AND it is *not* part of the original pattern segment identified in step 1, then it is a 'target pixel'.\n5.  For each target pixel found at column index 'c', replace the corresponding segment in the *output* grid with the 'pattern segment'. The replacement should be centered horizontally at index 'c'. This means the pattern segment will overwrite the pixels in the output grid starting from column `c - floor(pattern_length / 2)` for `pattern_length` columns. Handle boundary conditions where the pattern might extend beyond the grid edges.\n6.  Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_first_pattern(grid_row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels in a 1D array.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_row (np.array): A 1D numpy array representing the grid row.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (pattern_segment, pattern_color, pattern_length, start_index, end_index)\n               Returns (None, -1, 0, -1, -1) if no pattern is found.\n               'end_index' is the exclusive index (index after the last pattern pixel).\n    \"\"\"\n    width = len(grid_row)\n    start_index = -1\n    pattern_color = -1\n\n    for j in range(width):\n        pixel = grid_row[j]\n        # Look for the start of the pattern\n        if start_index == -1:\n            if pixel != 0:\n                start_index = j\n                pattern_color = pixel\n        # Already found the start, look for the end\n        else:\n            if pixel != pattern_color:\n                # Found the end (pixel differs)\n                end_index = j # Exclusive index\n                pattern_segment = grid_row[start_index:end_index]\n                pattern_length = len(pattern_segment)\n                # Ensure segment is not empty before returning\n                if pattern_length > 0:\n                     return pattern_segment, pattern_color, pattern_length, start_index, end_index\n                else: # Should not happen with this logic but safe guard\n                     start_index = -1 # Reset search if segment was somehow empty\n\n            # Special check if the current pixel is the pattern color AND it's the last pixel\n            # This ensures patterns ending at the edge are captured\n            elif j == width - 1 and pixel == pattern_color:\n                end_index = width # Exclusive index for the end of the array\n                pattern_segment = grid_row[start_index:end_index]\n                pattern_length = len(pattern_segment)\n                if pattern_length > 0:\n                    return pattern_segment, pattern_color, pattern_length, start_index, end_index\n\n    # If the loop finishes and we were inside a pattern that started but didn't explicitly end\n    # This case is handled by the 'j == width - 1' check inside the loop.\n\n    # If no non-zero pixel was ever found\n    return None, -1, 0, -1, -1\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): A 2D list representing the grid.\n                                     Expected to be 1xN for this specific task.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    # Assuming input is always 1xN based on examples\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return [] # Handle empty input\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy\n    output_np = np.copy(input_np)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # --- This task specifically works on a single row ---\n    # If grid has more than one row, process only the first or adapt logic.\n    # Based on examples, assuming height is always 1.\n    if height != 1:\n        # For now, just return the input copy if dimensions don't match expectation\n        # Or raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be 1xN\")\n        return output_np.tolist()\n\n    grid_row = input_np[0]\n    output_row = output_np[0] # Get a view of the row to modify\n\n    # 1.
