**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed because it incorrectly applied the coloring rule. It identified the active color and colored the white horizontal neighbors of *all* pixels with the active color. However, the examples show that only the white horizontal neighbors of *isolated* active color pixels should be colored. An active color pixel is considered "isolated" if both its immediate left and right neighbors (within the grid bounds) are white (0). Pixels already part of a horizontal segment of the active color are not isolated and do not cause their neighbors to be colored.

The strategy is to modify the logic to first identify only the *isolated* active pixels in the input grid. Then, for each identified isolated pixel, color its immediate left and right white neighbors (if they exist and are white) in the output grid.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's analyze the examples based on the revised understanding.
