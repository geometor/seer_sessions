            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt failed because it incorrectly assumed the input data was a 1D sequence. The error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` strongly indicates that the input and output are actually 2D NumPy arrays (grids), not simple lists. The transformation logic needs to be re-evaluated based on a 2D grid structure.\n\nThe core idea of identifying an \"active color\" and modifying white pixels adjacent to \"isolated\" active pixels seems plausible, but the definitions of \"isolated\" and \"adjacent\" must be adapted for a 2D grid. Observing the examples again with a 2D perspective suggests the isolation and subsequent coloring might be purely horizontal.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Grid Structure:** Verify that inputs/outputs are 2D arrays and determine their dimensions.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Isolation:** Define \"isolated\" in the context of a 2D grid. Based on the examples, it appears an active pixel is considered \"isolated\" if its immediate *horizontal* neighbors (left and right) are both white (0). Pixels on the left/right edges only need their single horizontal neighbor to be white.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Transformation:** Determine which neighbors of an isolated pixel are colored. The examples suggest only the immediate *horizontal* white neighbors are changed to the active color.\n4.  **Update Metrics, YAML, and Program:** Refine the analysis, documentation, and natural language program based on the 2D grid interpretation.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n"

Let's look at the input pixel `(1, 0)` again. It is isolated. Its right neighbor is `(1, 1)`, which was white and correctly changed. However, `(1, 2)` was also white, and it also changed. This suggests a potential secondary effect or a slightly different rule.\n    *   **Alternative Hypothesis:** Perhaps the rule isn't just about *isolated* single pixels. Maybe it's about *any* active pixel that has a white horizontal neighbor? Let's test this:\n        *   Pixel `(1, 0)` (value 9) has right neighbor `(1, 1)` (value 0). Change `(1, 1)` to 9.\n        *   Pixel `(1, 1)` (now 9) has right neighbor `(1, 2)` (value 0). Change `(1, 2)` to 9.\n        *   Pixel `(0, 6)` (value 9) has left neighbor `(0, 5)` (value 0). Change `(0, 5)` to 9.\n        *   Pixel `(0, 6)` (value 9) has right neighbor `(0, 7)` (value 0). Change `(0, 7)` to 9.\n    *   This revised hypothesis seems to match Example 3 perfectly. Let's recheck Examples 1 and 2.\n        *   **Example 1:**\n            *   Input: `[[0 7 7 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 0], [0 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0], [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`\n            *   Output: `[[0 7 7 7 0 0 7 7 7 0 0], [7 7 7 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0], [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`\n            *   `(0, 7)` (7) -> right neighbor `(0, 8)` (0) changes to 7. Left neighbor `(0, 6)` (0) changes to 7.\n            *   `(1, 1)` (7) -> left neighbor `(1, 0)` (0) changes to 7. Right neighbor `(1, 2)` (0) changes to 7.\n            *   `(1, 5)` (7) -> left neighbor `(1, 4)` (0) changes to 7. Right neighbor `(1, 6)` (0) changes to 7.\n            *   This revised rule also matches Example 1.\n        *   **Example 2:**\n            *   Input: `[[0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 6 0 0], [0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0], [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`\n            *   Output: `[[0 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 0], [0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0], [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`\n            *   `(0, 8)` (6) -> left neighbor `(0, 7)` (0) changes to 6. Right neighbor `(0, 9)` (0) changes to 6.\n            *   `(1, 3)` (6) -> left neighbor `(1, 2)` (0) changes to 6. Right neighbor `(1, 4)` (0) changes to 6.\n            *   This revised rule also matches Example 2.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The transformation rule is: Find the active color. For every pixel with the active color in the input grid, check its immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right). If a horizontal neighbor exists within the grid boundaries and is white (0) in the input grid, change that neighbor's color to the active color in the output grid. This process happens for *all* active pixels simultaneously based on the *original* input state.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
