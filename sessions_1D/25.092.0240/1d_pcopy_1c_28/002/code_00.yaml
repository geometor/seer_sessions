Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  background_color: 0 (white)
  format: NumPy array
  shape_assumption: 3x11 (based on examples length 33)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
  - type: Active_Color
    description: The single non-zero color value present in the input grid.
  - type: Active_Pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is the Active_Color.
  - type: Target_Pixel
    description: A white (0) pixel in the input grid that is immediately horizontally adjacent (left or right) to an Active_Pixel.

Relationships:
  - type: Horizontal_Adjacency
    object_types: [Pixel, Pixel]
    description: Pixel at (r, c) is horizontally adjacent to pixels at (r, c-1) and (r, c+1), if they exist within grid bounds.

Actions:
  - name: Identify_Active_Color
    input: Input grid
    output: Active_Color value (integer)
  - name: Identify_Target_Pixels
    input: Input grid, Active_Color
    output: List of coordinates [(r, c)] of Target_Pixels.
    description: Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the input grid. If input_grid[r, c] is the Active_Color, check its horizontal neighbors. If a neighbor (r, c-1) or (r, c+1) exists and its color in the input grid is white (0), add its coordinates to the list of Target_Pixels. Ensure uniqueness if a white pixel is adjacent to two active pixels.
  - name: Color_Target_Pixels
    input: Output grid, List of Target_Pixel coordinates, Active_Color
    description: For each coordinate (r, c) in the list of Target_Pixels, set the color of the output grid at output_grid[r, c] to the Active_Color.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
  - Identify the Active_Color from the input grid. If none exists, return the initial output grid.
  - Identify all Target_Pixels based on the input grid configuration (white pixels horizontally adjacent to any active pixel).
  - Perform the Color_Target_Pixels action on the output grid using the identified Target_Pixels and the Active_Color.
  - Return the final modified output grid.
