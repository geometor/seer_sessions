Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (treated as a sequence)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9)
      - position: index in the 1D sequence
  - type: Active_Pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is the single non-white color in the input.
  - type: Isolated_Active_Pixel
    description: An Active_Pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors in the sequence are white (0). Boundary conditions apply (a pixel at the start/end only needs its single neighbor to be white).
  - type: Active_Color_Segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more Active_Pixels.

Relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    object_types: [Pixel, Pixel]
    description: Pixels at index i and i+1 (or i-1) are adjacent.
  - type: Isolation
    object_types: [Active_Pixel, Pixel, Pixel]
    description: An Active_Pixel is isolated if its adjacent neighbors (if they exist) are white (0).

Actions:
  - name: Identify_Active_Color
    description: Find the unique non-zero color value in the input sequence.
  - name: Identify_Isolated_Pixels
    input: Input sequence, Active Color
    output: List of indices of Isolated_Active_Pixels.
  - name: Color_Neighbors
    input: Output sequence, Index of Isolated_Active_Pixel, Active Color
    description: Change the color of the white neighbors (at index-1 and index+1, if they exist and are white) of the isolated pixel to the Active Color in the output sequence.

Transformation_Rule:
  - For every Isolated_Active_Pixel in the input sequence, perform the Color_Neighbors action on the corresponding output sequence. Pixels that are not neighbors of isolated active pixels retain their original color.
