Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** The examples show input and output data represented as flat lists of integers (0-9), corresponding to colors. Although presented linearly, they likely represent a 1D structure or are treated as such for the transformation. The length of the input and output arrays is the same (33 in these examples).
*   **Colors:** Each input contains predominantly white pixels (0) and pixels of exactly one other color (7-orange, 6-magenta, 9-maroon). Let's call this the "active color". The output also contains only white and the active color.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve changing some white pixels (0) into the active color. The pixels that were originally the active color remain unchanged.
*   **Pattern:** The change appears localized. Comparing input and output, white pixels adjacent to *isolated* active color pixels are changed to the active color. An active color pixel seems "isolated" if its immediate left and right neighbors are both white. Existing contiguous segments of the active color are not modified.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (treated as a sequence)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9)
      - position: index in the 1D sequence
  - type: Active_Pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is the single non-white color in the input.
  - type: Isolated_Active_Pixel
    description: An Active_Pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors in the sequence are white (0). Boundary conditions apply (a pixel at the start/end only needs its single neighbor to be white).
  - type: Active_Color_Segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more Active_Pixels.

Relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    object_types: [Pixel, Pixel]
    description: Pixels at index i and i+1 (or i-1) are adjacent.
  - type: Isolation
    object_types: [Active_Pixel, Pixel, Pixel]
    description: An Active_Pixel is isolated if its adjacent neighbors (if they exist) are white (0).

Actions:
  - name: Identify_Active_Color
    description: Find the unique non-zero color value in the input sequence.
  - name: Identify_Isolated_Pixels
    input: Input sequence, Active Color
    output: List of indices of Isolated_Active_Pixels.
  - name: Color_Neighbors
    input: Output sequence, Index of Isolated_Active_Pixel, Active Color
    description: Change the color of the white neighbors (at index-1 and index+1, if they exist and are white) of the isolated pixel to the Active Color in the output sequence.

Transformation_Rule:
  - For every Isolated_Active_Pixel in the input sequence, perform the Color_Neighbors action on the corresponding output sequence. Pixels that are not neighbors of isolated active pixels retain their original color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Active Color:** Determine the single non-zero color value present in the input sequence. Call this `active_color`. If no non-zero color exists, return the input sequence unchanged.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
3.  **Iterate and Check Isolation:** Go through each pixel in the input sequence at index `i`.
4.  **Check if Pixel is Active:** If the pixel `input[i]` is equal to `active_color`:
    *   **Check Neighbors:** Determine if the pixel is isolated. Check the color of the left neighbor (`input[i-1]`) and the right neighbor (`input[i+1]`).
        *   A pixel at index `i` is considered isolated if:
            *   It has a left neighbor (`i > 0`) which is white (`input[i-1] == 0`), OR it's the first pixel (`i == 0`).
            *   AND
            *   It has a right neighbor (`i < length - 1`) which is white (`input[i+1] == 0`), OR it's the last pixel (`i == length - 1`).
5.  **Apply Color Change:** If the pixel `input[i]` is identified as an isolated active pixel:
    *   If it has a left neighbor (`i > 0`) and that neighbor is white (`input[i-1] == 0`), change the color of the pixel at index `i-1` in the *output* sequence to `active_color`.
    *   If it has a right neighbor (`i < length - 1`) and that neighbor is white (`input[i+1] == 0`), change the color of the pixel at index `i+1` in the *output* sequence to `active_color`.
6.  **Return Output:** After checking all pixels in the input sequence, return the final modified output sequence.
