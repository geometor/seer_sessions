            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Format:** The examples show input and output data represented as flat lists of integers (0-9), corresponding to colors. Although presented linearly, they likely represent a 1D structure or are treated as such for the transformation. The length of the input and output arrays is the same (33 in these examples).\n*   **Colors:** Each input contains predominantly white pixels (0) and pixels of exactly one other color (7-orange, 6-magenta, 9-maroon). Let's call this the \"active color\". The output also contains only white and the active color.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve changing some white pixels (0) into the active color. The pixels that were originally the active color remain unchanged.\n*   **Pattern:** The change appears localized. Comparing input and output, white pixels adjacent to *isolated* active color pixels are changed to the active color. An active color pixel seems \"isolated\" if its immediate left and right neighbors are both white. Existing contiguous segments of the active color are not modified.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
