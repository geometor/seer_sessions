Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** The examples show input and output data represented as flat lists of integers (0-9), corresponding to colors. Although presented linearly, they likely represent a 1D structure or are treated as such for the transformation. The length of the input and output arrays is the same (33 in these examples).
*   **Colors:** Each input contains predominantly white pixels (0) and pixels of exactly one other color (7-orange, 6-magenta, 9-maroon). Let's call this the "active color". The output also contains only white and the active color.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve changing some white pixels (0) into the active color. The pixels that were originally the active color remain unchanged.
*   **Pattern:** The change appears localized. Comparing input and output, white pixels adjacent to *isolated* active color pixels are changed to the active color. An active color pixel seems "isolated" if its immediate left and right neighbors are both white. Existing contiguous segments of the active color are not modified.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (treated as a sequence)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9)
      - position: index in the 1D sequence
  - type: Active_Pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is the single non-white color in the input.
  - type: Isolated_Active_Pixel
    description: An Active_Pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors in the sequence are white (0). Boundary conditions apply (a pixel at the start/end only needs its single neighbor to be white).
  - type: Active_Color_Segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more Active_Pixels.

Relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    object_types: [Pixel, Pixel]
    description: Pixels at index i and i+1 (or i-1) are adjacent.
  - type: Isolation
    object_types: [Active_Pixel, Pixel, Pixel]
    description: An Active_Pixel is isolated if its adjacent neighbors (if they exist) are white (0).

Actions:
  - name: Identify_Active_Color
    description: Find the unique non-zero color value in the input sequence.
  - name: Identify_Isolated_Pixels
    input: Input sequence, Active Color
    output: List of indices of Isolated_Active_Pixels.
  - name: Color_Neighbors
    input: Output sequence, Index of Isolated_Active_Pixel, Active Color
    description: Change the color of the white neighbors (at index-1 and index+1, if they exist and are white) of the isolated pixel to the Active Color in the output sequence.

Transformation_Rule:
  - For every Isolated_Active_Pixel in the input sequence, perform the Color_Neighbors action on the corresponding output sequence. Pixels that are not neighbors of isolated active pixels retain their original color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Active Color:** Determine the single non-zero color value present in the input sequence. Call this `active_color`. If no non-zero color exists, return the input sequence unchanged.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
3.  **Iterate and Check Isolation:** Go through each pixel in the input sequence at index `i`.
4.  **Check if Pixel is Active:** If the pixel `input[i]` is equal to `active_color`:
    *   **Check Neighbors:** Determine if the pixel is isolated. Check the color of the left neighbor (`input[i-1]`) and the right neighbor (`input[i+1]`).
        *   A pixel at index `i` is considered isolated if:
            *   It has a left neighbor (`i > 0`) which is white (`input[i-1] == 0`), OR it's the first pixel (`i == 0`).
            *   AND
            *   It has a right neighbor (`i < length - 1`) which is white (`input[i+1] == 0`), OR it's the last pixel (`i == length - 1`).
5.  **Apply Color Change:** If the pixel `input[i]` is identified as an isolated active pixel:
    *   If it has a left neighbor (`i > 0`) and that neighbor is white (`input[i-1] == 0`), change the color of the pixel at index `i-1` in the *output* sequence to `active_color`.
    *   If it has a right neighbor (`i < length - 1`) and that neighbor is white (`input[i+1] == 0`), change the color of the pixel at index `i+1` in the *output* sequence to `active_color`.
6.  **Return Output:** After checking all pixels in the input sequence, return the final modified output sequence.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt failed because it incorrectly assumed the input data was a 1D sequence. The error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` strongly indicates that the input and output are actually 2D NumPy arrays (grids), not simple lists. The transformation logic needs to be re-evaluated based on a 2D grid structure.

The core idea of identifying an "active color" and modifying white pixels adjacent to "isolated" active pixels seems plausible, but the definitions of "isolated" and "adjacent" must be adapted for a 2D grid. Observing the examples again with a 2D perspective suggests the isolation and subsequent coloring might be purely horizontal.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Grid Structure:** Verify that inputs/outputs are 2D arrays and determine their dimensions.
2.  **Re-evaluate Isolation:** Define "isolated" in the context of a 2D grid. Based on the examples, it appears an active pixel is considered "isolated" if its immediate *horizontal* neighbors (left and right) are both white (0). Pixels on the left/right edges only need their single horizontal neighbor to be white.
3.  **Re-evaluate Transformation:** Determine which neighbors of an isolated pixel are colored. The examples suggest only the immediate *horizontal* white neighbors are changed to the active color.
4.  **Update Metrics, YAML, and Program:** Refine the analysis, documentation, and natural language program based on the 2D grid interpretation.

**Analysis Results:**

*   **Grid Structure:** Assuming a 3x11 grid structure fits the data and the transformation logic. The input and output shapes are consistently (3, 11) under this assumption.
*   **Active Color:** Correctly identified in all examples (7, 6, 9).
*   **Horizontal Isolation:** The number of horizontally isolated active pixels found matches the number required to explain the output changes.
*   **Horizontal Neighbor Coloring:** The number of white pixels changed to the active color (`total_white_pixels_changed_to_active`) exactly matches the number of horizontal white neighbors adjacent to the identified isolated pixels (`white_neighbors_changed_by_isolation_rule`). This strongly supports the hypothesis that only horizontally isolated active pixels trigger the coloring of their immediate horizontal white neighbors.
*   **Example 3 Discrepancy:** In Example 3, the analysis found 3 changed neighbors for 2 isolated pixels (`white_neighbors_changed_by_isolation_rule`), but the total count of changed white pixels is 4 (`total_white_pixels_changed_to_active`). Let's re-examine Example 3's data and the analysis logic.

    *   Input 3 (reshaped):
        
```
        [[0 9 9 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0]
         [9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0]
         [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
        ```

    *   Output 3 (reshaped):
        
```
        [[0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0]
         [9 9 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0]
         [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
        ```

    *   Isolated pixels identified: `(0, 6)` (value 9, neighbors 0 and 0) and `(1, 0)` (value 9, left edge, right neighbor 0).
    *   Neighbors changed by `(0, 6)`: `(0, 5)` and `(0, 7)`.
    *   Neighbors changed by `(1, 0)`: `(1, 1)`.
    *   Total neighbors changed by rule: 3. Indices: `(0, 5)`, `(0, 7)`, `(1, 1)`.
    *   Actual changed pixels (Input[r,c]==0 and Output[r,c]==9): `(0, 5)`, `(0, 7)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 2)`.
    *   **The discrepancy:** Pixel `(1, 2)` changed from 0 to 9, but it wasn't identified as a neighbor of an isolated pixel by the current rule. Let's look at the input pixel `(1, 0)` again. It is isolated. Its right neighbor is `(1, 1)`, which was white and correctly changed. However, `(1, 2)` was also white, and it also changed. This suggests a potential secondary effect or a slightly different rule.
    *   **Alternative Hypothesis:** Perhaps the rule isn't just about *isolated* single pixels. Maybe it's about *any* active pixel that has a white horizontal neighbor? Let's test this:
        *   Pixel `(1, 0)` (value 9) has right neighbor `(1, 1)` (value 0). Change `(1, 1)` to 9.
        *   Pixel `(1, 1)` (now 9) has right neighbor `(1, 2)` (value 0). Change `(1, 2)` to 9.
        *   Pixel `(0, 6)` (value 9) has left neighbor `(0, 5)` (value 0). Change `(0, 5)` to 9.
        *   Pixel `(0, 6)` (value 9) has right neighbor `(0, 7)` (value 0). Change `(0, 7)` to 9.
    *   This revised hypothesis seems to match Example 3 perfectly. Let's recheck Examples 1 and 2.
        *   **Example 1:**
            *   Input: `[[0 7 7 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 0], [0 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0], [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`
            *   Output: `[[0 7 7 7 0 0 7 7 7 0 0], [7 7 7 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0], [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`
            *   `(0, 7)` (7) -> right neighbor `(0, 8)` (0) changes to 7. Left neighbor `(0, 6)` (0) changes to 7.
            *   `(1, 1)` (7) -> left neighbor `(1, 0)` (0) changes to 7. Right neighbor `(1, 2)` (0) changes to 7.
            *   `(1, 5)` (7) -> left neighbor `(1, 4)` (0) changes to 7. Right neighbor `(1, 6)` (0) changes to 7.
            *   This revised rule also matches Example 1.
        *   **Example 2:**
            *   Input: `[[0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 6 0 0], [0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0], [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`
            *   Output: `[[0 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 0], [0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0], [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`
            *   `(0, 8)` (6) -> left neighbor `(0, 7)` (0) changes to 6. Right neighbor `(0, 9)` (0) changes to 6.
            *   `(1, 3)` (6) -> left neighbor `(1, 2)` (0) changes to 6. Right neighbor `(1, 4)` (0) changes to 6.
            *   This revised rule also matches Example 2.

*   **Conclusion:** The transformation rule is: Find the active color. For every pixel with the active color in the input grid, check its immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right). If a horizontal neighbor exists within the grid boundaries and is white (0) in the input grid, change that neighbor's color to the active color in the output grid. This process happens for *all* active pixels simultaneously based on the *original* input state.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  background_color: 0 (white)
  format: NumPy array
  shape_assumption: 3x11 (based on examples length 33)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
  - type: Active_Color
    description: The single non-zero color value present in the input grid.
  - type: Active_Pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is the Active_Color.
  - type: Target_Pixel
    description: A white (0) pixel in the input grid that is immediately horizontally adjacent (left or right) to an Active_Pixel.

Relationships:
  - type: Horizontal_Adjacency
    object_types: [Pixel, Pixel]
    description: Pixel at (r, c) is horizontally adjacent to pixels at (r, c-1) and (r, c+1), if they exist within grid bounds.

Actions:
  - name: Identify_Active_Color
    input: Input grid
    output: Active_Color value (integer)
  - name: Identify_Target_Pixels
    input: Input grid, Active_Color
    output: List of coordinates [(r, c)] of Target_Pixels.
    description: Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the input grid. If input_grid[r, c] is the Active_Color, check its horizontal neighbors. If a neighbor (r, c-1) or (r, c+1) exists and its color in the input grid is white (0), add its coordinates to the list of Target_Pixels. Ensure uniqueness if a white pixel is adjacent to two active pixels.
  - name: Color_Target_Pixels
    input: Output grid, List of Target_Pixel coordinates, Active_Color
    description: For each coordinate (r, c) in the list of Target_Pixels, set the color of the output grid at output_grid[r, c] to the Active_Color.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
  - Identify the Active_Color from the input grid. If none exists, return the initial output grid.
  - Identify all Target_Pixels based on the input grid configuration (white pixels horizontally adjacent to any active pixel).
  - Perform the Color_Target_Pixels action on the output grid using the identified Target_Pixels and the Active_Color.
  - Return the final modified output grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input 2D grid (`input_grid`) and call it `output_grid`.
2.  **Find Active Color:** Scan the `input_grid` to find the single non-zero color value. Store it as `active_color`. If no `active_color` is found (the grid is all white), return the original `input_grid`.
3.  **Identify Pixels to Change:** Create an empty list called `pixels_to_color`. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`.
    *   If the color at `input_grid[r, c]` is equal to `active_color`:
        *   **Check Left Neighbor:** If `c > 0` (the cell is not in the first column) and the color at `input_grid[r, c-1]` is white (0), add the coordinates `(r, c-1)` to the `pixels_to_color` list.
        *   **Check Right Neighbor:** If `c < width - 1` (the cell is not in the last column) and the color at `input_grid[r, c+1]` is white (0), add the coordinates `(r, c+1)` to the `pixels_to_color` list.
4.  **Apply Changes:** Iterate through the unique coordinates `(r, c)` stored in the `pixels_to_color` list. For each coordinate, set the color of the corresponding cell in the `output_grid` to `active_color`. That is, `output_grid[r, c] = active_color`.
5.  **Return Result:** Return the modified `output_grid`.
