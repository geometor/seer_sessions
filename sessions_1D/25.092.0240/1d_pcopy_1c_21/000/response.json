The transformation specifically targets certain types of objects. In the input grids, there are two observed object shapes: single pixels and 1x3 horizontal lines. In the output grids, the single pixels are replaced by 1x3 horizontal lines of the same color, centered horizontally at the original pixel's location. The pre-existing 1x3 horizontal lines remain unchanged. The background color (white) is also unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
