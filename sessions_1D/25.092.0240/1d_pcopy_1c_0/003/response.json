Takes a 2D grid (list of lists) with shape 1xN as input.\n2. Initializes an output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3. Identifies the primary non-white color present in the input grid. If none exists, returns the copy.\n4. Iterates through each column index `c` of the input grid's single row (row 0).\n5. If a pixel at location (0, c) has the non-white color and both its left neighbor (if `c > 0`) and right neighbor (if `c < width-1`) are white (color 0), it is considered \"isolated\". Pixels at the edges are considered isolated if their single existing neighbor is white.\n6. For each isolated pixel found at location (0, c), the corresponding pixels at locations (0, c-1), (0, c), and (0, c+1) in the output grid are set to the non-white color (respecting grid boundaries).\n7. Pixels that are not part of an expansion or were already part of a non-white sequence retain their original color from the initial copy.\n8. Returns the modified output grid as a list of lists.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_non_white_color(grid_array):\n  \"\"\"Finds the first non-white color in the grid array.\"\"\"\n  # Find unique non-zero elements\n  unique_colors = np.unique(grid_array)\n  non_white_colors = unique_colors[unique_colors != 0]\n  if non_white_colors.size > 0:\n    return non_white_colors[0]\n  return None # Return None if grid is all white or empty\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the 1xN input grid.\n\n    Args:\n      input_grid: A list of lists representing the 1xN input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n      A list of lists representing the transformed 1xN output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert list of lists to numpy array for easier handling\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Handle empty input case (e.g., [[], []] or [])\n    if input_array.size == 0:\n        # Need to return structure consistent with input (list of lists)\n        # If input was [], return [].
