*   **Perception:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (or rows).
    *   Each grid contains mostly white pixels (0) and some pixels of a single non-white color (blue=1, green=3, or orange=7).
    *   The non-white pixels appear either as isolated single pixels or as contiguous horizontal lines of three pixels.
    *   In the output grid, the original lines of three non-white pixels are preserved.
    *   Each isolated non-white pixel in the input grid is expanded into a horizontal line of three pixels of the same color in the output grid. This expansion is centered on the original pixel's position, changing the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors (if they exist within the grid bounds) to the non-white color.
    *   White pixels remain white unless they are adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel and become part of the expanded 3-pixel line.

        b.  If it is `object_color`, check if its left neighbor (at `i-1`) and right neighbor (at `i+1`) are both white (color 0). Handle boundary conditions: if `i` is 0, consider the left neighbor condition met; if `i` is the last index, consider the right neighbor condition met.

*   **Assessment:**
    The initial analysis incorrectly assumed the input and output grids were 1-dimensional lists. The provided examples clearly show them as lists containing a single list, representing 2D grids with a height of 1 (1xN shape). The Python code failed because it attempted boolean comparisons on NumPy arrays derived from this 2D structure, leading to the "ambiguous truth value" error. The core logic of identifying an isolated non-white pixel and expanding it horizontally seems correct based on visual inspection, but the implementation must account for the 2D structure (accessing elements via `grid[0][index]`).

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Correct the understanding of the grid dimensionality (1xN, not 1D).
    2.  Use `tool_code` to verify the shape and contents of the examples.
    3.  Update the `facts` YAML to reflect the 2D structure and row/column indexing.
    4.  Refine the natural language program to use correct indexing terminology (e.g., `(0, i)`) and adjust boundary condition descriptions.
    5.  The subsequent coding phase will need to modify the array access logic (e.g., use `input_array[0, i]`) and potentially the `find_non_white_color` helper function to work with 2D arrays.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the 2D input grid (which has shape 1xN).
    2.  Determine the primary non-white color (`object_color`) present in the input grid. If no non-white color exists, return the copied grid.
    3.  Get the width of the grid (number of columns).
    4.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to `width - 1`.
    5.  For the cell at location `(0, c)` in the *input* grid:
        a.  Check if its color is `object_color`.
        b.  If it is `object_color`, determine if it is isolated:
            i.  Check the left neighbor: is `c == 0` (at the left edge) OR is the color at `(0, c-1)` white (0)?
            ii. Check the right neighbor: is `c == width - 1` (at the right edge) OR is the color at `(0, c+1)` white (0)?
        c.  If the cell at `(0, c)` is `object_color` AND both neighbor checks are true (meaning it's isolated), then modify the *output* grid:
            i.  Ensure the cell at `(0, c)` in the output grid has `object_color` (it should already from the copy).
            ii. If `c > 0` (not the first column), set the color of the cell at `(0, c-1)` in the output grid to `object_color`.
            iii. If `c < width - 1` (not the last column), set the color of the cell at `(0, c+1)` in the output grid to `object_color`.
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
