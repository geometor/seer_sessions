task_type: grid_transformation_2d
grid_dimensionality: 2
grid_shape: 1xN (height=1, variable width)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1, 3, or 7 in examples)
      - location: (row, column) or (0, c)
      - configuration:
          - isolated: white neighbors at (0, c-1) and (0, c+1), considering boundaries.
          - part_of_line: at least one neighbor at (0, c-1) or (0, c+1) has the same non-white color.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: (row, column) or (0, c)
actions:
  - name: expand_pixel_horizontally
    input: isolated non-white pixel at location (0, c)
    output: change pixels at locations (0, c-1), (0, c), (0, c+1) to the non-white color
    constraints: apply within grid column boundaries (0 to width-1)
  - name: copy_pixel
    input:
      - white pixel
      - non-white pixel that is part_of_line
    output: pixel with the same color at the same location
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels to the immediate left (0, c-1) and right (0, c+1) are relevant for determining if a pixel at (0, c) is isolated.
transformation_rule:
  - Identify the primary non-white color (C) in the input grid.
  - Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
  - Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to width-1 of the input grid's single row (row 0).
  - If the pixel at location (0, c) has color C:
      - Check its left neighbor: Is `c` equal to 0 OR is the color at (0, c-1) white (0)?
      - Check its right neighbor: Is `c` equal to width-1 OR is the color at (0, c+1) white (0)?
      - If both checks are true, the pixel at (0, c) is 'isolated'.
  - For each identified isolated pixel at location (0, c) with color C:
      - Set the pixel at location (0, c) in the output grid to C.
      - If c > 0, set the pixel at location (0, c-1) in the output grid to C.
      - If c < width - 1, set the pixel at location (0, c+1) in the output grid to C.
  - Pixels that are not isolated non-white pixels, and white pixels not overwritten by expansion, retain their original color in the output grid.
