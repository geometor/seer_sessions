*   **Assessment:**
    The initial analysis incorrectly assumed the input and output grids were 1-dimensional lists. The provided examples clearly show them as lists containing a single list, representing 2D grids with a height of 1 (1xN shape). The Python code failed because it attempted boolean comparisons on NumPy arrays derived from this 2D structure, leading to the "ambiguous truth value" error. The core logic of identifying an isolated non-white pixel and expanding it horizontally seems correct based on visual inspection, but the implementation must account for the 2D structure (accessing elements via `grid[0][index]`).

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Correct the understanding of the grid dimensionality (1xN, not 1D).
    2.  Use `tool_code` to verify the shape and contents of the examples.
    3.  Update the `facts` YAML to reflect the 2D structure and row/column indexing.
    4.  Refine the natural language program to use correct indexing terminology (e.g., `(0, i)`) and adjust boundary condition descriptions.
    5.  The subsequent coding phase will need to modify the array access logic (e.g., use `input_array[0, i]`) and potentially the `find_non_white_color` helper function to work with 2D arrays.

    description: Pixels to the immediate left (0, c-1) and right (0, c+1) are relevant for determining if a pixel at (0, c) is isolated.
transformation_rule:
  - Identify the primary non-white color (C) in the input grid.
  - Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
  - Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to width-1 of the input grid's single row (row 0).
  - If the pixel at location (0, c) has color C:
      - Check its left neighbor: Is `c` equal to 0 OR is the color at (0, c-1) white (0)?
      - Check its right neighbor: Is `c` equal to width-1 OR is the color at (0, c+1) white (0)?
      - If both checks are true, the pixel at (0, c) is 'isolated'.
  - For each identified isolated pixel at location (0, c) with color C:
      - Set the pixel at location (0, c) in the output grid to C.
      - If c > 0, set the pixel at location (0, c-1) in the output grid to C.
      - If c < width - 1, set the pixel at location (0, c+1) in the output grid to C.
  - Pixels that are not isolated non-white pixels, and white pixels not overwritten by expansion, retain their original color in the output grid.
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the 2D input grid (which has shape 1xN).
    2.  Determine the primary non-white color (`object_color`) present in the input grid. If no non-white color exists, return the copied grid.
    3.  Get the width of the grid (number of columns).
    4.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to `width - 1`.
    5.  For the cell at location `(0, c)` in the *input* grid:
        a.  Check if its color is `object_color`.
        b.  If it is `object_color`, determine if it is isolated:
            i.  Check the left neighbor: is `c == 0` (at the left edge) OR is the color at `(0, c-1)` white (0)?
            ii. Check the right neighbor: is `c == width - 1` (at the right edge) OR is the color at `(0, c+1)` white (0)?
        c.  If the cell at `(0, c)` is `object_color` AND both neighbor checks are true (meaning it's isolated), then modify the *output* grid:
            i.  Ensure the cell at `(0, c)` in the output grid has `object_color` (it should already from the copy).
            ii. If `c > 0` (not the first column), set the color of the cell at `(0, c-1)` in the output grid to `object_color`.
            iii. If `c < width - 1` (not the last column), set the color of the cell at `(0, c+1)` in the output grid to `object_color`.
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
