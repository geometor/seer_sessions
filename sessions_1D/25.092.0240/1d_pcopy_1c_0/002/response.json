            "text": "*   **Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis incorrectly assumed the input and output grids were 1-dimensional lists. The provided examples clearly show them as lists containing a single list, representing 2D grids with a height of 1 (1xN shape). The Python code failed because it attempted boolean comparisons on NumPy arrays derived from this 2D structure, leading to the \"ambiguous truth value\" error. The core logic of identifying an isolated non-white pixel and expanding it horizontally seems correct based on visual inspection, but the implementation must account for the 2D structure (accessing elements via `grid[0][index]`).\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Correct the understanding of the grid dimensionality (1xN, not 1D).\n    2.  Use `tool_code` to verify the shape and contents of the examples.\n    3.  Update the `facts` YAML to reflect the 2D structure and row/column indexing.\n    4.  Refine the natural language program to use correct indexing terminology (e.g., `(0, i)`) and adjust boundary condition descriptions.\n    5.  The subsequent coding phase will need to modify the array access logic (e.g., use `input_array[0, i]`) and potentially the `find_non_white_color` helper function to work with 2D arrays.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n"
