"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by expanding isolated non-white pixels into 3-pixel horizontal lines.

Specifically:
1. Copies the input grid to an output grid.
2. Identifies the primary non-white color present in the input.
3. Iterates through the input grid.
4. If a pixel has the non-white color and both its left and right neighbors are white (or are outside the grid boundaries), it is considered "isolated".
5. For each isolated pixel found at index i, the corresponding pixels at indices i-1, i, and i+1 in the output grid are set to the non-white color (respecting grid boundaries).
6. Pixels that are not part of an expansion or were already part of a non-white sequence remain unchanged from the initial copy.
