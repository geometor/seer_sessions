This expansion is centered on the original pixel's position, changing the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors (if they exist within the grid bounds) to the non-white color.\n    *   White pixels remain white unless they are adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel and become part of the expanded 3-pixel line.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
