*   **Perception:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (or rows).
    *   Each grid contains mostly white pixels (0) and some pixels of a single non-white color (blue=1, green=3, or orange=7).
    *   The non-white pixels appear either as isolated single pixels or as contiguous horizontal lines of three pixels.
    *   In the output grid, the original lines of three non-white pixels are preserved.
    *   Each isolated non-white pixel in the input grid is expanded into a horizontal line of three pixels of the same color in the output grid. This expansion is centered on the original pixel's position, changing the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors (if they exist within the grid bounds) to the non-white color.
    *   White pixels remain white unless they are adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel and become part of the expanded 3-pixel line.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation_1d
    grid_dimensionality: 1
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: non-white (1, 3, or 7 in examples)
          - configuration: 
              - isolated (white neighbors on both sides)
              - part_of_line (at least one neighbor has the same non-white color)
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
    actions:
      - name: expand_pixel
        input: isolated non-white pixel at index i
        output: change pixels at indices i-1, i, i+1 to the non-white color
        constraints: apply within grid boundaries
      - name: copy_pixel
        input: 
          - white pixel
          - non-white pixel that is part_of_line
        output: pixel with the same color at the same index
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Pixels to the immediate left and right (index i-1 and i+1) are relevant for determining if a pixel is isolated.
    transformation_rule:
      - Identify the primary non-white color (C).
      - Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
      - Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at index i.
      - If the pixel at index i has color C and its neighbors at i-1 and i+1 (within bounds) are white (0), then it's an 'isolated pixel'.
      - For each identified isolated pixel at index i with color C:
          - Set the pixel at index i in the output grid to C.
          - If i > 0, set the pixel at index i-1 in the output grid to C.
          - If i < grid_length - 1, set the pixel at index i+1 in the output grid to C.
      - Pixels that are not isolated non-white pixels, and white pixels not overwritten by expansion, retain their original color in the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Determine the primary non-white color (let's call it `object_color`) present in the input grid.
    3.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid using its index `i`.
    4.  For each cell at index `i`:
        a.  Check if the color of the cell is `object_color`.
        b.  If it is `object_color`, check if its left neighbor (at `i-1`) and right neighbor (at `i+1`) are both white (color 0). Handle boundary conditions: if `i` is 0, consider the left neighbor condition met; if `i` is the last index, consider the right neighbor condition met.
        c.  If both neighbors are white (meaning the pixel at `i` is isolated), then modify the *output* grid:
            i.  Set the color of the cell at index `i` in the output grid to `object_color`.
            ii. If `i > 0`, set the color of the cell at index `i-1` in the output grid to `object_color`.
            iii. If `i` is not the last index, set the color of the cell at index `i+1` in the output grid to `object_color`.
    5.  Return the modified output grid.
