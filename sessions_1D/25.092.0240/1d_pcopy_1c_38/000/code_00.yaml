objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: occupies most of the grid initially.
  - type: shape
    color: non-white (e.g., green=3, gray=5) - consistent within each example.
    property: forms a single connected component.
    location: occupies a specific region within the grid.
actions:
  - action: identify_object
    target: the non-white shape
  - action: determine_bounding_box
    target: the identified non-white shape
    result: coordinates of the minimum and maximum rows and columns containing the shape.
  - action: fill_region
    target: the area within the determined bounding box
    color: the color of the identified non-white shape
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of the non-white shape.
  - type: transformation
    input_object: non-white shape
    output_object: a filled rectangle (with the shape's color) corresponding to the input shape's bounding box.
    background: remains unchanged outside the bounding box.
