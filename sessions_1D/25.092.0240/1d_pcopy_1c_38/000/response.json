In the examples, these shapes resemble 'L' formations of varying sizes.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original white background pixels. The area corresponding to the non-white shape in the input is transformed.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the non-white shape, determines its minimal bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing all its pixels), and then fills this entire bounding box with the color of the original shape. Pixels outside this bounding box remain unchanged.\n5.  **Color Preservation:** The color of the shape in the input is the same color used to fill the bounding box in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Find the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) among all pixels identified in step 1. These coordinates define the bounding box of the non-white shape.\n3.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid. This will be the output grid.\n4.  Iterate through all grid cells within the bounding box (from `min_row` to `max_row` and `min_col` to `max_col`).\n5.  For each cell within this bounding box, set its color in the output grid to `object_color`.\n6.  The resulting grid is the final output."
