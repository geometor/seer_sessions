Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0) and a single connected shape made of a non-white color (green=3 or gray=5).
2.  **Object Identification:** The non-white shape appears to be the primary object of interest. In the examples, these shapes resemble 'L' formations of varying sizes.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original white background pixels. The area corresponding to the non-white shape in the input is transformed.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the non-white shape, determines its minimal bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing all its pixels), and then fills this entire bounding box with the color of the original shape. Pixels outside this bounding box remain unchanged.
5.  **Color Preservation:** The color of the shape in the input is the same color used to fill the bounding box in the output.

**Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: occupies most of the grid initially.
  - type: shape
    color: non-white (e.g., green=3, gray=5) - consistent within each example.
    property: forms a single connected component.
    location: occupies a specific region within the grid.
actions:
  - action: identify_object
    target: the non-white shape
  - action: determine_bounding_box
    target: the identified non-white shape
    result: coordinates of the minimum and maximum rows and columns containing the shape.
  - action: fill_region
    target: the area within the determined bounding box
    color: the color of the identified non-white shape
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of the non-white shape.
  - type: transformation
    input_object: non-white shape
    output_object: a filled rectangle (with the shape's color) corresponding to the input shape's bounding box.
    background: remains unchanged outside the bounding box.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). Record their color (let's call it `object_color`).
2.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) among all pixels identified in step 1. These coordinates define the bounding box of the non-white shape.
3.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid. This will be the output grid.
4.  Iterate through all grid cells within the bounding box (from `min_row` to `max_row` and `min_col` to `max_col`).
5.  For each cell within this bounding box, set its color in the output grid to `object_color`.
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
