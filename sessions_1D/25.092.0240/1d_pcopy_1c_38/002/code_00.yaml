objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: occupies most cells initially.
  - type: pixel_sequence
    color: non-white (e.g., green=3, gray=5) - consistent within each example.
    property: forms horizontal sequences of varying lengths (1 or 3 pixels in inputs).
    location: specific cells within the single row of the grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_object_pixels
    target: all non-white pixels
    result: list of coordinates and the object_color.
  - action: identify_isolated_pixels
    target: non-white pixels identified previously
    condition: a pixel `(r, c)` is isolated if its horizontal neighbors `(r, c-1)` and `(r, c+1)` (within grid bounds) are NOT the object_color.
    result: list of coordinates of isolated pixels.
  - action: expand_isolated_pixels
    target: the grid cells horizontally adjacent to each isolated pixel.
    effect: change the color of the left neighbor `(r, c-1)` and the right neighbor `(r, c+1)` of each isolated pixel `(r, c)` to the object_color. This is performed on a copy of the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The transformation focuses on the immediate horizontal neighbors of specific non-white pixels.
  - type: conditional_transformation
    condition: Applies only to non-white pixels that lack neighbors of the same color on *both* the left and right sides horizontally.
    input_object: isolated non-white pixel at (r, c)
    output_change: pixels at (r, c-1) and (r, c+1) become the object_color.
    invariance: Pixels not adjacent to isolated pixels, and pixels already part of a 3-block horizontal sequence, remain unchanged. The isolated pixel itself also remains unchanged.

assumptions:
  - The input grid consists of a single row. (This holds for all training examples).
  - There is only one non-white color present in the input grid.
  - The expansion only happens horizontally.
