**General Assessment**

The initial "fill bounding box" hypothesis was incorrect. Analyzing the discrepancies between the actual and expected outputs for all three training examples revealed a different pattern. The transformation seems to target specific non-white pixels based on their immediate horizontal neighbors and expands them into a 3-pixel horizontal line. The provided code execution results strongly support this revised hypothesis.

**Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location: occupies most cells initially.
  - type: pixel_sequence
    color: non-white (e.g., green=3, gray=5) - consistent within each example.
    property: forms horizontal sequences of varying lengths (1 or 3 pixels in inputs).
    location: specific cells within the single row of the grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_object_pixels
    target: all non-white pixels
    result: list of coordinates and the object_color.
  - action: identify_isolated_pixels
    target: non-white pixels identified previously
    condition: a pixel `(r, c)` is isolated if its horizontal neighbors `(r, c-1)` and `(r, c+1)` (within grid bounds) are NOT the object_color.
    result: list of coordinates of isolated pixels.
  - action: expand_isolated_pixels
    target: the grid cells horizontally adjacent to each isolated pixel.
    effect: change the color of the left neighbor `(r, c-1)` and the right neighbor `(r, c+1)` of each isolated pixel `(r, c)` to the object_color. This is performed on a copy of the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The transformation focuses on the immediate horizontal neighbors of specific non-white pixels.
  - type: conditional_transformation
    condition: Applies only to non-white pixels that lack neighbors of the same color on *both* the left and right sides horizontally.
    input_object: isolated non-white pixel at (r, c)
    output_change: pixels at (r, c-1) and (r, c+1) become the object_color.
    invariance: Pixels not adjacent to isolated pixels, and pixels already part of a 3-block horizontal sequence, remain unchanged. The isolated pixel itself also remains unchanged.

assumptions:
  - The input grid consists of a single row. (This holds for all training examples).
  - There is only one non-white color present in the input grid.
  - The expansion only happens horizontally.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid (`object_color`).
3.  Find all pixels in the input grid that have the `object_color`.
4.  For each such pixel at coordinate `(row, col)`:
    a.  Check its left neighbor at `(row, col-1)`. Does it exist (i.e., `col > 0`) and does it have the `object_color`?
    b.  Check its right neighbor at `(row, col+1)`. Does it exist (i.e., `col < width-1`) and does it have the `object_color`?
    c.  If *neither* the left neighbor *nor* the right neighbor has the `object_color` (considering boundary conditions where a neighbor might not exist), then this pixel at `(row, col)` is considered "isolated".
5.  For each "isolated" pixel identified in step 4 at `(row, col)`:
    a.  If the left neighbor `(row, col-1)` exists, change its color in the output grid to `object_color`.
    b.  If the right neighbor `(row, col+1)` exists, change its color in the output grid to `object_color`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
