"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying 'isolated' non-white pixels and 
expanding them horizontally. An isolated pixel is defined as a non-white 
pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors (if they exist within the 
grid boundaries) are not of the same non-white color. For each isolated 
pixel found in the input grid, its immediate left and right neighbors 
(if they exist) are colored with the isolated pixel's color in the output grid. 
All other pixels retain their original color from the input grid. Assumes 
only one non-white color exists per grid and the grid is effectively 1D 
(single row) based on examples.
