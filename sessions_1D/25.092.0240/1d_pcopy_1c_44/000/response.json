Some blocks consist of a single colored pixel, while others consist of multiple adjacent colored pixels. The transformation rule depends on the size of these colored blocks. Single colored pixels in the input are expanded into a block of three pixels of the same color in the output, centered at the original pixel's position. Blocks containing more than one colored pixel are copied directly to the output without modification. The background remains white except where replaced by the expansion of single colored pixels.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
