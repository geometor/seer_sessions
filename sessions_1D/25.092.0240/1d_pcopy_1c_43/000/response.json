Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first contiguous horizontal sequence of identical non-white pixels with a length greater than 1.

Check if the pixel at index `i` in the input grid meets the following criteria:\n        *   It is a non-white pixel.\n        *   Its color matches the pattern color C.\n        *   It forms a sequence of length 1 (i.e., the pixel to its left, if it exists, is different, and the pixel to its right, if it exists, is different or the grid ends).\n    5.  If all criteria are met, modify the output grid by placing the pattern sequence (color C, length L) starting at index `i` and extending to index `i + L - 1`. These pixels in the output grid are set to color C, overwriting their previous values.\n    6.  After checking all pixel positions, the modified output grid is the final result."
