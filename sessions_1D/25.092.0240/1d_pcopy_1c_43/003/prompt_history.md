*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output are 1D arrays or single-row grids of pixels.
    *   The primary elements are horizontal sequences (contiguous blocks) of identical non-white pixels, separated by white pixels (0).
    *   Each example contains at least one sequence longer than one pixel and one or more sequences of exactly one pixel.
    *   The transformation involves identifying a "pattern" sequence (the first encountered sequence longer than one pixel) and replacing single-pixel sequences of the *same color* with a copy of this pattern sequence.
    *   The replacement starts at the position of the single pixel and extends to the right, overwriting any existing pixels in that range.
    *   Pixels not part of a single-pixel sequence being replaced are copied directly from the input to the output.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: pattern_replacement
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (or single row 2D)
    objects:
      - type: sequence
        description: Contiguous horizontal block of identical non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - color: The color (1-9) of the pixels in the sequence.
          - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
          - position: The starting index (column) of the sequence.
    pattern_object:
      description: The first identified sequence with length > 1.
      identified_by: Scanning left-to-right.
      properties:
        - pattern_color: The color of the pattern object.
        - pattern_length: The length of the pattern object.
    target_objects:
      description: Sequences with length = 1.
      identified_by: Scanning the entire input.
    action:
      type: replace
      condition: A target object's color matches the pattern_color.
      mechanism: Replace the target object (single pixel) with a sequence identical to the pattern object (same color, same length), starting at the target object's position and extending rightwards.
    background:
      color: white (0)
      behavior: Generally preserved, unless overwritten by a replacement action.
    output_generation:
      - Initialize output as a copy of the input.
      - Identify the pattern object (color C, length L).
      - Iterate through the input grid.
      - If a single pixel of color C is found at index i:
          - Replace pixels in the output grid from index i to i + L - 1 with color C.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first contiguous horizontal sequence of identical non-white pixels with a length greater than 1. Store the color (C) and length (L) of this sequence as the "pattern". If no such sequence exists, the output is identical to the input.
    3.  Iterate through each pixel position (index `i`) in the input grid.
    4.  Check if the pixel at index `i` in the input grid meets the following criteria:
        *   It is a non-white pixel.
        *   Its color matches the pattern color C.
        *   It forms a sequence of length 1 (i.e., the pixel to its left, if it exists, is different, and the pixel to its right, if it exists, is different or the grid ends).
    5.  If all criteria are met, modify the output grid by placing the pattern sequence (color C, length L) starting at index `i` and extending to index `i + L - 1`. These pixels in the output grid are set to color C, overwriting their previous values.
    6.  After checking all pixel positions, the modified output grid is the final result.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core task: finding a pattern (the first sequence longer than one pixel) and replacing single pixels of the same color with that pattern. However, the comparison between the previous code's output and the expected output revealed a consistent off-by-one error in the placement of the replacement pattern. The expected outputs show the pattern being placed starting *one position to the left* of the identified single target pixel, whereas the previous code placed it starting *at* the target pixel's position.

The strategy is to refine the understanding of the replacement action. We need to precisely define the starting position for inserting the pattern relative to the target pixel's index.

```
*   **Example 1:** Pattern is `2 2 2` (color 2, length 3). Targets are single `2`s at indices 8, 14, 18. The replacements in the output start at indices 7, 13, 17 respectively (target_index - 1).
*   **Example 2:** Pattern is `5 5 5` (color 5, length 3). Target is single `5` at index 7. The replacement in the output starts at index 6 (target_index - 1).
*   **Example 3:** Pattern is `9 9 9` (color 9, length 3). Targets are single `9`s at indices 7, 13. The replacements in the output start at indices 6, 12 respectively (target_index - 1).

**Conclusion:** The pattern replacement consistently starts at the index immediately preceding the target single pixel (`index - 1`). If the target pixel is at index 0, the replacement presumably starts at index 0 (though this case is not present in the examples).

## Updated YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: pattern_replacement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or single row 2D)
objects:
  - type: sequence
    description: Contiguous horizontal block of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color (1-9) of the pixels in the sequence.
      - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      - position: The starting index (column) of the sequence.
pattern_object:
  description: The first identified sequence with length > 1 when scanning left-to-right.
  identified_by: Scanning left-to-right.
  properties:
    - pattern_color: The color (C) of the pattern object.
    - pattern_length: The length (L) of the pattern object.
target_objects:
  description: Pixels with color C that form a sequence of length = 1.
  identified_by: Scanning the entire input grid.
  properties:
    - target_color: Must match pattern_color (C).
    - target_index: The index (i) of the single pixel.
    - condition: Pixel at i-1 (if exists) has color != C, and pixel at i+1 (if exists) has color != C.
action:
  type: replace
  condition: A target object (single pixel of color C at index i) is found.
  mechanism: >
    Replace a segment in the output grid with the pattern sequence 
    (color C, length L). The replacement segment starts at index max(0, i - 1) 
    and ends at index max(0, i - 1) + L - 1 (clipped by grid boundary).
background:
  color: white (0)
  behavior: Preserved, unless overwritten by a replacement action.
output_generation:
  - Initialize output as a copy of the input.
  - Identify the pattern object (color C, length L). If none, return copy.
  - Iterate through the input grid to find target objects (single pixels of color C at index i).
  - For each target object found at index i:
      - Calculate the start position for replacement: `start_pos = max(0, i - 1)`.
      - Calculate the end position for replacement (exclusive): `end_pos = min(grid_width, start_pos + L)`.
      - Modify the output grid: set pixels from `start_pos` to `end_pos - 1` to color C.
```


## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid. Let the width of the grid be `W`.
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first contiguous horizontal sequence of identical non-white pixels with a length greater than 1. Store the color (C) and length (L) of this sequence as the "pattern". If no such sequence exists, return the initial output grid (the copy of the input).
3.  Iterate through each pixel position (index `i`, from 0 to `W-1`) in the *input* grid.
4.  Check if the pixel at index `i` in the input grid is a "target":
    *   It has the pattern color C.
    *   It forms a sequence of length 1:
        *   The pixel at `i-1` (if `i > 0`) has a color different from C.
        *   The pixel at `i+1` (if `i < W-1`) has a color different from C.
5.  If a target pixel is found at index `i`:
    *   Determine the starting index for the replacement in the *output* grid: `start_index = max(0, i - 1)`.
    *   Determine the ending index (exclusive) for the replacement: `end_index = min(W, start_index + L)`.
    *   Modify the output grid: Set all pixels from `start_index` up to (but not including) `end_index` to the pattern color C.
6.  After checking all potential target pixel positions in the input grid, return the modified output grid.
