"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on a pattern replacement rule.

1.  Identify the "pattern": Find the first contiguous horizontal sequence of 
    identical non-white pixels (color C) with a length (L) greater than 1, 
    scanning from left to right.
2.  If no such pattern exists, return the input grid unchanged.
3.  Identify "target" pixels: Locate all single pixels in the input grid 
    that have the same color (C) as the pattern. A pixel is considered single 
    if it's not adjacent (horizontally) to another pixel of the same color.
4.  Replace targets: For each target pixel found at index 'i', replace the 
    segment of the grid from index 'i' up to 'i + L - 1' (or the end of the 
    grid, whichever comes first) with the pattern color (C). This replacement 
    happens on a copy of the input grid.
5.  Return the modified grid.
