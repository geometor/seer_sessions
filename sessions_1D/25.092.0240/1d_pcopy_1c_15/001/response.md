"""
Transforms the input grid by expanding single gray pixels (5) horizontally into segments of three gray pixels, provided the single gray pixel is surrounded by white pixels (0) on both its immediate left and right.

The transformation rule targets single gray pixels that have white pixels immediately to their left and right in the input grid. It then changes the color of these adjacent white neighbors to gray in the output grid, effectively creating a horizontal segment of three gray pixels centered at the original position. Gray pixels already part of a longer segment or not flanked by white pixels remain unchanged. White pixels not adjacent to an isolated gray pixel also remain unchanged. The transformation requires neighbors on both sides, so pixels at the horizontal edges are not affected.
