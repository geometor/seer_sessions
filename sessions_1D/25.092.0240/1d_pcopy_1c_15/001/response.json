It then changes the color of these adjacent white neighbors to gray in the output grid, effectively creating a horizontal segment of three gray pixels centered at the original position. Gray pixels already part of a longer segment or not flanked by white pixels remain unchanged. White pixels not adjacent to an isolated gray pixel also remain unchanged. The transformation requires neighbors on both sides, so pixels at the horizontal edges are not affected.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.ndarray): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array if necessary\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    # Modifications will be made directly on this copy\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each row of the grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        # Iterate through each column, excluding the first and last columns\n        # as they cannot have both left and right neighbors\n        for c in range(1, width - 1):\n            # Check the condition: current pixel is gray (5)\n            is_gray = input_grid[r, c] == 5\n            # Check the condition: left neighbor is white (0)\n            left_is_white = input_grid[r, c - 1] == 0\n            # Check the condition: right neighbor is white (0)\n            right_is_white = input_grid[r, c + 1] == 0\n\n            # If all conditions are met (gray pixel flanked by white pixels)\n            if is_gray and left_is_white and right_is_white:\n                # Change the left neighbor to gray in the output grid\n                output_grid[r, c - 1] = 5\n                # Change the right neighbor to gray in the output grid\n                output_grid[r, c + 1] = 5\n                # The central pixel (r, c) is already gray and remains gray in the output_grid\n\n    # Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid.tolist() # Return as list of lists as per ARC standard\n```"
