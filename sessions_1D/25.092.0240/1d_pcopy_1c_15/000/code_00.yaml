grid_dimensions:
  - type: 1D array (single row)
  - input_size_equals_output_size: true
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - gray (5)
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segments of gray pixels
  - specific_forms_in_input:
    - single gray pixel surrounded by white pixels (e.g., `0 5 0`)
    - segment of three gray pixels (e.g., `5 5 5`)
transformation_rule:
  - target: single gray pixels that have white pixels immediately to their left and right
  - action: expand the single gray pixel into a group of three horizontal gray pixels
  - mechanism: change the color of the immediate left and right white neighbors of the target gray pixel to gray
  - invariant: gray pixels that are already part of a horizontal segment of length 3 or more, or that do not have white pixels on both sides, remain unchanged. White pixels not adjacent to an isolated gray pixel remain unchanged.
boundary_conditions:
  - based on examples, the transformation requires a white pixel on *both* sides, implying gray pixels at the horizontal edges (column 0 or column width-1) would not be transformed by this rule, even if their single neighbor is white.
