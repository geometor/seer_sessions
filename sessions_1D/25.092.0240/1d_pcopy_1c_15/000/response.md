Okay, let's break down the transformation in this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples provided appear to be single-row grids (1xN).
2.  **Colors Involved:** The grids use only white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
3.  **Input vs. Output:** The output grid is the same size as the input grid. The white pixels generally remain white. The key change involves the gray pixels.
4.  **Gray Pixel Behavior:**
    *   In the input, there are groups of three consecutive gray pixels (`5 5 5`) and single, isolated gray pixels (`0 5 0`).
    *   In the output, the groups of three consecutive gray pixels from the input seem unchanged.
    *   The single, isolated gray pixels in the input (`0 5 0`) are transformed into groups of three consecutive gray pixels (`5 5 5`) in the output, centered at the original position of the single gray pixel. The transformation effectively changes the white neighbors of the isolated gray pixel into gray pixels.

**Facts**


```yaml
grid_dimensions:
  - type: 1D array (single row)
  - input_size_equals_output_size: true
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - gray (5)
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segments of gray pixels
  - specific_forms_in_input:
    - single gray pixel surrounded by white pixels (e.g., `0 5 0`)
    - segment of three gray pixels (e.g., `5 5 5`)
transformation_rule:
  - target: single gray pixels that have white pixels immediately to their left and right
  - action: expand the single gray pixel into a group of three horizontal gray pixels
  - mechanism: change the color of the immediate left and right white neighbors of the target gray pixel to gray
  - invariant: gray pixels that are already part of a horizontal segment of length 3 or more, or that do not have white pixels on both sides, remain unchanged. White pixels not adjacent to an isolated gray pixel remain unchanged.
boundary_conditions:
  - based on examples, the transformation requires a white pixel on *both* sides, implying gray pixels at the horizontal edges (column 0 or column width-1) would not be transformed by this rule, even if their single neighbor is white.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid, checking its column index `c` (from 1 to width-2, as edge pixels cannot have neighbors on both sides).
3.  For each pixel at index `c`:
    a.  Check if the pixel at `c` in the *input* grid is gray (5).
    b.  Check if the pixel at `c-1` (left neighbor) in the *input* grid is white (0).
    c.  Check if the pixel at `c+1` (right neighbor) in the *input* grid is white (0).
4.  If all three conditions (3a, 3b, 3c) are true, then modify the *output* grid:
    a.  Set the pixel at index `c-1` in the *output* grid to gray (5).
    b.  Set the pixel at index `c+1` in the *output* grid to gray (5).
    (The pixel at index `c` is already gray and remains gray).
5.  After checking all applicable pixels in the input grid, return the final output grid.
