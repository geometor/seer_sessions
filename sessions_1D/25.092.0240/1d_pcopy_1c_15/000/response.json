The white pixels generally remain white. The key change involves the gray pixels.\n4.  **Gray Pixel Behavior:**\n    *   In the input, there are groups of three consecutive gray pixels (`5 5 5`) and single, isolated gray pixels (`0 5 0`).\n    *   In the output, the groups of three consecutive gray pixels from the input seem unchanged.\n    *   The single, isolated gray pixels in the input (`0 5 0`) are transformed into groups of three consecutive gray pixels (`5 5 5`) in the output, centered at the original position of the single gray pixel. The transformation effectively changes the white neighbors of the isolated gray pixel into gray pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Check if the pixel at `c+1` (right neighbor) in the *input* grid is white (0).\n4.  If all three conditions (3a, 3b, 3c) are true, then modify the *output* grid:\n    a.  Set the pixel at index `c-1` in the *output* grid to gray (5).\n    b.  Set the pixel at index `c+1` in the *output* grid to gray (5).\n    (The pixel at index `c` is already gray and remains gray).\n5.  After checking all applicable pixels in the input grid, return the final output grid."
