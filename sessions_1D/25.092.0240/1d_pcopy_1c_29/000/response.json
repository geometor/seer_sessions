They contain integer values representing colors, with 0 being the dominant background color (white).\n2.  **Colors**: Each example uses only two colors: white (0) and one other color (orange '7', maroon '9', or blue '1').\n3.  **Structure**: The non-white colors appear in blocks or as single isolated pixels within the white background.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation seems to involve expanding isolated, single non-white pixels. Blocks of three or more identical non-white pixels appear unchanged.\n5.  **Locality**: The change applied to a pixel seems dependent only on its immediate neighbours. Specifically, a single non-white pixel expands if it's flanked by white pixels on both sides.\n6.  **Expansion Rule**: When a single non-white pixel `C` is found between two white pixels (`0 C 0`), this triplet is replaced by `C C C`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

At each index `i`, examine the triplet of values: `input[i-1]`, `input[i]`, `input[i+1]`.\n4.  Let the color at `input[i]` be `C`.\n5.

If the condition in step 5 is not met, the value at `output[i]` remains unchanged from the initial copy (i.e., `output[i] = input[i]`). Note: Since we iterate up to index `length - 2`, the last element `output[length-1]` will also correctly retain its input value by default, as will the first element `output[0]`.\n8.
