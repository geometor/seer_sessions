Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format**: The inputs and outputs are presented as 1D arrays (or grids with a height of 1). They contain integer values representing colors, with 0 being the dominant background color (white).
2.  **Colors**: Each example uses only two colors: white (0) and one other color (orange '7', maroon '9', or blue '1').
3.  **Structure**: The non-white colors appear in blocks or as single isolated pixels within the white background.
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation seems to involve expanding isolated, single non-white pixels. Blocks of three or more identical non-white pixels appear unchanged.
5.  **Locality**: The change applied to a pixel seems dependent only on its immediate neighbours. Specifically, a single non-white pixel expands if it's flanked by white pixels on both sides.
6.  **Expansion Rule**: When a single non-white pixel `C` is found between two white pixels (`0 C 0`), this triplet is replaced by `C C C`.

## Facts


```yaml
InputDescription:
  type: 1D array (or 1xN grid)
  elements: integers 0-9 representing colors
  structure: contains a background color (0) and sequences of one other color (C)

OutputDescription:
  type: 1D array (or 1xN grid)
  elements: integers 0-9 representing colors
  structure: modified version of the input array

Objects:
  - name: background_pixel
    properties:
      color: 0 (white)
  - name: foreground_pixel
    properties:
      color: C (non-zero)
      is_isolated: boolean (true if neighbours are background_pixel)
  - name: foreground_block
    properties:
      color: C (non-zero)
      length: integer >= 1

Relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally in the 1D array.
  - type: pattern
    description: A specific sequence of three adjacent pixels `(pixel[i-1], pixel[i], pixel[i+1])`.

Actions:
  - name: identify_pattern
    input: input array
    output: list of indices `i` where the pattern `(0, C, 0)` occurs (C != 0).
  - name: expand_pixel
    input: index `i` identified by identify_pattern
    output: modifies the array segment around `i` from `(0, C, 0)` to `(C, C, C)`.
  - name: copy_pixel
    input: pixel value and index
    output: places the pixel value at the same index in the output array if no expansion applies.

TransformationRule:
  - Iterate through the input array from the second element to the second-to-last element.
  - For each element at index `i`:
    - Check if its value `C` is non-zero (foreground_pixel).
    - Check if the element at `i-1` is zero (background_pixel).
    - Check if the element at `i+1` is zero (background_pixel).
    - If all conditions are true, this pixel is part of the pattern `0 C 0`. Mark indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to be changed to color `C` in the output.
  - Construct the output array by copying the input array initially.
  - Apply the marked changes to the output array. Pixels not marked for change retain their original input value.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the initial output array.
2.  Iterate through the input array from the second position (index 1) up to, but not including, the last position (index `length - 1`). Let the current index be `i`.
3.  At each index `i`, examine the triplet of values: `input[i-1]`, `input[i]`, `input[i+1]`.
4.  Let the color at `input[i]` be `C`.
5.  If `input[i-1]` is white (0), `C` is not white (non-zero), AND `input[i+1]` is white (0), then this is an isolated foreground pixel.
6.  If the condition in step 5 is met, modify the output array by setting the values at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `C`.
7.  If the condition in step 5 is not met, the value at `output[i]` remains unchanged from the initial copy (i.e., `output[i] = input[i]`). Note: Since we iterate up to index `length - 2`, the last element `output[length-1]` will also correctly retain its input value by default, as will the first element `output[0]`.
8.  Return the modified output array.
