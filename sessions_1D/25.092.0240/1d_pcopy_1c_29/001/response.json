It scans the array\nfor a specific pattern: a non-background (non-zero) pixel `C` surrounded by \nbackground (zero) pixels on both its immediate left and right (`0 C 0`). \nWhen this pattern is found, the triplet `0 C 0` in the output grid is replaced \nby `C C C`, effectively expanding the isolated pixel into a block of three. \nPixels not part of this specific pattern are copied directly from the input to \nthe output. The scan happens from the second element to the second-to-last \nelement to allow checking neighbors.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the isolated pixel expansion transformation.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid (expected 1xN).\n\n    Returns:\n        A 2D numpy array representing the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Ensure input is a 2D numpy array\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, np.ndarray) or input_grid.ndim != 2:\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a 2D numpy array.\")\n\n    # Based on examples, this task operates on 1xN grids.\n    # Add a check or assertion if the transformation is strictly for 1xN grids.\n    if input_grid.shape[0] != 1:\n         # If not 1xN, the logic might need adjustment or clarification.\n         # For now, proceed assuming 1xN based on training examples.\n         pass # Or raise ValueError(\"Input grid must have exactly one row.\")\n\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through the columns of the grid.\n    # We need to check neighbors, so we skip the first (index 0) and \n    # the last (index width-1) columns.\n    # The loop range goes up to width-1 (exclusive), so the last index checked is width-2.\n    # This ensures input_grid[0, col+1] is always valid.\n    for col in range(1, width - 1):\n        # Get the color of the current pixel and its immediate horizontal neighbors\n        # Since we assume a 1xN grid, the row index is always 0.\n        left_pixel_color = input_grid[0, col - 1]\n        current_pixel_color = input_grid[0, col]\n        right_pixel_color = input_grid[0, col + 1]\n\n        # Check for the pattern: Background - Non-Background - Background (0 C 0 where C != 0)\n        if left_pixel_color == 0 and current_pixel_color != 0 and right_pixel_color == 0:\n            # If the pattern is found, expand the non-background pixel in the output grid.\n            # Change the left, current, and right pixels in the output to the current pixel's color.\n            output_grid[0, col - 1] = current_pixel_color\n            output_grid[0, col] = current_pixel_color\n            output_grid[0, col + 1] = current_pixel_color\n            \n            # Note: We modify the output_grid, not the input_grid. \n            # The checks in subsequent iterations still use the original input_grid values.\n\n    # Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid\n\n```"
