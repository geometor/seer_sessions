*   **Perception:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (represented as 1xN arrays).
    *   The grids contain a white background (color 0) and segments of non-white pixels.
    *   In the examples, the non-white colors are magenta (6), yellow (4), and red (2).
    *   The non-white segments in the inputs are either single pixels (size 1) or three contiguous pixels (size 3).
    *   The transformation specifically modifies the single-pixel segments.
    *   Single pixels of a specific color in the input are replaced by a three-pixel segment of the same color in the output. This three-pixel segment is centered horizontally at the position of the original single pixel.
    *   Three-pixel segments in the input remain unchanged in the output.

*   **Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    2.  For each identified segment:
        a.  Determine its color and size (number of pixels).
        b.  If the segment size is 1:
            i.  Note its color and its position (index).
            ii. In the output grid, place a new horizontal segment of size 3, using the noted color.
            iii. Center this new segment at the index of the original single pixel. Ensure the placement respects grid boundaries (although not shown in examples, it's a good practice).
        c.  If the segment size is 3 (or any size other than 1):
            i. Copy the segment unchanged to the corresponding position in the output grid.
    3.  Ensure all background (white) pixels remain white in the output grid unless overwritten by an expanded segment.
    4.  The final grid, after processing all segments, is the output.
