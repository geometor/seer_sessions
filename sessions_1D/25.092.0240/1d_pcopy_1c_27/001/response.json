Segments that are already larger than one pixel remain unchanged. The background color is white (0).\n\n1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid (assumed to be 1xN).\n3. For each non-white pixel at index `j` with color `C`:\n    a. Check its left neighbor (at `j-1`, if `j>0`) and right neighbor (at `j+1`, if `j < width-1`).\n    b. If both existing neighbors are white (0), then the pixel at `j` is isolated.\n    c. If the pixel is isolated:\n        i. Determine the start index for the new 3-pixel segment: `start = max(0, j - 1)`.\n        ii. Determine the end index (exclusive) for the new segment: `end = min(width, j + 2)`.\n        iii. Set the pixels in the output grid from `start` to `end` (exclusive) to the color `C`.\n4. Pixels that are part of segments larger than 1 or background pixels are effectively copied from the input to the output during initialization and are not modified further.\n5.
