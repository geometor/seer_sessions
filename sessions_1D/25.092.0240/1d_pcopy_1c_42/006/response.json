            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt failed because the code specifically looked for the pattern `0 C 0` (background - pattern color - background) to trigger the transformation. However, analyzing the expected outputs reveals that any pixel of the pattern color `C` whose immediate neighbors are *not* `C` should trigger the transformation. The neighbors do not necessarily have to be the background color (0).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Correctly identify the pattern color `C` from the first occurrence of `C C C`.\n2.  Iterate through the input grid, identifying pixels at index `i` that contain color `C`.\n3.  For each such pixel, check if its neighbors at `i-1` and `i+1` are *not* color `C`.\n4.  If a pixel at index `i` satisfies these conditions (i.e., `input[i] == C`, `input[i-1] != C`, `input[i+1] != C`), then modify the *output* grid by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.\n5.  Ensure the iteration handles boundary conditions correctly (the check implicitly requires index `i` to be between 1 and `length - 2`).\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's re-examine the examples with the corrected understanding:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, ...]`\n*   Pattern `5 5 5` found at index 2. Pattern Color `C = 5`.\n*   Check index `i=7`: `input[7]=5`. Neighbors: `input[6]=0` (not 5), `input[8]=0` (not 5). Condition met.\n*   Check index `i=12`: `input[12]=5`. Neighbors: `input[11]=0` (not 5), `input[13]=0` (not 5). Condition met.\n*   Transformation: Set output indices `[6, 7, 8]` to `5` and `[11, 12, 13]` to `5`.\n*   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, ...]` - Matches transformation.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, ...]`\n*   Pattern `5 5 5` found at index 2. Pattern Color `C = 5`.\n*   Check index `i=9`: `input[9]=5`. Neighbors: `input[8]=0` (not 5), `input[10]=0` (not 5). Condition met.\n*   Check index `i=15`: `input[15]=5`. Neighbors: `input[14]=0` (not 5), `input[16]=0` (not 5). Condition met.\n*   Transformation: Set output indices `[8, 9, 10]` to `5` and `[14, 15, 16]` to `5`.\n*   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, ...]` - Matches transformation.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, ...]`\n*   Pattern `8 8 8` found at index 2. Pattern Color `C = 8`.\n*   Check index `i=9`: `input[9]=8`. Neighbors: `input[8]=0` (not 8), `input[10]=0` (not 8). Condition met.\n*   Transformation: Set output indices `[8, 9, 10]` to `8`.\n*   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, ...]` - Matches transformation.\n\nThe analysis confirms the revised understanding aligns with all training examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
