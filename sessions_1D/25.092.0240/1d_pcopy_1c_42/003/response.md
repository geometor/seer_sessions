"""
Identify the color 'C' of the first sequence of three identical adjacent non-zero pixels found in the 1D input grid.
Then, find all single instances of color 'C' in the input grid that are located at index 'i' and whose neighbors at 'i-1' and 'i+1' are *not* color 'C' (isolated 'C' pixels).
For each such isolated 'C' pixel found at index 'i' in the input grid, transform the corresponding region in a *copy* of the grid by setting the pixels at indices 'i-1', 'i', and 'i+1' to color 'C'.
The original three-pixel blocks of color 'C' and all other pixels remain unchanged unless they are part of the neighborhood of an isolated 'C'.
