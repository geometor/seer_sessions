Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format**: The data is presented as 1D arrays (or lists) of integers, representing pixels in a single row.
2.  **Colors Used**: The examples use white (0) as the background and one other color per example: gray (5) in the first two, and azure (8) in the third.
3.  **Key Pattern**: Each input contains at least one block of three identical, adjacent non-zero colored pixels (e.g., `5 5 5` or `8 8 8`). Let's call this the "pattern color".
4.  **Transformation Trigger**: The inputs also contain isolated instances of the *same* pattern color. An "isolated" pixel seems to be one that is not part of a three-pixel block of that color (i.e., its immediate neighbors are not the same color).
5.  **Transformation Action**: When an isolated pixel of the pattern color `C` is found at index `i`, the output grid shows a block of `C C C` centered at that position. This means the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are all set to color `C` in the output, overwriting whatever was there previously (usually white pixels).
6.  **Stability**: The original `C C C` block(s) in the input remain unchanged in the output.
7.  **Scope**: The transformation seems local; only the immediate neighborhood of isolated pixels is affected.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  dimensionality: 1
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pattern_Block
    definition: A sequence of three identical adjacent non-zero pixels (C C C).
    properties:
      color: C (non-zero)
      length: 3
  - type: Isolated_Pixel
    definition: A single pixel of color C whose immediate left and right neighbors are not color C.
    properties:
      color: C (matches Pattern_Block color)
    relationships:
      - Must have the same color as a Pattern_Block present in the grid.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find the color C of the first Pattern_Block (C C C) in the input grid.
  - Find: Locate all Isolated_Pixels with color C in the input grid.
  - Transform: For each Isolated_Pixel found at index 'i' in the input grid:
      - Modify the output grid by setting the pixels at index i-1, i, and i+1 to color C.
      - Handle boundary conditions: If i=0, set indices 0 and 1. If i=last_index, set indices i-1 and i.
  - Preserve: Keep the original Pattern_Blocks from the input unchanged in the output.

Result:
  - The output grid reflects the original grid with the neighborhoods around Isolated_Pixels transformed into Pattern_Blocks.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Make a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the first sequence of three identical adjacent non-zero pixels (`C C C`). Identify the color `C`. If no such sequence exists, return the original grid copy.
3.  Iterate through the input grid from the second pixel (index 1) up to the second-to-last pixel (index `length - 2`).
4.  For each pixel at index `i` with color `C`:
    a.  Check if the pixel at `i-1` is *not* color `C`.
    b.  Check if the pixel at `i+1` is *not* color `C`.
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, this pixel at index `i` is an "isolated pixel".
    d.  For this isolated pixel, modify the *output* grid: set the pixel values at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
