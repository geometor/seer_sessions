Identify the color 'C' of the first sequence of three identical adjacent non-zero pixels found in the 1D input grid.
Then, find all single instances of color 'C' in the input grid that are surrounded by non-'C' pixels (isolated 'C' pixels).
For each isolated 'C' pixel found at index 'i', transform the output grid by setting the pixels at indices 'i-1', 'i', and 'i+1' to color 'C'.
The original three-pixel blocks of color 'C' remain unchanged.
