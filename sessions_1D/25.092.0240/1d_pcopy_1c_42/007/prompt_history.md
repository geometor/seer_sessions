Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format**: The data is presented as 1D arrays (or lists) of integers, representing pixels in a single row.
2.  **Colors Used**: The examples use white (0) as the background and one other color per example: gray (5) in the first two, and azure (8) in the third.
3.  **Key Pattern**: Each input contains at least one block of three identical, adjacent non-zero colored pixels (e.g., `5 5 5` or `8 8 8`). Let's call this the "pattern color".
4.  **Transformation Trigger**: The inputs also contain isolated instances of the *same* pattern color. An "isolated" pixel seems to be one that is not part of a three-pixel block of that color (i.e., its immediate neighbors are not the same color).
5.  **Transformation Action**: When an isolated pixel of the pattern color `C` is found at index `i`, the output grid shows a block of `C C C` centered at that position. This means the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are all set to color `C` in the output, overwriting whatever was there previously (usually white pixels).
6.  **Stability**: The original `C C C` block(s) in the input remain unchanged in the output.
7.  **Scope**: The transformation seems local; only the immediate neighborhood of isolated pixels is affected.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  dimensionality: 1
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pattern_Block
    definition: A sequence of three identical adjacent non-zero pixels (C C C).
    properties:
      color: C (non-zero)
      length: 3
  - type: Isolated_Pixel
    definition: A single pixel of color C whose immediate left and right neighbors are not color C.
    properties:
      color: C (matches Pattern_Block color)
    relationships:
      - Must have the same color as a Pattern_Block present in the grid.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find the color C of the first Pattern_Block (C C C) in the input grid.
  - Find: Locate all Isolated_Pixels with color C in the input grid.
  - Transform: For each Isolated_Pixel found at index 'i' in the input grid:
      - Modify the output grid by setting the pixels at index i-1, i, and i+1 to color C.
      - Handle boundary conditions: If i=0, set indices 0 and 1. If i=last_index, set indices i-1 and i.
  - Preserve: Keep the original Pattern_Blocks from the input unchanged in the output.

Result:
  - The output grid reflects the original grid with the neighborhoods around Isolated_Pixels transformed into Pattern_Blocks.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Make a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the first sequence of three identical adjacent non-zero pixels (`C C C`). Identify the color `C`. If no such sequence exists, return the original grid copy.
3.  Iterate through the input grid from the second pixel (index 1) up to the second-to-last pixel (index `length - 2`).
4.  For each pixel at index `i` with color `C`:
    a.  Check if the pixel at `i-1` is *not* color `C`.
    b.  Check if the pixel at `i+1` is *not* color `C`.
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, this pixel at index `i` is an "isolated pixel".
    d.  For this isolated pixel, modify the *output* grid: set the pixel values at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.

## Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt failed because the code specifically looked for the pattern `0 C 0` (background - pattern color - background) to trigger the transformation. However, analyzing the expected outputs reveals that any pixel of the pattern color `C` whose immediate neighbors are *not* `C` should trigger the transformation. The neighbors do not necessarily have to be the background color (0).

The strategy is to:
1.  Correctly identify the pattern color `C` from the first occurrence of `C C C`.
2.  Iterate through the input grid, identifying pixels at index `i` that contain color `C`.
3.  For each such pixel, check if its neighbors at `i-1` and `i+1` are *not* color `C`.
4.  If a pixel at index `i` satisfies these conditions (i.e., `input[i] == C`, `input[i-1] != C`, `input[i+1] != C`), then modify the *output* grid by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.
5.  Ensure the iteration handles boundary conditions correctly (the check implicitly requires index `i` to be between 1 and `length - 2`).

## Metrics

Let's re-examine the examples with the corrected understanding:

**Example 1:**
*   Input: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, ...]`
*   Pattern `5 5 5` found at index 2. Pattern Color `C = 5`.
*   Check index `i=7`: `input[7]=5`. Neighbors: `input[6]=0` (not 5), `input[8]=0` (not 5). Condition met.
*   Check index `i=12`: `input[12]=5`. Neighbors: `input[11]=0` (not 5), `input[13]=0` (not 5). Condition met.
*   Transformation: Set output indices `[6, 7, 8]` to `5` and `[11, 12, 13]` to `5`.
*   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, ...]` - Matches transformation.

**Example 2:**
*   Input: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, ...]`
*   Pattern `5 5 5` found at index 2. Pattern Color `C = 5`.
*   Check index `i=9`: `input[9]=5`. Neighbors: `input[8]=0` (not 5), `input[10]=0` (not 5). Condition met.
*   Check index `i=15`: `input[15]=5`. Neighbors: `input[14]=0` (not 5), `input[16]=0` (not 5). Condition met.
*   Transformation: Set output indices `[8, 9, 10]` to `5` and `[14, 15, 16]` to `5`.
*   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, ...]` - Matches transformation.

**Example 3:**
*   Input: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, ...]`
*   Pattern `8 8 8` found at index 2. Pattern Color `C = 8`.
*   Check index `i=9`: `input[9]=8`. Neighbors: `input[8]=0` (not 8), `input[10]=0` (not 8). Condition met.
*   Transformation: Set output indices `[8, 9, 10]` to `8`.
*   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, ...]` - Matches transformation.

The analysis confirms the revised understanding aligns with all training examples.

      color: C (must match the color of the Trigger_Pattern)
      index: i (where 1 <= i < grid_length - 1)
      context: Must have neighbors that are not color C.
    purpose: Identifies locations where the transformation should be applied.

Actions:
  - Step 1: Scan the input grid to find the first Trigger_Pattern (C C C) and identify its color C.
  - Step 2: If no Trigger_Pattern is found, return a copy of the input grid unchanged.
  - Step 3: Create a copy of the input grid (this will become the output grid).
  - Step 4: Iterate through the *input* grid from index 1 to length-2.
  - Step 5: At each index `i`, check if the pixel matches the criteria for an Isolated_Pixel (color is C, neighbors at i-1 and i+1 are not C).
  - Step 6: If an Isolated_Pixel is found at index `i` in the input grid, modify the *output* grid by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color C.
  - Step 7: After checking all relevant indices, return the modified output grid.

Result:
  - The output grid mirrors the input grid, except that every occurrence of an Isolated_Pixel (and its immediate non-C neighbors) in the input is replaced by a C C C sequence in the output. Original Trigger_Patterns remain unmodified unless they happen to be adjacent to an Isolated_Pixel that gets expanded.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid; this copy will be modified to become the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first sequence of three identical, adjacent, non-zero pixels (`C C C`). Let the color of these pixels be `pattern_color`.
3.  If no such sequence `C C C` is found in the input grid, return the unmodified copy of the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the `input_grid` using an index `i`, starting from the second position (index 1) up to, but not including, the last position (index `length - 1`).
5.  Inside the loop, check if the pixel at `input_grid[i]` has the `pattern_color`.
6.  If it does, then check if the pixel to its left (`input_grid[i-1]`) does *not* have the `pattern_color` AND the pixel to its right (`input_grid[i+1]`) also does *not* have the `pattern_color`.
7.  If both conditions in step 6 are true (i.e., the pixel at `i` is the `pattern_color` and is surrounded by pixels of different colors), then modify the *output* grid: set the value of `output_grid[i-1]`, `output_grid[i]`, and `output_grid[i+1]` to the `pattern_color`.
8.  After the loop finishes checking all relevant positions in the input grid, return the modified `output_grid`.
