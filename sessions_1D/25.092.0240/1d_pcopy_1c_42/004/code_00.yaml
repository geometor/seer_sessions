Grid:
  dimensionality: 1
  background_color: 0 (white)
  max_size: 32 # Based on example lengths

Objects:
  - type: Pattern_Block
    definition: A sequence of three identical adjacent non-zero pixels (C C C).
    properties:
      color: C (non-zero, e.g., 5 or 8)
      length: 3
  - type: Isolated_Pixel
    definition: A single pixel of color C located at index 'i', where the pixels at indices i-1 and i+1 are both the background color (0).
    properties:
      color: C (matches Pattern_Block color)
      index: i (where 1 <= i <= length-2)
    context:
      - Must have background color (0) as immediate left neighbor.
      - Must have background color (0) as immediate right neighbor.
    relationships:
      - Must have the same color C as a Pattern_Block present in the grid.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find the color C of the first Pattern_Block (C C C) in the input grid.
  - Find: Locate all Isolated_Pixels (0 C 0 pattern) with color C in the input grid.
  - Transform: For each Isolated_Pixel found at index 'i' in the input grid:
      - Modify a *copy* of the input grid (the output grid) by setting the pixels at index i-1, i, and i+1 to color C.
  - Preserve: All parts of the grid not involved in the 'Transform' step (including original Pattern_Blocks) remain unchanged in the output grid.

Result:
  - The output grid is a copy of the input grid where every occurrence of the pattern `0 C 0` (where C is the pattern color) has been replaced by `C C C`.
