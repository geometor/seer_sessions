            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format**: The data is presented as 1D arrays (or lists) of integers, representing pixels in a single row.\n2.  **Colors Used**: The examples use white (0) as the background and one other color per example: gray (5) in the first two, and azure (8) in the third.\n3.  **Key Pattern**: Each input contains at least one block of three identical, adjacent non-zero colored pixels (e.g., `5 5 5` or `8 8 8`). Let's call this the \"pattern color\".\n4.  **Transformation Trigger**: The inputs also contain isolated instances of the *same* pattern color. An \"isolated\" pixel seems to be one that is not part of a three-pixel block of that color (i.e., its immediate neighbors are not the same color).\n5.  **Transformation Action**: When an isolated pixel of the pattern color `C` is found at index `i`, the output grid shows a block of `C C C` centered at that position. This means the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are all set to color `C` in the output, overwriting whatever was there previously (usually white pixels).\n6.  **Stability**: The original `C C C` block(s) in the input remain unchanged in the output.\n7.  **Scope**: The transformation seems local; only the immediate neighborhood of isolated pixels is affected.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
