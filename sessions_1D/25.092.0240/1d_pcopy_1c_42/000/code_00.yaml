Grid:
  dimensionality: 1
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pattern_Block
    definition: A sequence of three identical adjacent non-zero pixels (C C C).
    properties:
      color: C (non-zero)
      length: 3
  - type: Isolated_Pixel
    definition: A single pixel of color C whose immediate left and right neighbors are not color C.
    properties:
      color: C (matches Pattern_Block color)
    relationships:
      - Must have the same color as a Pattern_Block present in the grid.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find the color C of the first Pattern_Block (C C C) in the input grid.
  - Find: Locate all Isolated_Pixels with color C in the input grid.
  - Transform: For each Isolated_Pixel found at index 'i' in the input grid:
      - Modify the output grid by setting the pixels at index i-1, i, and i+1 to color C.
      - Handle boundary conditions: If i=0, set indices 0 and 1. If i=last_index, set indices i-1 and i.
  - Preserve: Keep the original Pattern_Blocks from the input unchanged in the output.

Result:
  - The output grid reflects the original grid with the neighborhoods around Isolated_Pixels transformed into Pattern_Blocks.
