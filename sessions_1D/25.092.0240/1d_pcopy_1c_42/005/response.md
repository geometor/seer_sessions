"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on identifying a specific color pattern.
First, it identifies the color 'C' from the first occurrence of a sequence of three identical adjacent non-zero pixels (C C C) in the input grid.
Then, it scans the input grid for occurrences of the pattern '0 C 0', where '0' is the background color and 'C' is the identified pattern color.
For each '0 C 0' pattern found centered at index 'i' in the input grid, it modifies a copy of the grid (the output grid) by replacing this pattern with 'C C C' at indices i-1, i, and i+1.
All other pixels, including the original 'C C C' blocks, remain unchanged in the output grid unless they are part of a '0 C 0' to 'C C C' transformation.
If no 'C C C' pattern is found initially, or the grid is too short, the original grid is returned unchanged.
