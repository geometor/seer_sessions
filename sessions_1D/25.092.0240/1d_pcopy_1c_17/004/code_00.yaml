task_context:
  - Grid Transformation: Modifying pixels based on spatial relationships and color identity, assuming a 2D grid structure (likely 4x8 based on data length 32).
  - Input Format: Requires reshaping a flat list of integers into a 2D grid.
  - Color Focus: Operations primarily concern one non-white color per example, determined by the topmost structure.
  - Background: White pixels (0) are treated as background and are generally not modified unless specifically filled.

elements:
  - type: Reference Line
    description: The topmost contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the *same* single non-white color in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: The single non-white color of the pixels in the line (e.g., red, yellow, gray). Let's call this C.
      - row_index: The row where this line occurs. Let's call this R.
      - column_range: The start and end column indices of the line. Let's call this [min_col, max_col].
  - type: Trigger Pixel
    description: Any pixel in the *input* grid in a row strictly below R (row index > R) that has the color C.
    properties:
      - color: Must be color C.
      - row_index: Must be greater than R.
      - column_index: Any column index within the grid width.
  - type: Affected Row Segment
    description: A horizontal segment in the *output* grid corresponding to a row that contained at least one Trigger Pixel in the input.
    properties:
      - color: All pixels in this segment are set to color C.
      - row_index: Same as the row index of the Trigger Pixel(s) in that input row.
      - column_range: Spans from min_col to max_col (inclusive), matching the Reference Line's column range.

relationships:
  - The Reference Line defines the target color (C) and the horizontal boundaries ([min_col, max_col]) for modifications in subsequent rows.
  - The presence of at least one Trigger Pixel in an input grid row `r > R` activates the transformation for that row `r` in the output grid.
  - The transformation consists of filling the Affected Row Segment in the output grid for the triggered row `r` using color C and column range [min_col, max_col].

actions:
  - Reshape: Convert the input flat list into a 2D grid (e.g., 4x8 NumPy array).
  - Identify: Find the Reference Line (topmost horizontal contiguous segment of a single non-white color). Extract its color C, row R, and column range [min_col, max_col].
  - Scan: Iterate through input grid rows below R (r > R).
  - Check: For each row r, determine if any pixel in the input grid at `(r, c)` (for any column `c`) has color C.
  - Fill: If a check is positive for input row r, modify the *output* grid by setting pixels from (r, min_col) to (r, max_col) to color C.
  - Copy: Unmodified pixels (including the reference line itself, rows below R without trigger pixels, rows R and above, and pixels outside the [min_col, max_col] range in rows > R that are not triggered) retain their original values from the input. Initialize output as a copy of input.
