Description: This task identifies horizontally isolated non-white pixels and expands them into horizontal lines of length 3. Existing horizontal lines of length 3 remain unchanged.

Input_Characteristics:
  - Grid: Contains a white background (0) and pixels of one other color (C).
  - Objects:
      - Isolated_Pixel: A pixel of color C whose immediate left and right neighbors are white (0) or grid boundaries.
      - Horizontal_Line_3: A sequence of three adjacent pixels of color C in the same row.

Output_Characteristics:
  - Grid: Derived from the input grid.
  - Transformations:
      - Isolated_Pixel: Replaced by a Horizontal_Line_3 of color C, centered at the original pixel's location.
      - Horizontal_Line_3: Remain unchanged from the input.

Relationships:
  - Horizontally_Adjacent: Pixels immediately to the left or right within the same row.
  - Isolation_Condition: A non-white pixel is isolated if its horizontally adjacent neighbors are not the same color.

Color_Agnostic: The transformation rule applies independently of the specific non-white color C.
Row_Independent: The transformation appears to operate on each row independently, only considering horizontal neighbors.
