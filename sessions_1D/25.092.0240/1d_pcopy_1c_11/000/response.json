            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as 1D sequences of numbers, but they likely represent rows within a 2D grid. All examples show changes occurring within a single row, suggesting the transformation might operate independently on each row or only considers horizontal relationships.\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses a different non-white color (blue=1, magenta=6, yellow=4) along with the white background (0). The transformation seems color-agnostic, applying the same logic regardless of the specific non-white color involved.\n3.  **Patterns:** In each input, there are two distinct patterns of the non-white color:\n    *   A horizontal line segment exactly three pixels long (e.g., `1 1 1`, `6 6 6`, `4 4 4`).\n    *   A single, isolated pixel of the same color (e.g., `... 0 1 0 ...`, `... 0 6 0 ...`, `... 0 4 0 ...`).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is that the single, isolated non-white pixels in the input are expanded into a horizontal line segment of three pixels in the output, using the same color. The center of this new 3-pixel line is the location of the original isolated pixel. The existing 3-pixel lines in the input remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n"

Examine the color of the cell immediately to the right (`input[r, c+1]`, considering boundary conditions as white).\n    c.  If *neither* the left nor the right cell has the same color `C`, then the cell `(r, c)` is identified as horizontally isolated.\n    d.  If the cell `(r, c)` is horizontally isolated, then modify the *output* grid by setting the color of the cells at `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c)`, and `(r, c+1)` to `C`. Ensure these coordinates are within the grid boundaries before modifying.\n5.  After checking all cells in the input grid, return the modified output grid."
