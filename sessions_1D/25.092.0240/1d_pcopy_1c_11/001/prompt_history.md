Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as 1D sequences of numbers, but they likely represent rows within a 2D grid. All examples show changes occurring within a single row, suggesting the transformation might operate independently on each row or only considers horizontal relationships.
2.  **Colors:** Each example uses a different non-white color (blue=1, magenta=6, yellow=4) along with the white background (0). The transformation seems color-agnostic, applying the same logic regardless of the specific non-white color involved.
3.  **Patterns:** In each input, there are two distinct patterns of the non-white color:
    *   A horizontal line segment exactly three pixels long (e.g., `1 1 1`, `6 6 6`, `4 4 4`).
    *   A single, isolated pixel of the same color (e.g., `... 0 1 0 ...`, `... 0 6 0 ...`, `... 0 4 0 ...`).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is that the single, isolated non-white pixels in the input are expanded into a horizontal line segment of three pixels in the output, using the same color. The center of this new 3-pixel line is the location of the original isolated pixel. The existing 3-pixel lines in the input remain unchanged in the output.

**YAML Block:**


```yaml
Description: This task identifies horizontally isolated non-white pixels and expands them into horizontal lines of length 3. Existing horizontal lines of length 3 remain unchanged.

Input_Characteristics:
  - Grid: Contains a white background (0) and pixels of one other color (C).
  - Objects:
      - Isolated_Pixel: A pixel of color C whose immediate left and right neighbors are white (0) or grid boundaries.
      - Horizontal_Line_3: A sequence of three adjacent pixels of color C in the same row.

Output_Characteristics:
  - Grid: Derived from the input grid.
  - Transformations:
      - Isolated_Pixel: Replaced by a Horizontal_Line_3 of color C, centered at the original pixel's location.
      - Horizontal_Line_3: Remain unchanged from the input.

Relationships:
  - Horizontally_Adjacent: Pixels immediately to the left or right within the same row.
  - Isolation_Condition: A non-white pixel is isolated if its horizontally adjacent neighbors are not the same color.

Color_Agnostic: The transformation rule applies independently of the specific non-white color C.
Row_Independent: The transformation appears to operate on each row independently, only considering horizontal neighbors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid. This will be the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row (`r`) and column (`c`) of the input grid.
3.  For each cell `(r, c)`, check its color (`C`).
4.  If the color `C` is not white (i.e., `C > 0`):
    a.  Examine the color of the cell immediately to the left (`input[r, c-1]`, considering boundary conditions as white).
    b.  Examine the color of the cell immediately to the right (`input[r, c+1]`, considering boundary conditions as white).
    c.  If *neither* the left nor the right cell has the same color `C`, then the cell `(r, c)` is identified as horizontally isolated.
    d.  If the cell `(r, c)` is horizontally isolated, then modify the *output* grid by setting the color of the cells at `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c)`, and `(r, c+1)` to `C`. Ensure these coordinates are within the grid boundaries before modifying.
5.  After checking all cells in the input grid, return the modified output grid.
