**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays). Each grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and several objects composed of contiguous non-white pixels of a single color (magenta, yellow, or green). Within each input grid, there are multiple non-white objects, potentially of different sizes (lengths). The output grid retains the same background color and the same non-white color as the input. The key transformation involves identifying the largest non-white object in the input and using its pattern to replace all *other* non-white objects in the output, while keeping the largest object itself unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - foreground_color: single non-white color per example (magenta, yellow, green)

Objects:
  - definition: Contiguous sequences of non-white pixels.
  - properties:
    - color: Consistent within an object and across all objects in a single example.
    - size: Length (number of pixels) of the contiguous sequence.
  - relationships:
    - Multiple objects exist within each input grid.
    - Objects are separated by one or more white pixels.
    - One object is identifiable as the 'largest' based on length.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all non-white objects in the input.
  - Compare: Determine the object with the maximum length (the 'largest' object).
  - Replace: Substitute all non-white objects *except* the largest one with a copy of the largest object's pattern.
  - Preserve: Keep the original largest object and all white background pixels unchanged in their positions relative to the replacement action. The replacement starts at the same column index as the object being replaced.

Transformation:
  - Rule: Replicate the pattern of the largest non-white object onto the locations of all smaller non-white objects.
  - Input_State: Grid with multiple non-white objects of varying sizes.
  - Output_State: Grid where all non-white objects have the size and pattern of the originally largest object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous blocks (objects) of non-white pixels. Record their color, starting position (column index), and length for each object.
3.  Find the object with the maximum length among all identified objects. This is the "largest object". Store its pattern (sequence of pixel values).
4.  Iterate through the list of identified non-white objects.
5.  For each object that is *not* the largest object:
    a.  Retrieve its starting position (column index).
    b.  Replace the pixels in the *output* grid, starting from this column index, with the pattern of the largest object. The replacement overwrites the original object and potentially adjacent pixels, extending for the length of the largest object's pattern.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
