"""
Identifies all contiguous blocks (objects) of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid. 
Finds the object with the maximum length (the 'largest object').
Replaces all non-white objects *except* the largest one with a copy of the largest object's pattern, 
starting at the original position of the replaced object. White background pixels remain unchanged.
