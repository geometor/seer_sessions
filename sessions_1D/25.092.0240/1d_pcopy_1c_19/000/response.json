Each grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and several objects composed of contiguous non-white pixels of a single color (magenta, yellow, or green). Within each input grid, there are multiple non-white objects, potentially of different sizes (lengths). The output grid retains the same background color and the same non-white color as the input. The key transformation involves identifying the largest non-white object in the input and using its pattern to replace all *other* non-white objects in the output, while keeping the largest object itself unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

The replacement starts at the same column index as the object being replaced.\n\nTransformation:\n  - Rule: Replicate the pattern of the largest non-white object onto the locations of all smaller non-white objects.\n  - Input_State: Grid with multiple non-white objects of varying sizes.\n  - Output_State: Grid where all non-white objects have the size and pattern of the originally largest object.\n```"
