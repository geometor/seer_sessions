Grid_Properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - foreground_color: single non-white color per example (magenta, yellow, green)

Objects:
  - definition: Contiguous sequences of non-white pixels.
  - properties:
    - color: Consistent within an object and across all objects in a single example.
    - size: Length (number of pixels) of the contiguous sequence.
  - relationships:
    - Multiple objects exist within each input grid.
    - Objects are separated by one or more white pixels.
    - One object is identifiable as the 'largest' based on length.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all non-white objects in the input.
  - Compare: Determine the object with the maximum length (the 'largest' object).
  - Replace: Substitute all non-white objects *except* the largest one with a copy of the largest object's pattern.
  - Preserve: Keep the original largest object and all white background pixels unchanged in their positions relative to the replacement action. The replacement starts at the same column index as the object being replaced.

Transformation:
  - Rule: Replicate the pattern of the largest non-white object onto the locations of all smaller non-white objects.
  - Input_State: Grid with multiple non-white objects of varying sizes.
  - Output_State: Grid where all non-white objects have the size and pattern of the originally largest object.
