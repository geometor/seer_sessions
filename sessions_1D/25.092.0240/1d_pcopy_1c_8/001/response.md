```python
"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by expanding isolated non-white pixels into horizontal lines of three pixels of the same color.

Specifically, it iterates through the input grid. If a non-white pixel is found at index 'i' and its immediate left (i-1) and right (i+1) neighbors are white (0), then the output grid pixels at indices i-1, i, and i+1 are all set to the color of the original pixel at index 'i'. Existing non-white patterns (like 3-pixel lines) are preserved.
