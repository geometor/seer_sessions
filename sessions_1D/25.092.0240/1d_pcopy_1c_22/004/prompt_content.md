"""
Identifies isolated foreground pixels (pattern '0 C 0') in a 1D input grid and replaces them with a block of three foreground pixels ('C C C').
The foreground color 'C' is the single non-white (non-zero) color present in the grid.
Pixels already part of a horizontal block of the foreground color are left unchanged.
The transformation preserves the grid dimensions. Modifications are made based on the original input state.
