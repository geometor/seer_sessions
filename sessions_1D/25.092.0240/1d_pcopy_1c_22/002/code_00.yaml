task_type: pattern_replacement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
grid_size: Fixed length of 33 for all examples.
colors:
  - background: white (0)
  - foreground: variable (magenta=6, orange=7, maroon=9), exactly one per grid.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Either background (0) or foreground (C).
      - index: Position within the 1D grid.
  - type: pattern
    properties:
      - pattern_type: isolated_foreground
      - sequence: [white(0), foreground(C), white(0)]
      - location: indices [i-1, i, i+1]
  - type: pattern
    properties:
      - pattern_type: foreground_block
      - sequence: [foreground(C), foreground(C), foreground(C)]
      - location: indices [i-1, i, i+1] (after transformation)
input_features:
  - Contains exactly one foreground color 'C'.
  - May contain one or more instances of the 'isolated_foreground' pattern.
  - May contain contiguous blocks of the foreground color.
output_features:
  - Instances of the 'isolated_foreground' pattern are replaced by the 'foreground_block' pattern.
  - All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.
transformation:
  - name: expand_isolated_pixel
  - description: Replaces a sequence [white(0), foreground(C), white(0)] at indices [i-1, i, i+1] with [foreground(C), foreground(C), foreground(C)] at the same indices.
  - input_pattern: [0, C, 0]
  - output_pattern: [C, C, C]
  - condition: The pattern must occur within the grid boundaries (i.e., index `i` must be between 1 and length-2, inclusive).
  - scope: Operates horizontally on adjacent pixels. Applied simultaneously to all occurrences based on the *original* input state.
relationship: horizontal_adjacency
invariance:
  - grid_length (remains 33)
  - color_palette (uses only white and the original foreground color)
  - positions and colors of pixels not part of an 'isolated_foreground' pattern.
implementation_note: It is crucial to perform modifications on a *copy* of the input grid and return the modified copy, rather than modifying the input grid in place or returning the original input grid.
