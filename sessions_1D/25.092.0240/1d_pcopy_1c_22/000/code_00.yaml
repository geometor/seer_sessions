task_type: pattern_replacement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or row-wise 2D)
colors:
  - background: white (0)
  - foreground: variable (magenta=6, orange=7, maroon=9 in examples)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color
      - position (index)
      - left_neighbor_color
      - right_neighbor_color
  - type: pattern
    properties:
      - constituent_pixels
      - sequence (e.g., '0 C 0', 'C C C')
input_features:
  - presence of isolated foreground pixels (pattern '0 C 0')
  - presence of contiguous blocks of foreground pixels (e.g., 'C C C')
output_features:
  - isolated foreground pixels ('0 C 0') are replaced by a block ('C C C')
  - contiguous blocks ('C C C') remain unchanged
transformation:
  - name: expand_isolated_pixel
  - description: Replaces a sequence '0 C 0' with 'C C C', where C is the foreground color.
  - condition: Applies only if a pixel has the foreground color AND its immediate left and right neighbors are white (0).
  - scope: Operates horizontally. Requires index bounds checking (i-1, i, i+1 must be valid).
relationship: horizontal_adjacency
invariance:
  - grid_size
  - background_pixels not involved in the direct replacement
  - foreground pixels that are not isolated horizontally
