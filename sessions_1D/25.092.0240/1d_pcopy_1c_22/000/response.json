            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be 1-dimensional arrays or single rows from a larger grid. All examples have the same length (33).\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses white (0) as the background color and one other dominant color: magenta (6) in the first, orange (7) in the second, and maroon (9) in the third.\n3.  **Input Patterns:** The inputs contain blocks of the dominant color (e.g., `6 6 6`, `7 7 7`, `9 9 9`) and isolated instances of the dominant color surrounded by white pixels (e.g., `0 6 0`, `0 7 0`, `0 9 0`).\n4.  **Output Patterns:** In the outputs, the initial blocks of the dominant color remain unchanged. However, the isolated instances of the dominant color seem to be expanded into a block of three. Specifically, a pattern `0 C 0` (where `C` is the dominant color) in the input becomes `C C C` in the output, centered at the original position of `C`.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies isolated pixels of the dominant color (pixels with white neighbors on both the left and right) and replaces the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors with the dominant color. Pixels that are already part of a horizontal sequence of the dominant color are not considered isolated and are left unchanged. The transformation preserves the grid dimensions.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
