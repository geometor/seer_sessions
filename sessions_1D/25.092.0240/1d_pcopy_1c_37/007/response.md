"""
Constructs an output row by replicating an initial 3-pixel pattern at specific locations derived from the input row.

1.  Accept the input grid (expected to be a single row, 1xN).
2.  Create a new output row of length N, initialized entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Identify the primary non-white color (C) present in the input row.
4.  Find the first sequence of three consecutive pixels of color C (the pattern block P) and its starting index (pattern_start_index) in the input row.
5.  Place the pattern block P into the output row starting at pattern_start_index.
6.  Identify all indices (t) in the input row *after* the initial pattern block where the pixel has color C and is horizontally isolated (neighbors are not C).
7.  For each identified index t, calculate the output placement index (output_index = t - 1).
8.  Place a copy of the pattern block P into the output row starting at output_index, respecting boundaries.
9.  Return the constructed output row, formatted as a 1xN grid (list of lists).
