**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous attempt failed because the placement logic for the pattern block was incorrect. The code placed the 3-pixel pattern starting at the index of the single target pixel identified in the input. However, analysis of the expected outputs reveals that the single target pixel in the input actually marks the *middle* position of the 3-pixel pattern in the output. Therefore, the pattern should be placed starting one position *before* the identified target index.

The strategy is to:
1.  Keep the methods for identifying the primary color, the initial 3-pixel pattern block, and the subsequent single target pixels.
2.  Modify the final step: when placing the pattern block corresponding to a target pixel found at index `t`, place it in the output grid starting at index `t-1`.
3.  Ensure the output grid is initialized as white (all zeros) before placing any patterns.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Construct an output row by placing copies of an initial 3-pixel pattern based on locations identified in the input row.
elements:
  - object: grid
    property:
      - type: 1D array (single row)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - primary_color: varies (yellow, maroon, gray) - the single non-white color present.
  - object: initial_pattern_block
    property:
      - composition: sequence of three consecutive pixels of the primary_color.
      - location_rule: the first occurrence of such a sequence in the input row.
      - role: template pattern to be copied to the output.
  - object: target_marker_pixel
    property:
      - color: same as primary_color.
      - context: appears *after* the initial_pattern_block in the input row.
      - condition: must be horizontally isolated (immediate left and right neighbors are not the primary_color).
      - role: indicates a location for placing the pattern_block in the output.
  - object: output_grid
    property:
      - dimensions: same as input grid (1xN).
      - initial_state: all white (0) pixels.
      - final_state: constructed by placing pattern blocks.
actions:
  - name: identify_primary_color
    input: input_grid
    output: the non-white color `C`.
  - name: find_initial_pattern_block
    input: input_grid, primary_color `C`
    output:
      - pattern: the sequence `[C, C, C]`.
      - start_index: the starting index `idx_p` of this sequence in the input.
  - name: find_target_marker_indices
    input: input_grid, primary_color `C`, start_index_after_pattern (`idx_p + 3`)
    output: list of indices `T = [t1, t2, ...]` where single, isolated pixels of color `C` are found.
  - name: construct_output_grid
    based_on: input_grid_dimensions, initial_pattern_block, start_index `idx_p`, target_marker_indices `T`.
    steps:
      - Initialize output grid (1xN) with white (0).
      - Place the initial_pattern_block into the output grid starting at `idx_p`.
      - For each target marker index `t` in `T`:
        - Calculate the placement start index for the output: `output_idx = t - 1`.
        - Place a copy of the initial_pattern_block into the output grid starting at `output_idx`. (Handle boundary conditions if `output_idx` is less than 0 or placement exceeds grid length, though examples suggest this won't happen).
relationships:
  - type: spatial_mapping
    description: A target_marker_pixel at index `t` in the input row corresponds to the *center* pixel of a pattern_block placed in the output row. The output pattern block starts at index `t-1`.
  - type: origin
    description: The first instance of the pattern_block in the input dictates the pattern to be used for all subsequent placements. Its position is preserved directly in the output.
  - type: construction
    description: The output grid is built constructively by placing pattern blocks onto a blank canvas, not by modifying the input grid directly.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid (which is a single row). Let its length be `N`.
2.  Initialize a new output row of length `N` filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Identify the primary non-white color (`C`) present in the input row.
4.  Scan the input row to find the starting index (`idx_p`) of the first sequence of three consecutive pixels of color `C`. Define this sequence `[C, C, C]` as the "pattern block" (`P`).
5.  Copy the pattern block (`P`) into the output row, starting at index `idx_p`.
6.  Define a search region in the input row starting from the index immediately after the initial pattern block (i.e., from index `idx_p + 3`).
7.  Scan the input row within this search region. Identify all indices `t` where the pixel `input[t]` has color `C` and is horizontally isolated (i.e., `input[t-1]` is not `C` and `input[t+1]` is not `C`, considering boundary conditions). These are the "target marker indices".
8.  For each identified target marker index `t`:
    a.  Calculate the placement start index for the output: `output_idx = t - 1`.
    b.  Copy the pattern block (`P`) into the output row, starting at `output_idx`. (Ensure placement starts at or after index 0 and the pattern fits within the row length `N`).
9.  Return the constructed output row.
