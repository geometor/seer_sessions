"""
Construct an output row by placing a 3-pixel pattern based on positions identified in the input row.

1.  Accept the input grid (which is a 1xN 2D array). Extract the single row for processing.
2.  Determine the dimensions (length `N`) of the input row.
3.  Initialize a new output row of length `N` filled entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  Identify the primary non-white color (`C`) present in the input row.
5.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the first occurrence of three consecutive pixels of color `C`. Record this 3-pixel sequence as the "pattern block" (`P`) and its starting index (`pattern_start_index`).
6.  Copy the pattern block (`P`) into the output row, starting at `pattern_start_index`.
7.  Define the search region in the input row as starting from the index immediately *after* the end of the identified pattern block (`pattern_start_index + 3`).
8.  Scan the input row within this search region. For each position `i`:
    a.  Check if the pixel `input[i]` has color `C`.
    b.  Check if this pixel is isolated horizontally: `input[i-1]` is not `C` (if `i > 0`) AND `input[i+1]` is not `C` (if `i < N-1`).
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, then `i` is a "target index".
9.  For each identified target index `t`:
    a.  Copy the pattern block (`P`) into the output row, starting at index `t`. Ensure the placement respects the row boundary.
10. Return the final output row (formatted as a 1xN 2D array).
