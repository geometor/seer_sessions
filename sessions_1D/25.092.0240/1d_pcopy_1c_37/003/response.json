Accept the input grid (which is a 1xN 2D array). Extract the single row for processing.\n2.  Determine the dimensions (length `N`) of the input row.\n3.  Initialize a new output row of length `N` filled entirely with white pixels (0).\n4.  Identify the primary non-white color (`C`) present in the input row.\n5.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the first occurrence of three consecutive pixels of color `C`. Record this 3-pixel sequence as the \"pattern block\" (`P`) and its starting index (`pattern_start_index`).\n6.  Copy the pattern block (`P`) into the output row, starting at `pattern_start_index`.\n7.  Define the search region in the input row as starting from the index immediately *after* the end of the identified pattern block (`pattern_start_index + 3`).\n8.  Scan the input row within this search region. For each position `i`:\n    a.  Check if the pixel `input[i]` has color `C`.\n    b.  Check if this pixel is isolated horizontally: `input[i-1]` is not `C` (if `i > 0`) AND `input[i+1]` is not `C` (if `i < N-1`).\n    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, then `i` is a \"target index\".\n9.  For each identified target index `t`:\n    a.  Copy the pattern block (`P`) into the output row, starting at index `t`. Ensure the placement respects the row boundary.\n10. Return the final output row (formatted as a 1xN 2D array).\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef find_primary_color(row):\n    \"\"\"Finds the first non-zero color in the row.\"\"\"\n    for pixel in row:\n        if pixel != 0:\n            return pixel\n    return None # Should not happen based on examples\n\ndef find_pattern_block(row, primary_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start index and the block ([C, C, C]) of the first sequence \n    of three consecutive primary color pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(row)\n    for i in range(n - 2):\n        if row[i] == primary_color and row[i+1] == primary_color and row[i+2] == primary_color:\n            return i, [primary_color] * 3\n    return -1, None # Should not happen based on examples\n\ndef find_target_indices(row, primary_color, search_start_index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds indices of single occurrences of primary_color after search_start_index.\n    A single occurrence means its immediate neighbors are not the primary_color.\n    \"\"\"\n    target_indices = []\n    n = len(row)\n    for i in range(search_start_index, n):\n        if row[i] == primary_color:\n            # Check left neighbor (handle boundary and start of search)\n            left_is_primary = (i > 0 and row[i-1] == primary_color)\n            # Check right neighbor (handle boundary)\n            right_is_primary = (i < n - 1 and row[i+1] == primary_color)\n            \n            if not left_is_primary and not right_is_primary:\n                target_indices.append(i)\n    return target_indices\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid (expected 1xN).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid (1xN).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array and extract the single row\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    if input_array.shape[0] != 1:\n        # Handle unexpected input shape if necessary, though ARC grids are 2D\n        # For this task, we strictly expect a 1xN grid.\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must have exactly one row.\")\n        \n    input_row = input_array[0]\n    n = len(input_row)\n\n    # Initialize output grid (1xN) filled with white (0)\n    output_array = np.zeros_like(input_array)\n    output_row = output_array[0] # Get a view of the output row for modification\n\n    # Identify primary color\n    primary_color = find_primary_color(input_row)\n    if primary_color is None:\n        return output_array.tolist() # Return blank grid if no color found\n\n    # Find the pattern block and its start index in the input\n    pattern_start_index, pattern_block = find_pattern_block(input_row, primary_color)\n    if pattern_start_index == -1:\n        # If no pattern block found, return the blank grid (or handle as error)\n        # Based on examples, pattern block always exists.\n        return output_array.tolist() \n        \n    pattern_length = len(pattern_block)\n    pattern_end_index = pattern_start_index + pattern_length # index *after* the pattern\n\n    # Copy the initial pattern block to the output row\n    if pattern_start_index + pattern_length <= n:\n        output_row[pattern_start_index : pattern_end_index] = pattern_block\n    else:\n         # Handle cases where pattern doesn't fit (unlikely based on constraints/examples)\n        pass \n\n    # Define the search start index for target pixels (after the initial pattern)\n    search_start_index = pattern_end_index \n\n    # Find target indices in the input row\n    target_indices = find_target_indices(input_row, primary_color, search_start_index)\n\n    # Copy the pattern block to the output row at each target index\n    for t_index in target_indices:\n        # Ensure the placement fits within the grid boundaries\n        if t_index + pattern_length <= n:\n            output_row[t_index : t_index + pattern_length] = pattern_block\n        else:\n            # Handle cases where pattern doesn't fit (unlikely based on constraints/examples)\n            # Option 1: Truncate pattern (less likely)\n            # Option 2: Don't place if it doesn't fit (more likely)\n            # Option 3: Error (if constraints guarantee fit)\n            # Based on examples, it seems to always fit.\n            pass \n\n    # Return the modified output grid as a list of lists\n    return output_array.tolist()\n```"
