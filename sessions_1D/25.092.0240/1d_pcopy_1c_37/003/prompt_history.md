*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays).
    *   Each input contains a primary non-white color (e.g., yellow, maroon, gray) interspersed with white (0).
    *   The input starts with a sequence of three consecutive pixels of the primary color, followed by one or more single pixels of the same primary color, separated by white pixels.
    *   The output retains the initial three-pixel block in its original position.
    *   Each subsequent single pixel of the primary color in the input is replaced in the output by a copy of the initial three-pixel block. The replacement block starts at the same position where the single pixel was located in the input.
    *   The primary color remains consistent between the input and output for each example.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the primary non-white color (`C`) present in the input row.
    2.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the first occurrence of three consecutive pixels of color `C`. This is the "pattern block" (`P`).
    3.  Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row (or as an all-white row of the same length).
    4.  Place the identified pattern block (`P`) into the output row at the same starting position it had in the input row.
    5.  Continue scanning the input row from the position immediately *after* the pattern block.
    6.  For each position `i` encountered *after* the pattern block:
        a.  If the pixel at position `i` in the input row has the color `C` AND it is a single occurrence (i.e., `input[i-1]` is not `C` and `input[i+1]` is not `C`, considering boundary conditions), then it is a "target pixel".
        b.  Replace the pixel(s) in the output row starting at position `i` with the pattern block (`P`). Ensure the pattern block fits within the grid boundaries if placed starting at `i`. (Note: Based on examples, the replacement overwrites existing pixels, and the pattern block is always 3 pixels long).
    7.  Return the modified output row.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous analysis correctly identified the core pattern (replace single colored pixels with a 3-pixel block found at the start) but failed during execution. The error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` indicated that the code was attempting boolean operations on multi-element NumPy arrays, likely because the input grids were treated as 2D arrays (shape (1, N)) instead of flat 1D arrays as implicitly assumed by the initial logic.

Furthermore, the metrics gathering revealed that even simulating the original logic on a flattened array did not reproduce the example outputs (`logic_matches_output: False`). This pointed to a flaw in the transformation logic itself. The simulation assumed the transformation started with a copy of the input, while the examples show the output is constructed more deliberately: starting with a blank (white) grid, placing the initial pattern, and then placing copies of the pattern at the locations of the target single pixels identified in the input.

**Resolution Strategy:**
1.  Modify the code to explicitly handle the input as a 2D grid with one row, extracting the row for 1D processing.
2.  Revise the transformation logic to:
    *   Initialize the output grid with the background color (white/0).
    *   Identify the primary color and the initial 3-pixel pattern block in the input row.
    *   Copy this initial pattern block to the output grid at its original position.
    *   Identify all single occurrences (target pixels) of the primary color in the input row *after* the initial pattern block.
    *   For each target pixel's starting position, copy the 3-pixel pattern block into the output grid at that position.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this refined understanding.

## Metrics

The following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution:

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Primary Color | Pattern Block | Pattern Start Index (0-based) | Target Indices (in Input) | Initial Logic Matched Output |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------ | :------------ | :-------------------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------- |
| 1       | (1, 32)     | (1, 32)      | 4 (Yellow)    | `[4, 4, 4]`   | 1                           | `[7, 12, 18]`             | False                        |
| 2       | (1, 32)     | (1, 32)      | 9 (Maroon)    | `[9, 9, 9]`   | 2                           | `[7]`                     | False                        |
| 3       | (1, 32)     | (1, 32)      | 5 (Gray)      | `[5, 5, 5]`   | 1                           | `[6, 11]`                 | False                        |

**Observations from Metrics:**
*   All inputs and outputs are consistently single rows represented as 2D arrays of shape (1, N).
*   The pattern block is always three consecutive pixels of the primary non-white color.
*   Target pixels are single instances of the primary color, appearing *after* the initial pattern block.
*   The previous logic failed to replicate the output structure, confirming the need for revision.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid (which is a 1xN 2D array). Extract the single row for processing.
2.  Determine the dimensions (length `N`) of the input row.
3.  Initialize a new output row of length `N` filled entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  Identify the primary non-white color (`C`) present in the input row.
5.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the first occurrence of three consecutive pixels of color `C`. Record this 3-pixel sequence as the "pattern block" (`P`) and its starting index (`pattern_start_index`).
6.  Copy the pattern block (`P`) into the output row, starting at `pattern_start_index`.
7.  Define the search region in the input row as starting from the index immediately *after* the end of the identified pattern block (`pattern_start_index + 3`).
8.  Scan the input row within this search region. For each position `i`:
    a.  Check if the pixel `input[i]` has color `C`.
    b.  Check if this pixel is isolated horizontally: `input[i-1]` is not `C` (if `i > 0`) AND `input[i+1]` is not `C` (if `i < N-1`).
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, then `i` is a "target index".
9.  For each identified target index `t`:
    a.  Copy the pattern block (`P`) into the output row, starting at index `t`. Ensure the placement respects the row boundary (though examples suggest it always fits). This step overwrites any previous values in the output row at positions `t`, `t+1`, and `t+2`.
10. Return the final output row (formatted as a 1xN 2D array).
