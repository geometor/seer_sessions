Identifies the primary non-white color (C) in the input row.
Finds the first sequence of three consecutive pixels of color C (the pattern block P).
Initializes the output row as a copy of the input row.
Scans the input row after the pattern block.
For each single pixel of color C found after the pattern block (where its immediate neighbors are not C), 
replaces the corresponding three pixels in the output row, starting at the single pixel's position, with the pattern block P.
