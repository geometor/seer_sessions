"""
Constructs an output row by placing copies of an initial 3-pixel pattern based on locations identified in the input row.

1.  Accepts the input grid (a single row).
2.  Initializes a new output row of the same length filled with white (0).
3.  Identifies the primary non-white color (C).
4.  Finds the starting index (idx_p) and the sequence [C, C, C] (pattern block P) of the first occurrence of three consecutive pixels of color C in the input.
5.  Places the pattern block P into the output row starting at idx_p.
6.  Identifies all indices (t) in the input row *after* the initial pattern block where the pixel has color C and is horizontally isolated (neighbors are not C). These are target marker indices.
7.  For each target marker index t, calculates the output placement start index as t-1.
8.  Places a copy of the pattern block P into the output row starting at this calculated index (t-1), ensuring it fits within boundaries.
9.  Returns the constructed output row.
