*   **Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The previous code failed with an error indicating the input was not structured as expected (specifically, "Input grid must be a non-empty list of lists."). This likely stems from how the testing framework passes the data or an incorrect assumption in the code's input validation/handling, rather than a fundamental flaw in the pattern recognition logic itself.
    *   Analysis of the input/output pairs reveals a consistent pattern:
        1.  Find the first block of three identical non-white pixels (`C C C`). This is the pattern `P`, starting at index `idx_p`.
        2.  Find all isolated single pixels of color `C` in the input that appear *after* the initial pattern `P`. Let the index of such a pixel be `t`.
        3.  Construct the output grid by first placing `P` at `idx_p`. Then, for each isolated single pixel found at index `t` in the input, place a copy of `P` into the output grid starting at index `t-1`.
    *   The core logic needs a slight adjustment: the output pattern placement starts one position *before* the index of the triggering single pixel found in the input.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Re-implement the `transform` function assuming the input *is* correctly passed as a `list[list[int]]` representing a 1xN grid. Maintain input validation but focus on the transformation logic.
        2.  Implement the corrected placement logic: identify the pattern `P = [C, C, C]` at `idx_p`, identify single markers `t > idx_p+2`, and place `P` in the output at `idx_p` and at `t-1` for each marker `t`.
        3.  Build the output grid from a blank state (all white pixels) rather than modifying a copy of the input.

            - Calculate the output placement index `p = t - 1`.
            - Place a copy of the pattern_block into the output grid starting at index `p`. Overwrite existing pixels if necessary. Check boundary conditions.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input grid (a single row of pixels). Determine its length `N`.
    2.  Create a new output row of length `N`, initialized entirely with white pixels (0).
    3.  Identify the primary non-white color (`C`) present in the input row. If no non-white color exists, return the all-white output row.
    4.  Scan the input row to find the first sequence of three consecutive pixels of color `C`. Record this sequence as the "pattern block" (`P`) and its starting index as `pattern_start_index`. If no such pattern exists, return the all-white output row.
    5.  Place the identified pattern block (`P`) into the output row, starting at `pattern_start_index`. Ensure placement respects boundaries.
    6.  Define a search region in the input row starting from the index immediately *after* the end of the initial pattern block (`pattern_start_index + 3`).
    7.  Scan the input row within this search region. Identify all indices `t` where:
        a.  The pixel `input[t]` has color `C`.
        b.  The pixel is horizontally isolated: `input[t-1]` is not `C` (or `t` is the first pixel in the search region) AND `input[t+1]` is not `C` (or `t` is the last pixel in the row).
    8.  For each identified index `t`:
        a.  Calculate the corresponding output placement index `output_index = t - 1`.
        b.  Place a copy of the pattern block (`P`) into the output row starting at `output_index`. Ensure placement respects row boundaries (index >= 0 and index + length <= N). Overwrite any existing pixels in the output row at this location.
    9.  Return the constructed output row.
