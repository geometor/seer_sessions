            "text": "*   **Assessment and Strategy:**\n    *   The previous code failed with an error indicating the input was not structured as expected (specifically, \"Input grid must be a non-empty list of lists.\"). This likely stems from how the testing framework passes the data or an incorrect assumption in the code's input validation/handling, rather than a fundamental flaw in the pattern recognition logic itself.\n    *   Analysis of the input/output pairs reveals a consistent pattern:\n        1.  Find the first block of three identical non-white pixels (`C C C`). This is the pattern `P`, starting at index `idx_p`.\n        2.  Find all isolated single pixels of color `C` in the input that appear *after* the initial pattern `P`. Let the index of such a pixel be `t`.\n        3.  Construct the output grid by first placing `P` at `idx_p`. Then, for each isolated single pixel found at index `t` in the input, place a copy of `P` into the output grid starting at index `t-1`.\n    *   The core logic needs a slight adjustment: the output pattern placement starts one position *before* the index of the triggering single pixel found in the input.\n    *   The strategy is to:\n        1.  Re-implement the `transform` function assuming the input *is* correctly passed as a `list[list[int]]` representing a 1xN grid. Maintain input validation but focus on the transformation logic.\n        2.  Implement the corrected placement logic: identify the pattern `P = [C, C, C]` at `idx_p`, identify single markers `t > idx_p+2`, and place `P` in the output at `idx_p` and at `t-1` for each marker `t`.\n        3.  Build the output grid from a blank state (all white pixels) rather than modifying a copy of the input.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Input Shape: (1, 32)\n        *   Output Shape: (1, 32)\n        *   Primary Color: 4 (yellow)\n        *   Pattern Block: `[4, 4, 4]` starting at index 1.\n        *   Single Marker Indices (input): [7, 12, 18]\n        *   Output Pattern Start Indices: [1, 6, 11, 17] (corresponding to input indices 1, 7-1, 12-1, 18-1)\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Input Shape: (1, 32)\n        *   Output Shape: (1, 32)\n        *   Primary Color: 9 (maroon)\n        *   Pattern Block: `[9, 9, 9]` starting at index 2.\n        *   Single Marker Indices (input): [7]\n        *   Output Pattern Start Indices: [2, 6] (corresponding to input indices 2, 7-1)\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Input Shape: (1, 32)\n        *   Output Shape: (1, 32)\n        *   Primary Color: 5 (gray)\n        *   Pattern Block: `[5, 5, 5]` starting at index 1.\n        *   Single Marker Indices (input): [6, 11]\n        *   Output Pattern Start Indices: [1, 5, 10] (corresponding to input indices 1, 6-1, 11-1)\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
