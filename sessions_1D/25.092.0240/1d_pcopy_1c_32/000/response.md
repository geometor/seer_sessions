Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-row grid (effectively a 1D array or sequence). The length varies but seems consistent within the task (implied by the test case). The background is white (0).
2.  **Objects:** The objects are horizontal sequences of non-white pixels. In the inputs, we see single pixels (e.g., `5` surrounded by `0`) and 1x3 blocks (e.g., `5 5 5` or `2 2 2`). The colors observed are gray (5) and red (2).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation specifically targets the single, isolated non-white pixels. Existing blocks of 3 identical non-white pixels seem unchanged. Each isolated single pixel in the input is replaced by a 1x3 block of the same color in the output. This new 1x3 block is centered horizontally where the original single pixel was located.
4.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three examples. Isolated pixels of gray (5) become `5 5 5`, and isolated pixels of red (2) become `2 2 2`. Existing `5 5 5` and `2 2 2` blocks remain as they are.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Expand isolated single non-white pixels into horizontal 1x3 blocks of the same color.

grid_properties:
  - type: 1D horizontal array (represented as 1xN grid)
  - background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - type: pixel_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., gray(5), red(2))
      shape: horizontal sequence
      size: variable (observed: 1x1, 1x3)

input_specifics:
  - object: isolated_pixel
    description: A non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are white (or grid boundary).
    properties:
      size: 1x1
      color: C (any non-white color)
      location: (0, col)
      is_horizontally_isolated: true
  - object: horizontal_block
    description: A sequence of 3 identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      size: 1x3
      color: C (any non-white color)
      location: spans (0, col) to (0, col+2)
      is_horizontally_isolated: false (internal pixels have non-white neighbors)

actions:
  - name: expand_pixel
    target: isolated_pixel
    effect: Replace the pixel at (0, col) and its neighbors at (0, col-1) and (0, col+1) with the pixel's color C in the output grid.
    conditions: Must respect grid boundaries.
    centering: The new 1x3 block is centered at the original pixel's column 'col'.
  - name: copy_pixel
    target: Any pixel not part of an expansion (includes background and non-isolated pixels).
    effect: The pixel value in the output grid at a given position is the same as the input grid at that position.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Horizontal adjacency is key to determining if a pixel is isolated.
  - type: transformation
    description: Isolated input pixels map to 1x3 output blocks. Non-isolated input blocks map directly to identical output blocks. Background maps to background.

output_goal:
  - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Populate the output grid by applying the 'expand_pixel' rule for isolated input pixels and 'copy_pixel' for all other positions initially. Ensure expansions overwrite the initial copies correctly.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (output) with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same values as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each column `c` of the input grid (since it's a single row, row index `r` is always 0).
3.  For each pixel at `(0, c)`:
    a.  Check if the pixel's color is non-white (not 0).
    b.  If it is non-white, check its horizontal neighbors:
        i.  Check the color of the pixel to the left `(0, c-1)`. Consider it white if `c-1` is out of bounds (less than 0).
        ii. Check the color of the pixel to the right `(0, c+1)`. Consider it white if `c+1` is out of bounds (greater than or equal to the grid width).
    c.  If BOTH the left and right neighbors (considering boundaries) are white (0), then the pixel at `(0, c)` is an isolated pixel.
    d.  If the pixel at `(0, c)` is isolated:
        i.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `(0, c)`.
        ii. In the output grid, set the color of the pixel at `(0, c)` to `C`.
        iii. If `c-1` is within the grid bounds (>= 0), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c-1)` in the output grid to `C`.
        iv. If `c+1` is within the grid bounds (< width), set the color of the pixel at `(0, c+1)` in the output grid to `C`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
