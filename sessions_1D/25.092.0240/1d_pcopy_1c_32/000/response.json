            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-row grid (effectively a 1D array or sequence). The length varies but seems consistent within the task (implied by the test case). The background is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The objects are horizontal sequences of non-white pixels. In the inputs, we see single pixels (e.g., `5` surrounded by `0`) and 1x3 blocks (e.g., `5 5 5` or `2 2 2`). The colors observed are gray (5) and red (2).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation specifically targets the single, isolated non-white pixels. Existing blocks of 3 identical non-white pixels seem unchanged. Each isolated single pixel in the input is replaced by a 1x3 block of the same color in the output. This new 1x3 block is centered horizontally where the original single pixel was located.\n4.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three examples. Isolated pixels of gray (5) become `5 5 5`, and isolated pixels of red (2) become `2 2 2`. Existing `5 5 5` and `2 2 2` blocks remain as they are.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
