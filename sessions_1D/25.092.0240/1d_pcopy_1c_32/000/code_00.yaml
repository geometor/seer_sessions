task_description: Expand isolated single non-white pixels into horizontal 1x3 blocks of the same color.

grid_properties:
  - type: 1D horizontal array (represented as 1xN grid)
  - background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - type: pixel_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (e.g., gray(5), red(2))
      shape: horizontal sequence
      size: variable (observed: 1x1, 1x3)

input_specifics:
  - object: isolated_pixel
    description: A non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are white (or grid boundary).
    properties:
      size: 1x1
      color: C (any non-white color)
      location: (0, col)
      is_horizontally_isolated: true
  - object: horizontal_block
    description: A sequence of 3 identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      size: 1x3
      color: C (any non-white color)
      location: spans (0, col) to (0, col+2)
      is_horizontally_isolated: false (internal pixels have non-white neighbors)

actions:
  - name: expand_pixel
    target: isolated_pixel
    effect: Replace the pixel at (0, col) and its neighbors at (0, col-1) and (0, col+1) with the pixel's color C in the output grid.
    conditions: Must respect grid boundaries.
    centering: The new 1x3 block is centered at the original pixel's column 'col'.
  - name: copy_pixel
    target: Any pixel not part of an expansion (includes background and non-isolated pixels).
    effect: The pixel value in the output grid at a given position is the same as the input grid at that position.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Horizontal adjacency is key to determining if a pixel is isolated.
  - type: transformation
    description: Isolated input pixels map to 1x3 output blocks. Non-isolated input blocks map directly to identical output blocks. Background maps to background.

output_goal:
  - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Populate the output grid by applying the 'expand_pixel' rule for isolated input pixels and 'copy_pixel' for all other positions initially. Ensure expansions overwrite the initial copies correctly.
