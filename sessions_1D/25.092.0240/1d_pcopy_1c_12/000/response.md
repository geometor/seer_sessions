*   **Perception**:
    *   The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (vectors) of pixels.
    *   The primary colors involved are white (0) and other non-white colors (maroon (9) and green (3) in the examples).
    *   The transformation focuses on specific local patterns involving a single non-white pixel surrounded by white pixels.
    *   Existing sequences of three or more identical non-white pixels seem to be left unchanged.
    *   The transformation replaces the pattern `[white, color, white]` with `[color, color, color]`.

*   **Facts**:

        output_pattern: target_replacement ([C, C, C])
        condition: Applies wherever the input pattern is found in the input grid.
    relationships:
      - The transformation preserves the grid length.
      - The transformation only modifies pixels involved in the 'isolated_pixel' pattern. All other pixels remain unchanged.
      - The color 'C' in the output pattern is identical to the color 'C' in the corresponding input pattern.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Create a copy of the input 1D grid (vector) to serve as the output grid.
    2.  Iterate through the input grid from the second element (index 1) up to the second-to-last element (index length - 2). Let the current index be `i`.
    3.  Examine the triplet of pixels in the input grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
    4.  Let the color of the pixel at index `i` be `C`.
    5.  Check if the triplet matches the pattern `[white, C, white]`, which means:
        *   The pixel at `i-1` is white (0).
        *   The pixel `C` at `i` is *not* white (C != 0).
        *   The pixel at `i+1` is white (0).
    6.  If the pattern is matched, modify the *output grid* (the copy) by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `C`.
    7.  After iterating through all possible middle positions `i`, return the modified output grid.
