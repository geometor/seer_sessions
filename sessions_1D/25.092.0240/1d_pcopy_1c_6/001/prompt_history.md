Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output data are presented as single lists of numbers. Given the nature of the transformation involving adjacent elements, it's most likely representing a 1-dimensional grid (a single row).
2.  **Colors**: Each example uses only two colors: white (0) and one other non-white color (maroon=9 in the first two examples, orange=7 in the third).
3.  **Objects**: The non-white pixels can be seen as forming objects. Some objects are single pixels, while others are contiguous horizontal lines of pixels (e.g., `9 9 9`).
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation seems to involve the expansion of *isolated* non-white pixels. Isolated pixels are those whose immediate horizontal neighbors are both white. When an isolated pixel is found, it and its immediate left and right neighbors are all set to that non-white color in the output, effectively turning a single pixel into a three-pixel horizontal line. Pixels that are part of larger non-white groups (not isolated) remain unchanged. White pixels that are not adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel also remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  Dimensionality: Assumed 1D (single row) based on transformation logic.
  Colors_Used:
    - white (0)
    - One non-white color per task instance (e.g., maroon=9, orange=7)

Objects:
  - Type: Non-white Pixels
    Properties:
      - Color: The specific non-white color used in the grid (e.g., 9 or 7).
      - Position: Index within the 1D grid.
      - State: Can be 'isolated' or 'part_of_group'.
        - Isolated: Both horizontal neighbors are white (or grid boundary).
        - Part_of_group: At least one horizontal neighbor has the same non-white color.

Actions:
  - Action: Expand
    Target: Isolated non-white pixels.
    Result: In the output grid, the target pixel and its immediate left and right neighbors are set to the target pixel's color.
    Condition: The target pixel must be 'isolated'.
  - Action: Copy
    Target: Non-isolated non-white pixels and all white pixels not affected by 'Expand'.
    Result: The pixel's color and position are maintained in the output grid.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Horizontal adjacency is key to determining if a pixel is isolated.
  - Input_Output_Mapping:
    - Isolated non-white pixel at index `i` in input maps to a 3-pixel block (`i-1`, `i`, `i+1`) of the same color in the output (boundary conditions apply).
    - Non-isolated non-white pixels map directly to the same index and color in the output.
    - White pixels map directly unless they become part of an expanded block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the single non-white color (let's call it `C`) present in the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at index `i` from left to right.
4.  If the pixel at index `i` has the color `C`:
    a.  Check the color of the pixel to its left (at `i-1`, if `i > 0`). Let `left_is_white` be true if `i=0` or the pixel at `i-1` is white (0).
    b.  Check the color of the pixel to its right (at `i+1`, if `i < grid_width - 1`). Let `right_is_white` be true if `i = grid_width - 1` or the pixel at `i+1` is white (0).
    c.  If both `left_is_white` and `right_is_white` are true, then the pixel at `i` is "isolated".
    d.  If the pixel at `i` is isolated:
        i.  In the *output* grid, set the color of the pixel at index `i` to `C`.
        ii. If `i > 0`, set the color of the pixel at index `i-1` in the *output* grid to `C`.
        iii. If `i < grid_width - 1`, set the color of the pixel at index `i+1` in the *output* grid to `C`.
5.  Pixels in the input grid that are not isolated non-white pixels retain their original color in the corresponding position in the output grid (this is handled by initializing the output as a copy and only modifying around isolated pixels).
6.  Return the final output grid.
