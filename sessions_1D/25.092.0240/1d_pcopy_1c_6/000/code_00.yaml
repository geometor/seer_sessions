Grid_Properties:
  Dimensionality: Assumed 1D (single row) based on transformation logic.
  Colors_Used:
    - white (0)
    - One non-white color per task instance (e.g., maroon=9, orange=7)

Objects:
  - Type: Non-white Pixels
    Properties:
      - Color: The specific non-white color used in the grid (e.g., 9 or 7).
      - Position: Index within the 1D grid.
      - State: Can be 'isolated' or 'part_of_group'.
        - Isolated: Both horizontal neighbors are white (or grid boundary).
        - Part_of_group: At least one horizontal neighbor has the same non-white color.

Actions:
  - Action: Expand
    Target: Isolated non-white pixels.
    Result: In the output grid, the target pixel and its immediate left and right neighbors are set to the target pixel's color.
    Condition: The target pixel must be 'isolated'.
  - Action: Copy
    Target: Non-isolated non-white pixels and all white pixels not affected by 'Expand'.
    Result: The pixel's color and position are maintained in the output grid.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Horizontal adjacency is key to determining if a pixel is isolated.
  - Input_Output_Mapping:
    - Isolated non-white pixel at index `i` in input maps to a 3-pixel block (`i-1`, `i`, `i+1`) of the same color in the output (boundary conditions apply).
    - Non-isolated non-white pixels map directly to the same index and color in the output.
    - White pixels map directly unless they become part of an expanded block.
