Given the nature of the transformation involving adjacent elements, it's most likely representing a 1-dimensional grid (a single row).\n2.  **Colors**: Each example uses only two colors: white (0) and one other non-white color (maroon=9 in the first two examples, orange=7 in the third).\n3.  **Objects**: The non-white pixels can be seen as forming objects. Some objects are single pixels, while others are contiguous horizontal lines of pixels (e.g., `9 9 9`).\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation seems to involve the expansion of *isolated* non-white pixels. Isolated pixels are those whose immediate horizontal neighbors are both white. When an isolated pixel is found, it and its immediate left and right neighbors are all set to that non-white color in the output, effectively turning a single pixel into a three-pixel horizontal line. Pixels that are part of larger non-white groups (not isolated) remain unchanged. White pixels that are not adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel also remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Let `right_is_white` be true if `i = grid_width - 1` or the pixel at `i+1` is white (0).\n    c.
