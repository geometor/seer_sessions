Existing horizontal \nlines of three identical non-white pixels remain unchanged. The expansion \noverwrites any existing pixels in the target locations.\n\n1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid at row `r` and column `c`.\n3. If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid is non-white (value > 0):\n   a. Check if this pixel is isolated horizontally. A pixel is considered isolated \n      if its immediate left neighbor (if it exists) and its immediate right \n      neighbor (if it exists) are either the background color (0) or a \n      different color than the pixel itself.\n   b. If the pixel at `(r, c)` is identified as isolated and non-white:\n      i. Get the color `C` of the pixel `input_grid[r, c]`.\n      ii. In the output grid, set the pixel at `(r, c)` to color `C`. \n         (This is already true from the initial copy, but confirms intent).\n      iii. If the column `c + 1` is within the grid bounds, set the pixel \n          at `(r, c + 1)` in the output grid to color `C`.\n      iv. If the column `c + 2` is within the grid bounds, set the pixel \n          at `(r, c + 2)` in the output grid to color `C`.\n4.
