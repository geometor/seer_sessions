            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous code correctly identified the need to differentiate between single non-white pixels and existing horizontal triplets. However, it failed because the implementation of the expansion rule was incorrect. The code expanded the single pixel `P` at `(r, c)` into a triplet `P P P` starting at `(r, c)` and extending to `(r, c+2)`. The training examples show that the single pixel `P` at `(r, c)` should become the *center* of the new triplet, resulting in `P P P` at positions `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c)`, and `(r, c+1)`, provided these indices are within the grid bounds. The strategy is to correct the expansion logic in the natural language program and the subsequent code.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Let's confirm the grid dimensions and analyze the objects in each example.\n    "
