"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying isolated, non-white pixels and expanding 
them into a horizontal line of three pixels of the same color, starting from 
the original pixel's position and extending to the right. Existing horizontal 
lines of three identical non-white pixels remain unchanged. The expansion 
overwrites any existing pixels in the target locations.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid at row `r` and column `c`.
3. If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid is non-white (value > 0):
   a. Check if this pixel is isolated horizontally. A pixel is considered isolated 
      if its immediate left neighbor (if it exists) and its immediate right 
      neighbor (if it exists) are either the background color (0) or a 
      different color than the pixel itself.
   b. If the pixel at `(r, c)` is identified as isolated and non-white:
      i. Get the color `C` of the pixel `input_grid[r, c]`.
      ii. In the output grid, set the pixel at `(r, c)` to color `C`. 
         (This is already true from the initial copy, but confirms intent).
      iii. If the column `c + 1` is within the grid bounds, set the pixel 
          at `(r, c + 1)` in the output grid to color `C`.
      iv. If the column `c + 2` is within the grid bounds, set the pixel 
          at `(r, c + 2)` in the output grid to color `C`.
4. Pixels that were part of the original grid and were not identified as isolated, 
   non-white pixels remain unchanged in the output grid (due to the initial copy 
   and lack of modification).
5. Return the modified output grid.
