*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are grids of pixels, likely 3 rows by 11 columns based on the data length (33) and visual grouping in the examples.
    *   The primary elements are the background (white pixels, value 0) and foreground objects.
    *   Foreground objects in the input consist of either single pixels of a specific color (gray, yellow, orange) or horizontal lines of three identical pixels of that same color.
    *   The transformation specifically targets the single-pixel objects.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9).
      grid_dimensions_analysis: Input/output data has 33 values; assuming 3x11 grid structure based on visual patterns.
      background_color: white (0).
      foreground_colors_observed: gray (5), yellow (4), orange (7).
    object_definitions:
      - object_type: background
        pixels: All cells with value 0.
        properties: Static unless overwritten.
      - object_type: colored_pixel_group
        pixels: Contiguous cells with the same non-zero color value.
        connectivity: Assumed horizontal adjacency primarily relevant.
    input_features:
      - feature: Single Pixels
        description: Isolated non-white pixels. Examples - gray at (0,9) in train_1; yellow at (0,9), (1,5), (1,9) in train_2; orange at (0,6), (1,1), (1,5) in train_3.
        properties: Color varies (gray, yellow, orange); Size is 1x1.
      - feature: Horizontal Triplet
        description: Horizontal line of 3 identical non-white pixels. Examples - gray `5 5 5` in train_1; yellow `4 4 4` in train_2; orange `7 7 7` in train_3.
        properties: Color varies; Size is 1x3.
    transformation_observations:
      - action: Expansion
        target: Single non-white pixels found in the input grid.
        result: The single pixel is expanded into a horizontal triplet (1x3 line) of the same color, starting at the original pixel's position and extending to the right.
        overwrite_behavior: Expansion overwrites any existing pixels (including white background) in the target locations.
      - action: Preservation
        target: Horizontal triplets (1x3 lines) already present in the input grid.
        result: These objects remain unchanged in the output grid.
      - relationship: The transformation depends on the shape/size of the non-white object in the input. Single pixels are expanded; existing 1x3 lines are kept.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid, checking its row `r` and column `c`.
    3.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid is non-white (not 0):
        a.  Check if this pixel is part of a horizontal line of three identical pixels starting at `(r, c-2)`, `(r, c-1)`, or `(r, c)` in the *input* grid. Specifically, check if it satisfies the condition for being a single pixel object: it must be non-white AND it must NOT be the case that (`input[r, c] == input[r, c+1] == input[r, c+2]`) AND it must NOT be the case that (`input[r, c-1] == input[r, c] == input[r, c+1]`) AND it must NOT be the case that (`input[r, c-2] == input[r, c-1] == input[r, c]`).
        b.  A simpler way to identify the target pixels: Check if the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid is non-white AND it is *not* followed immediately to the right by two more pixels of the *same* color (i.e., `input[r, c+1]` or `input[r, c+2]` are either out of bounds, white, or a different color) AND it is *not* preceded immediately to the left by two pixels of the *same* color (similar check for `input[r, c-1]` and `input[r, c-2]`).
        c.  Alternative rule formulation (Object-based): Identify all connected components (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid. If an object consists of exactly one pixel located at `(r, c)` with color `C`:
            i.  In the *output* grid, ensure the pixel at `(r, c)` retains color `C`.
            ii. If the column `c+1` is within the grid bounds, change the pixel at `(r, c+1)` in the *output* grid to color `C`.
            iii. If the column `c+2` is within the grid bounds, change the pixel at `(r, c+2)` in the *output* grid to color `C`.
    4.  Pixels belonging to input objects that are *not* single pixels (i.e., the existing 1x3 horizontal lines) remain unchanged in the output grid because they were copied initially and are not modified by step 3c.
    5.  Return the modified output grid.
