Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid, checking its row `r` and column `c`.\n    3.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid is non-white (not 0):\n        a.  Check if this pixel is part of a horizontal line of three identical pixels starting at `(r, c-2)`, `(r, c-1)`, or `(r, c)` in the *input* grid. Specifically, check if it satisfies the condition for being a single pixel object: it must be non-white AND it must NOT be the case that (`input[r, c] == input[r, c+1] == input[r, c+2]`) AND it must NOT be the case that (`input[r, c-1] == input[r, c] == input[r, c+1]`) AND it must NOT be the case that (`input[r, c-2] == input[r, c-1] == input[r, c]`).\n        b.  A simpler way to identify the target pixels: Check if the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid is non-white AND it is *not* followed immediately to the right by two more pixels of the *same* color (i.e., `input[r, c+1]` or `input[r, c+2]` are either out of bounds, white, or a different color) AND it is *not* preceded immediately to the left by two pixels of the *same* color (similar check for `input[r, c-1]` and `input[r, c-2]`).\n        c.  Alternative rule formulation (Object-based): Identify all connected components (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid. If an object consists of exactly one pixel located at `(r, c)` with color `C`:\n            i.  In the *output* grid, ensure the pixel at `(r, c)` retains color `C`.\n            ii. If the column `c+1` is within the grid bounds, change the pixel at `(r, c+1)` in the *output* grid to color `C`.\n            iii. If the column `c+2` is within the grid bounds, change the pixel at `(r, c+2)` in the *output* grid to color `C`.\n    4.  Pixels belonging to input objects that are *not* single pixels (i.e., the existing 1x3 horizontal lines) remain unchanged in the output grid because they were copied initially and are not modified by step 3c.\n    5.  Return the modified output grid."
