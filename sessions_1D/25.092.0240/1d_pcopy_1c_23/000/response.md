*   **Perception of the Elements:**
    *   The input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays).
    *   Each input grid contains segments of a single non-white color (e.g., gray, magenta, yellow) separated by white pixels (0).
    *   These non-white segments represent "objects" of varying lengths.
    *   The output grid modifies the input by replacing all occurrences of the non-white objects with copies of the *longest* object of that color found in the input.
    *   The replacement starts at the original starting position of each object.
    *   The color of the objects remains the same.
    *   The background white pixels remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
        color: non-white (consistent within one example, e.g., gray, magenta, yellow)
        properties:
          - length: number of pixels in the segment
          - start_position: column index of the first pixel
    transformation:
      - action: identify_objects
        input: input_grid
        criteria: contiguous non-white pixels
        output: list of objects (color, length, start_position)
      - action: find_max_length_object
        input: list of objects
        criteria: maximum length for the specific non-white color
        output: template_object (color, max_length, start_position - position is not strictly needed for the template itself, just its shape/content)
      - action: replace_objects
        input: input_grid, list of objects, template_object
        output: output_grid
        logic: Iterate through all identified objects in the input. For each object's start_position, write the template_object into the output grid, starting at that position.
    constraints:
      - Only one non-white color per input grid.
      - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
      - Background pixels remain unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input row to identify the single non-white color present.
    2.  Locate all contiguous horizontal segments (objects) composed of this non-white color. Record the starting position and length of each segment.
    3.  Determine the maximum length found among these segments.
    4.  Define the "template segment" as a segment of the non-white color with this maximum length.
    5.  Create a new output row, initially identical to the input row.
    6.  For each non-white segment identified in step 2:
        a.  Starting at the segment's original starting position in the output row, overwrite the pixels with the "template segment".
    7.  Return the modified output row.
