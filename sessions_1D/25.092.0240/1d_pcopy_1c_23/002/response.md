**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt resulted in a `list index out of range` error for all training examples. Manual simulation of the logic (`target_start = original_start` for the first object, `target_start = original_start - 1` for subsequent objects, clamping negative starts to 0, and placing the max-length template) correctly produced the expected output for all three examples. This suggests the core logic derived from the examples is likely correct, but there might be a subtle implementation error, an unhandled edge case (perhaps related to grid boundaries), or an issue with how the code interacts with the testing environment (e.g., input format assumptions).

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-verify the core logic against the examples.
2.  Gather detailed metrics about the objects in each example to ensure no properties were missed.
3.  Refine the Natural Language Program to be extremely precise about the object identification and placement steps, particularly the starting index calculation for placing the template segment.
4.  Assume the previous implementation had a bug related to indexing or boundary conditions, even though it wasn't immediately obvious, and provide a clear specification for the coder phase.
