Grid:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  size_preservation: True (width and height remain unchanged)
Colors:
  background: white (0)
  foreground: One non-white color (varies per task, e.g., orange-7, red-2, yellow-4)
Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: (white or foreground color)
      - position: (column index)
  - type: Segment
    properties:
      - color: (foreground color)
      - pixels: contiguous sequence of same-colored foreground pixels
Relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    definition: Pixels immediately to the left or right of a given pixel within the row bounds.
Transformation:
  type: Conditional Pixel Update
  target: white (0) pixels
  condition: A white pixel is changed to the foreground color C if and only if it is adjacent (left or right) to a pixel of color C, AND the pixel on the *other* side of that color C pixel is also white (0) or out of the grid bounds.
  effect: Changes the targeted white pixel's color to the foreground color C.
  preservation: Pixels that are originally the foreground color remain unchanged. White pixels not meeting the condition remain white.
