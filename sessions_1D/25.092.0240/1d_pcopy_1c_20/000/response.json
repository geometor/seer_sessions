            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use input and output grids that are 1-dimensional (single row arrays). The length of the row remains constant from input to output (33 pixels in the provided example `train_1`).\n2.  **Colors:** Each example involves two colors: white (0) as the background and one other non-white color (orange-7 in `train_1`, red-2 in `train_2`, yellow-4 in `train_3`). The specific non-white color changes between examples but is consistent within a single input-output pair.\n3.  **Objects/Patterns:** The non-white pixels appear either as isolated single pixels or as contiguous horizontal segments (e.g., `7 7 7` in `train_1`).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve changing some white pixels adjacent to non-white pixels into that non-white color. Specifically, isolated non-white pixels in the input appear to become segments of three identical non-white pixels in the output, centered at the original position. Existing segments of non-white pixels seem unchanged, and the white pixels adjacent to the *ends* of these segments also remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
