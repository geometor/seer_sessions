Okay, let's analyze the provided examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use input and output grids that are 1-dimensional (single row arrays). The length of the row remains constant from input to output (33 pixels in the provided example `train_1`).
2.  **Colors:** Each example involves two colors: white (0) as the background and one other non-white color (orange-7 in `train_1`, red-2 in `train_2`, yellow-4 in `train_3`). The specific non-white color changes between examples but is consistent within a single input-output pair.
3.  **Objects/Patterns:** The non-white pixels appear either as isolated single pixels or as contiguous horizontal segments (e.g., `7 7 7` in `train_1`).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve changing some white pixels adjacent to non-white pixels into that non-white color. Specifically, isolated non-white pixels in the input appear to become segments of three identical non-white pixels in the output, centered at the original position. Existing segments of non-white pixels seem unchanged, and the white pixels adjacent to the *ends* of these segments also remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  size_preservation: True (width and height remain unchanged)
Colors:
  background: white (0)
  foreground: One non-white color (varies per task, e.g., orange-7, red-2, yellow-4)
Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: (white or foreground color)
      - position: (column index)
  - type: Segment
    properties:
      - color: (foreground color)
      - pixels: contiguous sequence of same-colored foreground pixels
Relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    definition: Pixels immediately to the left or right of a given pixel within the row bounds.
Transformation:
  type: Conditional Pixel Update
  target: white (0) pixels
  condition: A white pixel is changed to the foreground color C if and only if it is adjacent (left or right) to a pixel of color C, AND the pixel on the *other* side of that color C pixel is also white (0) or out of the grid bounds.
  effect: Changes the targeted white pixel's color to the foreground color C.
  preservation: Pixels that are originally the foreground color remain unchanged. White pixels not meeting the condition remain white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the single non-white color (let's call it `C`) present in the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid at column index `i`.
4.  If the pixel `input[i]` has color `C`:
    a.  Examine the left neighbor at index `i-1`.
    b.  Examine the right neighbor at index `i+1`.
    c.  **Left Fill Condition:** If the left neighbor `input[i-1]` exists (i.e., `i > 0`) AND `input[i-1]` is white (0) AND (the right neighbor `input[i+1]` does not exist (i.e., `i` is the last index) OR `input[i+1]` is white (0)), then change the corresponding pixel in the output grid `output[i-1]` to color `C`.
    d.  **Right Fill Condition:** If the right neighbor `input[i+1]` exists (i.e., `i < width - 1`) AND `input[i+1]` is white (0) AND (the left neighbor `input[i-1]` does not exist (i.e., `i == 0`) OR `input[i-1]` is white (0)), then change the corresponding pixel in the output grid `output[i+1]` to color `C`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
