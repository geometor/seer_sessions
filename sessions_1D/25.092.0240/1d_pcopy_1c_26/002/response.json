            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core concept of \"isolated\" non-white pixels triggering a transformation. However, the implementation failed due to two main issues:\n\n1.  **Input Parsing:** The code did not correctly interpret the flat list input representation. The 33 elements represent an 11x3 grid (11 rows, 3 columns), but the code seemed to process it incorrectly, leading to nonsensical output dimensions or logic application.\n2.  **Transformation Scope:** The logic incorrectly applied the fill operation globally (filling *all* rows with the color of the *first* detected isolated pixel) instead of locally (filling *only the specific row* where an isolated pixel was found).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Ensure the flat input list is reshaped into the correct 2D grid dimensions (11x3) before processing.\n2.  **Refine Transformation Logic:** Modify the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to:\n    *   Iterate through the grid to identify isolated non-white pixels.\n    *   For each row containing one or more isolated pixels, determine the color of *one* such pixel (the examples suggest all isolated pixels within a modified row share the same color, or the effect is consistent regardless of which one is chosen).\n    *   Fill *only that specific row* in the output grid with the identified color.\n    *   Ensure rows *without* any isolated pixels are copied unchanged from the input to the output.\n3.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use code execution to confirm grid dimensions and the locations/colors of isolated pixels in each example.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"
