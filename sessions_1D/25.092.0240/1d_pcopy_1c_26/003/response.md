"""
Identifies non-white pixels (value > 0) in the input grid that are "horizontally isolated". 
A pixel is horizontally isolated if its immediate left and right neighbors within the same row are both white (value 0). 
Pixels in the first or last column only need to check their single horizontal neighbor.
For each row containing at least one such horizontally isolated pixel, the entire row in the output grid is filled with the color of that horizontally isolated pixel. 
If multiple horizontally isolated pixels exist in the same row, the examples suggest they share the same color, so any one of their colors can be used.
Rows that do not contain any horizontally isolated non-white pixels remain unchanged from the input.
