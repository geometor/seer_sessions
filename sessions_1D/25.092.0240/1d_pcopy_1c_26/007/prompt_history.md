*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are grids. Based on the number of elements (33) and the visual structure suggested by the examples, the grids are likely 11 rows by 3 columns (11x3).
    *   Each example features a white background (color 0) and one other color (maroon 9, azure 8, gray 5).
    *   The core transformation involves identifying specific non-white pixels in the input and modifying their entire row in the output.
    *   The non-white pixels that trigger this change appear to be *isolated*. An isolated pixel is one that is not adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any other non-white pixel.
    *   When an isolated non-white pixel is found, its corresponding row in the output grid is filled entirely with that pixel's color.
    *   Non-white pixels that are *not* isolated (i.e., they are part of a larger shape or touch another non-white pixel) remain unchanged in the output.
    *   White pixels remain white unless they are part of a row that gets filled by the color of an isolated pixel.

*   **Facts:**

      condition: applies to rows containing at least one isolated non-white pixel
      action:
        - identify all isolated non-white pixels in the input grid.
        - for each identified isolated pixel:
            - determine its color (C) and row index (R).
            - in the output grid, set all pixels in row R to color C.
      unchanged_elements:
        - rows containing no isolated non-white pixels remain identical to the input rows.
        - note: non-isolated non-white pixels within a modified row are overwritten.
    
    relationships:
      - pixel_neighbor: adjacency (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) used to determine isolation.
      - pixel_to_row: a pixel belongs to a specific row.
      - isolated_pixel_triggers_row_fill: an isolated pixel dictates the color fill for its entire row.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row, column) that is not white (color > 0).
    3.  For each non-white pixel, check all 8 of its neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    4.  Determine if the current non-white pixel is "isolated": count how many of its neighbors are *not* white. If this count is zero, the pixel is isolated.
    5.  If a non-white pixel at (row, column) with color C is found to be isolated:
        a.  Modify the output grid by setting the color of *all* pixels in the `row`-th row to C.
    6.  After checking all non-white pixels, the final state of the output grid represents the result. (Note: If multiple isolated pixels exist in the same row, the last one processed by the iteration order would determine the final row color, but based on the examples, it seems only one isolated pixel exists per row that gets modified, or all isolated pixels in a row share the same color). A slightly better approach is to first identify all rows that need modification based on containing *any* isolated pixel, then perform the modification. Let's refine:
    
    **Refined Natural Language Program:**
    1. Create a list to store the row indices and colors of isolated pixels found: `isolated_pixels_info = []`.
    2. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row, col).
    3. If the pixel `input[row][col]` is not white:
        a. Check all 8 neighbors of `input[row][col]`.
        b. Count the number of non-white neighbors.
        c. If the count is 0, then the pixel is isolated. Record its row index and color: add `(row, input[row][col])` to `isolated_pixels_info`.
    4. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    5. Iterate through the recorded `isolated_pixels_info`. For each `(row, color)` pair:
        a. Set all pixels in the `row`-th row of the output grid to `color`.
    6. Return the final output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis incorrectly converged on a "horizontally isolated" rule, leading to code (`code_00.py`) that failed testing. The test results, showing entire grids being filled, were initially confusing but likely stemmed from a misinterpretation of the input/output format (1D string vs. 2D grid) during testing or visualization, rather than a fundamental flaw in the row-filling logic of the code *intended* for the correct rule.

Re-analyzing the examples with the assumed 11x3 grid dimensions strongly supports the *initial* hypothesis: the transformation identifies non-white pixels that are "isolated" from all 8 neighbors (including diagonals) and fills the entire row containing such an isolated pixel with its color. This rule consistently explains all three training pairs.

The strategy is to revert to the 8-neighbor isolation rule, verify its logic against the examples again, and update the documentation (facts, natural language program) accordingly. The code corresponding to this rule (the first Python block proposed in the previous step) should be the correct implementation, assuming the input is correctly parsed as an 11x3 grid.

**Metrics:**

Let's analyze the examples assuming an 11x3 grid structure and the 8-neighbor isolation rule.

Overall Rule Consistency (8-neighbor isolation): False

```
**Revised Assessment:**

The code execution reveals that the 8-neighbor isolation rule is *also incorrect*.
- Example 1 works as expected.
- Example 2: The rule identifies row 4 should be filled (correct), but the *expected output* also shows row 2 filled. My rule doesn't explain row 2. The pixel 8 at (2,1) is *not* isolated by the 8-neighbor rule because of the 8s at (1,0) and (1,1).
- Example 3: The rule identifies isolated pixels in row 4 (at col 0) and row 5 (at col 2), predicting rows 4 and 5 should be filled. However, the *expected output* shows modifications in rows 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, none of which are simple row fills based on the identified isolated pixels.

This invalidates the 8-neighbor isolation hypothesis. Let's rethink.

What is special about the pixels that *do* cause changes?
- Ex1: Pixel (3, 1) = 9. Input row 3 = `[0, 9, 0]`. Output row 3 = `[9, 9, 9]`. This pixel *is* 8-neighbor isolated.
- Ex2: Pixel (4, 1) = 8. Input row 4 = `[0, 8, 0]`. Output row 4 = `[8, 8, 8]`. This pixel *is* 8-neighbor isolated.
- Ex2: Pixel (2, 1) = 8. Input row 2 = `[0, 8, 0]`. Output row 2 = `[8, 8, 8]`. This pixel is *not* 8-neighbor isolated. Why does it cause a change? Its neighbors are `[8,8,0]` above, `[0,0,0]` below. Horizontally, its neighbors are `0` (left) and `0` (right). Maybe the rule is horizontal isolation only?
- Ex3: Pixel (4, 0) = 5. Input row 4 = `[5, 0, 0]`. Output row 4 = `[5, 5, 0]`.
- Ex3: Pixel (5, 2) = 5. Input row 5 = `[0, 0, 5]`. Output row 5 = `[0, 5, 5]`.
- Ex3: Pixel (2, 1) = 5. Input row 2 = `[0, 5, 0]`. Output row 2 = `[5, 5, 5]`. Horizontally isolated.
- Ex3: Row 3: Input `[0,0,0]` -> Output `[0,0,5]`. Why? Maybe related to pixel (2,1) or (4,0)?
- Ex3: Row 6: Input `[0,0,0]` -> Output `[5,0,0]`. Why? Maybe related to pixel (5,2)?

Let's reconsider "Horizontal Isolation": A non-white pixel P at (r, c) is horizontally isolated if `grid[r, c-1]` is white (or c=0) AND `grid[r, c+1]` is white (or c=cols-1).

- Ex1: (3, 1) = 9. Left=0, Right=0. Horizontally isolated. -> Fill row 3. Matches output.
- Ex2: (2, 1) = 8. Left=0, Right=0. Horizontally isolated. -> Fill row 2. Matches output row 2.
- Ex2: (4, 1) = 8. Left=0, Right=0. Horizontally isolated. -> Fill row 4. Matches output row 4. Matches output.
- Ex3: (2, 1) = 5. Left=0, Right=0. Horizontally isolated. -> Fill row 2. Matches output row 2.
- Ex3: (4, 0) = 5. Left=N/A, Right=0. Horizontally isolated. -> Fill row 4. Matches output row 4.
- Ex3: (5, 2) = 5. Left=0, Right=N/A. Horizontally isolated. -> Fill row 5. Matches output row 5.

This "horizontal isolation" rule seems to correctly identify *which* rows should be filled and *what color* to use for the fill. Now, let's verify the code execution with *this* rule.

**Final Assessment:**

Both the 8-neighbor isolation and the horizontal isolation rules fail to fully explain the transformations, particularly Example 3. The horizontal isolation rule correctly identifies *some* trigger pixels and predicts *some* row fills accurately (rows 2 and 4 in Ex2, row 2 in Ex3), but it also predicts fills for rows that aren't changed (row 0 in all examples) and fails to explain other changes (rows 3, 4, 5, 6 in Ex3).

There must be an additional condition or a different core logic. Let's reconsider the "horizontally isolated" pixels identified by the last analysis:
- Ex1: (0, 2)=9, (3, 1)=9. Output fills row 3.
- Ex2: (0, 2)=8, (2, 1)=8, (4, 1)=8. Output fills rows 2 and 4.
- Ex3: (0, 2)=5, (2, 1)=5, (4, 0)=5, (5, 2)=5. Output fills rows 2, 4, and 6. (Wait, previous analysis said output filled rows 2,3,4,5,6. Let me re-read Ex3 output: `0 0 5 5 5 0 | 5 5 5 | 0 0 0 | 5 5 5 | 0 0 0 | 5 5 5 | 0 0 0 ...`. Rows 0, 1 unchanged. Row 2 filled with 5. Row 3 unchanged. Row 4 filled with 5. Row 5 unchanged. Row 6 filled with 5. Rows 7+ unchanged. So, rows 2, 4, 6 are filled with 5).

**Revised Rule Hypothesis:**
1. Identify all non-white pixels that are "horizontally isolated" (white or grid boundary on left AND right).
2. *Filter* these: Only consider horizontally isolated pixels that are **not** in row 0.
3. For each row R containing at least one such *filtered* horizontally isolated pixel P:
    a. Determine the color C of P.
    b. Fill the entire row R in the output grid with color C.
4. All other rows remain unchanged.

Let's test this:
- Ex1: Horizontally isolated: (0, 2)=9, (3, 1)=9. Filtered (not row 0): (3, 1)=9. -> Fill row 3 with 9. **Matches output.**
- Ex2: Horizontally isolated: (0, 2)=8, (2, 1)=8, (4, 1)=8. Filtered (not row 0): (2, 1)=8, (4, 1)=8. -> Fill row 2 with 8, Fill row 4 with 8. **Matches output.**
- Ex3: Horizontally isolated: (0, 2)=5, (2, 1)=5, (4, 0)=5, (5, 2)=5. Filtered (not row 0): (2, 1)=5, (4, 0)=5, (5, 2)=5. -> Fill row 2 with 5, Fill row 4 with 5, Fill row 5 with 5. Output shows rows 2, 4, *6* filled.

Still a mismatch on Ex3 (row 5 vs row 6). Let's look at Ex3 input again:
Row 0: 0 0 5 -> H.Iso at (0,2) [IGNORE - row 0]
Row 1: 5 5 0
Row 2: 0 5 0 -> H.Iso at (2,1) -> Fill row 2 with 5. [OK]
Row 3: 0 0 0
Row 4: 5 0 0 -> H.Iso at (4,0) -> Fill row 4 with 5. [OK]
Row 5: 0 0 5 -> H.Iso at (5,2) -> Fill row 5 with 5. [MISMATCH - output fills row 6]
Row 6: 0 0 0
...

Is there a pattern in the *position* of the horizontally isolated pixel?
- Ex1: (3, 1) -> Fills row 3.
- Ex2: (2, 1) -> Fills row 2. (4, 1) -> Fills row 4.
- Ex3: (2, 1) -> Fills row 2. (4, 0) -> Fills row 4. (5, 2) -> Fills row **6** ???

Why would (5, 2) fill row 6? Is there an offset? Pixel at (5,2) triggers fill at row 5+1 = 6?
Let's check others:
- (3, 1) -> Fills row 3+0 = 3?
- (2, 1) -> Fills row 2+0 = 2?
- (4, 1) -> Fills row 4+0 = 4?
- (2, 1) -> Fills row 2+0 = 2?
- (4, 0) -> Fills row 4+0 = 4?

Maybe the offset depends on the *column* of the isolated pixel?
- Col 0: offset 0 (Ex3: (4,0) fills row 4)
- Col 1: offset 0 (Ex1: (3,1) fills row 3; Ex2: (2,1) fills row 2, (4,1) fills row 4; Ex3: (2,1) fills row 2)
- Col 2: offset +1 (Ex3: (5,2) fills row 6)

**Revised Rule Hypothesis 2:**
1. Identify all non-white pixels P at position (r, c) that are "horizontally isolated" (white or grid boundary on left AND right).
2. *Filter* these: Only consider pixels **not** in row 0.
3. For each *filtered* horizontally isolated pixel P at (r, c) with color C:
    a. Determine the target row R_target based on the column c:
        - If c = 0 or c = 1, R_target = r.
        - If c = 2 (last column), R_target = r + 1.
    b. Fill the entire row R_target in the output grid with color C. (Ensure R_target is within grid bounds).
4. All other rows remain unchanged. If multiple pixels target the same row, the last one processed would dominate (or assume they have same color). Let's assume colors are consistent if they map to the same row.

Testing this rule:
- Ex1: H.Iso (not row 0): (3, 1)=9. Col=1, target row=3. Fill row 3 with 9. **Matches output.**
- Ex2: H.Iso (not row 0): (2, 1)=8, (4, 1)=8.
    - (2, 1): Col=1, target row=2. Fill row 2 with 8.
    - (4, 1): Col=1, target row=4. Fill row 4 with 8. **Matches output.**
- Ex3: H.Iso (not row 0): (2, 1)=5, (4, 0)=5, (5, 2)=5.
    - (2, 1): Col=1, target row=2. Fill row 2 with 5.
    - (4, 0): Col=0, target row=4. Fill row 4 with 5.
    - (5, 2): Col=2, target row=5+1=6. Fill row 6 with 5. **Matches output.**

This rule works for all examples.

transformation:
  type: conditional_row_fill_with_offset
  steps:
    - copy input grid to output grid.
    - find all non-white pixels P at (r, c) in the input grid where r > 0.
    - check if P is horizontally isolated (left neighbor is white/boundary AND right neighbor is white/boundary).
    - if P at (r, c) with color C is horizontally isolated:
        - calculate target_row r_target = r if c < 2 else r + 1.
        - if r_target is a valid row index for the grid:
            - fill row r_target of the output grid entirely with color C.
    - return the modified output grid.

relationships:
  - pixel_neighbor: horizontal adjacency (left, right) used for isolation check.
  - trigger_pixel_to_target_row: column index of a trigger pixel determines if the target row is the same row or the next row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Create a dictionary `target_rows_to_fill` to store the target row index and the color to fill it with.
3.  Iterate through each row `r` of the input grid, starting from row 1 (skip row 0).
4.  Iterate through each column `c` in the current row `r`.
5.  Get the pixel color `C = input_grid[r][c]`.
6.  If the pixel is not white (`C > 0`):
    a.  Check if the pixel is horizontally isolated:
        i.  Is the left neighbor `input_grid[r][c-1]` white (or is `c == 0`)?
        ii. Is the right neighbor `input_grid[r][c+1]` white (or is `c == grid_width - 1`)?
    b.  If both conditions in (a) are true, the pixel at `(r, c)` is a trigger pixel.
        i.  Determine the target row `r_target`: If `c` is the last column index (`grid_width - 1`), then `r_target = r + 1`. Otherwise, `r_target = r`.
        ii. Store the instruction: `target_rows_to_fill[r_target] = C`. (If multiple triggers target the same row, the last one processed will define the color, which is consistent with examples).
7.  After checking all pixels, iterate through the `target_rows_to_fill` dictionary. For each `r_target`, `fill_color` pair:
    a. Check if `r_target` is a valid row index within the grid dimensions.
    b. If valid, set all pixels in row `r_target` of the output grid to `fill_color`.
8.  Return the final output grid.
