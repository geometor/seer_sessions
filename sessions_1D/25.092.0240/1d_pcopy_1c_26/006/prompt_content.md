"""
Identify non-white pixels (value > 0) in the input grid that meet two criteria:
1. They are "horizontally isolated": their immediate left and right neighbors within the same row are both white (value 0). Pixels in the first column only need their right neighbor to be white, and pixels in the last column only need their left neighbor to be white.
2. They are *not* located in the last column of the grid.

For each row containing at least one such pixel (a "trigger pixel"), fill the entire corresponding row in the output grid with the color of that trigger pixel. 
If multiple trigger pixels exist in the same row, the examples suggest they share the same color, so using the color of the first one found is sufficient.
Rows that do not contain any trigger pixels remain unchanged from the input.
