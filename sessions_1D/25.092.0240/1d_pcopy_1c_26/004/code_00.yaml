task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9)
  grid_dimensions: 11x3 (height x width) ثابت for all examples
  colors_present:
    - 0: white (background)
    - non-zero: foreground colors (maroon, azure, gray in examples)

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer 0-9
      position: (row, column)
      is_horizontally_isolated: boolean (true if left and right neighbors in the same row are white; edge columns check only the single existing horizontal neighbor)
      is_trigger: boolean (true if is_horizontally_isolated AND column index is not the last column index)

  - type: row
    properties:
      index: integer (0 to 10)
      pixels: list of 3 pixels

transformation:
  type: conditional_row_fill
  trigger_condition: Existence of at least one 'trigger' pixel within a row.
  action_on_trigger:
    - Identify all 'trigger' pixels (non-white, horizontally isolated, not in the last column).
    - For each row containing at least one trigger pixel:
        - Determine the color (C) of any one trigger pixel in that row (examples suggest all trigger pixels in a modified row share the same color).
        - In the output grid, set all pixels in that row to color C.
  unchanged_elements:
    - Rows containing no 'trigger' pixels remain identical to the corresponding input rows.
