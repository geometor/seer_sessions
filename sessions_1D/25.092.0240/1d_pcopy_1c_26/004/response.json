            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis identified a pattern related to isolated pixels triggering a row fill. The first code attempt (`code_00.py`), based on \"horizontal isolation\", failed to produce the correct outputs, generating grids where all rows were incorrectly filled. The subsequent analysis using the `tool_code` block and verification against expected outputs revealed that the simple \"horizontal isolation\" rule was insufficient.\n\nThe key insight came from comparing the rows where horizontal isolation occurred versus the rows that were actually modified in the output. Horizontally isolated pixels in the *last column* did not trigger a row fill, while those in the *middle column* did.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rule to incorporate this column constraint. The transformation is triggered only by non-white pixels that are horizontally isolated *and* are not located in the last column of the grid.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution and analysis:\n\n*   **Grid Dimensions:** All examples use an 11x3 grid (11 rows, 3 columns).\n*   **Horizontal Isolation Identification:**\n    *   Example 1: Horizontally isolated pixels found at (0, 2) and (3, 1).\n    *   Example 2: Horizontally isolated pixels found at (0, 2), (2, 1), and (4, 1).\n    *   Example 3: Horizontally isolated pixels found at (0, 2), (2, 1), (4, 1), and (6, 1).\n*   **Triggering Condition Verification:**\n    *   The rule \"fill row `r` if a horizontally isolated pixel exists at `(r, c)`\" is incorrect, as it would incorrectly fill row 0 in all examples.\n    *   The revised rule \"fill row `r` if a horizontally isolated pixel exists at `(r, c)` **where `c` is not the last column index**\" correctly predicts the filled rows in all examples:\n        *   Example 1: Pixel (3, 1) triggers fill for row 3. Pixel (0, 2) does not trigger. Matches output.\n        *   Example 2: Pixels (2, 1) and (4, 1) trigger fills for rows 2 and 4. Pixel (0, 2) does not trigger. Matches output.\n        *   Example 3: Pixels (2, 1), (4, 1), and (6, 1) trigger fills for rows 2, 4, and 6. Pixel (0, 2) does not trigger. Matches output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to `rows - 1`.\n5.  Iterate through each column `c` from 0 to `last_col_index`.\n6.  Get the pixel `P` and its color `C` at `input_grid[r][c]`.\n7.

Since a trigger is found for this row, we can stop checking other columns in this row and move to the next row (optimization).\n8.  After iterating through all relevant pixels, iterate through the `rows_to_fill` map.\n9.  For each `(row_index, fill_color)` pair in `rows_to_fill`:\n    a.
