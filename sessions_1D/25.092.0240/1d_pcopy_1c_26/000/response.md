*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are grids. Based on the number of elements (33) and the visual structure suggested by the examples, the grids are likely 11 rows by 3 columns (11x3).
    *   Each example features a white background (color 0) and one other color (maroon 9, azure 8, gray 5).
    *   The core transformation involves identifying specific non-white pixels in the input and modifying their entire row in the output.
    *   The non-white pixels that trigger this change appear to be *isolated*. An isolated pixel is one that is not adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any other non-white pixel.
    *   When an isolated non-white pixel is found, its corresponding row in the output grid is filled entirely with that pixel's color.
    *   Non-white pixels that are *not* isolated (i.e., they are part of a larger shape or touch another non-white pixel) remain unchanged in the output.
    *   White pixels remain white unless they are part of a row that gets filled by the color of an isolated pixel.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_representation: 2D array of integers (colors)
      grid_dimensions: inferred as 11x3 (height x width)
      colors_present:
        - 0: white (background)
        - non-zero: foreground colors (maroon, azure, gray in examples)
    
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: integer 0-9
          position: (row, column)
          is_isolated: boolean (true if all 8 neighbors are white, false otherwise)
      - type: row
        properties:
          index: integer (0 to height-1)
          pixels: list of pixels in the row
    
    transformation:
      type: conditional_row_fill
      condition: applies to rows containing at least one isolated non-white pixel
      action:
        - identify all isolated non-white pixels in the input grid.
        - for each identified isolated pixel:
            - determine its color (C) and row index (R).
            - in the output grid, set all pixels in row R to color C.
      unchanged_elements:
        - rows containing no isolated non-white pixels remain identical to the input rows.
        - note: non-isolated non-white pixels within a modified row are overwritten.
    
    relationships:
      - pixel_neighbor: adjacency (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) used to determine isolation.
      - pixel_to_row: a pixel belongs to a specific row.
      - isolated_pixel_triggers_row_fill: an isolated pixel dictates the color fill for its entire row.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row, column) that is not white (color > 0).
    3.  For each non-white pixel, check all 8 of its neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    4.  Determine if the current non-white pixel is "isolated": count how many of its neighbors are *not* white. If this count is zero, the pixel is isolated.
    5.  If a non-white pixel at (row, column) with color C is found to be isolated:
        a.  Modify the output grid by setting the color of *all* pixels in the `row`-th row to C.
    6.  After checking all non-white pixels, the final state of the output grid represents the result. (Note: If multiple isolated pixels exist in the same row, the last one processed by the iteration order would determine the final row color, but based on the examples, it seems only one isolated pixel exists per row that gets modified, or all isolated pixels in a row share the same color). A slightly better approach is to first identify all rows that need modification based on containing *any* isolated pixel, then perform the modification. Let's refine:
    
    **Refined Natural Language Program:**
    1. Create a list to store the row indices and colors of isolated pixels found: `isolated_pixels_info = []`.
    2. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row, col).
    3. If the pixel `input[row][col]` is not white:
        a. Check all 8 neighbors of `input[row][col]`.
        b. Count the number of non-white neighbors.
        c. If the count is 0, then the pixel is isolated. Record its row index and color: add `(row, input[row][col])` to `isolated_pixels_info`.
    4. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    5. Iterate through the recorded `isolated_pixels_info`. For each `(row, color)` pair:
        a. Set all pixels in the `row`-th row of the output grid to `color`.
    6. Return the final output grid.
