Based on the number of elements (33) and the visual structure suggested by the examples, the grids are likely 11 rows by 3 columns (11x3).\n    *   Each example features a white background (color 0) and one other color (maroon 9, azure 8, gray 5).\n    *   The core transformation involves identifying specific non-white pixels in the input and modifying their entire row in the output.\n    *   The non-white pixels that trigger this change appear to be *isolated*. An isolated pixel is one that is not adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any other non-white pixel.\n    *   When an isolated non-white pixel is found, its corresponding row in the output grid is filled entirely with that pixel's color.\n    *   Non-white pixels that are *not* isolated (i.e., they are part of a larger shape or touch another non-white pixel) remain unchanged in the output.\n    *   White pixels remain white unless they are part of a row that gets filled by the color of an isolated pixel.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row, column) that is not white (color > 0).\n    3.  For each non-white pixel, check all 8 of its neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).\n    4.  Determine if the current non-white pixel is \"isolated\": count how many of its neighbors are *not* white. If this count is zero, the pixel is isolated.\n    5.

After checking all non-white pixels, the final state of the output grid represents the result. (Note: If multiple isolated pixels exist in the same row, the last one processed by the iteration order would determine the final row color, but based on the examples, it seems only one isolated pixel exists per row that gets modified, or all isolated pixels in a row share the same color). A slightly better approach is to first identify all rows that need modification based on containing *any* isolated pixel, then perform the modification. Let's refine:\n    \n    **Refined Natural Language Program:**\n    1. Create a list to store the row indices and colors of isolated pixels found: `isolated_pixels_info = []`.\n    2. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row, col).\n    3. If the pixel `input[row][col]` is not white:\n        a. Check all 8 neighbors of `input[row][col]`.\n        b. Count the number of non-white neighbors.\n        c. If the count is 0, then the pixel is isolated. Record its row index and color: add `(row, input[row][col])` to `isolated_pixels_info`.\n    4. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    5. Iterate through the recorded `isolated_pixels_info`. For each `(row, color)` pair:\n        a. Set all pixels in the `row`-th row of the output grid to `color`.\n    6. Return the final output grid."
