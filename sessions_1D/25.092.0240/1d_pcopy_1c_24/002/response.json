            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation pattern: isolated non-white pixels expand horizontally. The provided code implemented this logic. However, the code failed during execution with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if my_numpy_array:`).\n\nThe error likely occurred in the initial input validation check: `if not input_grid or len(input_grid) != 1:`. When the testing environment passes the `input_grid` as a NumPy array, the `not input_grid` part triggers the ambiguity error.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Remove or adapt the problematic input validation check, assuming the execution environment provides valid NumPy arrays representing the grids.\n2.  Verify the core transformation logic against the examples based on the metrics.\n3.  Refine the natural language description and facts to be more precise about the transformation, particularly noting that only the neighboring white pixels change color.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution:\n\n"
