    name: isolated_pixel
    definition: A non-white pixel (color C > 0) at index 'i' whose immediate left neighbor (i-1) and immediate right neighbor (i+1) are both white (color 0).
    location: Indices 'i-1', 'i', 'i+1'
transformation:
  action: modify_neighbors
  target: white neighbors of isolated_pixels
  condition: A pixel is identified as part of an 'isolated_pixel' pattern (specifically, the central non-white pixel).
  effect: Change the color of the white pixel neighbors (at indices i-1 and i+1) to the color (C) of the central non-white pixel (at index i).
  preservation:
    - Pixels not part of an 'isolated_pixel' pattern (0 C 0) remain unchanged.
    - The central non-white pixel (C) in the 'isolated_pixel' pattern also remains unchanged (though it is rewritten with its own color in the implementation).
    - Non-white pixel sequences of length >= 2 are only affected if they are adjacent to a white pixel that gets changed by this rule (which doesn't happen in the examples).
input_source_for_conditions: The conditions (checking for the 0 C 0 pattern) are evaluated based solely on the original input grid.
output_grid: A grid of the same dimensions as the input, modified according to the transformation rule. Modifications are based on patterns found in the original input.
