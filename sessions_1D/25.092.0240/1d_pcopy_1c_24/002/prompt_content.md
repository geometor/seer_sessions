```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by expanding isolated non-white pixels.

An isolated non-white pixel is defined as a pixel with a value greater than 0 
that has white (0) pixels immediately to its left and right.

When such an isolated pixel is found at index 'i', the sequence of three pixels 
[white (i-1), non-white (i), white (i+1)] in the input grid is replaced by 
[non-white (i), non-white (i), non-white (i)] in the output grid, using the 
color of the original pixel at index 'i'.

Pixels at the edges (index 0 and index width-1) cannot be the center of 
such a sequence and are therefore never expanded. Existing sequences of 
non-white pixels (length >= 2) are not affected by this rule unless they 
contain an isolated pixel satisfying the condition within a larger white gap.
