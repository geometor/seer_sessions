*   **Perception:** The task operates on single-row grids (1xN). Each example uses white (0) as a background color and one other color (yellow, blue, or azure). The transformation involves modifying sequences of the non-white color. Specifically, isolated non-white pixels (pixels surrounded by white pixels on both sides) are expanded horizontally into a sequence of three identical pixels, overwriting the adjacent white pixels. Existing sequences of three or more non-white pixels remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
    background_color: 0 # White
    objects:
      - type: pixel_sequence
        color: non-white # Yellow (4), Blue (1), Azure (8) in examples
        properties:
          - length: Integer (number of contiguous pixels)
          - position: Start and end indices
          - context: Neighboring pixels (especially if they are white)
    transformation:
      action: conditional_expansion
      target: isolated_pixels # Non-white pixels with white neighbors on both sides
      condition: pixel is non-white AND left_neighbor is white AND right_neighbor is white
      effect: replace the sequence [white, pixel, white] with [pixel, pixel, pixel]
      preservation: non-white pixel sequences of length >= 3 are unchanged
    output_grid: Same dimensions as input, modified according to the transformation rule.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid from the second pixel (index 1) up to the second-to-last pixel (index width-2).
    3.  For the current pixel at index `i`:
        a.  Check if the pixel is non-white (value > 0).
        b.  Check if the pixel to its left (index `i-1`) is white (value 0).
        c.  Check if the pixel to its right (index `i+1`) is white (value 0).
    4.  If all three conditions (non-white current pixel, white left neighbor, white right neighbor) are true:
        a.  Get the color of the current pixel.
        b.  Set the pixel at index `i-1` in the output grid to this color.
        c.  Set the pixel at index `i` in the output grid to this color.
        d.  Set the pixel at index `i+1` in the output grid to this color.
    5.  Return the modified output grid.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation pattern: isolated non-white pixels expand horizontally. The provided code implemented this logic. However, the code failed during execution with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if my_numpy_array:`).

The error likely occurred in the initial input validation check: `if not input_grid or len(input_grid) != 1:`. When the testing environment passes the `input_grid` as a NumPy array, the `not input_grid` part triggers the ambiguity error.

The strategy is to:
1.  Remove or adapt the problematic input validation check, assuming the execution environment provides valid NumPy arrays representing the grids.
2.  Verify the core transformation logic against the examples based on the metrics.
3.  Refine the natural language description and facts to be more precise about the transformation, particularly noting that only the neighboring white pixels change color.

## Metrics

**Findings:**
*   All examples consist of 1x33 grids.
*   The transformation consistently identifies isolated non-white pixels (a non-white pixel C at index `i` where index `i-1` and `i+1` are white).
*   Example 1 has 1 isolated pixel at index 6.
*   Example 2 has 2 isolated pixels at indices 8 and 12.
*   Example 3 has 3 isolated pixels at indices 9, 13, and 19.
*   The number of pixels changed between the input and output grids is exactly twice the number of isolated pixels found (`match: True` for all). This confirms that for each `0 C 0` pattern, the transformation changes the two `0` pixels to `C`, resulting in `C C C`.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows (1xN)
background_color: 0 # White
objects:
  - type: pixel_sequence
    color: non-white # Yellow (4), Blue (1), Azure (8) in examples
    properties:
      - length: Integer (number of contiguous pixels)
      - position: Indices
  - type: pattern
    name: isolated_pixel
    definition: A non-white pixel (color C > 0) at index 'i' whose immediate left neighbor (i-1) and immediate right neighbor (i+1) are both white (color 0).
    location: Indices 'i-1', 'i', 'i+1'
transformation:
  action: modify_neighbors
  target: white neighbors of isolated_pixels
  condition: A pixel is identified as part of an 'isolated_pixel' pattern (specifically, the central non-white pixel).
  effect: Change the color of the white pixel neighbors (at indices i-1 and i+1) to the color (C) of the central non-white pixel (at index i).
  preservation:
    - Pixels not part of an 'isolated_pixel' pattern (0 C 0) remain unchanged.
    - The central non-white pixel (C) in the 'isolated_pixel' pattern also remains unchanged (though it is rewritten with its own color in the implementation).
    - Non-white pixel sequences of length >= 2 are only affected if they are adjacent to a white pixel that gets changed by this rule (which doesn't happen in the examples).
input_source_for_conditions: The conditions (checking for the 0 C 0 pattern) are evaluated based solely on the original input grid.
output_grid: A grid of the same dimensions as the input, modified according to the transformation rule. Modifications are based on patterns found in the original input.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid's single row, examining each pixel from the second position (index 1) up to the second-to-last position (index width-2). Let the current index be `i`.
3.  For each pixel at index `i`, check the corresponding pixels in the *original input grid*:
    a.  Is the pixel at index `i` non-white (color > 0)?
    b.  Is the pixel at index `i-1` (left neighbor) white (color 0)?
    c.  Is the pixel at index `i+1` (right neighbor) white (color 0)?
4.  If all three conditions are true (an "isolated non-white pixel" is found):
    a.  Identify the color (let's call it `C`) of the non-white pixel at index `i` in the input grid.
    b.  In the *output grid*, change the color of the pixel at index `i-1` to `C`.
    c.  In the *output grid*, change the color of the pixel at index `i+1` to `C`.
    d.  (Optionally, for clarity or robustness: In the output grid, set the color of the pixel at index `i` to `C`, although it already has this color from the initial copy).
5.  After iterating through all possible center positions (`i` from 1 to width-2), return the modified output grid.
