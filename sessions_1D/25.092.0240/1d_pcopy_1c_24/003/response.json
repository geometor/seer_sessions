The central pixel itself \nremains unchanged (or is effectively overwritten with its own color). \nPixels not involved in such a pattern are copied unchanged from input to output.\n\nThe transformation is based solely on patterns found in the original input grid; \nchanges made during the process do not influence the detection of other patterns \nwithin the same transformation step.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the isolated pixel expansion transformation to a 1D grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists or NumPy array representing the 1xN input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the 1xN output grid after transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to NumPy array for efficient processing\n    # Assuming input_grid is always a list containing one list (the row)\n    # or a 2D numpy array with shape (1, N)\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n\n    # Ensure it's a 1xN grid\n    if input_np.ndim != 2 or input_np.shape[0] != 1:\n        # Handle unexpected dimensions if necessary, perhaps raise error\n        # For now, assume correct input format based on examples\n        # If input might be 1D array directly: input_np = input_np.reshape(1, -1)\n        pass # Or raise ValueError(\"Input must be a 1xN grid\")\n\n    input_row = input_np[0]\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input numpy array\n    # Working on a copy ensures we reference the original input for conditions\n    output_np = np.copy(input_np)\n    output_row = output_np[0]\n\n    # Iterate through the pixels, checking for the isolated non-white pattern\n    # We only need to check indices from 1 up to width-2 (exclusive),\n    # as the pattern requires neighbors on both sides.\n    for i in range(1, width - 1):\n        # Get the current pixel color and its neighbors from the *original* input row\n        current_pixel_color = input_row[i]\n        left_neighbor_color = input_row[i-1]\n        right_neighbor_color = input_row[i+1]\n\n        # Check the condition: non-white pixel surrounded by white pixels\n        if current_pixel_color > 0 and left_neighbor_color == 0 and right_neighbor_color == 0:\n            # Apply the transformation to the output grid\n            # Change the color of the white neighbors to the central pixel's color\n            output_row[i-1] = current_pixel_color\n            # output_row[i] remains current_pixel_color (already copied)\n            output_row[i+1] = current_pixel_color\n\n    # Convert the result back to a list of lists format\n    output_grid = output_np.tolist()\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
