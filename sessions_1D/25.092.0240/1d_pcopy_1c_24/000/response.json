The transformation involves modifying sequences of the non-white color. Specifically, isolated non-white pixels (pixels surrounded by white pixels on both sides) are expanded horizontally into a sequence of three identical pixels, overwriting the adjacent white pixels. Existing sequences of three or more non-white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
