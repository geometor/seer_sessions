"""
Transforms an 11x3 grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify the primary non-white color (foreground_color, C) in the input grid.
2. Find the index (header_row_index, R) of the first row (scanning top-to-bottom)
   that contains more than one pixel of the foreground_color.
   If no such row exists, or if no foreground color exists, the output is identical
   to the input.
3. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4. Iterate through the rows below the header_row_index (i.e., from R + 1 to the
   last row).
5. For each row 'i' in this range:
   a. If the corresponding row in the *input* grid contains exactly one pixel
      of the foreground_color C at column index 'j':
      i. If j = 0 (left column), set output row 'i' to [C, C, 0].
      ii. If j = 1 (middle column), set output row 'i' to [C, C, C].
      iii. If j = 2 (right column), set output row 'i' to [0, C, C].
   b. Otherwise (if the input row 'i' has 0, 2, or 3 foreground pixels),
      the output row 'i' remains unchanged from the initial copy.
6. Rows at or above header_row_index R also remain unchanged.
7. Return the modified grid, flattened into a list.
