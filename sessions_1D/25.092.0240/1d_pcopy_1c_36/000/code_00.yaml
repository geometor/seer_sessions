Grid_Dimensions:
  Height: 11
  Width: 3
Colors:
  Background: 0 (white)
  Foreground: Variable per example (6: magenta, 9: maroon, 5: gray), consistent within each input-output pair.
Objects:
  - Type: Header_Pattern
    Description: The first group of non-white pixels encountered (scanning top-to-bottom) that spans more than one pixel within a single row. Its row defines a boundary.
    Location: Variable, typically near the top rows.
    Properties: Contains >= 2 non-white pixels in its row. Color matches the task's foreground color.
  - Type: Isolated_Pixel
    Description: A single non-white pixel in a row, located below the Header_Pattern's row.
    Location: Rows below the Header_Pattern row.
    Properties: Exactly 1 non-white pixel in the row. Color matches the task's foreground color.
  - Type: Target_Row
    Description: A row containing three non-white pixels of the foreground color.
    Location: Corresponds to rows in the input that contained an Isolated_Pixel (below the Header_Pattern).
Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Relationship: Spatial (Below) - Isolated_Pixels targeted for transformation are located in rows below the row containing the Header_Pattern.
  - Action: Expansion - Rows containing Isolated_Pixels (below the header) are transformed into Target_Rows.
  - Action: Preservation - Rows at or above the Header_Pattern row, and rows below it that do not contain exactly one non-white pixel, are copied unchanged from input to output.
Rule_Trigger:
  - Condition: A row must be below the first row containing >1 non-white pixel.
  - Condition: The row must contain exactly one non-white pixel.
