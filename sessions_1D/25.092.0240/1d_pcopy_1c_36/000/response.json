            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be flattened representations of 2D grids. Analyzing the number of elements (33) and the patterns across the three examples suggests a consistent grid size of 11 rows by 3 columns.\n2.  **Colors:** Each example pair uses white (0) as the background and a single distinct non-white color for the foreground patterns: magenta (6) in the first, maroon (9) in the second, and gray (5) in the third. The output grid retains the same non-white color as its corresponding input.\n3.  **Objects/Patterns:** The non-white pixels form patterns. In the input grids, there's typically a pattern near the top involving two or more connected pixels (a \"header\" pattern), followed by rows containing single isolated non-white pixels below it.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to affect the rows containing single, isolated non-white pixels. These single pixels are expanded horizontally into a full row of three non-white pixels of the same color in the output grid.\n5.  **Conditional Logic:** This expansion doesn't happen to all single pixels. It specifically applies only to rows *below* the first row (from the top) that contains more than one non-white pixel. Rows at or above this \"header\" row, and rows below it that don't contain exactly one non-white pixel, remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid row by row, from top (row 0) to bottom (row 10). Find the index (`R`) of the *first* row that contains more than one pixel of color `C`. If no such row exists, the output is identical to the input.\n3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n4.  Iterate through the rows of the input grid from index `R + 1` down to row 10.\n5.  For each of these rows (`i`), count the number of pixels with color `C`.\n6.  If the count for row `i` is exactly 1, modify the corresponding row `i` in the output grid to consist of three pixels of color `C` (i.e., `[C, C, C]`).\n7.  If the count for row `i` is not 1 (i.e., 0, 2, or 3), leave row `i` in the output grid unchanged from the initial copy.\n8.  The rows from 0 to `R` (inclusive) in the output grid remain unchanged from the input grid.\n9.  Return the modified grid as the output."
