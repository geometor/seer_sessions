Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be flattened representations of 2D grids. Analyzing the number of elements (33) and the patterns across the three examples suggests a consistent grid size of 11 rows by 3 columns.
2.  **Colors:** Each example pair uses white (0) as the background and a single distinct non-white color for the foreground patterns: magenta (6) in the first, maroon (9) in the second, and gray (5) in the third. The output grid retains the same non-white color as its corresponding input.
3.  **Objects/Patterns:** The non-white pixels form patterns. In the input grids, there's typically a pattern near the top involving two or more connected pixels (a "header" pattern), followed by rows containing single isolated non-white pixels below it.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to affect the rows containing single, isolated non-white pixels. These single pixels are expanded horizontally into a full row of three non-white pixels of the same color in the output grid.
5.  **Conditional Logic:** This expansion doesn't happen to all single pixels. It specifically applies only to rows *below* the first row (from the top) that contains more than one non-white pixel. Rows at or above this "header" row, and rows below it that don't contain exactly one non-white pixel, remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Dimensions:
  Height: 11
  Width: 3
Colors:
  Background: 0 (white)
  Foreground: Variable per example (6: magenta, 9: maroon, 5: gray), consistent within each input-output pair.
Objects:
  - Type: Header_Pattern
    Description: The first group of non-white pixels encountered (scanning top-to-bottom) that spans more than one pixel within a single row. Its row defines a boundary.
    Location: Variable, typically near the top rows.
    Properties: Contains >= 2 non-white pixels in its row. Color matches the task's foreground color.
  - Type: Isolated_Pixel
    Description: A single non-white pixel in a row, located below the Header_Pattern's row.
    Location: Rows below the Header_Pattern row.
    Properties: Exactly 1 non-white pixel in the row. Color matches the task's foreground color.
  - Type: Target_Row
    Description: A row containing three non-white pixels of the foreground color.
    Location: Corresponds to rows in the input that contained an Isolated_Pixel (below the Header_Pattern).
Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Relationship: Spatial (Below) - Isolated_Pixels targeted for transformation are located in rows below the row containing the Header_Pattern.
  - Action: Expansion - Rows containing Isolated_Pixels (below the header) are transformed into Target_Rows.
  - Action: Preservation - Rows at or above the Header_Pattern row, and rows below it that do not contain exactly one non-white pixel, are copied unchanged from input to output.
Rule_Trigger:
  - Condition: A row must be below the first row containing >1 non-white pixel.
  - Condition: The row must contain exactly one non-white pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the primary non-white color (let's call it `C`) present in the 11x3 input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid row by row, from top (row 0) to bottom (row 10). Find the index (`R`) of the *first* row that contains more than one pixel of color `C`. If no such row exists, the output is identical to the input.
3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the rows of the input grid from index `R + 1` down to row 10.
5.  For each of these rows (`i`), count the number of pixels with color `C`.
6.  If the count for row `i` is exactly 1, modify the corresponding row `i` in the output grid to consist of three pixels of color `C` (i.e., `[C, C, C]`).
7.  If the count for row `i` is not 1 (i.e., 0, 2, or 3), leave row `i` in the output grid unchanged from the initial copy.
8.  The rows from 0 to `R` (inclusive) in the output grid remain unchanged from the input grid.
9.  Return the modified grid as the output.
