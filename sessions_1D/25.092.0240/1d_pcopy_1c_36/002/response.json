            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided validation results indicate that the initial Python code failed to produce the correct output for any of the training examples. However, a detailed manual trace of the code's logic against the *expected* outputs suggests the code *should* have worked correctly for all three examples. The \"Transformed Output\" listed in the validation results for examples 1 and 2 does not match what the provided code logic would produce. Furthermore, for example 3, the listed \"Transformed Output\" *matches* the expected output, yet the result is marked as \"Match: False\".\n\nThis suggests a potential discrepancy between the code presented, the execution environment that produced the validation results, or the reporting of those results.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Assumptions:** Use `tool_code` to confirm basic properties like grid dimensions and the identified header row for one example, based on the *input* data.\n2.  **Re-affirm Logic:** Since the manual trace indicates the code aligns with the transformation seen in the *expected* outputs, the core logic will be retained.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for maximum clarity, explicitly stating the conditions for transformation.\n4.  **Highlight Discrepancy:** Note the inconsistency observed in the validation report for future reference or potential debugging of the validation process itself.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
