"""
Transforms an 11x3 grid by identifying a 'header' row and modifying subsequent rows.

1.  Determine the grid dimensions (assumed 11x3).
2.  Identify the single non-white color used in the input grid (the `foreground_color`). If only white (0) is present, the output is identical to the input.
3.  Scan the input grid from top to bottom to find the index (`header_row_index`) of the first row containing more than one pixel of the `foreground_color`.
4.  If no such header row is found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
5.  If a header row is found:
    *   Create the output grid, initially as a copy of the input grid.
    *   Iterate through each row of the input grid starting from the row *after* the header row (index `header_row_index + 1`) down to the last row.
    *   For each row in this range, count the number of pixels matching the `foreground_color`.
    *   If the count is exactly 1, replace the *entire corresponding row* in the output grid with the `foreground_color`.
    *   Rows at or above the `header_row_index`, and rows below it where the count of `foreground_color` pixels is *not* exactly 1, remain unchanged from the input grid copy.
6.  Return the final output grid, flattened into a list.
