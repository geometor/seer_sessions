"""
Transforms an 11x3 grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify the primary non-white color (foreground_color) in the input grid.
2. Find the index (header_row_index) of the first row (scanning top-to-bottom)
   that contains more than one pixel of the foreground_color.
   If no such row exists, the output is identical to the input.
3. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4. Iterate through the rows below the header_row_index (i.e., from
   header_row_index + 1 to the last row).
5. For each row in this range, if it contains exactly one pixel of the
   foreground_color, change all three pixels in that row of the output grid
   to the foreground_color.
6. Rows at or above header_row_index, and rows below it that do not contain
   exactly one foreground_color pixel, remain unchanged.
7. Return the modified grid, flattened into a list.
