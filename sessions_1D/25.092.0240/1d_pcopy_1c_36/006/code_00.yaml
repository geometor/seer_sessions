Grid_Dimensions:
  Height: 11
  Width: 3
Colors:
  Background: 0 (white)
  Foreground: Variable (6: magenta, 9: maroon, 5: gray), consistent per example. Determined as the most frequent non-zero color.
Objects:
  - Type: Foreground_Pixel
    Description: A pixel with the foreground color C.
  - Type: Header_Row
    Description: The first row (scanning top-to-bottom) containing more than one Foreground_Pixel.
    Location: Index R. Defines the boundary for transformations.
    Properties: Contains >= 2 pixels of color C. Remains unchanged in the output.
  - Type: Trigger_Pixel
    Description: A single Foreground_Pixel within a row below the Header_Row.
    Location: Row index i > R, Column index j (0, 1, or 2).
    Properties: The row contains exactly one Foreground_Pixel.
  - Type: Target_Row
    Description: A row in the output grid corresponding to an input row that contained a Trigger_Pixel. The pattern depends on the Trigger_Pixel's column.
    Location: Row index i > R.
Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Relationship: Spatial (Below) - Transformations only apply to rows below the Header_Row.
  - Action: Conditional Transformation - Rows below the Header_Row are transformed *only if* they contain exactly one Foreground_Pixel (a Trigger_Pixel).
  - Transformation Rule (based on Trigger_Pixel column j):
      - If j = 0 (left): Output row becomes [C, C, 0]. (Hypothesized based on symmetry, no direct example).
      - If j = 1 (middle): Output row becomes [C, C, C]. (Examples 1, 2, 3).
      - If j = 2 (right): Output row becomes [0, C, C]. (Example 3).
  - Action: Preservation - Rows at or above the Header_Row index R, and rows below R that do *not* contain exactly one Foreground_Pixel, are copied unchanged from input to output.
Anomaly:
  - Context: Example 3, Row 3 (index 3).
  - Input Row: [0, 0, 0]
  - Expected Output Row: [5, 0, 0]
  - Status: This transformation is not explained by the primary Conditional Transformation rule, as the input row does not contain a Trigger_Pixel. It remains an exception.
