task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
color_usage:
  - background: white (0)
  - foreground: one single non-white color (C) per example (variable C)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: non-white (C)
    attributes:
      - position (index)
relationships:
  - type: span
    definition: The range of indices from the minimum index of a non-white pixel to the maximum index of a non-white pixel in the input row.
    color: C
actions:
  - type: identify_color
    description: Determine the single non-white color (C) present in the input grid.
  - type: find_indices
    description: Find all indices where the non-white color (C) appears in the input grid.
  - type: calculate_span
    description: Determine the minimum (min_idx) and maximum (max_idx) indices found in the previous step.
  - type: fill_span
    input: original grid, color C, min_idx, max_idx
    output: modified grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid, then changing the color of all pixels from index min_idx to max_idx (inclusive) to the non-white color C.
