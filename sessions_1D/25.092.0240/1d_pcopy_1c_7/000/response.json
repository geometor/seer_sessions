The non-white color is consistent within each input/output pair but varies between pairs.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** The input grid contains scattered pixels of the non-white color, sometimes forming small contiguous blocks, separated by white pixels.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid retains the white pixels outside the range of the non-white pixels. Within the range defined by the first and last non-white pixel in the input, all pixels (including the originally white ones) are filled with the non-white color.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies the span covered by the non-white pixels in the input row (from the first occurrence to the last occurrence) and fills this entire span with that non-white color in the output row.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
