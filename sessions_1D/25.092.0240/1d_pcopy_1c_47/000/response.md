Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single rows (1xN grids).
2.  **Color Palette:** Each example uses only two colors: white (0) and one other color (azure (8) in train\_1, maroon (9) in train\_2, orange (7) in train\_3). Let's call the non-white color the "primary color".
3.  **Input Pattern:** The input rows contain contiguous blocks of the primary color, separated by one or more white pixels. These blocks can have varying lengths (e.g., length 3 and length 1 in train\_1).
4.  **Output Pattern:** The output rows also contain contiguous blocks of the primary color separated by white pixels. However, in the output, *all* blocks of the primary color have a fixed length of 3 pixels.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to locate each contiguous block of the primary color in the input. For each such block found, regardless of its original length, it places a block of *three* pixels of the primary color in the output grid. The starting position of the output block corresponds to the starting position of the original input block. The original content of the grid at the positions where the new 3-pixel block is placed is overwritten.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - grid_type: 1D array (row vector)
  - colors:
      - white (0): background
      - primary_color (non-zero): varies per example (8, 9, 7)
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: primary_color
        location: input grid
        properties:
          - start_index: integer
          - length: integer (can vary)
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: primary_color
        location: output grid
        properties:
          - start_index: integer (matches input block start_index)
          - length: fixed at 3
  - relationships:
      - mapping: Each input `contiguous_block` maps to exactly one output `contiguous_block`.
      - positional_invariance: The `start_index` of the output block is the same as the `start_index` of the corresponding input block.
  - actions:
      - identify: Detect the primary_color in the input.
      - locate: Find the start_index of every contiguous_block of the primary_color in the input.
      - generate: Create an output grid initialized with white (0), matching the input dimensions.
      - replace: For each located start_index in the input, write a sequence of three primary_color pixels into the output grid, starting at that same index. Overwrite existing values if necessary.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Identify the primary color present in the input grid (the single non-white color).
3.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right using an index `i`.
4.  At each index `i`, check if the pixel at `input[i]` is the primary color AND if it marks the beginning of a contiguous block of that color (i.e., either `i` is 0, or the pixel at `input[i-1]` is white).
5.  If both conditions in step 4 are true, then place a block of three pixels of the primary color into the output grid, starting at index `i`. Specifically, set `output[i]`, `output[i+1]`, and `output[i+2]` to the primary color (ensure checks for grid boundaries if necessary, although the examples suggest this won't go out of bounds).
6.  Continue iterating through the input grid until the end.
7.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
