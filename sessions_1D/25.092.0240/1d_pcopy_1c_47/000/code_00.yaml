task_elements:
  - grid_type: 1D array (row vector)
  - colors:
      - white (0): background
      - primary_color (non-zero): varies per example (8, 9, 7)
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: primary_color
        location: input grid
        properties:
          - start_index: integer
          - length: integer (can vary)
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: primary_color
        location: output grid
        properties:
          - start_index: integer (matches input block start_index)
          - length: fixed at 3
  - relationships:
      - mapping: Each input `contiguous_block` maps to exactly one output `contiguous_block`.
      - positional_invariance: The `start_index` of the output block is the same as the `start_index` of the corresponding input block.
  - actions:
      - identify: Detect the primary_color in the input.
      - locate: Find the start_index of every contiguous_block of the primary_color in the input.
      - generate: Create an output grid initialized with white (0), matching the input dimensions.
      - replace: For each located start_index in the input, write a sequence of three primary_color pixels into the output grid, starting at that same index. Overwrite existing values if necessary.
