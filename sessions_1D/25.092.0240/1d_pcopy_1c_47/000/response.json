Let's call the non-white color the \"primary color\".\n3.  **Input Pattern:** The input rows contain contiguous blocks of the primary color, separated by one or more white pixels. These blocks can have varying lengths (e.g., length 3 and length 1 in train\\_1).\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output rows also contain contiguous blocks of the primary color separated by white pixels. However, in the output, *all* blocks of the primary color have a fixed length of 3 pixels.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to locate each contiguous block of the primary color in the input. For each such block found, regardless of its original length, it places a block of *three* pixels of the primary color in the output grid. The starting position of the output block corresponds to the starting position of the original input block. The original content of the grid at the positions where the new 3-pixel block is placed is overwritten.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the primary color present in the input grid (the single non-white color).\n3.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right using an index `i`.\n4.  At each index `i`, check if the pixel at `input[i]` is the primary color AND if it marks the beginning of a contiguous block of that color (i.e., either `i` is 0, or the pixel at `input[i-1]` is white).\n5.  If both conditions in step 4 are true, then place a block of three pixels of the primary color into the output grid, starting at index `i`. Specifically, set `output[i]`, `output[i+1]`, and `output[i+2]` to the primary color (ensure checks for grid boundaries if necessary, although the examples suggest this won't go out of bounds).\n6.  Continue iterating through the input grid until the end.\n7.  The final state of the output grid is the result."
