*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The task operates on single-row grids containing primarily white (0) pixels and some magenta (6) pixels.
    *   The core pattern involves sequences of three consecutive magenta pixels (`6 6 6`) and isolated single magenta pixels (`0 6 0`).
    *   The transformation replaces isolated magenta pixels with the three-pixel sequence.
    *   Existing three-pixel sequences in the input are preserved in the output.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
    2.  Iterate through the input row, examining each pixel from the second position up to the second-to-last position. Let the current index be `i`.
    3.  Check if the pattern `[white, magenta, white]` (i.e., `[0, 6, 0]`) exists starting at index `i-1` in the *input* row.
    4.  If this pattern is found, modify the *output* row by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to magenta (6).
    5.  After checking all relevant positions, return the modified output row.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Input must be a list containing at least one list (row)

## Example 2:
Error: Input must be a list containing at least one list (row)

## Example 3:
Error: Input must be a list containing at least one list (row)
*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The error `ValueError: Input must be a list containing at least one list (row)` occurred consistently across all training examples. This strongly suggests the issue lies not in the core transformation logic itself (replacing `[0, 6, 0]` with `[6, 6, 6]`), but in how the function expects and handles the input data format.
    *   The previous code explicitly checks `isinstance(input_grid, list)` and `isinstance(input_grid[0], list)`, assuming a list-of-lists structure like `[[...]]`. The error implies the data provided during testing might be a simple list `[...]`, a NumPy array, or another format that doesn't pass these checks.
    *   The transformation logic identified previously (replacing isolated magenta pixels surrounded by white with a sequence of three magenta pixels) appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples.
*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Modify the input handling part of the `transform` function to be more robust. It should correctly extract the single row of data, potentially handling both list-of-lists `[[...]]` and NumPy array `np.array([[...]])` formats, which are common representations for ARC grids.
    2.  Retain the core iteration and replacement logic, as it seems to align with the observed transformations.
    3.  Verify the dimensions and structure of the input/output pairs using code execution.

*   **Metrics:**
    Let's check the structure and dimensions of the examples. Since the provided format is just the sequence of numbers, we'll assume they represent a single row.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a 2D NumPy array, typically with a shape of (1, N).
    2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
    3.  Create a mutable copy of the input row (e.g., convert to a list or copy the NumPy array) to serve as the basis for the output row.
    4.  Iterate through the *original* input row using an index `i`, scanning from the second element (index 1) up to the second-to-last element (index length - 2). This allows checking the element at `i` along with its left (`i-1`) and right (`i+1`) neighbors.
    5.  At each position `i`, check if the sequence of pixels `[input_row[i-1], input_row[i], input_row[i+1]]` matches the pattern `[white, magenta, white]` (i.e., `[0, 6, 0]`).
    6.  If the pattern `[0, 6, 0]` is found in the input row, modify the *copied* output row by setting the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to magenta (6).
    7.  After iterating through all relevant positions in the input row, convert the modified output row back into the required output format (a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N)).
    8.  Return the resulting 2D NumPy array.
