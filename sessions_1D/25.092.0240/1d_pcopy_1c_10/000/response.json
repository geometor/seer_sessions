            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation process for these examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both inputs and outputs are single rows (1D arrays) of pixels represented by numbers 0-9. 0 represents white, and other numbers represent different colors (red=2, yellow=4 in the examples).\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation seems to operate on individual non-white pixels. Specifically, it identifies non-white pixels that are \"isolated\".\n3.  **Isolation Condition:** A non-white pixel appears to be considered \"isolated\" if its immediate left and right neighbors are white (0) or if it's at the edge of the row and the adjacent pixel is white.\n4.  **Action on Isolated Pixels:** When an isolated pixel of color `C` is found at a position `i`, it expands into a horizontal block of three pixels of color `C`. This block replaces the pixels at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the output. Care must be taken for pixels at the very beginning or end of the row.\n5.  **Handling Non-Isolated Pixels:** Non-white pixels that are already part of a contiguous horizontal block of the same color (e.g., the `2 2 2` or `4 4 4` blocks in the inputs) are *not* modified; they remain as they are in the output.\n6.  **White Pixels:** White pixels (0) generally remain white unless they are adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel, in which case they are overwritten by the expansion of that isolated pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel in the input row using its index `i` from left to right (from index 0 to the last index).\n3.  For the pixel at index `i`, check its color `C`.\n4.  If the color `C` is not white (i.e., `C != 0`):\n    a.  Check if the pixel to the left (at `i-1`) is white (0) or if `i` is 0 (left edge).\n    b.
