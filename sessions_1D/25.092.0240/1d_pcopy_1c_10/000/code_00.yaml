Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (single row)
  Element: Pixel
Pixel:
  Properties:
    - Color: Integer (0-9)
    - Position: Index (integer >= 0)
    - IsWhite: Boolean (Color == 0)
    - IsIsolated: Boolean (Applies to non-white pixels)
        Condition: (Pixel is non-white) AND ((Left neighbor is white OR is leftmost pixel) AND (Right neighbor is white OR is rightmost pixel))
Object:
  - Isolated Pixel: A non-white pixel satisfying the IsIsolated condition.
  - Contiguous Block: A sequence of 2 or more adjacent pixels of the same non-white color.
Action:
  - Expand: Replace an isolated pixel and its immediate neighbors with a block of three pixels of the isolated pixel's color.
    Target: Isolated Pixel at index `i`.
    Result: Output pixels at indices `max(0, i-1)`, `i`, `min(width-1, i+1)` are set to the isolated pixel's color.
  - Copy: Transfer a pixel's color from input to output without modification.
    Target: Non-isolated pixels (both white and non-white pixels part of blocks).
TransformationRule:
  - Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
  - Identify isolated non-white pixels based on their neighbors.
  - Create an output grid, initially identical to the input.
  - For each identified isolated pixel, apply the Expand action to the corresponding location in the output grid.
Relationship:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are adjacent if their indices differ by 1. Crucial for determining isolation and contiguous blocks.
