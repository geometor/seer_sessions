If a non-white pixel is found that is \"isolated\" \n(meaning its immediate left and right neighbors are white, or it's at an edge \nadjacent to white), expand this pixel into a horizontal block of three pixels \nof the same color in the output row, overwriting the original position and its \nneighbors.
