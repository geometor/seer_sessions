Okay, let's break down the transformation process for these examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both inputs and outputs are single rows (1D arrays) of pixels represented by numbers 0-9. 0 represents white, and other numbers represent different colors (red=2, yellow=4 in the examples).
2.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation seems to operate on individual non-white pixels. Specifically, it identifies non-white pixels that are "isolated".
3.  **Isolation Condition:** A non-white pixel appears to be considered "isolated" if its immediate left and right neighbors are white (0) or if it's at the edge of the row and the adjacent pixel is white.
4.  **Action on Isolated Pixels:** When an isolated pixel of color `C` is found at a position `i`, it expands into a horizontal block of three pixels of color `C`. This block replaces the pixels at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the output. Care must be taken for pixels at the very beginning or end of the row.
5.  **Handling Non-Isolated Pixels:** Non-white pixels that are already part of a contiguous horizontal block of the same color (e.g., the `2 2 2` or `4 4 4` blocks in the inputs) are *not* modified; they remain as they are in the output.
6.  **White Pixels:** White pixels (0) generally remain white unless they are adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel, in which case they are overwritten by the expansion of that isolated pixel.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (single row)
  Element: Pixel
Pixel:
  Properties:
    - Color: Integer (0-9)
    - Position: Index (integer >= 0)
    - IsWhite: Boolean (Color == 0)
    - IsIsolated: Boolean (Applies to non-white pixels)
        Condition: (Pixel is non-white) AND ((Left neighbor is white OR is leftmost pixel) AND (Right neighbor is white OR is rightmost pixel))
Object:
  - Isolated Pixel: A non-white pixel satisfying the IsIsolated condition.
  - Contiguous Block: A sequence of 2 or more adjacent pixels of the same non-white color.
Action:
  - Expand: Replace an isolated pixel and its immediate neighbors with a block of three pixels of the isolated pixel's color.
    Target: Isolated Pixel at index `i`.
    Result: Output pixels at indices `max(0, i-1)`, `i`, `min(width-1, i+1)` are set to the isolated pixel's color.
  - Copy: Transfer a pixel's color from input to output without modification.
    Target: Non-isolated pixels (both white and non-white pixels part of blocks).
TransformationRule:
  - Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
  - Identify isolated non-white pixels based on their neighbors.
  - Create an output grid, initially identical to the input.
  - For each identified isolated pixel, apply the Expand action to the corresponding location in the output grid.
Relationship:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are adjacent if their indices differ by 1. Crucial for determining isolation and contiguous blocks.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial output row.
2.  Iterate through each pixel in the input row using its index `i` from left to right (from index 0 to the last index).
3.  For the pixel at index `i`, check its color `C`.
4.  If the color `C` is not white (i.e., `C != 0`):
    a.  Check if the pixel to the left (at `i-1`) is white (0) or if `i` is 0 (left edge).
    b.  Check if the pixel to the right (at `i+1`) is white (0) or if `i` is the last index (right edge).
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, then the pixel at `i` is "isolated".
    d.  If the pixel at `i` is isolated:
        i.  Set the color of the pixel at index `i` in the output row to `C`.
        ii. If `i > 0`, set the color of the pixel at index `i-1` in the output row to `C`.
        iii. If `i < length-1` (where `length` is the total number of pixels in the row), set the color of the pixel at index `i+1` in the output row to `C`.
5.  If the pixel at index `i` is white (color 0) or is non-white but *not* isolated, its value in the output row remains unchanged from the initial copy made in step 1.
6.  After iterating through all input pixels, the modified output row is the final result.
