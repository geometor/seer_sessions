            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (or grids with a single row) of pixels represented by integers (colors). The length of the output array is the same as the input array.\n2.  **Colors:** The examples use white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4), red (2), and green (3). The transformation preserves the colors present but changes their arrangement and repetition.\n3.  **Background:** The predominant color is white (0), acting as a background or separator.\n4.  **Objects/Patterns:**\n    *   We see sequences of identical non-white colors (e.g., `8 8 8`, `4 4 4`). These sequences appear unchanged in the output.\n    *   We also see single non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (e.g., `0 6 0`, `0 2 0`, `0 3 0`, `0 8 0`).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to target the single non-white pixels that are adjacent to white pixels on both sides. When such a pattern (`0 X 0`, where X is non-white) is found, it is replaced by a sequence of three pixels of color X (`X X X`). Pixels that are part of longer sequences (like `8 8 8`) or are not surrounded by white pixels on both sides remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the input array from the second element up to the second-to-last element (index 1 to length-2).\n3.  For each element at index `i`:\n    *   Check if the pixel at `i` is non-white (value > 0).\n    *   Check if the pixel at index `i-1` (left neighbor) is white (value 0).\n    *   Check if the pixel at index `i+1` (right neighbor) is white (value 0).\n4.
