Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (or grids with a single row) of pixels represented by integers (colors). The length of the output array is the same as the input array.
2.  **Colors:** The examples use white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4), red (2), and green (3). The transformation preserves the colors present but changes their arrangement and repetition.
3.  **Background:** The predominant color is white (0), acting as a background or separator.
4.  **Objects/Patterns:**
    *   We see sequences of identical non-white colors (e.g., `8 8 8`, `4 4 4`). These sequences appear unchanged in the output.
    *   We also see single non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (e.g., `0 6 0`, `0 2 0`, `0 3 0`, `0 8 0`).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to target the single non-white pixels that are adjacent to white pixels on both sides. When such a pattern (`0 X 0`, where X is non-white) is found, it is replaced by a sequence of three pixels of color X (`X X X`). Pixels that are part of longer sequences (like `8 8 8`) or are not surrounded by white pixels on both sides remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1 # Assumed based on examples looking like 1xN grids
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_sequence
    min_length: 3
    color: non-white
    action: copy # These sequences are copied as-is
  - type: isolated_pixel
    color: non-white
    context: adjacent pixels on both sides are background_color (0)
    action: expand # The isolated pixel 'expands' to fill its neighbors
transformation_rule:
  - condition: pixel sequence matches [0, C, 0] where C > 0
    action: replace sequence with [C, C, C] in the output grid
  - condition: pixel does not meet the above condition
    action: copy pixel value from input to output at the same position
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output array of the same size as the input array, initially identical to the input.
2.  Iterate through the input array from the second element up to the second-to-last element (index 1 to length-2).
3.  For each element at index `i`:
    *   Check if the pixel at `i` is non-white (value > 0).
    *   Check if the pixel at index `i-1` (left neighbor) is white (value 0).
    *   Check if the pixel at index `i+1` (right neighbor) is white (value 0).
4.  If all three conditions are true:
    *   Let the color of the pixel at index `i` be `C`.
    *   Set the pixels in the output array at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.
5.  Pixels not modified by step 4 retain their original value from the input.
6.  Return the modified output array.
