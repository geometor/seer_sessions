task_type: array_transformation_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1 # Assumed based on examples looking like 1xN grids
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_sequence
    min_length: 3
    color: non-white
    action: copy # These sequences are copied as-is
  - type: isolated_pixel
    color: non-white
    context: adjacent pixels on both sides are background_color (0)
    action: expand # The isolated pixel 'expands' to fill its neighbors
transformation_rule:
  - condition: pixel sequence matches [0, C, 0] where C > 0
    action: replace sequence with [C, C, C] in the output grid
  - condition: pixel does not meet the above condition
    action: copy pixel value from input to output at the same position
