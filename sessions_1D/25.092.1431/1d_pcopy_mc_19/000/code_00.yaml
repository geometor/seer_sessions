task_description: >
  Identify single, isolated non-white pixels in the input grid and expand them horizontally to the right to form a 1x3 line of the same color. Leave all other pixels (background white pixels and non-white objects larger than a single pixel) unchanged.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions_preserved: true

object_definitions:
  - type: pixel
    description: A single cell with a non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0)
      - size: 1x1
  - type: line
    description: A horizontal sequence of three pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0)
      - size: 1x3
      - orientation: horizontal

transformation_rules:
  - condition: Input object is a single non-white pixel.
    action:
      - type: expand
      - direction: horizontal, right
      - extent: Add two pixels of the same color to the right.
      - result: A 1x3 horizontal line of the original color, starting at the original pixel's position.
  - condition: Input object is a non-white object larger than a single pixel.
    action:
      - type: copy
      - result: The object remains unchanged in the output.
  - condition: Input pixel is white (0).
    action:
      - type: copy
      - result: The pixel remains white (0) in the output.

relationships:
  - The transformation targets individual pixels based on their color and context (being isolated).
  - Existing larger objects are unaffected by the transformation applied to single pixels.
