            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions seem consistent between input and output for each example pair.\n2.  **Color Palette:** Colors used include white (0), magenta (6), red (2), green (3), orange (7), and blue (1). White appears to be the background color.\n3.  **Objects:** Non-white pixels form distinct objects. These objects can be single pixels or horizontal lines of three pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The key transformation observed is that single, isolated non-white pixels in the input are expanded into horizontal lines of three pixels in the output. The expansion occurs by adding two pixels of the same color immediately to the right of the original pixel.\n5.  **Persistence:** Objects that are already larger than a single pixel (specifically, the 1x3 magenta and green lines observed) remain unchanged in the output. The background white pixels also remain unchanged.\n6.  **Directionality:** The expansion is consistently horizontal and towards the right.\n7.  **Size Constraint:** The expansion seems fixed to create a total object size of 1x3 (the original pixel plus two added pixels).\n\n## Factual Documentation\n\n"

Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid using its row and column index.\n3.  For the current cell at `(row, col)`:\n    a.  Check if the color of the pixel is not white (0).\n    b.  If the pixel is non-white, check if it is a \"single pixel object\". This means checking its immediate neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and perhaps diagonally, though horizontal seems sufficient based on examples) to ensure it's not part of a larger contiguous block of the same color. More simply, based on the examples, check if it's the *only* pixel of that object. Given the observed outputs, a simpler check might be sufficient: Is this a non-white pixel, and is the pixel immediately to its right white (or off-grid)? And is the pixel immediately to its left white (or off-grid)? (This specifically identifies 1x1 objects).\n    c.  If the conditions in (a) and (b) are met (it's a single, isolated non-white pixel), then in the *output* grid, change the color of the two pixels immediately to the right of the current position (`(row, col+1)` and `(row, col+2)`) to be the same color as the pixel at `(row, col)`, provided these positions are within the grid boundaries.\n4.  If the pixel is white or part of an already larger object (like the initial 3-pixel lines), make no changes to the corresponding pixel in the output grid (it retains its copied value).\n5.  Return the modified output grid."
