            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task elements: finding isolated non-white pixels and expanding them into 1x3 horizontal lines. However, the precise placement of this new 1x3 line was incorrect. The failed test results show that the single isolated pixel is not the starting point (leftmost pixel) of the new 1x3 line in the output. Instead, the original pixel's location becomes the *center* pixel of the new 1x3 line. The transformation involves shifting the placement one step to the left relative to the original isolated pixel's column index.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rule to account for this leftward shift during the expansion. The identification logic for isolated pixels appears correct, but the action taken upon identification needs adjustment.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the grids more formally to confirm the shift-and-expand pattern.\n\n"
