            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are single-row grids containing sequences of pixels. Most pixels are white (0), representing the background.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct objects. In the examples, we see two types of objects:\n    *   Single non-white pixels (e.g., orange 7 in train\\_1, red 2 and yellow 4 in train\\_2, yellow 4s in train\\_3).\n    *   Horizontal lines of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., maroon 9 in train\\_1, yellow 4 in train\\_2, blue 1 in train\\_3).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the single non-white pixels. Each single pixel is expanded horizontally into a line of three pixels of the same color. The original single pixel becomes the center of the new three-pixel line. The existing three-pixel horizontal lines remain unchanged.\n4.  **Context:** The transformation seems local. The change applied to one single pixel doesn't depend on other single pixels, only on its own color and position. The existing 3-pixel lines appear to be unaffected 'structures'. The key distinguishing feature for transformation is whether a non-white pixel is horizontally adjacent to other non-white pixels. If it's surrounded horizontally by white pixels, it expands. If it's part of a 3-pixel horizontal line (meaning it has non-white horizontal neighbors), it remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
