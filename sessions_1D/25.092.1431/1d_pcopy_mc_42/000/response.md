Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are single-row grids containing sequences of pixels. Most pixels are white (0), representing the background.
2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct objects. In the examples, we see two types of objects:
    *   Single non-white pixels (e.g., orange 7 in train\_1, red 2 and yellow 4 in train\_2, yellow 4s in train\_3).
    *   Horizontal lines of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., maroon 9 in train\_1, yellow 4 in train\_2, blue 1 in train\_3).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the single non-white pixels. Each single pixel is expanded horizontally into a line of three pixels of the same color. The original single pixel becomes the center of the new three-pixel line. The existing three-pixel horizontal lines remain unchanged.
4.  **Context:** The transformation seems local. The change applied to one single pixel doesn't depend on other single pixels, only on its own color and position. The existing 3-pixel lines appear to be unaffected 'structures'. The key distinguishing feature for transformation is whether a non-white pixel is horizontally adjacent to other non-white pixels. If it's surrounded horizontally by white pixels, it expands. If it's part of a 3-pixel horizontal line (meaning it has non-white horizontal neighbors), it remains unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  - type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: provides separation and boundaries
Objects:
  - type: isolated_pixel
    properties:
      color: any non-white (1-9)
      size: 1x1
      neighbors:
        left: white (0)
        right: white (0)
    action:
      - expand_horizontally
      - becomes: centered 3-pixel line of the same color
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: any non-white (1-9)
      size: 1x3 (width 3, height 1)
      pixels: identical color
      neighbors:
        center_pixel:
          left: non-white (same color)
          right: non-white (same color)
        end_pixels:
          inner_side: non-white (same color)
          outer_side: white (0)
    action:
      - remain_unchanged
Relationships:
  - transformation_trigger: A non-white pixel triggers expansion only if its immediate left and right neighbors are white (0).
  - transformation_result: The trigger pixel and its immediate left and right neighbors are replaced by the trigger pixel's color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, examining its color and its immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right). Ignore pixels in the first or last column as they cannot be the center of a 3-pixel horizontal expansion.
3.  For each pixel being examined:
    *   Check if the pixel's color is non-white (not 0).
    *   Check if the pixel immediately to its left is white (0).
    *   Check if the pixel immediately to its right is white (0).
4.  If all three conditions (non-white center, white left, white right) are met:
    *   In the output grid, change the color of the pixel to the left, the pixel itself, and the pixel to the right to the color of the original center pixel.
5.  After checking all eligible pixels, return the modified output grid.
