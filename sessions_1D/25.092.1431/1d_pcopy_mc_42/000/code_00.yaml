Grid:
  - type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: provides separation and boundaries
Objects:
  - type: isolated_pixel
    properties:
      color: any non-white (1-9)
      size: 1x1
      neighbors:
        left: white (0)
        right: white (0)
    action:
      - expand_horizontally
      - becomes: centered 3-pixel line of the same color
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: any non-white (1-9)
      size: 1x3 (width 3, height 1)
      pixels: identical color
      neighbors:
        center_pixel:
          left: non-white (same color)
          right: non-white (same color)
        end_pixels:
          inner_side: non-white (same color)
          outer_side: white (0)
    action:
      - remain_unchanged
Relationships:
  - transformation_trigger: A non-white pixel triggers expansion only if its immediate left and right neighbors are white (0).
  - transformation_result: The trigger pixel and its immediate left and right neighbors are replaced by the trigger pixel's color.
