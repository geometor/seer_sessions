For each pixel, checks if it is non-white (not 0) \nand if its immediate left and right neighbors are both white (0). If these conditions \nare met, it modifies the corresponding pixels in the output grid: the pixel itself, \nits left neighbor, and its right neighbor are all set to the color of the original \nnon-white pixel.
