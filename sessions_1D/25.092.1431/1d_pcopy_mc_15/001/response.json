Iterate through the input grid, looking at each pixel from the second position up to the second-to-last position.\n2. For each pixel at index 'i', check if it is non-white (color != 0) and if its immediate left neighbor (index i-1) and immediate right neighbor (index i+1) are both white (color == 0).\n3. If these conditions are met, the pixel at index 'i' is considered an \"isolated non-white pixel\".\n4. For each such isolated pixel with color 'C' found at index 'i', modify the output grid (initially a copy of the input) by setting the pixels at indices i-1, i, and i+1 all to color 'C'.\n5. Pixels that are not part of such a [white, non-white, white] triplet in the input remain unchanged in the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the isolated pixel expansion transformation to a 1D input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.ndarray): A 1xN numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A 1xN numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a numpy array\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid)\n    \n    # Get the dimensions (height will be 1, width is the length)\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    # This ensures pixels not modified by the rule are preserved\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid_np)\n\n    # Iterate through the pixels, excluding the first and last columns\n    # as they cannot be the center of a 3-pixel sequence\n    for i in range(1, width - 1):\n        # Get the center pixel and its neighbors from the *original* input grid\n        left_neighbor = input_grid_np[0, i - 1]\n        center_pixel = input_grid_np[0, i]\n        right_neighbor = input_grid_np[0, i + 1]\n\n        # Check if the center pixel is non-white (isolated) and neighbors are white\n        if center_pixel != 0 and left_neighbor == 0 and right_neighbor == 0:\n            # If it's an isolated non-white pixel, get its color\n            isolated_color = center_pixel\n            \n            # Modify the *output* grid by expanding the color to the neighbors\n            output_grid[0, i - 1] = isolated_color\n            output_grid[0, i] = isolated_color\n            output_grid[0, i + 1] = isolated_color\n\n    # Return the modified output grid\n    return output_grid.tolist() # Return as list of lists, matching input format if needed\n\n```"
