"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by finding isolated non-white pixels and expanding them into a block of three.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Iterate through the input grid, looking at each pixel from the second position up to the second-to-last position.
2. For each pixel at index 'i', check if it is non-white (color != 0) and if its immediate left neighbor (index i-1) and immediate right neighbor (index i+1) are both white (color == 0).
3. If these conditions are met, the pixel at index 'i' is considered an "isolated non-white pixel".
4. For each such isolated pixel with color 'C' found at index 'i', modify the output grid (initially a copy of the input) by setting the pixels at indices i-1, i, and i+1 all to color 'C'.
5. Pixels that are not part of such a [white, non-white, white] triplet in the input remain unchanged in the output.
