            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training example.\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both the input and output are 1D grids (single rows) with a width of 33 pixels.\n2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain white pixels (0) and various colored pixels (blue=1, orange=7, magenta=6, maroon=9).\n3.  **Objects:** We can identify contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. In the input, we see a block of blue (`1 1 1`), a single orange pixel (`7`), a single magenta pixel (`6`), and a single maroon pixel (`9`). The rest is the white background (0).\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output, the block `1 1 1` remains unchanged. However, the single pixels `7`, `6`, and `9` in the input seem to expand into blocks of three identical pixels (`7 7 7`, `6 6 6`, `9 9 9`) in the output.\n5.  **Context of Change:** The expansion specifically targets *isolated* non-white pixels. An isolated pixel is a non-white pixel surrounded immediately by white pixels on both its left and right sides.\n6.  **Mechanism of Change:** When an isolated non-white pixel `C` at position `i` is found (`input[i-1]==0`, `input[i]==C`, `input[i+1]==0`), the corresponding segment in the output grid at positions `i-1`, `i`, `i+1` becomes `C C C`. This means the expansion overwrites the two adjacent white pixels.\n7.  **No Change:** Pixels that are not part of such a `0 C 0` triplet in the input remain unchanged in the output. This includes white pixels not adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel, and non-white pixels that are already part of a larger block (like the `1 1 1` block).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through the input grid pixels, focusing on the indices from 1 up to (but not including) the last index (i.e., from the second pixel to the second-to-last pixel). Let the current index be `i`.\n3.  At each index `i`, check the triplet of pixels: `input[i-1]`, `input[i]`, `input[i+1]`.\n4.  If `input[i]` is non-white (not 0), AND `input[i-1]` is white (0), AND `input[i+1]` is white (0), then the pixel `input[i]` is an isolated colored pixel. Let its color be `C`.\n5.  If an isolated colored pixel `C` is found at index `i`, modify the *output* grid: set the values at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `C`.\n6.  Continue iterating through all possible indices `i`. Note that modifications are made to the output grid, while the checks are performed on the original input grid to avoid interference between overlapping potential expansions.\n7.  After checking all relevant indices, the resulting output grid is the final answer."
