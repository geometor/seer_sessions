      - size: number_of_contiguous_pixels

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    direction: horizontal
    pixels: [any, any]
  - type: isolation
    definition: A non-white pixel C at index i is isolated if pixel at i-1 is white and pixel at i+1 is white.
    applies_to: non-white_pixels
actions:
  - name: identify_isolated_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_indices_and_colors
    criteria: pixel is non-white AND left_neighbor is white AND right_neighbor is white
  - name: expand_and_overwrite
    input: isolated_pixel_info (index i, color C)
    target: output_grid (initially copy of input)
    effect: Modifies pixels at indices i-1, i, i+1 in the output_grid to color C.
    scope: operates on a 3-pixel window [i-1, i, i+1] centered on the isolated pixel.
  - name: preserve_pixel
    input: input_pixel
    target: output_grid
    condition: Pixel is not part of an expansion operation triggered by an adjacent isolated pixel.
transformation_rule_summary:
  - Find all isolated non-white pixels in the input row.
  - For each isolated pixel C at index i, replace the three-pixel sequence [white, C, white] centered at i with [C, C, C] in the output.
  - All other pixels remain unchanged.
