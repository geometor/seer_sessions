For each occurrence of this pattern found in the original input sequence, \nit replaces the corresponding triplet of elements in a copy of the sequence with \n`[C, C, C]`. Pixels not part of such a pattern remain unchanged. The process ensures \nthat modifications are based solely on the original input state, preventing cascading \neffects within a single transformation step.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        input_sequence (list): A list of integers (0-9) representing the input 1D sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list representing the transformed sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a deep copy of the input sequence to store the output.\n    # Modifications will be made to this copy, ensuring that the pattern matching\n    # logic always refers to the original, unmodified input sequence.\n    output_sequence = copy.deepcopy(input_sequence)\n    \n    # Get the length of the input sequence.\n    n = len(input_sequence)\n\n    # Iterate through the sequence, focusing on potential central elements of the [0, C, 0] pattern.\n    # The loop must start at index 1 and end at index n-2 (exclusive of n-1) to allow\n    # safe access to the element before (i-1) and the element after (i+1).\n    # If the sequence length is less than 3, this range will be empty, and the loop won't run,\n    # correctly handling short sequences.\n    for i in range(1, n - 1):\n        \n        # Check if the triplet centered at index 'i' in the *original* input sequence\n        # matches the pattern [0, C, 0], where C is any non-white color (1-9).\n        if input_sequence[i-1] == 0 and input_sequence[i] != 0 and input_sequence[i+1] == 0:\n            \n            # If the pattern is found, identify the non-white color 'C' to be expanded.\n            color_to_expand = input_sequence[i]\n            \n            # Modify the corresponding elements in the *output* sequence.\n            # Replace the [0, C, 0] pattern at indices [i-1, i, i+1] with [C, C, C].\n            output_sequence[i-1] = color_to_expand\n            output_sequence[i]   = color_to_expand\n            output_sequence[i+1] = color_to_expand\n\n    # Return the modified sequence.\n    return output_sequence\n```"
