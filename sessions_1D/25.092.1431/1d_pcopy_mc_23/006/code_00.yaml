output_format: 1D_array_representing_flattened_2D_grid
grid_dimensions:
  analysis: Constant across examples
  height: 3
  width: 11
elements:
  - type: background_pixel
    color_value: 0
    color_name: white
  - type: isolated_pixel_horizontal
    properties:
      - color_value: non-zero (C)
      - context: Located at grid position (r, c)
      - condition: Pixel to the left (r, c-1) is white AND pixel to the right (r, c+1) is white.
  - type: pixel_block
    properties:
      - composition: Identical non-zero color_value
      - context: Can exist in the input or be created by the transformation.
actions:
  - name: reshape_input
    input: 1D_array (length 33)
    output: 2D_grid (3x11)
  - name: identify_horizontal_pattern
    input: 2D_grid
    pattern: sequence [white, non-white(C), white] horizontally adjacent
    target: isolated_pixel_horizontal and its immediate horizontal white neighbors
  - name: replace_horizontal_pattern
    input_pattern: [0, C, 0] at grid cells [(r, c-1), (r, c), (r, c+1)]
    output_pattern: [C, C, C] at grid cells [(r, c-1), (r, c), (r, c+1)]
    condition: Applied to a *copy* of the grid for every match found in the *original* grid.

    input: 2D_grid (3x11)
    output: 1D_array (length 33)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Horizontal adjacency within rows of the 2D grid is critical. Vertical adjacency is ignored.
invariance:
  - description: Pixels not part of a horizontal [0, C, 0] pattern remain unchanged.
  - description: Existing blocks of non-white pixels are preserved unless they are part of a transformation pattern (which seems unlikely given the observed pattern requires white neighbors).
  - description: Vertical patterns or isolated pixels without the specific horizontal white neighbors are unchanged.
