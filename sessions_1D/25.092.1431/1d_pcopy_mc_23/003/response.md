```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D sequence by finding isolated non-white pixels and expanding them.

The transformation rule identifies patterns of `[white, non-white, white]` (represented 
as `[0, X, 0]` where X is any color from 1 to 9) in the input sequence. 
For each occurrence of this pattern, it replaces the triplet `[0, X, 0]` with 
`[X, X, X]` in the output sequence. Pixels not part of such a pattern remain 
unchanged. The check for the pattern is always done against the original input sequence.
