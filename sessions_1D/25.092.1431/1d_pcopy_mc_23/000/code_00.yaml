task_type: sequence_transformation
data_format: 1D_array_of_integers
elements:
  - type: background_pixel
    color_value: 0
    color_name: white
  - type: isolated_pixel
    properties:
      - color_value: non-zero
      - context: preceded and followed by a white pixel (0)
  - type: pixel_block
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - composition: identical non-zero color_value
actions:
  - name: identify_pattern
    input: input_sequence
    pattern: sequence [0, X, 0] where X != 0
    target: isolated_pixel and its white neighbors
  - name: replace_pattern
    input_pattern: [0, X, 0] at indices [i-1, i, i+1]
    output_pattern: [X, X, X] at indices [i-1, i, i+1]
    condition: applies only where the input_pattern is found
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Adjacency in the 1D sequence is critical for pattern matching.
invariance:
  - description: Pixels not part of the identified [0, X, 0] pattern remain unchanged in the output.
  - description: Existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels are preserved.
