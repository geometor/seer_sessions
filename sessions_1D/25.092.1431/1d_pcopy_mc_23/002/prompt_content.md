```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D sequence by finding isolated non-white pixels and expanding them.

The transformation rule identifies patterns of `[white, non-white, white]` (represented 
as `[0, X, 0]` where X is any color from 1 to 9) in the input sequence. 
For each occurrence of this pattern, it replaces the triplet `[0, X, 0]` with 
`[X, X, X]` in the output sequence. Pixels not part of such a pattern remain 
unchanged.
"""

def transform(input_sequence):
    """
    Applies the transformation rule to the input sequence.

    Args:
        input_sequence (list): A list of integers (0-9) representing the input sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A new list representing the transformed sequence.
