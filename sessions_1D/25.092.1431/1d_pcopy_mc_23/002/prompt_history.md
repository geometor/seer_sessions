Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Data Format:** The input and output data are presented as 1D arrays (lists) of integers, representing colors. Although ARC tasks usually involve 2D grids, these examples seem to operate linearly on the given sequence.
2.  **Key Elements:** The sequences consist primarily of white pixels (0) interspersed with non-white colored pixels. Some non-white pixels appear individually, while others form blocks of three identical colors.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation observed involves single, isolated non-white pixels. Specifically, a pattern of `white, color, white` (0, X, 0 where X is not 0) in the input is replaced by `color, color, color` (X, X, X) in the output.
4.  **Invariance:** Pixels not part of this specific `0, X, 0` pattern seem to remain unchanged. This includes existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., `8 8 8`, `3 3 3`, `5 5 5`) and other white pixels.
5.  **Process:** The transformation identifies all occurrences of the `0, X, 0` pattern in the input and applies the `X, X, X` replacement to generate the output. It appears to be a direct substitution based on local context.

**Facts**

    description: Adjacency in the 1D sequence is critical for pattern matching.
invariance:
  - description: Pixels not part of the identified [0, X, 0] pattern remain unchanged in the output.
  - description: Existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels are preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence, examining each triplet of consecutive pixels from the second pixel (index 1) to the second-to-last pixel (index length-2). Let the index of the middle pixel in the current triplet be `i`.
3.  For each triplet `(input[i-1], input[i], input[i+1])`, check if it matches the pattern: `input[i-1]` is white (0), `input[i]` is a non-white color (let's call it `C`), and `input[i+1]` is white (0).
4.  If the pattern `(0, C, 0)` is found at indices `(i-1, i, i+1)` in the *input* sequence, modify the *output* sequence by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to color `C`.
5.  After checking all possible triplets in the input sequence, the modified output sequence represents the final result.
```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D sequence by finding isolated non-white pixels and expanding them.

The transformation rule identifies patterns of `[white, non-white, white]` (represented 
as `[0, X, 0]` where X is any color from 1 to 9) in the input sequence. 
For each occurrence of this pattern, it replaces the triplet `[0, X, 0]` with 
`[X, X, X]` in the output sequence. Pixels not part of such a pattern remain 
unchanged.
