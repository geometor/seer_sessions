task_type: sequence_transformation
data_format: 1D_array_of_integers (list)
sequence_length: 33 (consistent across all examples)
elements:
  - type: background_pixel
    color_value: 0
    color_name: white
  - type: isolated_pixel
    properties:
      - color_value: non-zero (1-9)
      - context: preceded and followed by a white pixel (0) in the input sequence
  - type: pixel_block
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - composition: identical non-zero color_value
      - origin: Can exist in the input or be generated by the transformation
actions:
  - name: identify_pattern
    input: input_sequence
    pattern: sequence [0, X, 0] where X is any non-zero color (1-9)
    target: The triplet of pixels forming the pattern
  - name: replace_pattern
    input_pattern: [0, X, 0] at indices [i-1, i, i+1] in the input sequence
    output_pattern: [X, X, X] at indices [i-1, i, i+1] in the output sequence
    condition: Applies for every identified pattern based on the original input state.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation depends strictly on the immediate left and right neighbors of a non-white pixel in the 1D sequence.
invariance:
  - description: Pixels not part of an identified `[0, X, 0]` pattern in the input remain unchanged in the output.
  - description: Existing blocks of three or more identical non-white pixels in the input are preserved.
  - description: The length of the sequence remains constant.
