```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms a 1D sequence representing a flattened 3x11 grid by finding 
horizontally adjacent patterns of `[white, non-white, white]` (represented 
numerically as `[0, C, 0]` where C is any color from 1 to 9) in the grid. 
For each occurrence of this pattern found in the original grid, it replaces 
the corresponding triplet of elements in a copy of the grid with `[C, C, C]`. 
Pixels not part of such a horizontal pattern remain unchanged. The process ensures 
that modifications are based solely on the original input state, preventing 
cascading effects within a single transformation step. The final transformed 
grid is then flattened back into a 1D list.
