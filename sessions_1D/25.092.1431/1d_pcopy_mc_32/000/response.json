This block appears early in the sequence.\n    *   One or more single, isolated non-white pixels occurring later in the sequence (blue 1, maroon 9, yellow 4, azure 8). These single pixels are separated from other non-white pixels by at least one white pixel on each side.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The initial 3-pixel block remains unchanged in the output in the same position.\n    *   Each isolated single non-white pixel in the input is replaced in the output by a horizontal block of three pixels of the *same* color.\n    *   The new 3-pixel block is positioned such that the original single pixel's location becomes the *center* of the new 3-pixel block. Equivalently, the new block starts one position to the left of the original single pixel's position.\n    *   White pixels generally remain white, unless they are overwritten by the expansion of a neighboring single non-white pixel.\n4.  **Independence:** When multiple isolated single pixels exist (like in train\\_3), each is transformed independently according to the rule.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
