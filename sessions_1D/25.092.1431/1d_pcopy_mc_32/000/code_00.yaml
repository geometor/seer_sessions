task_description: Expand isolated single non-white pixels into 3-pixel horizontal blocks, keeping the first encountered 3-pixel block unchanged.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  content: Integer color values (0-9)
  background_color: 0 (white)

objects:
  - type: anchor_block
    definition: The first contiguous horizontal sequence of exactly 3 identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (varies by example, e.g., 9, 8)
      - size: 3 pixels wide
    actions:
      - remains unchanged in the output.
  - type: target_pixel
    definition: A single non-white pixel that is not part of the anchor_block and has white pixels (0) or grid boundaries as immediate horizontal neighbors.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (varies, e.g., 1, 9, 4, 8)
      - size: 1 pixel wide
      - isolation: horizontally adjacent pixels are white (0) or boundary.
    actions:
      - is expanded into a 3-pixel block in the output.
  - type: expanded_block
    definition: A block of 3 identical non-white pixels in the output grid, resulting from the expansion of a target_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: same as the corresponding target_pixel.
      - size: 3 pixels wide
      - position: centered at the original location of the target_pixel (occupies indices c-1, c, c+1 where c was the index of the target_pixel).

relationships:
  - target_pixels are distinct from the anchor_block.
  - the transformation of each target_pixel is independent of others.
  - the position of the expanded_block is directly determined by the position of the corresponding target_pixel.

rules:
  - Find the anchor_block first.
  - Identify all target_pixels.
  - For each target_pixel, replace the corresponding 3-pixel region in the output grid (centered on the target_pixel's original location) with the target_pixel's color.
  - Copy the anchor_block and all other background pixels directly to the output unless overwritten by an expansion.
