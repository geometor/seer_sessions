Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The examples provided show input and output grids that appear to be single rows (or 1D arrays) of pixels.
2.  **Key Elements:** Each input grid contains:
    *   A background of white pixels (0).
    *   A single, contiguous horizontal block of exactly three identical non-white pixels (maroon 9, azure 8). This block appears early in the sequence.
    *   One or more single, isolated non-white pixels occurring later in the sequence (blue 1, maroon 9, yellow 4, azure 8). These single pixels are separated from other non-white pixels by at least one white pixel on each side.
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   The initial 3-pixel block remains unchanged in the output in the same position.
    *   Each isolated single non-white pixel in the input is replaced in the output by a horizontal block of three pixels of the *same* color.
    *   The new 3-pixel block is positioned such that the original single pixel's location becomes the *center* of the new 3-pixel block. Equivalently, the new block starts one position to the left of the original single pixel's position.
    *   White pixels generally remain white, unless they are overwritten by the expansion of a neighboring single non-white pixel.
4.  **Independence:** When multiple isolated single pixels exist (like in train\_3), each is transformed independently according to the rule.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Expand isolated single non-white pixels into 3-pixel horizontal blocks, keeping the first encountered 3-pixel block unchanged.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  content: Integer color values (0-9)
  background_color: 0 (white)

objects:
  - type: anchor_block
    definition: The first contiguous horizontal sequence of exactly 3 identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (varies by example, e.g., 9, 8)
      - size: 3 pixels wide
    actions:
      - remains unchanged in the output.
  - type: target_pixel
    definition: A single non-white pixel that is not part of the anchor_block and has white pixels (0) or grid boundaries as immediate horizontal neighbors.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (varies, e.g., 1, 9, 4, 8)
      - size: 1 pixel wide
      - isolation: horizontally adjacent pixels are white (0) or boundary.
    actions:
      - is expanded into a 3-pixel block in the output.
  - type: expanded_block
    definition: A block of 3 identical non-white pixels in the output grid, resulting from the expansion of a target_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: same as the corresponding target_pixel.
      - size: 3 pixels wide
      - position: centered at the original location of the target_pixel (occupies indices c-1, c, c+1 where c was the index of the target_pixel).

relationships:
  - target_pixels are distinct from the anchor_block.
  - the transformation of each target_pixel is independent of others.
  - the position of the expanded_block is directly determined by the position of the corresponding target_pixel.

rules:
  - Find the anchor_block first.
  - Identify all target_pixels.
  - For each target_pixel, replace the corresponding 3-pixel region in the output grid (centered on the target_pixel's original location) with the target_pixel's color.
  - Copy the anchor_block and all other background pixels directly to the output unless overwritten by an expansion.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first instance of three consecutive identical non-white pixels. Record the starting index and color of this "anchor block".
3.  Iterate through the input grid again, examining each pixel at index `i`.
4.  Check if the current pixel at index `i` is part of the identified anchor block. If it is, continue to the next pixel.
5.  Check if the current pixel at index `i` is non-white (color > 0).
6.  If it is non-white and not part of the anchor block, check if it is isolated:
    *   Check the pixel at index `i-1` (if `i > 0`). It must be white (0).
    *   Check the pixel at index `i+1` (if `i < grid_width - 1`). It must be white (0).
7.  If the pixel at index `i` is non-white, not part of the anchor block, and isolated, then it is a "target pixel".
8.  For this target pixel with color `C` at index `i`:
    *   Modify the *output* grid:
        *   Set the color of the pixel at index `i-1` to `C` (if `i > 0`).
        *   Set the color of the pixel at index `i` to `C`.
        *   Set the color of the pixel at index `i+1` to `C` (if `i < grid_width - 1`).
9.  After iterating through all pixels in the input grid, the modified output grid contains the final result.
