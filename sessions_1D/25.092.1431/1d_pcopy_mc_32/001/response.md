"""
Expand isolated single non-white pixels into 3-pixel horizontal blocks, 
keeping the first encountered 3-pixel block unchanged.

The transformation applies to grids that are effectively single rows.
It identifies the first sequence of three identical non-white pixels ('anchor block')
and leaves it untouched. Then, it finds any other single non-white pixels ('target pixels')
that are surrounded horizontally by white pixels (or grid boundaries). Each target pixel
is expanded into a horizontal block of three pixels of its own color, centered at the 
original target pixel's location.
