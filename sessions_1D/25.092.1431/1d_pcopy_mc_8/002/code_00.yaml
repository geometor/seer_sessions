Input_Output_Structure:
  format: 2D grid, consistently single row.
  shape: (1, N) # N=33 in examples, but could vary.
  background_color: 0 (white)
  pixel_values: integers 0-9 representing colors.

Object_Definition:
  basis: Contiguous horizontal sequence of non-background (non-zero) pixels within the row.
  identity: defined by color and contiguity.
  properties:
    - color: integer value (1-9)
    - start_index: column index (0-based) of the first pixel.
    - length: count of pixels in the sequence.

Transformation_Rule:
  scope: Applies independently to each identified object based on its length.
  output_initialization: Output grid is same shape as input, filled with background color (0).
  conditions:
    - if object length == 3:
        action: copy the object (color, length, position) directly to the output grid.
        target_start_index: same as input object start_index.
    - if object length == 1:
        action: create a new object of length 3 with the same color.
        target_start_index: input object start_index - 1.
  pixel_placement:
    - For copied (length 3) objects: write 3 pixels of object color starting at target_start_index.
    - For expanded (length 1->3) objects: write 3 pixels of object color starting at target_start_index.
  boundary_handling: Pixel placements must respect grid boundaries (index >= 0 and index < grid_width). Placements outside bounds are clipped/ignored.
  overlap_handling: Assumed that later object placements overwrite earlier ones if positions overlap (based on typical left-to-right processing).
