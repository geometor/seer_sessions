Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels.
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).
3.  **Objects:** Objects are contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels.
4.  **Object Properties:** The key properties seem to be the color and length of these segments.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to operate differently based on the length of the input objects. Objects of length 3 remain unchanged in color, length, and position. Objects of length 1 (single pixels) are expanded into segments of length 3 using the same color, and their starting position shifts one step to the left relative to the original single pixel's position.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Object_Definition:
  type: contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels
  properties:
    - color: integer value 1-9
    - length: number of pixels in the segment
    - position: starting index (column) of the segment

Transformation_Rules:
  - rule: identify all non-white objects in the input grid.
  - rule: for each object:
      - if object length == 3:
          action: copy the object to the output grid at the same position.
      - if object length == 1:
          action: create a new object of the same color but length 3.
          positioning: place the new 3-pixel object starting at the original object's index minus 1.
  - rule: initialize the output grid with the background color before placing transformed objects.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to identify contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of non-white pixels. Record the color, starting index, and length of each object found.
3.  Iterate through the identified objects:
    a.  If an object has a length of 3, copy its pixels directly into the output grid at the same starting index.
    b.  If an object has a length of 1 (it's a single pixel) at index `i`, place a segment of 3 pixels of the *same color* into the output grid, starting at index `i-1`.
4.  The resulting grid after processing all objects is the final output.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms the input grid based on identified object lengths.
Objects are contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels (value > 0).
Objects of length 3 are copied directly to the output grid at the same position.
Objects of length 1 (single pixels) are expanded into a segment of length 3 
using the same color, starting one position to the left of the original pixel's position.
The output grid is initialized with the background color (white, 0).
