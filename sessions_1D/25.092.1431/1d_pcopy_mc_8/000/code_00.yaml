Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Object_Definition:
  type: contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels
  properties:
    - color: integer value 1-9
    - length: number of pixels in the segment
    - position: starting index (column) of the segment

Transformation_Rules:
  - rule: identify all non-white objects in the input grid.
  - rule: for each object:
      - if object length == 3:
          action: copy the object to the output grid at the same position.
      - if object length == 1:
          action: create a new object of the same color but length 3.
          positioning: place the new 3-pixel object starting at the original object's index minus 1.
  - rule: initialize the output grid with the background color before placing transformed objects.
