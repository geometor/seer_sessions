Scan the grid to find the single, isolated non-white pixel (the \"target pixel\"). \n    An isolated pixel is defined as a non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are white (or grid boundaries).\n3.  Record the color of the target pixel (`target_color`) and its column position (`target_col`). \n    Ignore any blocks of three non-white pixels or other non-isolated pixels.\n4.  Create a new grid (the output grid) initially identical to the input grid.\n5.  In the output grid, set the color of the pixel at column `target_col` to `target_color`.\n6.  Set the color of the pixel at column `target_col + 1` to `target_color`.\n7.  Set the color of the pixel at column `target_col + 2` to `target_color`. \n    Assume there is always enough space to the right based on examples.\n8.  The resulting grid is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_isolated_pixel(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first single, isolated non-white pixel in a 1-row grid.\n    An isolated pixel has white (0) neighbors (or is at a boundary).\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): A 1xN numpy array representing the input grid row.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (row, col, color) of the isolated pixel, or None if not found.\n               Since it's a 1-row grid, row will always be 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grid.shape[0] != 1:\n        # This function assumes a 1-row grid based on the examples\n        # Handle potential multi-row grids if necessary, though unlikely for this task\n        print(\"Warning: Expected a 1-row grid.\")\n        return None # Or adapt logic for multi-row\n\n    row = 0\n    width = grid.shape[1]\n    for col in range(width):\n        color = grid[row, col]\n        if color != 0: # Found a non-white pixel\n            # Check left neighbor (or boundary)\n            is_left_white = (col == 0) or (grid[row, col - 1] == 0)\n            # Check right neighbor (or boundary)\n            is_right_white = (col == width - 1) or (grid[row, col + 1] == 0)\n\n            if is_left_white and is_right_white:\n                # This is the isolated pixel\n                return row, col, color\n    return None # No isolated pixel found\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by finding a single isolated non-white pixel\n    and expanding it into a 1x3 block of the same color.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 1xN numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height, width = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Find the target isolated pixel\n    target_info = find_isolated_pixel(input_grid)\n\n    if target_info:\n        row, target_col, target_color = target_info\n\n        # Apply the transformation: expand the pixel to a 1x3 block\n        # The pixel itself is already the correct color in the copy\n        # We just need to color the next two pixels to the right\n        # Ensure we don't go out of bounds (though examples suggest it's safe)\n        if target_col + 1 < width:\n            output_grid[row, target_col + 1] = target_color\n        if target_col + 2 < width:\n            output_grid[row, target_col + 2] = target_color\n            \n    # If no isolated pixel is found, the grid remains unchanged (per the copy)\n    return output_grid\n\n```"
