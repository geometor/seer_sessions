**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both single-row grids (effectively 1D arrays). The dimensions appear consistent across examples (1x33).
2.  **Colors:** The primary background color is white (0). Each input contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
3.  **Objects in Input:**
    *   There is always a contiguous block of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., green-green-green, maroon-maroon-maroon, gray-gray-gray).
    *   There is always a single isolated non-white pixel of a different color (e.g., maroon, gray, azure), located to the right of the three-pixel block.
    *   These non-white elements are separated by one or more white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The three-pixel block from the input remains unchanged in the output.
    *   The single isolated pixel in the input is "expanded" in the output. It becomes the starting pixel of a new three-pixel block of the *same* color as the original single pixel. This expansion occurs horizontally to the right.
    *   All white pixels remain white, except for the two pixels immediately to the right of the original single pixel, which are overwritten by the expansion.
5.  **Irrelevance:** The specific colors or the relative positions (beyond the single pixel being to the right of the triple block) of the non-white elements don't seem to affect the *type* of transformation, only *which* color is used for the expansion and *where* it occurs. The three-pixel block seems entirely unaffected and potentially irrelevant to the core transformation logic applied to the single pixel. The core operation focuses solely on the single pixel.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D Array / Single Row Grid
  Dimensions: 1x33 (constant in examples)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Input_Objects:
  - Name: Source_Object # Note: This object appears irrelevant to the transformation logic observed.
    Type: Contiguous Block
    Shape: 1x3 pixels
    Color: Any non-white (variable, e.g., green, maroon, gray)
    Quantity: 1
  - Name: Target_Pixel
    Type: Single Pixel
    Shape: 1x1 pixel
    Color: Any non-white (variable, different from Source_Object, e.g., maroon, gray, azure)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: To the right of Source_Object, separated by white pixels.

Relationships:
  - Target_Pixel is located at a column index greater than any column index of the Source_Object.
  - Source_Object and Target_Pixel are separated by at least one white pixel.

Transformation:
  Action: Expansion
  Target: The Target_Pixel
  Rule:
    1. Identify the position (row 0, column X) and color (C) of the Target_Pixel.
    2. In the output grid, modify the pixels at (0, X), (0, X+1), and (0, X+2) to color C.
  Effect: The Target_Pixel becomes the leftmost pixel of a new 1x3 block of color C.
  Unaffected_Elements:
    - Source_Object
    - All white pixels not overwritten by the expansion.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid (a single row).
2.  Scan the grid to find the single, isolated non-white pixel (the "target pixel"). Record its color (let's call it `target_color`) and its column position (let's call it `target_col`). Ignore any blocks of three non-white pixels.
3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) initially identical to the input grid.
4.  In the output grid, set the color of the pixel at column `target_col` to `target_color`.
5.  Set the color of the pixel at column `target_col + 1` to `target_color`.
6.  Set the color of the pixel at column `target_col + 2` to `target_color`.

## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identified the single, isolated non-white pixel and its color in each example. It also correctly performed an expansion to create a three-pixel block of that color. However, the placement of this new three-pixel block was incorrect in all examples.

The transformed output consistently placed the new three-pixel block starting *at* the original position of the isolated pixel, while the expected output shows the new block starting *one position to the left* of the original isolated pixel's position.

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the rule for placing the expanded block. Instead of starting the block at the original column index (`target_col`), it should start at `target_col - 1`.
2.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts to accurately reflect this corrected placement rule.
3.  Verify that this corrected rule holds for all provided training examples.

## Metrics Analysis

Let's use code execution to confirm the positions of the isolated pixel and the start of the target block in the expected output for each example.



*code_execution:*

Example 3 Metrics: {'input_isolated_pixel': {'col': 7, 'color': np.int64(8)}, 'output_block_start_col': 6, 'output_block_color': np.int64(8)}

```
The metrics confirm the observation:

*   **Example 1:** Isolated pixel (maroon, 9) at col 7. Output block starts at col 6. (Shift left by 1)
*   **Example 2:** Isolated pixel (gray, 5) at col 8. Output block starts at col 7. (Shift left by 1)
*   **Example 3:** Isolated pixel (azure, 8) at col 7. Output block starts at col 6. (Shift left by 1)

The rule is consistently that the new 3-pixel block starts one column to the left of the original isolated pixel.

## Updated YAML Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D Array / Single Row Grid
  Dimensions: 1x33 (constant in examples)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Input_Objects:
  - Name: Irrelevant_Object # Renamed as it seems unaffected and unused by the transformation
    Type: Contiguous Block
    Shape: 1x3 pixels
    Color: Any non-white (variable)
    Quantity: 1
  - Name: Target_Pixel
    Type: Single Pixel
    Property: Isolated (white or boundary neighbors)
    Shape: 1x1 pixel
    Color: Any non-white (variable, distinct from Irrelevant_Object)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: Identified by its column index (target_col) and color (target_color).

Relationships:
  - Target_Pixel is located to the right of the Irrelevant_Object, separated by white pixels.

Transformation:
  Action: Replace and Expand
  Target: The area starting one column *before* the Target_Pixel.
  Rule:
    1. Identify the position (row 0, column `target_col`) and color (`target_color`) of the isolated Target_Pixel.
    2. In the output grid, modify the pixels at (0, `target_col - 1`), (0, `target_col`), and (0, `target_col + 1`) to `target_color`.
  Effect: A new 1x3 block of `target_color` is created, starting one position to the left of the original Target_Pixel's location, overwriting the original pixel and its left and right neighbors.
  Unaffected_Elements:
    - Irrelevant_Object
    - All other pixels not part of the 3-pixel replacement area.
```


## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Start with the input grid (a single row).
2.  Scan the grid to find the single, isolated non-white pixel (the "target pixel"). An isolated pixel is one whose immediate left and right neighbors are white (or grid boundaries).
3.  Record the color of the target pixel (let's call it `target_color`) and its column position (let's call it `target_col`). Ignore any non-isolated non-white pixels (like the initial 3-pixel block).
4.  Create a new grid (the output grid) initially identical to the input grid.
5.  In the output grid, set the color of the pixel at column `target_col - 1` to `target_color`.
6.  Set the color of the pixel at column `target_col` to `target_color`.
7.  Set the color of the pixel at column `target_col + 1` to `target_color`. (Ensure column indices remain within grid bounds, although examples suggest this is safe).
8.  The resulting grid is the final output.
