Scan the grid to find the single, isolated non-white pixel (the \"target pixel\"). \n   An isolated pixel is defined as a non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are white (0) or grid boundaries.\n3. Record the color of the target pixel (`target_color`) and its column position (`target_col`). \n   Ignore any non-isolated non-white pixels (like the initial 3-pixel block).\n4. Create a new grid (the output grid) initially identical to the input grid.\n5. In the output grid, set the color of the pixel at column `target_col - 1` to `target_color`.\n6. Set the color of the pixel at column `target_col` to `target_color`.\n7. Set the color of the pixel at column `target_col + 1` to `target_color`. \n   (Ensure column indices remain within grid bounds).\n8. The resulting grid is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_isolated_pixel(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first single, isolated non-white pixel in a 1-row grid.\n    An isolated pixel has white (0) neighbors (or is at a boundary).\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): A 1xN numpy array representing the input grid row.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (row, col, color) of the isolated pixel, or None if not found.\n               Since it's a 1-row grid, row will always be 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Assuming grid is always 1 row based on examples\n    if grid.shape[0] != 1:\n        # Handle unexpected dimensions if necessary\n        return None \n\n    row = 0\n    width = grid.shape[1]\n    for col in range(width):\n        color = grid[row, col]\n        if color != 0: # Found a non-white pixel\n            # Check left neighbor (or boundary is considered white)\n            is_left_white = (col == 0) or (grid[row, col - 1] == 0)\n            # Check right neighbor (or boundary is considered white)\n            is_right_white = (col == width - 1) or (grid[row, col + 1] == 0)\n\n            # If both neighbors are white (or boundary), it's isolated\n            if is_left_white and is_right_white:\n                return row, col, color # Return info for the first one found\n                \n    return None # No isolated pixel found\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by finding a single isolated non-white pixel\n    and replacing the pixel, its left neighbor, and its right neighbor \n    with a 1x3 block of the isolated pixel's color.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 1xN numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height, width = output_grid.shape # Get dimensions\n\n    # Find the target isolated pixel\n    target_info = find_isolated_pixel(input_grid)\n\n    # If an isolated pixel was found\n    if target_info:\n        row, target_col, target_color = target_info\n\n        # Define the 3 columns to be modified\n        # Start one column to the left of the target pixel\n        col_start = target_col - 1\n        col_mid = target_col\n        col_end = target_col + 1\n\n        # Apply the transformation: create a 1x3 block\n        # Check bounds before modifying\n        if col_start >= 0:\n            output_grid[row, col_start] = target_color\n        \n        # The middle pixel (original target_col) is always within bounds if target_info was found\n        output_grid[row, col_mid] = target_color\n            \n        if col_end < width:\n            output_grid[row, col_end] = target_color\n            \n    # If no isolated pixel is found, the grid remains unchanged (due to the copy)\n    return output_grid\n```"
