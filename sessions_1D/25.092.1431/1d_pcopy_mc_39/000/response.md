**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both single-row grids (effectively 1D arrays). The dimensions appear consistent across examples (1x33).
2.  **Colors:** The primary background color is white (0). Each input contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
3.  **Objects in Input:**
    *   There is always a contiguous block of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., green-green-green, maroon-maroon-maroon, gray-gray-gray).
    *   There is always a single isolated non-white pixel of a different color (e.g., maroon, gray, azure), located to the right of the three-pixel block.
    *   These non-white elements are separated by one or more white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The three-pixel block from the input remains unchanged in the output.
    *   The single isolated pixel in the input is "expanded" in the output. It becomes the starting pixel of a new three-pixel block of the *same* color as the original single pixel. This expansion occurs horizontally to the right.
    *   All white pixels remain white, except for the two pixels immediately to the right of the original single pixel, which are overwritten by the expansion.
5.  **Irrelevance:** The specific colors or the relative positions (beyond the single pixel being to the right of the triple block) of the non-white elements don't seem to affect the *type* of transformation, only *which* color is used for the expansion and *where* it occurs. The three-pixel block seems entirely unaffected and potentially irrelevant to the core transformation logic applied to the single pixel. The core operation focuses solely on the single pixel.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D Array / Single Row Grid
  Dimensions: 1x33 (constant in examples)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Input_Objects:
  - Name: Source_Object # Note: This object appears irrelevant to the transformation logic observed.
    Type: Contiguous Block
    Shape: 1x3 pixels
    Color: Any non-white (variable, e.g., green, maroon, gray)
    Quantity: 1
  - Name: Target_Pixel
    Type: Single Pixel
    Shape: 1x1 pixel
    Color: Any non-white (variable, different from Source_Object, e.g., maroon, gray, azure)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: To the right of Source_Object, separated by white pixels.

Relationships:
  - Target_Pixel is located at a column index greater than any column index of the Source_Object.
  - Source_Object and Target_Pixel are separated by at least one white pixel.

Transformation:
  Action: Expansion
  Target: The Target_Pixel
  Rule:
    1. Identify the position (row 0, column X) and color (C) of the Target_Pixel.
    2. In the output grid, modify the pixels at (0, X), (0, X+1), and (0, X+2) to color C.
  Effect: The Target_Pixel becomes the leftmost pixel of a new 1x3 block of color C.
  Unaffected_Elements:
    - Source_Object
    - All white pixels not overwritten by the expansion.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid (a single row).
2.  Scan the grid to find the single, isolated non-white pixel (the "target pixel"). Record its color (let's call it `target_color`) and its column position (let's call it `target_col`). Ignore any blocks of three non-white pixels.
3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) initially identical to the input grid.
4.  In the output grid, set the color of the pixel at column `target_col` to `target_color`.
5.  Set the color of the pixel at column `target_col + 1` to `target_color`.
6.  Set the color of the pixel at column `target_col + 2` to `target_color`.
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
