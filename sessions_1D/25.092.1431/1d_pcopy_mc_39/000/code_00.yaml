Grid:
  Type: 1D Array / Single Row Grid
  Dimensions: 1x33 (constant in examples)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Input_Objects:
  - Name: Source_Object # Note: This object appears irrelevant to the transformation logic observed.
    Type: Contiguous Block
    Shape: 1x3 pixels
    Color: Any non-white (variable, e.g., green, maroon, gray)
    Quantity: 1
  - Name: Target_Pixel
    Type: Single Pixel
    Shape: 1x1 pixel
    Color: Any non-white (variable, different from Source_Object, e.g., maroon, gray, azure)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: To the right of Source_Object, separated by white pixels.

Relationships:
  - Target_Pixel is located at a column index greater than any column index of the Source_Object.
  - Source_Object and Target_Pixel are separated by at least one white pixel.

Transformation:
  Action: Expansion
  Target: The Target_Pixel
  Rule:
    1. Identify the position (row 0, column X) and color (C) of the Target_Pixel.
    2. In the output grid, modify the pixels at (0, X), (0, X+1), and (0, X+2) to color C.
  Effect: The Target_Pixel becomes the leftmost pixel of a new 1x3 block of color C.
  Unaffected_Elements:
    - Source_Object
    - All white pixels not overwritten by the expansion.
