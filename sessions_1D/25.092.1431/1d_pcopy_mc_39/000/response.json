The dimensions appear consistent across examples (1x33).\n2.  **Colors:** The primary background color is white (0). Each input contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.\n3.  **Objects in Input:**\n    *   There is always a contiguous block of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., green-green-green, maroon-maroon-maroon, gray-gray-gray).\n    *   There is always a single isolated non-white pixel of a different color (e.g., maroon, gray, azure), located to the right of the three-pixel block.\n    *   These non-white elements are separated by one or more white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The three-pixel block from the input remains unchanged in the output.\n    *   The single isolated pixel in the input is \"expanded\" in the output. It becomes the starting pixel of a new three-pixel block of the *same* color as the original single pixel. This expansion occurs horizontally to the right.\n    *   All white pixels remain white, except for the two pixels immediately to the right of the original single pixel, which are overwritten by the expansion.\n5.  **Irrelevance:** The specific colors or the relative positions (beyond the single pixel being to the right of the triple block) of the non-white elements don't seem to affect the *type* of transformation, only *which* color is used for the expansion and *where* it occurs. The three-pixel block seems entirely unaffected and potentially irrelevant to the core transformation logic applied to the single pixel. The core operation focuses solely on the single pixel.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
