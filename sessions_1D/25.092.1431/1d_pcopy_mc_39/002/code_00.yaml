Grid:
  Type: 1D Array / Single Row Grid
  Dimensions: 1x33 (constant in examples)
  Background_Color: white (0)

Input_Objects:
  - Name: Irrelevant_Object # Renamed as it seems unaffected and unused by the transformation
    Type: Contiguous Block
    Shape: 1x3 pixels
    Color: Any non-white (variable)
    Quantity: 1
  - Name: Target_Pixel
    Type: Single Pixel
    Property: Isolated (white or boundary neighbors)
    Shape: 1x1 pixel
    Color: Any non-white (variable, distinct from Irrelevant_Object)
    Quantity: 1
    Position: Identified by its column index (target_col) and color (target_color).

Relationships:
  - Target_Pixel is located to the right of the Irrelevant_Object, separated by white pixels.

Transformation:
  Action: Replace and Expand
  Target: The area starting one column *before* the Target_Pixel.
  Rule:
    1. Identify the position (row 0, column `target_col`) and color (`target_color`) of the isolated Target_Pixel.
    2. In the output grid, modify the pixels at (0, `target_col - 1`), (0, `target_col`), and (0, `target_col + 1`) to `target_color`.
  Effect: A new 1x3 block of `target_color` is created, starting one position to the left of the original Target_Pixel's location, overwriting the original pixel and its left and right neighbors.
  Unaffected_Elements:
    - Irrelevant_Object
    - All other pixels not part of the 3-pixel replacement area.
