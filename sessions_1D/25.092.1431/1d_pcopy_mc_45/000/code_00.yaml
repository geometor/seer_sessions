task_description: Expand isolated single colored pixels into 1x3 horizontal blocks.
elements:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1 # Effectively 1D since it's a single row
    content:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: object
        description: Blocks or single pixels of non-white color.
objects:
  - type: single_pixel
    description: A colored pixel with white pixels (or grid boundaries) as horizontal neighbors.
    properties:
      color: non-white (1-9)
      location: original index in the row
    action:
      type: expand
      direction: horizontal
      size: 1x3
      center: original location
      color: same as original pixel
  - type: block
    description: A horizontal sequence of 2 or more identical colored pixels.
    properties:
      color: non-white (1-9)
      location: range of indices
      size: >1 pixel wide
    action:
      type: none # Blocks remain unchanged
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Used to determine if a colored pixel is single (horizontally adjacent to white/boundary) or part of a block (horizontally adjacent to the same color).
constraints:
  - Expansion happens horizontally only.
  - Expansion overwrites background pixels.
  - Expansion is centered on the original single pixel's position.
  - Only single pixels are expanded; existing blocks are preserved.
