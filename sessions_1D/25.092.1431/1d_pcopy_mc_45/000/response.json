            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input and output are single rows (1D arrays represented as strings).\nThe input contains sequences of white pixels (0) interspersed with colored pixels.\nSome colored pixels appear individually (like the maroon 9 and the second orange 7 in `train_1`), while others form horizontal blocks (like the first orange 777 block in `train_1`).\n\nObserving the transformation:\n1.  The existing horizontal block of orange pixels `7 7 7` remains unchanged in the output.\n2.  The single maroon pixel `9` at index 9 in the input is replaced by a `9 9 9` block in the output, centered around the original position (indices 8, 9, 10).\n3.  The single orange pixel `7` at index 13 in the input is replaced by a `7 7 7` block in the output, centered around the original position (indices 12, 13, 14).\n4.  All white pixels (0) remain white unless overwritten by the expansion of a single colored pixel.\n\nThe core transformation seems to be the identification of isolated colored pixels and their expansion into a 1x3 horizontal block of the same color. Pixels already part of a horizontal block (of size > 1) are not affected.\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
