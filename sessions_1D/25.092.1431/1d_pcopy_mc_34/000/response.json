            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output grids are one-dimensional arrays (represented as 1 row, 32 columns).\n2.  **Colors**: The grids contain white pixels (0) and various other colors (gray-5, azure-8, magenta-6, yellow-4, orange-7, blue-1). White pixels appear to serve as background or separators.\n3.  **Objects**: Non-white pixels often form contiguous horizontal blocks. We can consider these blocks as objects.\n4.  **Transformation Observation**:\n    *   Blocks of non-white color with a width greater than 1 pixel (like `5 5 5`, `6 6 6`, `7 7 7`) appear unchanged in the output, maintaining their color and position.\n    *   Single, isolated non-white pixels (width = 1) in the input are transformed in the output. They are replaced by a horizontal block of 3 pixels of the *same* color. This 3-pixel block is centered where the original single pixel was located.\n    *   The white background pixels are adjusted to accommodate the expansion of single pixels into 3-pixel blocks.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
