Task: Expand single non-white pixels horizontally into 3-pixel blocks.

Input_Grid:
  Type: 2D Array (effectively 1D)
  Dimensions: 1x32
  Content: Pixels with integer values 0-9 (colors)
  Background_Color: 0 (white)

Output_Grid:
  Type: 2D Array (effectively 1D)
  Dimensions: 1x32 (same as input)
  Content: Derived from input grid based on transformation rules

Objects:
  - Type: Horizontal_Block
    Definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels in the row.
    Properties:
      - Color: The color (integer value > 0) of the pixels in the block.
      - Width: The number of pixels in the block.
      - Position: The starting and ending column index of the block.

Relationships_And_Actions:
  - Rule: Identify all Horizontal_Blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Condition: Check the Width property of each identified block.
  - Action_1 (if Width == 1):
    - Identify: The color and column index (col) of the single pixel.
    - Transform: In the output grid, create a new Horizontal_Block of the same Color with Width = 3.
    - Placement: Center the new 3-pixel block at the original column index (col). The new block occupies columns [col-1, col, col+1], respecting grid boundaries (columns 0 to 31).
  - Action_2 (if Width > 1):
    - Transform: Copy the original Horizontal_Block (same Color, Width, and Position) from the input grid to the output grid without modification.
  - Background_Handling: White pixels (0) from the input are generally copied to the output, unless they are overwritten by the expansion of a single pixel (Action_1).
