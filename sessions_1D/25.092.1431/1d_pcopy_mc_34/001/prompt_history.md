Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output grids are one-dimensional arrays (represented as 1 row, 32 columns).
2.  **Colors**: The grids contain white pixels (0) and various other colors (gray-5, azure-8, magenta-6, yellow-4, orange-7, blue-1). White pixels appear to serve as background or separators.
3.  **Objects**: Non-white pixels often form contiguous horizontal blocks. We can consider these blocks as objects.
4.  **Transformation Observation**:
    *   Blocks of non-white color with a width greater than 1 pixel (like `5 5 5`, `6 6 6`, `7 7 7`) appear unchanged in the output, maintaining their color and position.
    *   Single, isolated non-white pixels (width = 1) in the input are transformed in the output. They are replaced by a horizontal block of 3 pixels of the *same* color. This 3-pixel block is centered where the original single pixel was located.
    *   The white background pixels are adjusted to accommodate the expansion of single pixels into 3-pixel blocks.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Expand single non-white pixels horizontally into 3-pixel blocks.

Input_Grid:
  Type: 2D Array (effectively 1D)
  Dimensions: 1x32
  Content: Pixels with integer values 0-9 (colors)
  Background_Color: 0 (white)

Output_Grid:
  Type: 2D Array (effectively 1D)
  Dimensions: 1x32 (same as input)
  Content: Derived from input grid based on transformation rules

Objects:
  - Type: Horizontal_Block
    Definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels in the row.
    Properties:
      - Color: The color (integer value > 0) of the pixels in the block.
      - Width: The number of pixels in the block.
      - Position: The starting and ending column index of the block.

Relationships_And_Actions:
  - Rule: Identify all Horizontal_Blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Condition: Check the Width property of each identified block.
  - Action_1 (if Width == 1):
    - Identify: The color and column index (col) of the single pixel.
    - Transform: In the output grid, create a new Horizontal_Block of the same Color with Width = 3.
    - Placement: Center the new 3-pixel block at the original column index (col). The new block occupies columns [col-1, col, col+1], respecting grid boundaries (columns 0 to 31).
  - Action_2 (if Width > 1):
    - Transform: Copy the original Horizontal_Block (same Color, Width, and Position) from the input grid to the output grid without modification.
  - Background_Handling: White pixels (0) from the input are generally copied to the output, unless they are overwritten by the expansion of a single pixel (Action_1).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid (1x32), initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid's single row from left to right (column 0 to 31) to identify contiguous horizontal blocks of non-white pixels. Record the color, starting column, and ending column for each block found.
3.  Iterate through the list of identified blocks.
4.  For each block:
    a.  Calculate its width (width = ending column - starting column + 1).
    b.  If the width is exactly 1:
        i.  Get the color and the column index (`col`) of this single pixel.
        ii. Write this color into the output grid at column `col`.
        iii. Also, write this color into the output grid at column `col - 1`, but only if `col > 0`.
        iv. Also, write this color into the output grid at column `col + 1`, but only if `col < 31`.
    c.  If the width is greater than 1:
        i.  Get the color, starting column (`start_col`), and ending column (`end_col`) of the block.
        ii. Copy the pixels of this block (from `start_col` to `end_col` with the identified color) directly from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
