"""
Transforms the input grid based on the width of contiguous horizontal blocks of non-white pixels.
If a block consists of a single non-white pixel, it is expanded horizontally into a 3-pixel block of the same color, centered at the original pixel's position (respecting grid boundaries).
If a block consists of two or more contiguous non-white pixels of the same color, it is copied to the output grid without modification.
Background pixels (white, 0) are preserved unless overwritten by the expansion of a single pixel.
The transformation is applied to the single row of the input grid.
