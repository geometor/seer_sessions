The input sequence contains \"objects,\" which are contiguous blocks of non-white (non-zero) pixels, separated by white (zero) pixels. The transformation rule targets specific objects based on their size (length). Objects consisting of a single non-white pixel are expanded into a block of three pixels of the same color. Objects that are already longer than one pixel remain unchanged. The white background pixels also remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
