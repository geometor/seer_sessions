Data:
  - type: 1D sequence of integers (pixels)
  - background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - definition: Contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels.
  - properties:
    - color: The integer value of the pixels in the object.
    - length: The number of pixels in the object.
    - position: Start and end indices within the sequence.

Transformation:
  - focus: Operates on individual objects based on their length.
  - rule:
    - if object length is 1:
        action: replace the single pixel with three pixels of the same color.
    - if object length > 1:
        action: keep the object unchanged.
  - background: White pixels remain unchanged.

Relationships:
  - Objects are separated by one or more white pixels.
  - The relative order of objects and white spaces is preserved.
