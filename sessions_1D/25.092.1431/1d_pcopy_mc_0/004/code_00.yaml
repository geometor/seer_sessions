Data:
  - type: 1D sequence of integers (pixels) represented as a 1xN grid.
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (1xN).

Objects:
  - definition: Contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels.
  - properties:
    - color: The integer value of the pixels in the object.
    - length: The number of pixels in the object.
    - position: Indices within the sequence.

Transformation:
  - focus: Operates locally on specific 3-pixel patterns.
  - rule:
    - identify: Find all occurrences of the pattern `[0, C, 0]` where `C` is any non-zero color (1-9).
    - action: Replace each occurrence of `[0, C, 0]` in the input with `[C, C, C]` in the output at the corresponding positions.
    - unchanged: All other pixels (pixels part of longer objects, white pixels not adjacent to a single non-white pixel in the `0 C 0` pattern) are copied directly from the input to the output at their original positions.
  - constraints: The transformation preserves the grid dimensions. Boundary conditions need consideration (patterns at the very start/end are not explicitly shown but the rule implies the pattern must be `0 C 0`).

Relationships:
  - The transformation depends on the immediate neighborhood (left and right pixels) of single, non-zero pixels.
  - The relative order of elements not involved in the `0 C 0 -> C C C` transformation is preserved.
