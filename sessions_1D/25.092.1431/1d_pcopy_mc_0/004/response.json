            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified objects and applied the expansion rule (1 pixel -> 3 pixels) and the pass-through rule (>1 pixel -> unchanged). However, it failed because it incorrectly handled the context, specifically the white (0) pixels surrounding the single-pixel objects being expanded. The code inserted the three pixels without modifying or removing the surrounding white pixels, leading to outputs with incorrect lengths and structures compared to the expected outputs.\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples reveals that the transformation maintains the original grid dimensions. When a single non-white pixel `C` is found at index `i` and is surrounded by white pixels (i.e., the pattern `0 C 0` exists at indices `i-1, i, i+1`), this entire 3-pixel sequence in the input is replaced by `C C C` in the output at the same indices. Pixels not part of such a `0 C 0` pattern that gets transformed are copied directly from the input to the output. This ensures the output grid has the same size as the input grid.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with a placeholder or copied from the input.\n2.  Iterate through the input grid, specifically looking for the pattern `0 C 0` where `C` is non-zero. The check needs to handle boundary conditions (avoiding index errors at the start/end of the sequence).\n3.  When the pattern `0 C 0` is found (with `C` at index `i`), update the *output* grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to `C, C, C`.\n4.  Keep track of which output indices have been modified by this expansion rule. A simple way is to iterate with `i` and when a transformation `0 C 0 -> C C C` is performed at `i-1, i, i+1`, advance the iteration index `i` by 3.\n5.  If the current pixel `input[i]` is not the center of a `0 C 0` pattern that gets transformed, copy `input[i]` to `output[i]` (if not already filled by a previous expansion centered at `i-1`). Advance `i` by 1.\n6.  This process ensures all pixels are considered and the output grid is correctly populated.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"

Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same values as the input grid (or zeros).\n2.  Iterate through the input grid's pixels using an index `i`, starting from the second pixel (`i=1`) up to the second-to-last pixel (`i = length - 2`) to allow checking neighbors.\n3.  At each index `i`, check if the pixel `input[i]` is non-white (value `C > 0`).\n4.  If `input[i]` is non-white, check its neighbors: `input[i-1]` and `input[i+1]`.\n5.  If both neighbors `input[i-1]` and `input[i+1]` are white (value 0), then the pattern `0 C 0` is found.\n6.  If the pattern is found:\n    *   Modify the *output* grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by setting all three positions to the color `C`.\n7.  If the pattern `0 C 0` is *not* found at index `i` (either because `input[i]` is 0, or one or both neighbors are non-zero), ensure the corresponding pixel `output[i]` retains its original value from the input (if initializing the output as a copy, no action is needed here; if initializing with zeros, copy `input[i]` to `output[i]` only if `output[i]` hasn't been potentially modified by a pattern centered at `i-1`). *Correction*: A simpler approach is to initialize the output as a copy of the input and only modify it when the `0 C 0` pattern is found.\n8.  Handle the first (`i=0`) and last (`i=length-1`) pixels: Since the transformation rule seen requires a `0 C 0` pattern, pixels at the absolute edges (index 0 and N-1) cannot be the center `C` of such a pattern, and will thus always be copied directly from input to output (unless they are the `0` part of a pattern centered at index 1 or N-2, respectively, in which case they will be overwritten by the central color `C`).\n9.  After iterating through all possible center indices (`i` from 1 to length-2), return the modified output grid."
