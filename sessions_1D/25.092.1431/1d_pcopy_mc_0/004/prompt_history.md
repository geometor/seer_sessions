**Perception:**

The task operates on a 1D sequence of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The input sequence contains "objects," which are contiguous blocks of non-white (non-zero) pixels, separated by white (zero) pixels. The transformation rule targets specific objects based on their size (length). Objects consisting of a single non-white pixel are expanded into a block of three pixels of the same color. Objects that are already longer than one pixel remain unchanged. The white background pixels also remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: 1D sequence of integers (pixels)
  - background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - definition: Contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels.
  - properties:
    - color: The integer value of the pixels in the object.
    - length: The number of pixels in the object.
    - position: Start and end indices within the sequence.

Transformation:
  - focus: Operates on individual objects based on their length.
  - rule:
    - if object length is 1:
        action: replace the single pixel with three pixels of the same color.
    - if object length > 1:
        action: keep the object unchanged.
  - background: White pixels remain unchanged.

Relationships:
  - Objects are separated by one or more white pixels.
  - The relative order of objects and white spaces is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (objects) and their start/end positions, lengths, and colors. Also, identify the positions of white pixels.
2.  Create a new empty output sequence.
3.  Process the input sequence element by element or object by object:
    *   If the current element is a white pixel (0), append a white pixel to the output sequence.
    *   If the current element is the start of an identified object:
        *   Check the length of this object.
        *   If the object's length is 1: Append three pixels of the object's color to the output sequence. Skip the next element in the input (as it's already processed).
        *   If the object's length is greater than 1: Append the entire object (all its pixels) as is to the output sequence. Skip the corresponding number of elements in the input.
4.  Continue processing until the end of the input sequence is reached.
5.  Return the completed output sequence.
