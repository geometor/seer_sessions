Data:
  - type: 2D grid (NumPy array) of integers (pixels)
  - input_shape: 1xN (specifically 1x32 in examples)
  - output_shape: 1xM (specifically 1x32 in examples, although the length could change)
  - background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - definition: Contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels within the single row.
  - properties:
    - color: The integer value of the pixels in the object.
    - length: The number of pixels in the object.
    - position: Start index within the row.

Transformation:
  - scope: Operates on the single row of the input grid.
  - focus: Modifies objects based on their length.
  - rule:
    - Identify all contiguous segments (objects) of non-zero pixels and their lengths.
    - Identify all segments of zero pixels (background).
    - Reconstruct the row:
        - Copy background segments unchanged.
        - For each object segment:
            - if object length is 1:
                action: replace the single pixel with three pixels of the same color.
            - if object length > 1:
                action: keep the object unchanged (copy the segment as is).
  - background: White pixels (0) are preserved in their positions relative to the potentially modified objects.
  - output: A new 1xM grid containing the transformed row.

Relationships:
  - Objects are separated by one or more white pixels.
  - The relative order of objects (potentially modified) and white spaces is preserved.
