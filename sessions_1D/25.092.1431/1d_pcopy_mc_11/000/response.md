Okay, let's analyze the provided example pair.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are presented as single lines of numbers, suggesting they are 1-dimensional arrays or single-row grids.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) acting as a background, and various non-white colors (red=2, gray=5, magenta=6, yellow=4 in this example) which seem to represent distinct objects or markers.
3.  **Input Pattern:** The input contains sequences of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., `2 2 2`) and single non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (e.g., `0 5 0`, `0 6 0`, `0 4 0`).
4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output, the sequences of three identical non-white pixels from the input remain unchanged. The single non-white pixels from the input have expanded into sequences of three identical pixels, centered approximately where the single pixel was. Specifically, the pattern `0 X 0` (where X is non-white) in the input becomes `X X X` in the output, effectively replacing the surrounding white pixels.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be an expansion rule applied selectively. Single, isolated non-white pixels expand to fill their immediate neighborhood (left and right), resulting in a 3-pixel block of that color. Existing 3-pixel blocks of a non-white color are preserved. White background pixels are either preserved or overwritten by the expansion rule.

**YAML Facts:**

      - color: non-white

    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - neighbors:

    action: expand_to_3
      - target_pixels: [left_neighbor, self, right_neighbor]
      - result: [color, color, color]

    condition: immediate left and right neighbors must be background_color for expansion rule to apply.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output array of the same size as the input array, initially filled with the background color (white/0) or as a copy of the input.
2.  Iterate through the input array from the second element (index 1) up to the second-to-last element (index length-2).
3.  For each element at index `i`:
    *   Check if the element at `i` is non-white (not 0).
    *   Check if the element at `i-1` is white (0).
    *   Check if the element at `i+1` is white (0).
    *   If all three conditions are true (i.e., we found an isolated non-white pixel `0 X 0`), then in the *output* array, set the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to the color of the element at index `i` from the *input* array.
4.  If the conditions in step 3 are not met for index `i`, check if the element at index `i` in the input is part of a sequence `X X X`. If it is, ensure the corresponding position `i` in the output array retains the value `X`. (Alternatively, if the output started as a copy of the input, this step ensures these values are not overwritten). Handle edge cases and ensure the iteration logic correctly copies unchanged pixels. A simpler approach might be:
    *   Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array.
    *   Iterate through the input array from index 1 to length-2.
    *   If an isolated non-white pixel is found at index `i` (input[i-1]==0, input[i]!=0, input[i+1]==0), update the output array at indices `i-1`, `i`, `i+1` with the color `input[i]`.
5.  Return the final output array.
