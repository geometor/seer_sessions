The single non-white pixels from the input have expanded into sequences of three identical pixels, centered approximately where the single pixel was. Specifically, the pattern `0 X 0` (where X is non-white) in the input becomes `X X X` in the output, effectively replacing the surrounding white pixels.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be an expansion rule applied selectively. Single, isolated non-white pixels expand to fill their immediate neighborhood (left and right), resulting in a 3-pixel block of that color. Existing 3-pixel blocks of a non-white color are preserved. White background pixels are either preserved or overwritten by the expansion rule.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new output array of the same size as the input array, initially filled with the background color (white/0) or as a copy of the input.\n2.  Iterate through the input array from the second element (index 1) up to the second-to-last element (index length-2).\n3.  For each element at index `i`:\n    *   Check if the element at `i` is non-white (not 0).\n    *   Check if the element at `i-1` is white (0).\n    *   Check if the element at `i+1` is white (0).\n    *   If all three conditions are true (i.e., we found an isolated non-white pixel `0 X 0`), then in the *output* array, set the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to the color of the element at index `i` from the *input* array.\n4.  If the conditions in step 3 are not met for index `i`, check if the element at index `i` in the input is part of a sequence `X X X`. If it is, ensure the corresponding position `i` in the output array retains the value `X`. (Alternatively, if the output started as a copy of the input, this step ensures these values are not overwritten). Handle edge cases and ensure the iteration logic correctly copies unchanged pixels. A simpler approach might be:\n    *   Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array.\n    *   Iterate through the input array from index 1 to length-2.\n    *   If an isolated non-white pixel is found at index `i` (input[i-1]==0, input[i]!=0, input[i+1]==0), update the output array at indices `i-1`, `i`, `i+1` with the color `input[i]`.\n5.  Return the final output array."
