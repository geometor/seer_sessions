objects:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - length: 3
      - composition: identical pixels
    action: preserved
  - type: isolated_pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - neighbors:
          left: 0 # white
          right: 0 # white
    action: expand_to_3
      - target_pixels: [left_neighbor, self, right_neighbor]
      - result: [color, color, color]
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    involved: [isolated_pixel, background_color]
    condition: immediate left and right neighbors must be background_color for expansion rule to apply.
