Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception:**

The task appears to operate on a one-dimensional sequence of pixels (colors). Each example input contains exactly two non-white elements:
1.  A contiguous block of 3 identical non-white pixels (e.g., `8 8 8`, `2 2 2`). I'll call this the "template block".
2.  A single isolated non-white pixel (e.g., `1`, `7`, `3`). I'll call this the "seed pixel".

The transformation rule seems to involve using the properties of these two elements to generate the output:
*   The template block remains unchanged in its original position in the output.
*   The seed pixel is used to determine the color and placement of a new block in the output.
*   A new block is created in the output. This new block has the same color as the seed pixel and the same size (length) as the template block.
*   The new block is positioned such that it starts one index immediately to the left of the original position of the seed pixel.
*   The original seed pixel location becomes white (0) in the output, replaced by the start of the new block.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Transform a 1D sequence based on a template block and a seed pixel.

elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A 1D sequence of pixels (colors).
  - type: object
    name: template_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of 3 identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block.
      - size: The number of pixels in the block (always 3 in examples).
      - position: The starting index of the block.
    relationship: Remains unchanged in the output.
  - type: object
    name: seed_pixel
    description: A single isolated non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixel.
      - size: 1 pixel.
      - position: The index of the pixel.
    relationship: Determines the color and influences the position of the new_block. Its original position becomes white or is overwritten.
  - type: object
    name: new_block
    description: A block created in the output sequence.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the seed_pixel color.
      - size: Same as the template_block size (3 pixels).
      - position: Starts at the index immediately preceding the original seed_pixel position.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: template_block
    details: Find the contiguous block of 3 identical non-white pixels. Record its size.
  - action: identify
    target: seed_pixel
    details: Find the single isolated non-white pixel. Record its color and position.
  - action: copy
    source: input_sequence
    target: output_sequence
    details: Initialize the output as a copy of the input.
  - action: modify
    target: output_sequence
    details: Set the pixel at the original seed_pixel position to white (0).
  - action: create
    target: new_block
    details: Place a block in the output sequence with the color of the seed_pixel and the size of the template_block, starting at the index one less than the seed_pixel's original position.

input_constraints:
  - Contains exactly one template_block (size 3).
  - Contains exactly one seed_pixel.
  - The template_block and seed_pixel do not overlap.
  - The seed_pixel is not at index 0.

output_derivation:
  - The template_block from the input is preserved in the output.
  - A new_block is generated based on the properties of the seed_pixel (color) and template_block (size), positioned relative to the seed_pixel's original location.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input sequence to locate the contiguous block of identical non-white pixels (the "template block"). Determine its size (number of pixels).
2.  Scan the input sequence to locate the single, isolated non-white pixel (the "seed pixel"). Determine its color and its index (position).
3.  Create a new sequence for the output, initially identical to the input sequence.
4.  In the output sequence, change the pixel at the original index of the "seed pixel" to white (color 0).
5.  Determine the starting index for the new block: this is the index immediately before the original "seed pixel" index (seed pixel index - 1).
6.  Starting at this new index, write a sequence of pixels into the output sequence. This sequence should have the same color as the "seed pixel" and the same length (size) as the "template block". This write operation may overwrite the pixel set to white in step 4.
