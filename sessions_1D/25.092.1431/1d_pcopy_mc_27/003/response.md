"""
Transform a 1D sequence based on identifying two key elements: a 'template block' and a 'seed pixel'.
The template block is a contiguous sequence of exactly 3 identical non-white pixels.
The seed pixel is a single non-white pixel isolated by white pixels (0) or grid boundaries.
The transformation rule is:
1. Preserve the original template block in the output.
2. Create a new block in the output sequence. This new block:
    - has the same color as the seed pixel.
    - has the same size as the template block (3 pixels).
    - starts at the index immediately preceding the original position of the seed pixel (seed_index - 1).
3. The original seed pixel location is overwritten by this new block.
