task_description: Transform a 1D sequence based on a template block and a seed pixel.

elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A 1D sequence of pixels (colors).
  - type: object
    name: template_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of 3 identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block.
      - size: The number of pixels in the block (always 3 in examples).
      - position: The starting index of the block.
    relationship: Remains unchanged in the output.
  - type: object
    name: seed_pixel
    description: A single isolated non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixel.
      - size: 1 pixel.
      - position: The index of the pixel.
    relationship: Determines the color and influences the position of the new_block. Its original position becomes white or is overwritten.
  - type: object
    name: new_block
    description: A block created in the output sequence.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the seed_pixel color.
      - size: Same as the template_block size (3 pixels).
      - position: Starts at the index immediately preceding the original seed_pixel position.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: template_block
    details: Find the contiguous block of 3 identical non-white pixels. Record its size.
  - action: identify
    target: seed_pixel
    details: Find the single isolated non-white pixel. Record its color and position.
  - action: copy
    source: input_sequence
    target: output_sequence
    details: Initialize the output as a copy of the input.
  - action: modify
    target: output_sequence
    details: Set the pixel at the original seed_pixel position to white (0).
  - action: create
    target: new_block
    details: Place a block in the output sequence with the color of the seed_pixel and the size of the template_block, starting at the index one less than the seed_pixel's original position.

input_constraints:
  - Contains exactly one template_block (size 3).
  - Contains exactly one seed_pixel.
  - The template_block and seed_pixel do not overlap.
  - The seed_pixel is not at index 0.

output_derivation:
  - The template_block from the input is preserved in the output.
  - A new_block is generated based on the properties of the seed_pixel (color) and template_block (size), positioned relative to the seed_pixel's original location.
