            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe task appears to operate on a one-dimensional sequence of pixels (colors). Each example input contains exactly two non-white elements:\n1.  A contiguous block of 3 identical non-white pixels (e.g., `8 8 8`, `2 2 2`). I'll call this the \"template block\".\n2.  A single isolated non-white pixel (e.g., `1`, `7`, `3`). I'll call this the \"seed pixel\".\n\nThe transformation rule seems to involve using the properties of these two elements to generate the output:\n*   The template block remains unchanged in its original position in the output.\n*   The seed pixel is used to determine the color and placement of a new block in the output.\n*   A new block is created in the output. This new block has the same color as the seed pixel and the same size (length) as the template block.\n*   The new block is positioned such that it starts one index immediately to the left of the original position of the seed pixel.\n*   The original seed pixel location becomes white (0) in the output, replaced by the start of the new block.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the starting index for the new block: this is the index immediately before the original \"seed pixel\" index (seed pixel index - 1).\n6.  Starting at this new index, write a sequence of pixels into the output sequence. This sequence should have the same color as the \"seed pixel\" and the same length (size) as the \"template block\". This write operation may overwrite the pixel set to white in step 4."
