GridProperties:
  dimensionality: 2
  rows: 1
  symmetry: none

Objects:
  - type: block
    definition: A sequence of 3 identical non-white pixels horizontally adjacent.
    attributes:
      color: C (where C > 0)
      length: 3
    examples: [ '1 1 1', '9 9 9', '4 4 4' ]
  - type: pixel
    definition: A single non-white pixel C at index 'i' such that the pixel at 'i-1' (if exists) is not C, AND the pixel at 'i+1' (if exists) is not C.
    attributes:
      color: C (where C > 0)
      location: index i
    examples: [ '8' in '0 8 0', '7' in '0 7 0', '4' in '0 4 0' ]
  - type: background
    definition: White pixels (0).

Relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are evaluated based on their immediate horizontal neighbors.
  - type: position
    description: The transformation depends on the index/column of the pixel.

Actions:
  - name: replicate_right
    actor: isolated single pixel (type: pixel)
    target: the two pixels immediately to the right of the actor pixel.
    condition: The actor pixel must be of type 'pixel' (isolated single non-white pixel).
    effect: Changes the color of the two target pixels to match the color of the actor pixel.
  - name: no_change
    actor: block of three (type: block)
    condition: The object is a pre-existing block of three identical non-white pixels.
    effect: The block remains unchanged in the output.
  - name: no_change
    actor: background pixel (type: background)
    condition: The pixel is white (0) and is not targeted by a 'replicate_right' action.
    effect: The pixel remains white (0) in the output.

TransformationRule:
  - Identify all 'isolated single pixels' in the input grid based on their color and neighbors.
  - For each identified pixel C at index 'i', modify a copy of the grid by setting the pixels at indices 'i+1' and 'i+2' to color C.
  - All other pixels (part of 3-blocks or background pixels not overwritten) retain their original color.
