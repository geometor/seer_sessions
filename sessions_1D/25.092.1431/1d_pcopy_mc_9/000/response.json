            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-row grid (effectively a 1D array or sequence). The width varies but seems large enough to accommodate the changes.\n2.  **Colors:** The background color is white (0). Various other colors (blue=1, red=2, green=3, yellow=4, gray=5, magenta=6, orange=7, azure=8, maroon=9) appear.\n3.  **Objects:** We can perceive two types of primary objects composed of non-white pixels:\n    *   Blocks of three identical, horizontally adjacent non-white pixels (e.g., `1 1 1`, `9 9 9`, `4 4 4`).\n    *   Single, isolated non-white pixels (e.g., the `8` and `7` in train\\_1; the `4` in train\\_2; the `9`, `6`, and `1` in train\\_3). An isolated pixel is one whose immediate left and right neighbors are *not* the same color as itself (often they are white/0).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation targets the *single, isolated* non-white pixels. Blocks of three identical non-white pixels seem to remain unchanged.\n5.  **Action:** When a single, isolated non-white pixel of color `C` is found at a position `i`, it appears to \"expand\" or \"replicate\" itself into the two positions immediately to its right (`i+1` and `i+2`), changing those cells to color `C`. This results in a block of three `C C C` starting at position `i`. This expansion overwrites the original content of cells `i+1` and `i+2`, which are always white (0) in the examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
