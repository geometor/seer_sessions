Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-row grid (effectively a 1D array or sequence). The width varies but seems large enough to accommodate the changes.
2.  **Colors:** The background color is white (0). Various other colors (blue=1, red=2, green=3, yellow=4, gray=5, magenta=6, orange=7, azure=8, maroon=9) appear.
3.  **Objects:** We can perceive two types of primary objects composed of non-white pixels:
    *   Blocks of three identical, horizontally adjacent non-white pixels (e.g., `1 1 1`, `9 9 9`, `4 4 4`).
    *   Single, isolated non-white pixels (e.g., the `8` and `7` in train\_1; the `4` in train\_2; the `9`, `6`, and `1` in train\_3). An isolated pixel is one whose immediate left and right neighbors are *not* the same color as itself (often they are white/0).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation targets the *single, isolated* non-white pixels. Blocks of three identical non-white pixels seem to remain unchanged.
5.  **Action:** When a single, isolated non-white pixel of color `C` is found at a position `i`, it appears to "expand" or "replicate" itself into the two positions immediately to its right (`i+1` and `i+2`), changing those cells to color `C`. This results in a block of three `C C C` starting at position `i`. This expansion overwrites the original content of cells `i+1` and `i+2`, which are always white (0) in the examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
GridProperties:
  dimensionality: 2
  rows: 1
  symmetry: none

Objects:
  - type: block
    definition: A sequence of 3 identical non-white pixels horizontally adjacent.
    attributes:
      color: C (where C > 0)
      length: 3
    examples: [ '1 1 1', '9 9 9', '4 4 4' ]
  - type: pixel
    definition: A single non-white pixel C at index 'i' such that the pixel at 'i-1' (if exists) is not C, AND the pixel at 'i+1' (if exists) is not C.
    attributes:
      color: C (where C > 0)
      location: index i
    examples: [ '8' in '0 8 0', '7' in '0 7 0', '4' in '0 4 0' ]
  - type: background
    definition: White pixels (0).

Relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are evaluated based on their immediate horizontal neighbors.
  - type: position
    description: The transformation depends on the index/column of the pixel.

Actions:
  - name: replicate_right
    actor: isolated single pixel (type: pixel)
    target: the two pixels immediately to the right of the actor pixel.
    condition: The actor pixel must be of type 'pixel' (isolated single non-white pixel).
    effect: Changes the color of the two target pixels to match the color of the actor pixel.
  - name: no_change
    actor: block of three (type: block)
    condition: The object is a pre-existing block of three identical non-white pixels.
    effect: The block remains unchanged in the output.
  - name: no_change
    actor: background pixel (type: background)
    condition: The pixel is white (0) and is not targeted by a 'replicate_right' action.
    effect: The pixel remains white (0) in the output.

TransformationRule:
  - Identify all 'isolated single pixels' in the input grid based on their color and neighbors.
  - For each identified pixel C at index 'i', modify a copy of the grid by setting the pixels at indices 'i+1' and 'i+2' to color C.
  - All other pixels (part of 3-blocks or background pixels not overwritten) retain their original color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the columns (pixels) of the input grid from left to right, using index `i`.
3.  For each pixel at index `i` with a non-white color `C`:
    a.  Check if it's an "isolated single pixel":
        i.  Verify that the pixel to the left (at `i-1`, if `i > 0`) does *not* have color `C`.
        ii. Verify that the pixel to the right (at `i+1`, if `i < width-1`) does *not* have color `C`.
    b.  If both conditions are true (it is an isolated single pixel):
        i.  If `i+1` is within the grid bounds, change the color of the pixel at index `i+1` in the *output* grid to `C`.
        ii. If `i+2` is within the grid bounds, change the color of the pixel at index `i+2` in the *output* grid to `C`.
4.  After checking all pixels in the input grid, return the final output grid.
