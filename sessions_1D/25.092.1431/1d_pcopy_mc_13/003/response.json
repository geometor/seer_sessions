An isolated pixel is a single \nnon-white pixel whose immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right), \nif they exist within the grid bounds, are all white (0).\nFor each isolated pixel found at position (r, c) with color C, change the \ncolor of the pixels at (r, c-1), (r, c), and (r, c+1) in the output grid to C, \nprovided these positions are within the grid bounds.
