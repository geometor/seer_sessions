"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
Find isolated non-white pixels in the input grid. An isolated pixel is a single 
non-white pixel whose immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right), 
if they exist within the grid bounds, are all white (0).
For each isolated pixel found at position (r, c) with color C, change the 
color of the pixels at (r, c-1), (r, c), and (r, c+1) in the output grid to C, 
provided these positions are within the grid bounds. Pixels that are not part of 
this transformation (including non-isolated non-white pixels) retain their 
original color from the input.
