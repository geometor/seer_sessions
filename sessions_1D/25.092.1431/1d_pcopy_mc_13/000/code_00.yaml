task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: 3x11 (inferred)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: isolated_pixel
    description: A single non-white pixel surrounded horizontally and vertically by white pixels or grid boundaries.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white (1-9)
      - size: 1x1
    actions:
      - name: expand_right
        parameters:
          - distance: 2 cells
        conditions:
          - target_cells_exist: The cells at (row, col+1) and (row, col+2) must be within grid bounds.
          # - target_cells_are_white: The cells at (row, col+1) and (row, col+2) must be white (0). (Implicit in examples)
        effect: Changes the color of the target cells (row, col+1) and (row, col+2) to the color of the isolated_pixel.
  - type: color_block
    description: A contiguous area of 2 or more pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white (1-9)
      - size: >= 2 pixels
    actions:
      - name: none
        description: These blocks remain unchanged in the output.
relationships:
  - The transformation applied depends on whether a non-white pixel is isolated (1x1) or part of a larger block.
