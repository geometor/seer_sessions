            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data appear to be flattened representations of 2D grids. Based on the number of elements (33) and the visual patterns in the reconstructed examples, a grid size of 3x11 seems highly likely for all examples. The background color is white (0).\n2.  **Input Objects:** The inputs contain various colored shapes and isolated pixels against the white background.\n    *   Example 1: A 1x3 blue (1) horizontal bar and an isolated yellow (4) pixel.\n    *   Example 2: A 1x3 red (2) horizontal bar, an isolated orange (7) pixel, and two isolated green (3) pixels.\n    *   Example 3: A 1x3 orange (7) horizontal bar and an isolated magenta (6) pixel.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is that isolated, non-white pixels \"expand\" horizontally to the right. Specifically, an isolated pixel of color C at position (row, col) causes the cells at (row, col+1) and (row, col+2) to also become color C.\n4.  **Object Preservation:** Existing shapes (like the 1x3 bars) that are larger than a single pixel remain unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Isolation Condition:** The expansion only seems to apply to pixels that are 1x1 blocks of a non-white color, surrounded horizontally and vertically by white pixels (or grid boundaries). Pixels that are part of larger contiguous blocks of the same color do not trigger this expansion.\n6.  **Target Condition:** The expansion overwrites the cells to the right only if they are currently white (0). While not explicitly tested with non-white target cells in the examples, this is a reasonable assumption based on the observed behavior.\n7.  **Consistency:** The transformation rule appears consistent across all three examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

If it does, change its color in the output grid to C.\n    b.  Check if the cell at (row, col+2) exists within the grid boundaries. If it does, change its color in the output grid to C.\n6.  If the cell is non-white but not isolated (i.e., it's part of a larger block of the same color), do nothing (its color is already preserved in the initialized output grid).\n7.  After checking all cells in the input grid, the modified output grid is the result."
