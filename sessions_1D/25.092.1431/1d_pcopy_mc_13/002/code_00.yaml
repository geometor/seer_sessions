task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: 3x11 (observed)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: isolated_pixel
    description: A single non-white pixel whose orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right), if they exist within the grid bounds, are all white (0).
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white (1-9)
      - size: 1x1
      - location: (row, col)
    actions:
      - name: transform_to_1x3_block
        conditions:
          - The pixel must be isolated.
        effect: In the output grid, sets the color of the pixels at `(row, col-1)`, `(row, col)`, and `(row, col+1)` to the color of the isolated_pixel. This action only modifies pixels within the grid boundaries (e.g., if col=0, only (row, 0) and (row, 1) are affected; if col=width-1, only (row, width-2) and (row, width-1) are affected). The transformation overwrites any previous content at these locations in the output grid.
  - type: non_isolated_non_white_pixel
    description: Any non-white pixel that is not an isolated_pixel (i.e., has at least one non-white orthogonal neighbor). This includes pixels that are part of larger contiguous blocks.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white (1-9)
      - location: (row, col)
    actions:
      - name: copy_to_output
        effect: The pixel retains its original color and position in the output grid. (This is achieved by initializing the output as a copy and only modifying based on isolated pixels).
