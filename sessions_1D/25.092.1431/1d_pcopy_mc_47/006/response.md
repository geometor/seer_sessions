**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous attempt failed because the transformation rule was misinterpreted. The code incorrectly assumed that *any* non-background pixel encountered should result in writing three identical pixels to the output and advancing the input index by three. This failed to distinguish between pre-existing 3-pixel blocks (which should be preserved) and single pixels requiring transformation.

The analysis of the failed examples reveals a consistent pattern:
1.  Existing 3-pixel blocks of the same color in the input are copied directly to the output, advancing the position by 3.
2.  Single non-background pixels (pixels not part of an existing 3-block of the same color) trigger a specific transformation *only if* their immediate left neighbor in the input is a background pixel (0).
3.  This transformation involves replacing the background pixel to the left and the single pixel itself with a 3-pixel block of the single pixel's color. Effectively, the single pixel shifts one position left and expands into a 3-pixel block. The input index advances only by 1 after processing the single pixel, as the following two positions in the input were irrelevant to the transformed output block.
4.  Background pixels (0) are generally copied, unless they are replaced by the left-shifting expansion of a single colored pixel.

The strategy is to implement this revised logic, carefully handling the conditions for transformation and the correct advancement of the input index. A sequential build of the output row seems appropriate.

**Metrics**

Based on the comparison between the expected outputs and the outputs generated by the previous incorrect code (`code_00.py`):

import numpy as np

    """Analyzes differences between two 1D lists (rows)."""

    report["Example"] = example_name
    report["Input Length"] = len(expected_row) # Assuming input/output lengths are same based on task
    report["Expected Output Length"] = len(expected_row)
    report["Actual Output Length"] = len(actual_row)
    report["Length Match"] = len(expected_row) == len(actual_row)

    if report["Length Match"]:
        for i in range(len(expected_row)):
            if expected_row[i] != actual_row[i]:

                    "actual_value": actual_row[i]
                })
    else:
        diff_count = abs(len(expected_row) - len(actual_row)) + min(len(expected_row), len(actual_row)) # Rough estimate

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN 2D grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel Block
    properties:
      color: non-zero integer (1-9)
      size_in_input:
        - 1 pixel (single pixel object)
        - 3 pixels (3-pixel block object)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      position: index within the row

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Crucial for identifying 3-pixel blocks (C, C, C) and the left neighbor of single pixels.

Transformation:
  action: Sequential Processing and Conditional Modification
  target: Non-background pixels (color != 0)
  rules:
    - Rule 1 (Preservation):
        condition: A non-background pixel `C` at index `i` is followed by two more pixels of color `C` at `i+1` and `i+2` (within bounds).
        effect: Append `C, C, C` to the output. Advance input index by 3.
    - Rule 2 (Shift-Left Expansion):
        condition: A non-background pixel `C` at index `i` is *not* part of an existing 3-block (fails Rule 1 condition), AND index `i > 0`, AND the input pixel at `i-1` is background (0).
        effect: Remove the last appended pixel (which must be the '0' from `input[i-1]`) from the output. Append `C, C, C` to the output. Advance input index by 1.
    - Rule 3 (Copy Background):
        condition: The pixel at index `i` is background (0).
        effect: Append `0` to the output. Advance input index by 1.
    - Rule 4 (Default/Copy Single - Inferred):
        condition: A non-background pixel `C` at index `i` does not meet the conditions for Rule 1 or Rule 2 (e.g., single pixel at index 0, or single pixel whose left neighbor is not background). This case is not explicitly shown in examples. Based on minimal change principle, assume it's copied.
        effect (assumed): Append `C` to the output. Advance input index by 1. (Note: The chosen sequential algorithm implicitly handles this via the final append/increment step if other rules don't apply).

Output Construction:
  - The output row is built sequentially based on applying the rules while iterating through the input row.
  - The final output grid maintains the 1xN shape.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list `output_row` to store the transformed pixels.
2.  Initialize an index `i` to 0 to track the current position in the `input_row`.
3.  Get the width of the `input_row`.
4.  While `i` is less than the `width`:
    a.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `input_row[i]`.
    b.  Check if `C` is non-background (`C != 0`).
    c.  **If `C` is non-background:**
        i.  Check if it forms a 3-pixel block in the input: Look ahead to see if `i+1` and `i+2` are within the grid bounds AND `input_row[i+1] == C` AND `input_row[i+2] == C`.
        ii. **If it is a 3-pixel block:** Append `C`, `C`, `C` to `output_row`. Increment `i` by 3. Go to the start of the while loop (step 4).
        iii.**If it is NOT a 3-pixel block:** Check if the pixel can be shifted left and expanded: Look behind to see if `i > 0` AND `input_row[i-1] == 0`.
        iv. **If it can be shifted left:** Remove the last element added to `output_row` (which corresponds to the background pixel at `input_row[i-1]`). Append `C`, `C`, `C` to `output_row`. Increment `i` by 1. Go to the start of the while loop (step 4).
    d.  **If the program reaches this point, it means either:**
        *   The pixel `C` at `input_row[i]` was background (0).
        *   Or, it was a non-background pixel that didn't satisfy the conditions for Rule 1 (3-block) or Rule 2 (shift-left expand).
    e.  Append the original pixel `C` (which is `input_row[i]`) to `output_row`.
    f.  Increment `i` by 1.
5.  After the loop finishes, wrap the `output_row` in a list to form the final 1xN output grid.
6.  Return the final output grid.
