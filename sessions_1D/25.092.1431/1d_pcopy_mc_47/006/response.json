            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous attempt failed because the transformation rule was misinterpreted. The code incorrectly assumed that *any* non-background pixel encountered should result in writing three identical pixels to the output and advancing the input index by three. This failed to distinguish between pre-existing 3-pixel blocks (which should be preserved) and single pixels requiring transformation.\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples reveals a consistent pattern:\n1.  Existing 3-pixel blocks of the same color in the input are copied directly to the output, advancing the position by 3.\n2.  Single non-background pixels (pixels not part of an existing 3-block of the same color) trigger a specific transformation *only if* their immediate left neighbor in the input is a background pixel (0).\n3.  This transformation involves replacing the background pixel to the left and the single pixel itself with a 3-pixel block of the single pixel's color. Effectively, the single pixel shifts one position left and expands into a 3-pixel block. The input index advances only by 1 after processing the single pixel, as the following two positions in the input were irrelevant to the transformed output block.\n4.  Background pixels (0) are generally copied, unless they are replaced by the left-shifting expansion of a single colored pixel.\n\nThe strategy is to implement this revised logic, carefully handling the conditions for transformation and the correct advancement of the input index. A sequential build of the output row seems appropriate.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the comparison between the expected outputs and the outputs generated by the previous incorrect code (`code_00.py`):\n\n"
