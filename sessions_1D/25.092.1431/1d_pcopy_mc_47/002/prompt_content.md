```python
import numpy as np
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid based on sequences of colored pixels.

The transformation operates on a single-row grid. It iterates through the input row:
1. If a pixel is background (0), it's copied to the output.
2. If a non-background pixel is encountered:
   a. Check if it's the start of a 3-pixel block of the same color.
   b. If it is a 3-pixel block, copy all three pixels to the output and advance the input index by 3.
   c. If it's not a 3-pixel block (i.e., it's a single colored pixel or the sequence is interrupted before 3 pixels), treat it as a single pixel to be expanded. Append three pixels of its color to the output and advance the input index by 1.
The process continues until the entire input row is processed.
