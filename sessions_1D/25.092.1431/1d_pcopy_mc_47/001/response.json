Check if it's the start of a 3-pixel block of the same color.\n   b. If it is a 3-pixel block, copy all three pixels to the output and advance the input index by 3.\n   c. If it's not a 3-pixel block (i.e., it's a single colored pixel or the sequence is interrupted before 3 pixels), treat it as a single pixel to be expanded.
