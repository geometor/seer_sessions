Grid:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN 2D grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel Block
    properties:
      color: C (non-zero integer 1-9)
      size_in_input:
        - 1 pixel (single pixel object)
        - 3 pixels (3-pixel block object)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      position: index `i` within the input row

Transformation:
  action: Sequential Processing and Conditional Transformation
  target: Non-background pixels in the input row.
  rule: Iterate through the input row using index `i`.
    - If `input[i]` is background (0):
        Append 0 to the output.
        Increment `i` by 1.
    - If `input[i]` is non-background (color C):
        Check if `input[i:i+3]` forms a block `[C, C, C]` (within bounds).
        If yes (existing 3-block):
            Append `C, C, C` to the output.
            Increment `i` by 3.
        If no (single pixel or start of shorter block):
            Append `C, C, C` to the output (expansion).
            Increment `i` by 3. # Crucial correction: Advance past the conceptual 3-pixel space consumed.
  output_size: The output width will be `input_width + 2 * (number of single non-background pixels in input)`. The metrics confirm this relationship holds for the expected outputs.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Objects are positioned horizontally, potentially separated by background pixels.
  - Transformation Dependency: The processing depends on whether a non-background pixel is the start of an existing 3-pixel block of the same color.
  - Index Advancement: Background pixels advance the index by 1. Non-background pixels, whether preserved or expanded, result in a 3-pixel output block and advance the input index by 3.
