Grid:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN 2D grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel Block
    properties:
      color: non-zero integer (1-9)
      size: 
        - 1 pixel (single pixel object)
        - 3 pixels (3-pixel block object)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      position: index within the row

Transformation:
  action: Conditional Expansion
  target: Single Pixel Objects (size=1, color != 0)
  condition: The object must be a single pixel (i.e., not immediately followed by two pixels of the same color).
  effect:
    - Replace the single pixel and the two subsequent pixels with a 3-pixel block of the original single pixel's color.
  unchanged:
    - Background pixels (0), unless overwritten by expansion.
    - 3-pixel block objects.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Objects are positioned horizontally, separated by background pixels.
  - Transformation Dependency: The transformation applied depends on the size (1 or 3) of the non-background object encountered. Expansion occurs rightward.
