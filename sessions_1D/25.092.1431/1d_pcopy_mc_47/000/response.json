These objects appear either as single pixels of a specific color or as horizontal blocks of three identical colored pixels. The transformation rule modifies only the single-pixel objects. Existing 3-pixel blocks remain unchanged. Each single colored pixel in the input is expanded into a 3-pixel block of the same color in the output. This expansion effectively replaces the single pixel and the two pixels immediately to its right (which are background pixels in the examples) with the triplet of the single pixel's color. The relative order of objects and background segments is preserved, though the lengths change due to expansion.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
