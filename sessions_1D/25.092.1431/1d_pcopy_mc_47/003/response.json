It iterates through the input row:\n1. If a pixel is background (0), it's copied directly to the output.\n2. If a non-background pixel (color C) is encountered:\n   a. It checks if this pixel is the start of a 3-pixel block of the same color (C, C, C) within the input grid bounds.\n   b. If it is an existing 3-pixel block, all three pixels (C, C, C) are copied to the output, and the input index advances by 3.\n   c. If it is *not* an existing 3-pixel block (either because the sequence is shorter, the colors differ, or it's near the end of the row), it is treated as a single pixel to be expanded. Three pixels of its color (C, C, C) are appended to the output, and the input index advances by only 1.\nThe process continues until the entire input row is processed. The output row is then wrapped in a list to maintain the grid format.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): A 1xN grid represented as a list containing one list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed 1xN grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a list of lists and extract the single row\n    # Handle potential issues like numpy arrays or empty inputs\n    if isinstance(input_grid, np.ndarray):\n        input_row = input_grid.tolist()[0]\n    elif isinstance(input_grid, list) and input_grid:\n        input_row = input_grid[0]\n    else:\n        # Return empty grid for invalid input\n        return [[]] \n\n    width = len(input_row)\n    if width == 0:\n        return [[]] # Handle empty row case\n\n    # Initialize output row list\n    output_row = []\n    \n    # Initialize index for iterating through the input row\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the input row\n    while i < width:\n        # Get the color of the current pixel\n        current_color = input_row[i]\n        \n        # Case 1: Background pixel\n        if current_color == 0:\n            output_row.append(0)\n            i += 1 # Move to the next pixel\n        # Case 2: Non-background pixel\n        else:\n            # Check if it's a 3-pixel block\n            # Crucially, check bounds *before* accessing indices i+1 and i+2\n            is_three_block = False\n            if i + 2 < width: # Check if indices i+1 and i+2 are valid\n                if input_row[i+1] == current_color and input_row[i+2] == current_color:\n                    is_three_block = True\n            \n            # Subcase 2a: It's an existing 3-pixel block\n            if is_three_block:\n                # Append the block to the output\n                output_row.extend([current_color, current_color, current_color])\n                # Advance index past the block\n                i += 3 \n            # Subcase 2b: It's a single pixel (or start of shorter block) - expand it\n            else:\n                # Append the expanded block (3 pixels of current_color) to the output\n                output_row.extend([current_color, current_color, current_color])\n                # Advance index by 1 (only consuming the original single pixel)\n                i += 1 \n                \n    # Return the output row wrapped in a list to match grid format\n    return [output_row]\n\n```"
