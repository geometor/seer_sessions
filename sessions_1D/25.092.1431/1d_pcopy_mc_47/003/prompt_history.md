**Perception**

The task operates on single-row grids (1xN). The input grid contains background pixels (white, 0) and colored objects. These objects appear either as single pixels of a specific color or as horizontal blocks of three identical colored pixels. The transformation rule modifies only the single-pixel objects. Existing 3-pixel blocks remain unchanged. Each single colored pixel in the input is expanded into a 3-pixel block of the same color in the output. This expansion effectively replaces the single pixel and the two pixels immediately to its right (which are background pixels in the examples) with the triplet of the single pixel's color. The relative order of objects and background segments is preserved, though the lengths change due to expansion.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN 2D grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel Block
    properties:
      color: non-zero integer (1-9)
      size: 
        - 1 pixel (single pixel object)
        - 3 pixels (3-pixel block object)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      position: index within the row

Transformation:
  action: Conditional Expansion
  target: Single Pixel Objects (size=1, color != 0)
  condition: The object must be a single pixel (i.e., not immediately followed by two pixels of the same color).
  effect:
    - Replace the single pixel and the two subsequent pixels with a 3-pixel block of the original single pixel's color.
  unchanged:
    - Background pixels (0), unless overwritten by expansion.
    - 3-pixel block objects.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Objects are positioned horizontally, separated by background pixels.
  - Transformation Dependency: The transformation applied depends on the size (1 or 3) of the non-background object encountered. Expansion occurs rightward.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list to store the output row.
2.  Initialize an index `i` to 0, pointing to the current position in the input row.
3.  While `i` is less than the width of the input row:
    a.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `input[i]`.
    b.  If `C` is the background color (0):
        i.  Append `0` to the output list.
        ii. Increment `i` by 1.
    c.  If `C` is a non-background color:
        i.  Check if the pixels at `input[i+1]` and `input[i+2]` (within bounds) are also equal to `C`.
        ii. If yes (it's a 3-pixel block): Append `C`, `C`, `C` to the output list. Increment `i` by 3.
        iii.If no (it's treated as a single pixel to be expanded): Append `C`, `C`, `C` to the output list. Increment `i` by 1.
4.  Construct the final output grid using the generated output list (maintaining the 1xN shape).

## General Assessment

The previous code implemented the core logic derived from the examples: check for background, check for existing 3-blocks, and otherwise expand single non-background pixels into 3-blocks. However, it produced "list index out of range" errors on all training examples.

The error likely stems from accessing indices `i+1` or `i+2` when checking for a 3-block, even though a check `if i + 2 < width:` was present. This suggests the check might not be sufficient or is placed incorrectly relative to the access, or there's an edge case related to the grid dimensions or object placement near the end of the grid that wasn't handled.

The strategy is to re-examine the boundary conditions carefully and ensure that any access to `input_row[index]` is preceded by a check that `index` is less than `width`. The core logic of identifying 3-blocks versus single pixels to expand seems correct based on the visual transformation.

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   All grids are 1x32.
*   Input objects are either size 1 or size 3.
*   Output objects are all size 3.
*   Comparing input and output objects confirms the rule: Input objects of size 3 are preserved in the output. Input objects of size 1 are replaced by objects of size 3 with the same color in the output.
*   The positions shift slightly due to the expansion. The relative order is maintained.

## Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN, specifically 1x32 in examples)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel Block
    properties:
      color: non-zero integer (1-9)
      size: 
        - 1 pixel (single pixel object)
        - 3 pixels (3-pixel block object)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      position: starting index within the row

Transformation:
  action: Iterate and Conditionally Transform
  target: Non-background pixels encountered during iteration.
  condition_1: If the current pixel `input[i]` is background (0).
    effect_1: Append 0 to the output. Advance index `i` by 1.
  condition_2: If the current pixel `input[i]` is non-background (color `C`) AND the next two pixels are also `C` (i.e., `input[i+1]==C` and `input[i+2]==C`), provided `i+1` and `i+2` are within grid bounds.
    effect_2: Append `C, C, C` to the output. Advance index `i` by 3.
  condition_3: If the current pixel `input[i]` is non-background (color `C`) but condition_2 is false (it's not the start of a 3-block).
    effect_3: Append `C, C, C` to the output. Advance index `i` by 1.
  unchanged_elements: Background pixels (unless involved in the expansion from condition 3, which isn't the case here as expansion happens *into* the output structure). Existing 3-pixel blocks are effectively unchanged by passing through condition 2.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Objects are positioned horizontally, potentially separated by background pixels.
  - Transformation Dependency: The transformation applied at index `i` depends on the color at `input[i]` and potentially `input[i+1]` and `input[i+2]`. Advancing the index `i` depends on whether a 3-block was found (advance by 3) or not (advance by 1).

Error Handling Notes:
  - Accessing `input[i+1]` or `input[i+2]` requires explicit boundary checks (`i+1 < width` and `i+2 < width`) BEFORE the access attempt.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty list `output_row` to store the transformed row.
2.  Initialize an index `i` to 0 to track the current position in the input row `input_row`. Let `width` be the length of `input_row`.
3.  While `i` is less than `width`:
    a.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `input_row[i]`.
    b.  **Case 1: Background Pixel:** If `C` is 0 (white):
        i.  Append 0 to `output_row`.
        ii. Increment `i` by 1.
    c.  **Case 2: Non-Background Pixel:** If `C` is not 0:
        i.  **Check for 3-Block:** Check if index `i + 2` is within the bounds of the input row (i.e., `i + 2 < width`).
        ii. If `i + 2` is within bounds AND `input_row[i+1]` is equal to `C` AND `input_row[i+2]` is equal to `C`:
            1.  It's an existing 3-block. Append `C, C, C` to `output_row`.
            2.  Increment `i` by 3 (to move past the block).
        iii. Else (it's not a 3-block starting at `i`, either because it's shorter, the colors don't match, or we're too close to the end of the row):
            1.  Treat it as a pixel to be expanded. Append `C, C, C` to `output_row`.
            2.  Increment `i` by 1 (to move to the next pixel in the input).
4.  Wrap the completed `output_row` in a list to form the final 1xN output grid. Return the output grid.
