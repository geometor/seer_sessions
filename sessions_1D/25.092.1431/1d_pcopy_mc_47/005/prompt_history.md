**Perception**

The task operates on single-row grids (1xN). The input grid contains background pixels (white, 0) and colored objects. These objects appear either as single pixels of a specific color or as horizontal blocks of three identical colored pixels. The transformation rule modifies only the single-pixel objects. Existing 3-pixel blocks remain unchanged. Each single colored pixel in the input is expanded into a 3-pixel block of the same color in the output. This expansion effectively replaces the single pixel and the two pixels immediately to its right (which are background pixels in the examples) with the triplet of the single pixel's color. The relative order of objects and background segments is preserved, though the lengths change due to expansion.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN 2D grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel Block
    properties:
      color: non-zero integer (1-9)
      size: 
        - 1 pixel (single pixel object)
        - 3 pixels (3-pixel block object)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      position: index within the row

Transformation:
  action: Conditional Expansion
  target: Single Pixel Objects (size=1, color != 0)
  condition: The object must be a single pixel (i.e., not immediately followed by two pixels of the same color).
  effect:
    - Replace the single pixel and the two subsequent pixels with a 3-pixel block of the original single pixel's color.
  unchanged:
    - Background pixels (0), unless overwritten by expansion.
    - 3-pixel block objects.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Objects are positioned horizontally, separated by background pixels.
  - Transformation Dependency: The transformation applied depends on the size (1 or 3) of the non-background object encountered. Expansion occurs rightward.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list to store the output row.
2.  Initialize an index `i` to 0, pointing to the current position in the input row.
3.  While `i` is less than the width of the input row:
    a.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `input[i]`.
    b.  If `C` is the background color (0):
        i.  Append `0` to the output list.
        ii. Increment `i` by 1.
    c.  If `C` is a non-background color:
        i.  Check if the pixels at `input[i+1]` and `input[i+2]` (within bounds) are also equal to `C`.
        ii. If yes (it's a 3-pixel block): Append `C`, `C`, `C` to the output list. Increment `i` by 3.
        iii.If no (it's treated as a single pixel to be expanded): Append `C`, `C`, `C` to the output list. Increment `i` by 1.
4.  Construct the final output grid using the generated output list (maintaining the 1xN shape).

**General Assessment**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: single colored pixels are expanded into 3-pixel blocks, while existing 3-pixel blocks are preserved. However, the implementation failed because it incorrectly handled the advancement of the input index after expanding a single pixel. The code advanced the index by only 1, causing subsequent background pixels (which should have been overwritten by the expansion) to be incorrectly appended to the output. This resulted in outputs that were longer than expected and contained extra background pixels before the expanded blocks.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to adjust the logic for advancing the input index. When a non-background pixel is encountered, regardless of whether it's part of an existing 3-pixel block or a single pixel being expanded, the output should receive three pixels of that color, and the input index should advance by 3. This correctly accounts for the three input grid positions conceptually occupied by the resulting 3-pixel block in the output.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN 2D grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - type: Pixel Block
    properties:
      color: C (non-zero integer 1-9)
      size_in_input:
        - 1 pixel (single pixel object)
        - 3 pixels (3-pixel block object)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      position: index `i` within the input row

Transformation:
  action: Sequential Processing and Conditional Transformation
  target: Non-background pixels in the input row.
  rule: Iterate through the input row using index `i`.
    - If `input[i]` is background (0):
        Append 0 to the output.
        Increment `i` by 1.
    - If `input[i]` is non-background (color C):
        Check if `input[i:i+3]` forms a block `[C, C, C]` (within bounds).
        If yes (existing 3-block):
            Append `C, C, C` to the output.
            Increment `i` by 3.
        If no (single pixel or start of shorter block):
            Append `C, C, C` to the output (expansion).
            Increment `i` by 3. # Crucial correction: Advance past the conceptual 3-pixel space consumed.
  output_size: The output width will be `input_width + 2 * (number of single non-background pixels in input)`. The metrics confirm this relationship holds for the expected outputs.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Objects are positioned horizontally, potentially separated by background pixels.
  - Transformation Dependency: The processing depends on whether a non-background pixel is the start of an existing 3-pixel block of the same color.
  - Index Advancement: Background pixels advance the index by 1. Non-background pixels, whether preserved or expanded, result in a 3-pixel output block and advance the input index by 3.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list to store the output row.
2.  Initialize an index `i` to 0, pointing to the current position in the input row.
3.  Get the width `W` of the input row.
4.  While `i` is less than `W`:
    a.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `input[i]`.
    b.  If `C` is the background color (0):
        i.  Append `0` to the output list.
        ii. Increment `i` by 1.
    c.  If `C` is a non-background color:
        i.  Assume it will be expanded/copied as a 3-block: Append `C`, `C`, `C` to the output list.
        ii. Increment `i` by 3. # Always advance by 3 for non-background pixels.
5.  Construct the final output grid using the generated output list (maintaining the 1xN shape).
