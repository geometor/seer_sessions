Checks if the current non-background pixel is the start of a 3-pixel block of the same color.\n   - If yes: The 3-pixel block is appended to the output, and the input index advances by 3.\n2. If it's not a 3-pixel block, checks if the current non-background pixel is preceded by a background pixel (0).\n   - If yes: The preceding background pixel (which would have just been added to the output) is removed, and a 3-pixel block of the current pixel's color is appended. The input index advances by 1.\n3.
