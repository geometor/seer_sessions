"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in a 1D input grid.
If a segment consists of a single pixel, it is expanded into a 3-pixel segment of the same color in the output grid, centered at the original pixel's location (respecting grid boundaries).
If a segment has a length other than 1, it is copied directly to the output grid in the same position.
The background remains white (0).
