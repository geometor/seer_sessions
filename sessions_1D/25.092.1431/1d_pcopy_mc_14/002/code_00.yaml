task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D # Confirmed all examples are 1xN grids
  background_color: 0 # white
  object_representation: contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels

objects:
  - name: pixel_segment
    properties:
      - color: (integer 1-9)
      - length: (integer >= 1)
      - start_index: (integer >= 0)
      - end_index: (integer >= 0)
  - name: background_pixel
    properties:
      - color: 0 # white

actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input_grid (1xN)
    output: list of pixel_segments found in the single row
  - name: transform_segment
    input: pixel_segment
    output: modified_segment (or original segment) based on length
    conditions:
      - if length == 1: expand segment to length 3, centered on original position, respecting grid boundaries.
      - if length != 1: keep segment unchanged.
  - name: render_output
    input: list of transformed/original segments, grid_dimensions
    output: output_grid (1xN)
    details: Place segments onto an initially white grid. Segments are processed sequentially; later segments overwrite earlier ones in case of overlap (though no overlaps observed in training examples from expansion).

relationships:
  - segments are separated by one or more background_pixels (color 0).
  - the transformation depends solely on the length of the segment.
  - segments of length 1 are replaced by segments of length 3.
  - segments of length > 1 are copied unchanged.

execution_issue:
  - error_message: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()"
  - probable_cause: Mismatch between the data type/structure returned by the `transform` function (likely `List[List[int]]`) and the format expected by the test harness for comparison (likely `numpy.ndarray`). The core transformation logic itself was verified to correctly produce the expected output grid values.
