Scan the input grid from left to right to identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. For each segment, record its color, start index, and end index.\n    3.  Iterate through the list of identified segments found in the input grid.\n    4.  For each segment:\n        a.  Determine its length (`L`) by calculating `end_index - start_index + 1`.\n        b.  If the length `L` is exactly 1 (the segment is a single pixel at index `i`):\n            i.  Identify the target indices in the output grid: `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.\n            ii. For each target index `j` that is within the valid bounds of the grid (i.e., `0 <= j < grid_width`), set the pixel at `output_grid[j]` to the segment's color.\n        c.  If the length `L` is not 1:\n            i.  Copy the segment directly from the input to the output grid. For each index `k` from the segment's `start_index` to its `end_index`, set `output_grid[k]` to the segment's color.\n    5.  Return the completed output grid. (Note: Step 4c implicitly covers the case where L=3, copying it as is. This program assumes that if expansions from L=1 segments overlap or overwrite other segments, the last write takes precedence based on iteration order, although such overlaps are not present in the training examples.)"
