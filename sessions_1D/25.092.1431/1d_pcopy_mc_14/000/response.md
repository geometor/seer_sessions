*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or single rows) of pixels.
    *   Pixels have colors, represented by integers 0-9. White (0) acts as a background/separator.
    *   The task focuses on contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels.
    *   The key properties of these segments are their color and their length.
    *   A transformation rule is applied based on the length of these segments.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_dimensionality: 1D # Based on provided examples appearing as single rows
      background_color: 0 # white
      object_representation: contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels
    
    objects:
      - name: pixel_segment
        properties:
          - color: (integer 1-9)
          - length: (integer >= 1)
          - start_index: (integer >= 0)
          - end_index: (integer >= 0)
      - name: background_pixel
        properties:
          - color: 0 # white
    
    actions:
      - name: identify_segments
        input: input_grid
        output: list of pixel_segments
      - name: transform_segment
        input: pixel_segment
        output: modified_segment (or original segment)
        conditions:
          - if length == 1: expand segment to length 3, centered on original position
          - if length != 1: keep segment unchanged
      - name: render_output
        input: list of transformed/original segments, grid_dimensions
        output: output_grid
        details: Place segments onto an initially white grid. Handle potential overlaps if expansions meet or overwrite. Check boundary conditions.
    
    relationships:
      - segments are separated by one or more background_pixels (color 0) in the input.
      - the transformation of a single-pixel segment involves changing its neighbors in the output.
      - segments of length 3 in the input appear unchanged in the output at the same location.
      - single pixels in the input become the center of a 3-pixel segment of the same color in the output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initializing all pixels to white (0).
    2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. For each segment, record its color, start index, and end index.
    3.  Iterate through the list of identified segments found in the input grid.
    4.  For each segment:
        a.  Determine its length (`L`) by calculating `end_index - start_index + 1`.
        b.  If the length `L` is exactly 1 (the segment is a single pixel at index `i`):
            i.  Identify the target indices in the output grid: `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
            ii. For each target index `j` that is within the valid bounds of the grid (i.e., `0 <= j < grid_width`), set the pixel at `output_grid[j]` to the segment's color.
        c.  If the length `L` is not 1:
            i.  Copy the segment directly from the input to the output grid. For each index `k` from the segment's `start_index` to its `end_index`, set `output_grid[k]` to the segment's color.
    5.  Return the completed output grid. (Note: Step 4c implicitly covers the case where L=3, copying it as is. This program assumes that if expansions from L=1 segments overlap or overwrite other segments, the last write takes precedence based on iteration order, although such overlaps are not present in the training examples.)
