Grid Properties:
  - Type: Single row (1D vector)
  - Size: Constant (1x32)
  - Background: Predominantly white pixels (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Single Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (1-9)
      - Context: Surrounded by white pixels (0) horizontally.
    Identifier: A non-white pixel `C` at index `i` where input[i-1] == 0 and input[i+1] == 0.
  - Type: Pixel Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (1-9), uniform within the block.
      - Shape: Horizontal line of three identical pixels.
      - Context: Appears contiguous in the input.
    Identifier: Three identical non-white pixels `C` at indices `i`, `i+1`, `i+2`.
  - Type: Background Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Objects (Single Pixels, Pixel Blocks) are separated by one or more Background Pixels.
  - Adjacency: The transformation rule specifically considers the immediate horizontal neighbors of Single Pixels.

Actions/Transformation:
  - Identify: Scan the input grid for Single Pixels and Pixel Blocks.
  - Expand: For each identified Single Pixel of color `C` at index `i`:
      - Set the output pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, `i+1` to color `C`.
      - This expansion only occurs if the neighbors at `i-1` and `i+1` are white (0).
  - Copy:
      - Identified Pixel Blocks are copied directly to the output grid at the same indices.
      - Background Pixels are copied directly to the output grid unless they are overwritten by the 'Expand' action.

Result:
  - The output grid contains the original Pixel Blocks and expanded versions of the original Single Pixels, now also appearing as blocks of three.
