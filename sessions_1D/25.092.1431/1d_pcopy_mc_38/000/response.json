The grids consist primarily of white pixels (0) acting as a background. Scattered within the white background are non-white pixels. These non-white pixels appear in two configurations in the input: either as isolated single pixels or as horizontal blocks of three identical pixels.\n\nThe transformation modifies the appearance of the single non-white pixels while leaving the blocks of three unchanged. Specifically, each single non-white pixel in the input is expanded into a horizontal block of three identical pixels in the output, centered at the original pixel's position. This expansion overwrites the immediate left and right neighboring pixels if they were white. Existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels are copied directly from the input to the output. White pixels that are not part of the expansion process remain white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel of the input grid from left to right, considering its index `i`.\n3.  For the current pixel at index `i` with color `C`:\n    a.  Check if `C` is non-white (not 0).\n    b.  If `C` is non-white, check its immediate left neighbor (index `i-1`) and right neighbor (index `i+1`), handling boundary conditions (assuming neighbors outside the grid are white or the pattern doesn't occur at the edges based on examples).\n    c.  **Expansion Rule:** If the pixel at `i` is non-white (`C`), AND the pixel at `i-1` is white (0), AND the pixel at `i+1` is white (0), then set the output grid pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.\n    d.  **Copy Rule (Blocks):** If the pixel at `i` is non-white (`C`), AND it is part of a block of three identical pixels (i.e., input[`i-1`]==`C` and input[`i+1`]==`C`, or input[`i+1`]==`C` and input[`i+2`]==`C`, or input[`i-1`]==`C` and input[`i-2`]==`C`), copy the color `C` to the output grid at index `i`. *Correction based on re-evaluation: A simpler approach is needed to avoid double-processing.*\n    e.  **Copy Rule (Background):** If the pixel at `i` is white (0) AND the output grid at index `i` has not already been set by the Expansion Rule (step 3c), copy the white pixel (0) to the output grid at index `i`.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program (Simpler Logic)**\n\n1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.\n2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid from index 1 to length-2 (to check neighbors safely).
