**Perception of Task Elements**

The input and output are both single-row grids (vectors) of the same length (1x32). The grids consist primarily of white pixels (0) acting as a background. Scattered within the white background are non-white pixels. These non-white pixels appear in two configurations in the input: either as isolated single pixels or as horizontal blocks of three identical pixels.

The transformation modifies the appearance of the single non-white pixels while leaving the blocks of three unchanged. Specifically, each single non-white pixel in the input is expanded into a horizontal block of three identical pixels in the output, centered at the original pixel's position. This expansion overwrites the immediate left and right neighboring pixels if they were white. Existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels are copied directly from the input to the output. White pixels that are not part of the expansion process remain white.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Type: Single row (1D vector)
  - Size: Constant (1x32)
  - Background: Predominantly white pixels (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Single Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (1-9)
      - Context: Surrounded by white pixels (0) horizontally.
    Identifier: A non-white pixel `C` at index `i` where input[i-1] == 0 and input[i+1] == 0.
  - Type: Pixel Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (1-9), uniform within the block.
      - Shape: Horizontal line of three identical pixels.
      - Context: Appears contiguous in the input.
    Identifier: Three identical non-white pixels `C` at indices `i`, `i+1`, `i+2`.
  - Type: Background Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Objects (Single Pixels, Pixel Blocks) are separated by one or more Background Pixels.
  - Adjacency: The transformation rule specifically considers the immediate horizontal neighbors of Single Pixels.

Actions/Transformation:
  - Identify: Scan the input grid for Single Pixels and Pixel Blocks.
  - Expand: For each identified Single Pixel of color `C` at index `i`:
      - Set the output pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, `i+1` to color `C`.
      - This expansion only occurs if the neighbors at `i-1` and `i+1` are white (0).
  - Copy:
      - Identified Pixel Blocks are copied directly to the output grid at the same indices.
      - Background Pixels are copied directly to the output grid unless they are overwritten by the 'Expand' action.

Result:
  - The output grid contains the original Pixel Blocks and expanded versions of the original Single Pixels, now also appearing as blocks of three.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white pixels (0).
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid from left to right, considering its index `i`.
3.  For the current pixel at index `i` with color `C`:
    a.  Check if `C` is non-white (not 0).
    b.  If `C` is non-white, check its immediate left neighbor (index `i-1`) and right neighbor (index `i+1`), handling boundary conditions (assuming neighbors outside the grid are white or the pattern doesn't occur at the edges based on examples).
    c.  **Expansion Rule:** If the pixel at `i` is non-white (`C`), AND the pixel at `i-1` is white (0), AND the pixel at `i+1` is white (0), then set the output grid pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.
    d.  **Copy Rule (Blocks):** If the pixel at `i` is non-white (`C`), AND it is part of a block of three identical pixels (i.e., input[`i-1`]==`C` and input[`i+1`]==`C`, or input[`i+1`]==`C` and input[`i+2`]==`C`, or input[`i-1`]==`C` and input[`i-2`]==`C`), copy the color `C` to the output grid at index `i`. *Correction based on re-evaluation: A simpler approach is needed to avoid double-processing.*
    e.  **Copy Rule (Background):** If the pixel at `i` is white (0) AND the output grid at index `i` has not already been set by the Expansion Rule (step 3c), copy the white pixel (0) to the output grid at index `i`.

**Revised Natural Language Program (Simpler Logic)**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid from index 1 to length-2 (to check neighbors safely). Let the current index be `i` and the color be `C`.
3.  If the pixel at `i` is non-white (`C != 0`), AND the pixel at `i-1` is white (`input[i-1] == 0`), AND the pixel at `i+1` is white (`input[i+1] == 0`):
    a.  Modify the output grid: Set `output[i-1] = C`, `output[i] = C`, `output[i+1] = C`.
4.  Return the modified output grid. (This implicitly copies unchanged pixels and blocks because we started with a copy).
