These blocks remain unchanged in the output.\n    *   The input also contains single, isolated colored pixels (e.g., `3` in train_1, `5` and `9` in train_2, `5` and `7` in train_3). These are typically surrounded by white pixels (0) or pixels of a different color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation targets these isolated single colored pixels. Each isolated pixel is expanded into a horizontal block of 3 pixels of the same color. This 3-pixel block overwrites the original pixel's location and its immediate left and right neighbors in the output grid.\n5.  **Identification Criteria:** An \"isolated single colored pixel\" seems to be a non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are *not* the same color as itself. This prevents pixels already part of a larger block (like the initial `4 4 4`) from being further expanded.\n6.  **Overwriting:** The expansion overwrites the content of the adjacent cells. In the examples, it overwrites white pixels, but the rule likely applies regardless of the overwritten pixel's original color.\n7.  **Independence:** The expansion seems to happen independently for each identified isolated pixel based on the *original* input state.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
