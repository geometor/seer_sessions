Grid_Structure:
  - Dimension: 1D (single row)
  - Background_Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color (0-9)
      - Position (Index in the row)
      - Is_Isolated_Single (Boolean): True if the pixel is non-white AND its left neighbor has a different color AND its right neighbor has a different color. (Applies to pixels not at the very edges).
  - Type: Block
    Properties:
      - Color (Non-zero)
      - Size (Typically 3 in these examples)
      - Orientation: Horizontal

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all pixels where Is_Isolated_Single is True based on the input grid.
  - Expand_and_Overwrite: For each identified isolated single pixel at index `i` with color `C`:
      - Modify the output grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Left and right neighbors are crucial for identifying isolated pixels.
  - Input_Output_Mapping: Pixels not part of an expansion remain unchanged from input to output. Pixels involved in an expansion are determined by the identified isolated pixels. Existing 3-pixel blocks in the input are preserved in the output.
