Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are single rows (1-dimensional grids) of pixels.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as a background color and various other colors (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon) for specific patterns.
3.  **Patterns:**
    *   The input contains some pre-existing horizontal blocks of 3 identical colored pixels (e.g., `4 4 4` in train_1, `5 5 5` in train_2, `2 2 2` in train_3). These blocks remain unchanged in the output.
    *   The input also contains single, isolated colored pixels (e.g., `3` in train_1, `5` and `9` in train_2, `5` and `7` in train_3). These are typically surrounded by white pixels (0) or pixels of a different color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation targets these isolated single colored pixels. Each isolated pixel is expanded into a horizontal block of 3 pixels of the same color. This 3-pixel block overwrites the original pixel's location and its immediate left and right neighbors in the output grid.
5.  **Identification Criteria:** An "isolated single colored pixel" seems to be a non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are *not* the same color as itself. This prevents pixels already part of a larger block (like the initial `4 4 4`) from being further expanded.
6.  **Overwriting:** The expansion overwrites the content of the adjacent cells. In the examples, it overwrites white pixels, but the rule likely applies regardless of the overwritten pixel's original color.
7.  **Independence:** The expansion seems to happen independently for each identified isolated pixel based on the *original* input state.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid_Structure:
  - Dimension: 1D (single row)
  - Background_Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color (0-9)
      - Position (Index in the row)
      - Is_Isolated_Single (Boolean): True if the pixel is non-white AND its left neighbor has a different color AND its right neighbor has a different color. (Applies to pixels not at the very edges).
  - Type: Block
    Properties:
      - Color (Non-zero)
      - Size (Typically 3 in these examples)
      - Orientation: Horizontal

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all pixels where Is_Isolated_Single is True based on the input grid.
  - Expand_and_Overwrite: For each identified isolated single pixel at index `i` with color `C`:
      - Modify the output grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Left and right neighbors are crucial for identifying isolated pixels.
  - Input_Output_Mapping: Pixels not part of an expansion remain unchanged from input to output. Pixels involved in an expansion are determined by the identified isolated pixels. Existing 3-pixel blocks in the input are preserved in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial output row.
2.  Identify all "isolated single colored pixels" in the *original* input row. An isolated single colored pixel is defined as a non-white pixel at index `i` (where `1 <= i < length-1`) such that the pixel at `i-1` has a different color AND the pixel at `i+1` also has a different color. Store the index `i` and color `C` of each such identified pixel.
3.  For each identified isolated pixel (with index `i` and color `C`) found in step 2:
    a.  Set the pixel at index `i-1` in the *output* row to color `C`.
    b.  Set the pixel at index `i` in the *output* row to color `C`.
    c.  Set the pixel at index `i+1` in the *output* row to color `C`.
4.  Return the final output row.
