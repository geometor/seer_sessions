Identify isolated single colored pixels in the input row. An isolated single colored pixel is a non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are not the same color as itself.\n2. For each identified isolated pixel at index `i` with color `C`, modify a copy of the input row by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.\n3. Base the identification solely on the original input state to avoid cascading effects within a single transformation step.\n4.
