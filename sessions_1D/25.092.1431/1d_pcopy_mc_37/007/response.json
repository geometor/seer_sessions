The expansion overwrites the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and \n`i+1` in the output grid with the color of the isolated pixel. Pixels not \nidentified as isolated and not overwritten by an expansion retain their \noriginal input color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_isolated_pixels(input_row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies isolated pixels in a single row based on the definition.\n    \n    An isolated pixel is non-white, not at the edges, and has neighbors \n    of different colors than itself.\n\n    Args:\n        input_row (list[int]): The row to analyze.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list[tuple[int, int]]: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains \n                                (index, color) of an identified isolated pixel.\n    \"\"\"\n    isolated_pixels_info = []\n    row_len = len(input_row)\n    \n    # Iterate through potential isolated pixel indices (1 to len-2).\n    # Pixels at index 0 and row_len - 1 cannot be isolated by definition \n    # as they lack two neighbors for comparison.\n    for i in range(1, row_len - 1):\n        current_color = input_row[i]\n        \n        # Condition 1: Pixel must be non-white (not background color 0).\n        if current_color == 0:\n            continue\n            \n        # Get neighbor colors\n        left_color = input_row[i - 1]\n        right_color = input_row[i + 1]\n        \n        # Condition 2 & 3: Neighbors must have different colors than the current pixel.\n        if left_color != current_color and right_color != current_color:\n            # This pixel meets all criteria for being isolated.\n            isolated_pixels_info.append((i, current_color))\n            \n    return isolated_pixels_info\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the isolated pixel expansion transformation to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A grid representing the input state \n                                      (expected to be 1xN).\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: The transformed grid (1xN).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Input Validation and Setup ---\n    # Expect a grid containing exactly one row.\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or len(input_grid) != 1 or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):\n        # Handle invalid input format if necessary, though ARC guarantees valid formats.\n        # Returning an empty grid structure for robustness.\n        return [[]] \n        \n    input_row = input_grid[0]\n    row_len = len(input_row)\n\n    # Handle edge case of an empty row within the grid.\n    if row_len == 0:\n      return [[]]\n\n    # --- Initialization ---\n    # Create a deep copy of the input row.
