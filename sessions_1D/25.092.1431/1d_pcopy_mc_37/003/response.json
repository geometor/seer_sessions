The identification of isolated \npixels is based solely on the original input grid. The expansion overwrites \nthe pixels at indices i-1, i, and i+1 in the output grid, where i is the \nindex of the isolated pixel in the input grid. Pixels not identified as \nisolated and not overwritten by an expansion retain their original input color.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\n\ndef _find_isolated_pixels(input_row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies isolated pixels in a single row based on the definition.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_row (list[int]): The row to analyze.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list[tuple[int, int]]: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains \n                                (index, color) of an identified isolated pixel.\n    \"\"\"\n    isolated_pixels_info = []\n    row_len = len(input_row)\n    \n    # Iterate through potential isolated pixel indices (1 to len-2)\n    for i in range(1, row_len - 1):\n        current_color = input_row[i]\n        \n        # Check if the pixel is non-white (not background)\n        if current_color == 0:\n            continue\n            \n        # Get neighbor colors\n        left_color = input_row[i - 1]\n        right_color = input_row[i + 1]\n        \n        # Check if neighbors have different colors than the current pixel\n        if left_color != current_color and right_color != current_color:\n            # This pixel is isolated\n            isolated_pixels_info.append((i, current_color))\n            \n    return isolated_pixels_info\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the isolated pixel expansion transformation to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A grid representing the input state \n                                      (expected to be 1xN).\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: The transformed grid (1xN).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate input format - expect a single row\n    if not input_grid or not isinstance(input_grid, list) or len(input_grid) != 1 or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):\n        # Return empty or handle error appropriately based on expected behavior\n        # For ARC, often returning the input or an empty grid might be options.\n        # Returning empty list of lists for now.\n        return [[]] \n        \n    input_row = input_grid[0]\n    row_len = len(input_row)\n\n    # Handle empty row case\n    if row_len == 0:\n      return [[]]\n\n    # Create a modifiable copy for the output\n    output_row = copy.deepcopy(input_row)\n\n    # Identify all isolated pixels based *only* on the input row\n    isolated_pixels = _find_isolated_pixels(input_row)\n\n    # Apply the expansion transformation for each identified isolated pixel\n    for index, color in isolated_pixels:\n        # The identification loop ensures index is between 1 and len-2,\n        # so index-1 and index+1 are always valid indices within the row.\n        output_row[index - 1] = color\n        output_row[index] = color\n        output_row[index + 1] = color\n\n    # Return the modified row wrapped in a list to match grid format\n    return [output_row]\n\n```"
