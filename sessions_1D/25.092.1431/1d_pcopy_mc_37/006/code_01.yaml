Grid_Structure:
  - Dimension: 1D (single row, represented as list[list[int]])
  - Background_Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color (0-9)
      - Position (Index in the row)
      - Is_Isolated (Boolean): Determined based on the *input* grid. True if:
          - Pixel is not at index 0 or the last index.
          - Pixel color is non-white (not 0).
          - The color of the pixel at `index - 1` is different from the pixel's color.
          - The color of the pixel at `index + 1` is different from the pixel's color.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all pixels in the input row where `Is_Isolated` is True. Record their index and color.
  - Expand_and_Overwrite: For each identified isolated pixel (index `i`, color `C`) from the input:
      - In a *copy* of the input row (which will become the output row):
          - Set the color of the pixel at index `i-1` to `C`.
          - Set the color of the pixel at index `i` to `C`.
          - Set the color of the pixel at index `i+1` to `C`.
  - Preserve: Pixels not identified as isolated and not overwritten during the expansion retain their original color from the input row.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Immediate left and right neighbors are used to determine if a pixel is isolated.
  - Input_Output_Mapping: Output is derived from the input by applying the 'Expand_and_Overwrite' action based on 'Identify' results. All identification uses the original input state.
