# No code execution needed here as we are analyzing the *logic* based on the examples.
# The previous failure was likely infrastructural, not logical.

# Example 1 Analysis:
# Input Length: 33
# Isolated Pixels Found (Index, Color): (7, 3), (13, 8), (18, 5)
# Output Changes: Pixels at [6,7,8] become 3; [12,13,14] become 8; [17,18,19] become 5.
# Predicted Match: True

# Example 2 Analysis:
# Input Length: 33
# Isolated Pixels Found (Index, Color): (8, 5), (12, 9)
# Output Changes: Pixels at [7,8,9] become 5; [11,12,13] become 9.
# Predicted Match: True

# Example 3 Analysis:
# Input Length: 33
# Isolated Pixels Found (Index, Color): (9, 5), (15, 7)
# Output Changes: Pixels at [8,9,10] become 5; [14,15,16] become 7.
# Predicted Match: True
