Analysis suggests this was likely due to an input format mismatch between the test harness (providing string data) and the Python function expecting `list[list[int]]`. The core transformation logic itself, as defined in the previous natural language program and simulated execution, appears correct for the given examples. The strategy is to proceed with the existing logic, assuming the input format will be correctly handled in future executions, and refine the documentation (facts and natural language program) for clarity.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nAssuming the code *had* run with correctly formatted `list[list[int]]` inputs:\n\n"
