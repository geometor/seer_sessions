Grid_Structure:
  - Dimension: 1D (single row, represented as a 1xN grid).
  - Size: Width is 33 pixels in all training examples. Height is 1 pixel.
  - Background_Color: White (0).

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Integer from 0 to 9.
      - Position: Index within the row (0-based).
  - Type: Isolated_Pixel (Target Object for Transformation)
    Identification_Criteria (based on Input Grid):
      - Must not be the background color (Color != 0).
      - Must not be at the first (index 0) or last (index N-1) position.
      - The color of the pixel immediately to its left (index - 1) must be different from its own color.
      - The color of the pixel immediately to its right (index + 1) must be different from its own color.

Actions:
  - Identify: Scan the input row (from index 1 to N-2) to find all pixels meeting the criteria for an Isolated_Pixel. Record the index and color of each found Isolated_Pixel.
  - Generate_Output_Base: Create a modifiable copy of the input row.
  - Expand_and_Overwrite (applied to Output Base): For each identified Isolated_Pixel (with original index `i` and color `C`):
      - Set the pixel color at index `i-1` in the output base to `C`.
      - Set the pixel color at index `i` in the output base to `C`.
      - Set the pixel color at index `i+1` in the output base to `C`.
  - Finalize: The modified output base becomes the final output row.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Immediate horizontal neighbors are crucial for the identification step.
  - Input_Dependence: Identification is based entirely on the original input state.
  - Transformation_Scope: The Expand_and_Overwrite action is triggered only by identified Isolated_Pixels and affects a 3-pixel region centered on the Isolated_Pixel's original location. Pixels not identified as isolated and not overwritten by an expansion retain their original color from the input.
