import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (row) by expanding isolated single non-white pixels into horizontal blocks of three.

1. Identify isolated single colored pixels in the input row. An isolated single colored pixel is a non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are not the same color as itself.
2. For each identified isolated pixel at index `i` with color `C`, modify a copy of the input row by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.
3. Base the identification solely on the original input state to avoid cascading effects within a single transformation step.
4. Pixels that are already part of a horizontal block of the same color are not considered isolated and remain unchanged (unless overwritten by an adjacent expansion).
