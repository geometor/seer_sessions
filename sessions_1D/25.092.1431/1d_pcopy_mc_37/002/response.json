            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously seems correct, as confirmed by manual tracing and the code execution analysis. The transformation involves identifying specific \"isolated\" non-background pixels in the input row and expanding each into a horizontal 3-pixel block of the same color in the output row. Existing blocks of 3 identical colors in the input remain untouched unless overwritten by an adjacent expansion.\n\nThe `ValueError` encountered during the previous execution likely stems from the testing environment's data representation (possibly using NumPy arrays where scalar booleans were expected in conditional checks) rather than a flaw in the fundamental transformation logic. The strategy is to maintain the established logic but ensure the implementation is robust, possibly by explicitly handling potential NumPy types if necessary, or ensuring scalar values are compared.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

Record the index and color of each found Isolated_Pixel.\n  - Generate_Output_Base: Create a modifiable copy of the input row.\n  - Expand_and_Overwrite (applied to Output Base): For each identified Isolated_Pixel (with original index `i` and color `C`):\n      - Set the pixel color at index `i-1` in the output base to `C`.\n      - Set the pixel color at index `i` in the output base to `C`.\n      - Set the pixel color at index `i+1` in the output base to `C`.\n  - Finalize: The modified output base becomes the final output row.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Adjacency: Immediate horizontal neighbors are crucial for the identification step.\n  - Input_Dependence: Identification is based entirely on the original input state.\n  - Transformation_Scope: The Expand_and_Overwrite action is triggered only by identified Isolated_Pixels and affects a 3-pixel region centered on the Isolated_Pixel's original location.
