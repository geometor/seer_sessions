Grid_Structure:
  - Dimension: 1D (single row, represented as a 1xN list of lists).
  - Size: Variable length (e.g., 1x33 in examples).
  - Background_Color: White (0).

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Integer 0-9.
      - Position: Index within the row.
      - Is_Isolated (Boolean): Defined for indices `i` where `0 < i < length-1`. True if `Pixel[i].Color` is not White (0) AND `Pixel[i-1].Color != Pixel[i].Color` AND `Pixel[i+1].Color != Pixel[i].Color`. Calculated based on the *input* grid state.
  - Type: Horizontal_Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-zero integer 0-9.
      - Size: Number of contiguous pixels of the same color (e.g., size 3).
      - Position: Start and end indices.

Actions:
  - Identify_Isolated_Pixels: Scan the input row (excluding the first and last elements) to find all pixels where `Is_Isolated` is True. Record their index and color.
  - Expand_and_Overwrite: Create a copy of the input row. For each identified isolated pixel (index `i`, color `C`):
      - Set the color of the pixel at index `i-1` in the copied row to `C`.
      - Set the color of the pixel at index `i` in the copied row to `C`.
      - Set the color of the pixel at index `i+1` in the copied row to `C`.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Immediate left and right neighbors (indices `i-1` and `i+1`) are used to determine if a pixel at index `i` is isolated.
  - Input_Output_Mapping:
    - Pixels identified as isolated in the input determine the location and color of 3-pixel blocks in the output.
    - Pixels *not* identified as isolated and *not* overwritten by an expansion retain their original color from the input row in the output row.
    - Existing horizontal blocks (like `4 4 4`) in the input persist in the output unless overwritten by an expansion originating from an adjacent isolated pixel.
