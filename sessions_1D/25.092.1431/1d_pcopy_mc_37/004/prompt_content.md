"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (row) by identifying isolated single non-white pixels 
and expanding each into a horizontal block of three pixels of the same color in 
the output grid. 

An isolated pixel is defined as a non-white pixel located between indices 1 and 
length-2 (inclusive) whose immediate left and right neighbors in the input grid 
have different colors than the pixel itself. The identification of isolated 
pixels is based solely on the original input grid. The expansion overwrites 
the pixels at indices i-1, i, and i+1 in the output grid, where i is the 
index of the isolated pixel in the input grid. Pixels not identified as 
isolated and not overwritten by an expansion retain their original input color.
