"""
Transforms a 4x8 grid represented as a 1D list of 32 integers.

The transformation rule operates as follows:
1. Reshape the input 1D list into a 4x8 2D grid.
2. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
3. Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.
4. Identify "source" pixels: A non-white pixel is a source if its horizontal neighbors (left and right, with column wrap-around) have different colors than the pixel itself.
5. For each source pixel found at position (r, c) with color 'C':
    a. Determine the target coordinates for a 3-pixel horizontal line centered conceptually at (r, c):
        - Center: (r, c)
        - Left column: (c - 1 + 8) % 8
        - Right column: (c + 1 + 8) % 8
    b. Apply special row wrap-around rules for the left/right pixels if the source pixel is on a column edge:
        - If the source pixel is in the leftmost column (c == 0), the row index for the "left" target pixel (which wraps to the last column) becomes (r - 1 + 4) % 4. Otherwise, it's 'r'.
        - If the source pixel is in the rightmost column (c == 7), the row index for the "right" target pixel (which wraps to the first column) becomes (r + 1 + 4) % 4. Otherwise, it's 'r'.
    c. Set the pixels at the calculated left, center, and right target coordinates in the *output* grid to the color 'C' of the source pixel.
6. Pixels that were part of an existing 3-pixel horizontal line in the input grid (and therefore not "source" pixels) remain unchanged in the output grid because the output grid starts as a copy and these pixels are not overwritten.
7. Flatten the final 4x8 output grid back into a 1D list of 32 integers.
