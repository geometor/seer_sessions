Reshape the input 1D list into a 4x8 2D grid.\n2. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.\n3. Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.\n4. Identify \"source\" pixels: A non-white pixel is a source if its horizontal neighbors (left and right, with column wrap-around) have different colors than the pixel itself.\n5. For each source pixel found at position (r, c) with color 'C':\n    a. Determine the target coordinates for a 3-pixel horizontal line centered conceptually at (r, c):\n        - Center: (r, c)\n        - Left column: (c - 1 + 8) % 8\n        - Right column: (c + 1 + 8) % 8\n    b. Apply special row wrap-around rules for the left/right pixels if the source pixel is on a column edge:\n        - If the source pixel is in the leftmost column (c == 0), the row index for the \"left\" target pixel (which wraps to the last column) becomes (r - 1 + 4) % 4. Otherwise, it's 'r'.\n        - If the source pixel is in the rightmost column (c == 7), the row index for the \"right\" target pixel (which wraps to the first column) becomes (r + 1 + 4) % 4. Otherwise, it's 'r'.\n    c. Set the pixels at the calculated left, center, and right target coordinates in the *output* grid to the color 'C' of the source pixel.\n6. Pixels that were part of an existing 3-pixel horizontal line in the input grid (and therefore not \"source\" pixels) remain unchanged in the output grid because the output grid starts as a copy and these pixels are not overwritten.\n7.
