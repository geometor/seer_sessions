Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output data are presented as 1D arrays of length 32. Observing the patterns, particularly the horizontal lines of length 3, suggests a 2D grid structure. A 4x8 grid (4 rows, 8 columns) fits the data and reveals the underlying patterns clearly.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background and various other colors (Gray-5, Red-2, Orange-7, Maroon-9, Azure-8, Blue-1, Magenta-6) for foreground objects.
3.  **Objects:** There appear to be two types of significant objects in the input grids:
    *   Single, isolated pixels of a non-white color. A pixel is isolated if all its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) are white (0).
    *   Horizontal lines of exactly 3 pixels, all having the same non-white color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to operate differently on these two types of objects:
    *   Existing horizontal lines of length 3 are preserved; they appear unchanged in the output grid at the same location.
    *   Single, isolated pixels are expanded into a horizontal line of length 3, using the original pixel's color. The original pixel becomes the center of the new line (if possible).
5.  **Wrapping Behavior:** The expansion of single pixels exhibits edge wrapping:
    *   If a single pixel is in the leftmost column (column 0), the leftmost pixel of its expanded line wraps to the last column (column 7) of the row *above*. The row index also wraps (row 0 wraps to row 3).
    *   If a single pixel is in the rightmost column (column 7), the rightmost pixel of its expanded line wraps to the first column (column 0) of the row *below*. The row index also wraps (row 3 wraps to row 0).
    *   For pixels not on the left or right edges, the expansion is simply `(r, c-1), (r, c), (r, c+1)`.
6.  **Output Construction:** The output grid seems to be constructed by taking the input grid, identifying the single pixels, and then drawing the corresponding expanded 3-pixel lines onto the grid, overwriting the original single pixel and potentially adjacent white pixels. The unchanged 3-pixel lines from the input are effectively carried over.

**Facts (YAML):**

Transforms a 4x8 grid represented as a 1D list of 32 integers.

The transformation rule operates as follows:
1. Reshape the input 1D list into a 4x8 2D grid.
2. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
3. Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.
4. Identify "isolated" non-white pixels. An isolated pixel is a non-white pixel (value > 0) where all 8 of its neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent, with wrap-around for edges) are white (value 0).
5. For each isolated pixel found at position (r, c) with color 'C':
    a. Determine the coordinates for a 3-pixel horizontal line centered at (r, c), considering wrap-around for columns:
        - Center: (r, c)
        - Left: (r, (c - 1 + 8) % 8)
        - Right: (r, (c + 1 + 8) % 8)
    b. Apply special row wrap-around rules for pixels on the left or right edges:
        - If the isolated pixel is in the leftmost column (c == 0), the row index for the "left" pixel (which wraps to column 7) becomes (r - 1 + 4) % 4.
        - If the isolated pixel is in the rightmost column (c == 7), the row index for the "right" pixel (which wraps to column 0) becomes (r + 1 + 4) % 4.
    c. Set the pixels at the calculated left, center, and right coordinates in the output grid to the color 'C' of the original isolated pixel.
6. Pixels that were already part of a 3-pixel horizontal line in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid because they are not "isolated" and the output grid starts as a copy.
7. Flatten the final 4x8 output grid back into a 1D list of 32 integers.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the grid dimensions (4x8) and the core concept of expanding single pixels into 3-pixel horizontal lines. However, the definition of "isolated" pixel was likely too strict, and the failure reported by the testing harness suggests an issue with how the input data (provided as space-separated strings) was parsed and passed to the `transform` function, rather than a fundamental flaw in the transformation logic itself (assuming the function expected `List[int]`).

The previous Python code implemented the core logic using a concept similar to "source pixels" and correctly handled column wrap-around. The refinement needed is to ensure the row wrap-around rule for edge columns (column 0 and column 7) is precisely defined and implemented, matching the behavior observed across all examples.

The strategy is:
1.  Confirm the grid structure (4x8).
2.  Define the "source" pixels accurately: non-white pixels whose horizontal neighbors (with column wrapping) are not the same color.
3.  Define the expansion rule for source pixels, including the specific row and column wrap-around logic for pixels created based on source pixels at the left (col 0) and right (col 7) edges.
4.  Ensure the natural language program and YAML facts clearly reflect this refined understanding.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
grid_properties:
  height: 4
  width: 8
  background_color: 0 (white)

input_objects:
  - type: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - is_source: Boolean. True if the pixel is non-white AND its horizontal neighbors (left and right, with column wrap-around) have colors different from this pixel's color.
  - type: horizontal_line
    description: A sequence of exactly 3 contiguous pixels in the same row with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 1-9.
      - length: 3
      - position: Defined by the coordinates of its 3 constituent pixels.

transformation_rule:
  actions:
    - action: copy_grid
      description: Create the output grid as an initial copy of the input grid.
    - action: identify_sources
      description: Iterate through the input grid to find all 'source' pixels.
    - action: expand_source
      description: For each identified source pixel at input position (r, c) with color C:
      inputs:
        - source_pixel_coords: (r, c)
        - source_pixel_color: C
        - grid_dimensions: (rows=4, cols=8)
      outputs:
        - A set of 3 target coordinates and the color C to be written to the output grid.
      process:
        1. Calculate target column indices with horizontal wrap-around:
           - center_c: c
           - left_c: (c - 1 + 8) % 8
           - right_c: (c + 1 + 8) % 8
        2. Calculate target row indices, applying vertical wrap-around only for edge cases:
           - center_r: r
           - left_r: (r - 1 + 4) % 4 IF source pixel is at column 0 (c == 0), ELSE r
           - right_r: (r + 1 + 4) % 4 IF source pixel is at column 7 (c == 7), ELSE r
        3. Determine the 3 target coordinates: (left_r, left_c), (center_r, center_c), (right_r, right_c).
    - action: apply_expansion
      description: For each source pixel identified, overwrite the pixels at the 3 calculated target coordinates in the output grid with the source pixel's color (C).

output_composition:
  - The final output grid is the modified copy, containing the original horizontal lines (unless overwritten) and the newly created 3-pixel lines resulting from source expansions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Assume the input is a 4x8 grid. Create a new 4x8 output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
2.  **Identify Sources:** Examine each pixel in the *input* grid. A pixel at `(r, c)` is considered a "source" if it is not white (color > 0) AND its left neighbor (at column `(c-1+8)%8`, same row `r`) and its right neighbor (at column `(c+1+8)%8`, same row `r`) both have colors different from the pixel at `(r, c)`.
3.  **Expand Sources:** For each source pixel identified at input position `(r, c)` with color `C`:
    a.  Determine the coordinates of the three pixels that will form the new horizontal line in the *output* grid:
        i.  **Center Pixel:** The coordinates are `(r, c)`.
        ii. **Left Pixel:** The column is `(c - 1 + 8) % 8`. The row is `(r - 1 + 4) % 4` if the source pixel was in the first column (`c == 0`), otherwise the row is `r`.
        iii.**Right Pixel:** The column is `(c + 1 + 8) % 8`. The row is `(r + 1 + 4) % 4` if the source pixel was in the last column (`c == 7`), otherwise the row is `r`.
    b.  **Update Output:** Set the color of the output grid pixels at these three calculated coordinates (Left, Center, Right) to `C`. Note that this overwrites the original pixel at `(r, c)` and potentially two other pixels in the output grid.
4.  **Finalize:** The resulting output grid, after all source pixels have been processed and their expansions applied, is the final result. Existing 3-pixel horizontal lines from the input remain in the output unless overwritten by an expansion.
