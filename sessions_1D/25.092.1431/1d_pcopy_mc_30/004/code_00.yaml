grid_properties:
  height: 4
  width: 8
  background_color: 0 (white)

input_objects:
  - type: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - is_source: Boolean. True if the pixel is non-white AND its horizontal neighbors (left and right, with column wrap-around) have colors different from this pixel's color.
  - type: horizontal_line
    description: A sequence of exactly 3 contiguous pixels in the same row with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 1-9.
      - length: 3
      - position: Defined by the coordinates of its 3 constituent pixels.

  actions:
    - action: copy_grid
      description: Create the output grid as an initial copy of the input grid.
    - action: identify_sources
      description: Iterate through the input grid to find all 'source' pixels.
    - action: expand_source
      description: For each identified source pixel at input position (r, c) with color C:
      inputs:
        - source_pixel_coords: (r, c)
        - source_pixel_color: C
        - grid_dimensions: (rows=4, cols=8)
      outputs:
        - A set of 3 target coordinates and the color C to be written to the output grid.
      process:
        1. Calculate target column indices with horizontal wrap-around:
           - center_c: c
           - left_c: (c - 1 + 8) % 8
           - right_c: (c + 1 + 8) % 8
        2. Calculate target row indices, applying vertical wrap-around only for edge cases:
           - center_r: r
           - left_r: (r - 1 + 4) % 4 IF source pixel is at column 0 (c == 0), ELSE r
           - right_r: (r + 1 + 4) % 4 IF source pixel is at column 7 (c == 7), ELSE r
        3. Determine the 3 target coordinates: (left_r, left_c), (center_r, center_c), (right_r, right_c).
    - action: apply_expansion
      description: For each source pixel identified, overwrite the pixels at the 3 calculated target coordinates in the output grid with the source pixel's color (C).

output_composition:
  - The final output grid is the modified copy, containing the original horizontal lines (unless overwritten) and the newly created 3-pixel lines resulting from source expansions.
