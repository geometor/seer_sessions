Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output data are presented as 1D arrays of length 32. Observing the patterns, particularly the horizontal lines of length 3, suggests a 2D grid structure. A 4x8 grid (4 rows, 8 columns) fits the data and reveals the underlying patterns clearly.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background and various other colors (Gray-5, Red-2, Orange-7, Maroon-9, Azure-8, Blue-1, Magenta-6) for foreground objects.
3.  **Objects:** There appear to be two types of significant objects in the input grids:
    *   Single, isolated pixels of a non-white color. A pixel is isolated if all its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) are white (0).
    *   Horizontal lines of exactly 3 pixels, all having the same non-white color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to operate differently on these two types of objects:
    *   Existing horizontal lines of length 3 are preserved; they appear unchanged in the output grid at the same location.
    *   Single, isolated pixels are expanded into a horizontal line of length 3, using the original pixel's color. The original pixel becomes the center of the new line (if possible).
5.  **Wrapping Behavior:** The expansion of single pixels exhibits edge wrapping:
    *   If a single pixel is in the leftmost column (column 0), the leftmost pixel of its expanded line wraps to the last column (column 7) of the row *above*. The row index also wraps (row 0 wraps to row 3).
    *   If a single pixel is in the rightmost column (column 7), the rightmost pixel of its expanded line wraps to the first column (column 0) of the row *below*. The row index also wraps (row 3 wraps to row 0).
    *   For pixels not on the left or right edges, the expansion is simply `(r, c-1), (r, c), (r, c+1)`.
6.  **Output Construction:** The output grid seems to be constructed by taking the input grid, identifying the single pixels, and then drawing the corresponding expanded 3-pixel lines onto the grid, overwriting the original single pixel and potentially adjacent white pixels. The unchanged 3-pixel lines from the input are effectively carried over.

**Facts (YAML):**


```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List

"""
Transforms a 4x8 grid represented as a 1D list of 32 integers.

The transformation rule operates as follows:
1. Reshape the input 1D list into a 4x8 2D grid.
2. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
3. Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.
4. Identify "isolated" non-white pixels. An isolated pixel is a non-white pixel (value > 0) where all 8 of its neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent, with wrap-around for edges) are white (value 0).
5. For each isolated pixel found at position (r, c) with color 'C':
    a. Determine the coordinates for a 3-pixel horizontal line centered at (r, c), considering wrap-around for columns:
        - Center: (r, c)
        - Left: (r, (c - 1 + 8) % 8)
        - Right: (r, (c + 1 + 8) % 8)
    b. Apply special row wrap-around rules for pixels on the left or right edges:
        - If the isolated pixel is in the leftmost column (c == 0), the row index for the "left" pixel (which wraps to column 7) becomes (r - 1 + 4) % 4.
        - If the isolated pixel is in the rightmost column (c == 7), the row index for the "right" pixel (which wraps to column 0) becomes (r + 1 + 4) % 4.
    c. Set the pixels at the calculated left, center, and right coordinates in the output grid to the color 'C' of the original isolated pixel.
6. Pixels that were already part of a 3-pixel horizontal line in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid because they are not "isolated" and the output grid starts as a copy.
7. Flatten the final 4x8 output grid back into a 1D list of 32 integers.
