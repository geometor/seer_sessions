"""
Transforms a 4x8 grid represented as a 1D list of 32 integers.

The transformation rule operates as follows:
1. Reshape the input 1D list into a 4x8 2D grid.
2. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
3. Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.
4. Identify "isolated" non-white pixels. An isolated pixel is a non-white pixel (value > 0) where all 8 of its neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent, with wrap-around for edges) are white (value 0).
5. For each isolated pixel found at position (r, c) with color 'C':
    a. Determine the coordinates for a 3-pixel horizontal line centered at (r, c), considering wrap-around for columns:
        - Center: (r, c)
        - Left: (r, (c - 1 + 8) % 8)
        - Right: (r, (c + 1 + 8) % 8)
    b. Apply special row wrap-around rules for pixels on the left or right edges:
        - If the isolated pixel is in the leftmost column (c == 0), the row index for the "left" pixel (which wraps to column 7) becomes (r - 1 + 4) % 4.
        - If the isolated pixel is in the rightmost column (c == 7), the row index for the "right" pixel (which wraps to column 0) becomes (r + 1 + 4) % 4.
    c. Set the pixels at the calculated left, center, and right coordinates in the output grid to the color 'C' of the original isolated pixel.
6. Pixels that were already part of a 3-pixel horizontal line in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid because they are not "isolated" and the output grid starts as a copy.
7. Flatten the final 4x8 output grid back into a 1D list of 32 integers.
