Reshape the input 1D list into a 4x8 2D grid.\n2. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.\n3. Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.\n4. Identify \"isolated\" non-white pixels. An isolated pixel is a non-white pixel (value > 0) where all 8 of its neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent, with wrap-around for edges) are white (value 0).\n5. For each isolated pixel found at position (r, c) with color 'C':\n    a. Determine the coordinates for a 3-pixel horizontal line centered at (r, c), considering wrap-around for columns:\n        - Center: (r, c)\n        - Left: (r, (c - 1 + 8) % 8)\n        - Right: (r, (c + 1 + 8) % 8)\n    b. Apply special row wrap-around rules for pixels on the left or right edges:\n        - If the isolated pixel is in the leftmost column (c == 0), the row index for the \"left\" pixel (which wraps to column 7) becomes (r - 1 + 4) % 4.\n        - If the isolated pixel is in the rightmost column (c == 7), the row index for the \"right\" pixel (which wraps to column 0) becomes (r + 1 + 4) % 4.\n    c. Set the pixels at the calculated left, center, and right coordinates in the output grid to the color 'C' of the original isolated pixel.\n6. Pixels that were already part of a 3-pixel horizontal line in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid because they are not \"isolated\" and the output grid starts as a copy.\n7. Flatten the final 4x8 output grid back into a 1D list of 32 integers.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Gets the values of the 8 neighbors of a cell (r, c) with wrap-around.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            nr = (r + dr + rows) % rows\n            nc = (c + dc + cols) % cols\n            neighbors.append(grid[nr, nc])\n    return neighbors\n\ndef is_isolated(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-white pixel at (r, c) is isolated.\"\"\"\n    if grid[r, c] == 0: # White pixels cannot be isolated points of interest\n        return False\n    neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, r, c)\n    # Check if all neighbors are white (0)\n    return all(neighbor == 0 for neighbor in neighbors)\n\ndef transform(input_grid_flat: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    Expands isolated single pixels into 3-pixel horizontal lines with wrapping.\n    Preserves existing 3-pixel horizontal lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(input_grid_flat) != 32:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must have exactly 32 elements for a 4x8 grid.\")\n\n    # Reshape input list into a 4x8 numpy array\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid_flat).reshape(4, 8)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check if the current cell is an isolated non-white pixel\n            if is_isolated(input_grid, r, c):\n                color = input_grid[r, c]\n\n                # Calculate coordinates for the 3-pixel line\n                center_r, center_c = r, c\n                left_r, left_c = r, (c - 1 + cols) % cols\n                right_r, right_c = r, (c + 1 + cols) % cols\n\n                # Apply special row wrapping for edge columns\n                if c == 0: # Left edge column\n                    left_r = (r - 1 + rows) % rows\n                if c == cols - 1: # Right edge column (using cols-1 for generality)\n                    right_r = (r + 1 + rows) % rows\n\n                # Update the output grid with the expanded line\n                output_grid[left_r, left_c] = color\n                output_grid[center_r, center_c] = color # This pixel is already set, but good for clarity\n                output_grid[right_r, right_c] = color\n\n    # Flatten the output grid back to a 1D list\n    return output_grid.flatten().tolist()\n\n```"
