Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output data are presented as 1D arrays of length 32. Observing the patterns, particularly the horizontal lines of length 3, suggests a 2D grid structure. A 4x8 grid (4 rows, 8 columns) fits the data and reveals the underlying patterns clearly.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background and various other colors (Gray-5, Red-2, Orange-7, Maroon-9, Azure-8, Blue-1, Magenta-6) for foreground objects.
3.  **Objects:** There appear to be two types of significant objects in the input grids:
    *   Single, isolated pixels of a non-white color. A pixel is isolated if all its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) are white (0).
    *   Horizontal lines of exactly 3 pixels, all having the same non-white color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to operate differently on these two types of objects:
    *   Existing horizontal lines of length 3 are preserved; they appear unchanged in the output grid at the same location.
    *   Single, isolated pixels are expanded into a horizontal line of length 3, using the original pixel's color. The original pixel becomes the center of the new line (if possible).
5.  **Wrapping Behavior:** The expansion of single pixels exhibits edge wrapping:
    *   If a single pixel is in the leftmost column (column 0), the leftmost pixel of its expanded line wraps to the last column (column 7) of the row *above*. The row index also wraps (row 0 wraps to row 3).
    *   If a single pixel is in the rightmost column (column 7), the rightmost pixel of its expanded line wraps to the first column (column 0) of the row *below*. The row index also wraps (row 3 wraps to row 0).
    *   For pixels not on the left or right edges, the expansion is simply `(r, c-1), (r, c), (r, c+1)`.
6.  **Output Construction:** The output grid seems to be constructed by taking the input grid, identifying the single pixels, and then drawing the corresponding expanded 3-pixel lines onto the grid, overwriting the original single pixel and potentially adjacent white pixels. The unchanged 3-pixel lines from the input are effectively carried over.
