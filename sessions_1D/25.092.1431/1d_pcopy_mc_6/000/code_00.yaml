task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_properties: primarily 1 row, variable width
  colors_present: white (background), gray, magenta, maroon, red, yellow, blue (non-background)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_block
    definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels in a row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (horizontally).
      - position: The starting column index of the block.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    direction: horizontal
    description: Pixels or blocks are adjacent if they are next to each other in the same row.
actions:
  - name: identify_singletons
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_singleton_pixels
    description: Find all non-white pixels that do not have an identical non-white neighbor immediately to the left or right.
  - name: expand_singleton
    input: singleton_pixel (color, position)
    output: 1x3_block
    description: Create a 1x3 horizontal block of the singleton's color, starting at the singleton's original position.
  - name: copy_unchanged
    input: non_singleton_objects_or_pixels
    output: identical_objects_or_pixels
    description: Pixels that are white or part of a horizontal block longer than 1 are copied directly to the output grid.
transformation_rule:
  condition: Applies to non-white pixels.
  logic: If a non-white pixel is a horizontal singleton (no identical neighbors left or right), expand it into a 1x3 block of the same color starting at its position. Otherwise, leave the pixel as it is.
  output_grid_generation: Start with a copy of the input grid. Apply expansions for all identified singletons. Ensure expansions do not exceed grid boundaries.
