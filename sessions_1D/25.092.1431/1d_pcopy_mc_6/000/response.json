            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 1-row grids (1xN dimensions). The width varies slightly.\n2.  **Colors:** The grids contain white pixels (0) as background and various other colored pixels (gray-5, magenta-6, maroon-9, red-2, yellow-4, blue-1).\n3.  **Objects:** We can perceive \"objects\" as contiguous horizontal sequences of the same non-white color. In the examples, we see objects of length 1 (e.g., a single `6`, `9`, `2`, or `1`) and objects of length 3 (e.g., `5 5 5` or `4 4 4`).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to target only the single-pixel objects (length 1). These single pixels are expanded horizontally into blocks of three identical pixels. The original pixel becomes the leftmost pixel of the new 3-pixel block. Objects that are already blocks of length greater than 1 (like `5 5 5` or `4 4 4`) remain unchanged. White pixels remain white unless overwritten by the expansion of a singleton object. The relative order of objects/blocks seems preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
