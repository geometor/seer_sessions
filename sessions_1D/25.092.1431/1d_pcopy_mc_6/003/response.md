Transformation Rule:
Identify non-white pixels (color != 0) in the input grid (which is expected to be 1 row).
For each non-white pixel at index `j`, determine if it is a horizontal singleton, meaning it does not have an identical non-white neighbor immediately to its left or right within the row.
If a pixel is identified as a horizontal singleton with color C at index j, modify the output grid (initially a copy of the input) by setting the color C at indices j-1 (if j>0), j, and j+1 (if j < width-1). 
Pixels that are white or part of a horizontal block longer than 1 in the input remain unchanged in the output unless overwritten by the expansion of a nearby singleton.
The output grid reflects these centered expansions.
