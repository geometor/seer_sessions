Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 1-row grids (1xN dimensions). The width varies slightly.
2.  **Colors:** The grids contain white pixels (0) as background and various other colored pixels (gray-5, magenta-6, maroon-9, red-2, yellow-4, blue-1).
3.  **Objects:** We can perceive "objects" as contiguous horizontal sequences of the same non-white color. In the examples, we see objects of length 1 (e.g., a single `6`, `9`, `2`, or `1`) and objects of length 3 (e.g., `5 5 5` or `4 4 4`).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to target only the single-pixel objects (length 1). These single pixels are expanded horizontally into blocks of three identical pixels. The original pixel becomes the leftmost pixel of the new 3-pixel block. Objects that are already blocks of length greater than 1 (like `5 5 5` or `4 4 4`) remain unchanged. White pixels remain white unless overwritten by the expansion of a singleton object. The relative order of objects/blocks seems preserved.

**YAML Facts:**

  output_grid_generation: Start with a copy of the input grid. Apply expansions for all identified singletons. Ensure expansions do not exceed grid boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid row by its column index `j`.
3.  For the pixel at index `j`, check its color (`C`). If the color `C` is white (0), continue to the next pixel.
4.  If the color `C` is not white, check if this pixel is a "horizontal singleton":
    *   Check the pixel to the left (at `j-1`): Is it the beginning of the row (`j=0`) or is the color different from `C`?
    *   Check the pixel to the right (at `j+1`): Is it the end of the row (`j = width-1`) or is the color different from `C`?
5.  If *both* conditions in step 4 are true (the pixel is a horizontal singleton):
    *   Modify the *output* grid: Set the color of the pixels at column indices `j`, `j+1`, and `j+2` to `C`. Be careful not to write past the end of the grid (only write to `j+1` if it exists, and to `j+2` if it exists).
6.  If the conditions in step 4 are *not* both true (the pixel is part of a larger horizontal block or white), do nothing (the pixel was already copied in step 1).
7.  After checking all pixels in the input grid row, the output grid contains the final transformed result.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed because the interpretation of the expansion rule was incorrect. The code assumed that a singleton pixel at index `j` expanded into a 1x3 block starting at index `j` (covering `j`, `j+1`, `j+2`). However, the comparison between the actual and expected outputs reveals that the 1x3 block should replace the pixels at indices `j-1`, `j`, and `j+1`, effectively centering the block around the original singleton's position but shifted one position to the left compared to the initial assumption.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-analyze the input/output pairs to confirm the exact positioning of the expanded block relative to the original singleton.
2.  Calculate metrics for each example to quantify the elements involved (singletons, blocks, positions).
3.  Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the corrected expansion rule.
4.  Refine the code logic to implement this new rule, paying attention to boundary conditions (e.g., a singleton at index 0 or near the end of the row).

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_properties: 1 row, variable width (32 in examples)
  colors_present: white (background), gray, magenta, maroon, red, yellow, blue (non-background)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_block
    definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels in a row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (horizontally).
      - position: The starting column index of the block.
  - type: singleton_pixel
    definition: A non-white pixel that does not have an identical non-white neighbor immediately to its left or right.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixel.
      - position: The column index of the pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    direction: horizontal
    description: Pixels are adjacent if they are next to each other in the same row. Used to identify singletons and blocks.
actions:
  - name: identify_singletons
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_singleton_pixels (color, position)
    description: Find all non-white pixels where the pixel to the left (if exists) has a different color AND the pixel to the right (if exists) has a different color.
  - name: expand_singleton_centered
    input: singleton_pixel (color C, position j), grid_width W
    output: modifications to output grid
    description: Modify the output grid by setting the color C at indices j-1, j, and j+1. This action is only performed if the respective indices are within the grid bounds [0, W-1]. Specifically, index j-1 is only modified if j > 0, and index j+1 is only modified if j < W-1. Index j is always modified.
  - name: copy_unchanged
    input: input_grid
    output: initial_output_grid
    description: Pixels are initially copied from input to output. Only pixels involved in an expansion are subsequently changed. White pixels and pixels part of multi-pixel blocks in the input remain unchanged unless overwritten by an expansion.
transformation_rule:
  - Iterate through the input grid to identify all 'singleton_pixels'.
  - Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - For each identified 'singleton_pixel' (color C, position j):
    - Perform the 'expand_singleton_centered' action on the output grid using color C and position j, respecting grid boundaries.
  - The final state of the output grid after all expansions is the result.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an output grid initialized as an exact copy of the input grid (which is assumed to be a single row).
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid by its column index `j` from left to right (0 to width-1).
3.  For the pixel at index `j`, get its color `C`.
4.  If `C` is white (0), continue to the next pixel.
5.  If `C` is not white, check if it's a "horizontal singleton":
    *   Check the pixel to the left (at `j-1`): Is it the beginning of the row (`j=0`) OR is the color at `j-1` different from `C`? Let this be `left_ok`.
    *   Check the pixel to the right (at `j+1`): Is it the end of the row (`j = width-1`) OR is the color at `j+1` different from `C`? Let this be `right_ok`.
6.  If *both* `left_ok` AND `right_ok` are true, then the pixel at `j` is a singleton. Perform the following modifications on the *output* grid:
    *   Set the color of the pixel at index `j` in the output grid to `C`.
    *   If `j > 0` (i.e., there is a pixel to the left), set the color of the pixel at index `j-1` in the output grid to `C`.
    *   If `j < width - 1` (i.e., there is a pixel to the right), set the color of the pixel at index `j+1` in the output grid to `C`.
7.  Continue iterating through the input grid until all pixels have been checked.
8.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
