Transformation Rule:
Identify non-white pixels (color != 0) in the input grid (which is expected to be 1 row).
For each non-white pixel, check if it is a horizontal singleton, meaning it does not have an identical non-white neighbor immediately to its left or right within the row.
If a pixel is identified as a horizontal singleton, expand it horizontally to the right, creating a 1x3 block of its color starting at its original position. This expansion overwrites the pixels at the original position and the two positions immediately to its right, respecting grid boundaries.
Pixels that are white or part of a horizontal block longer than 1 remain unchanged unless overwritten by the expansion of a singleton.
The output grid reflects these expansions.
