Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 1-row grids (1xN dimensions). The width varies slightly.
2.  **Colors:** The grids contain white pixels (0) as background and various other colored pixels (gray-5, magenta-6, maroon-9, red-2, yellow-4, blue-1).
3.  **Objects:** We can perceive "objects" as contiguous horizontal sequences of the same non-white color. In the examples, we see objects of length 1 (e.g., a single `6`, `9`, `2`, or `1`) and objects of length 3 (e.g., `5 5 5` or `4 4 4`).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to target only the single-pixel objects (length 1). These single pixels are expanded horizontally into blocks of three identical pixels. The original pixel becomes the leftmost pixel of the new 3-pixel block. Objects that are already blocks of length greater than 1 (like `5 5 5` or `4 4 4`) remain unchanged. White pixels remain white unless overwritten by the expansion of a singleton object. The relative order of objects/blocks seems preserved.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_properties: primarily 1 row, variable width
  colors_present: white (background), gray, magenta, maroon, red, yellow, blue (non-background)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_block
    definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels in a row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (horizontally).
      - position: The starting column index of the block.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    direction: horizontal
    description: Pixels or blocks are adjacent if they are next to each other in the same row.
actions:
  - name: identify_singletons
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_singleton_pixels
    description: Find all non-white pixels that do not have an identical non-white neighbor immediately to the left or right.
  - name: expand_singleton
    input: singleton_pixel (color, position)
    output: 1x3_block
    description: Create a 1x3 horizontal block of the singleton's color, starting at the singleton's original position.
  - name: copy_unchanged
    input: non_singleton_objects_or_pixels
    output: identical_objects_or_pixels
    description: Pixels that are white or part of a horizontal block longer than 1 are copied directly to the output grid.
transformation_rule:
  condition: Applies to non-white pixels.
  logic: If a non-white pixel is a horizontal singleton (no identical neighbors left or right), expand it into a 1x3 block of the same color starting at its position. Otherwise, leave the pixel as it is.
  output_grid_generation: Start with a copy of the input grid. Apply expansions for all identified singletons. Ensure expansions do not exceed grid boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid row by its column index `j`.
3.  For the pixel at index `j`, check its color (`C`). If the color `C` is white (0), continue to the next pixel.
4.  If the color `C` is not white, check if this pixel is a "horizontal singleton":
    *   Check the pixel to the left (at `j-1`): Is it the beginning of the row (`j=0`) or is the color different from `C`?
    *   Check the pixel to the right (at `j+1`): Is it the end of the row (`j = width-1`) or is the color different from `C`?
5.  If *both* conditions in step 4 are true (the pixel is a horizontal singleton):
    *   Modify the *output* grid: Set the color of the pixels at column indices `j`, `j+1`, and `j+2` to `C`. Be careful not to write past the end of the grid (only write to `j+1` if it exists, and to `j+2` if it exists).
6.  If the conditions in step 4 are *not* both true (the pixel is part of a larger horizontal block or white), do nothing (the pixel was already copied in step 1).
7.  After checking all pixels in the input grid row, the output grid contains the final transformed result.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transformation Rule:
Identify non-white pixels (color != 0) in the input grid (which is expected to be 1 row).
For each non-white pixel, check if it is a horizontal singleton, meaning it does not have an identical non-white neighbor immediately to its left or right within the row.
If a pixel is identified as a horizontal singleton, expand it horizontally to the right, creating a 1x3 block of its color starting at its original position. This expansion overwrites the pixels at the original position and the two positions immediately to its right, respecting grid boundaries.
Pixels that are white or part of a horizontal block longer than 1 remain unchanged unless overwritten by the expansion of a singleton.
The output grid reflects these expansions.
