The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.\n*   **Colors:** The primary background color is white (0). Various other colors appear as significant elements.\n*   **Objects:** The significant elements are non-white pixels. These appear either as isolated single pixels surrounded by white pixels or as contiguous horizontal blocks of three identical non-white pixels.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation targets isolated, single, non-white pixels. Each such pixel expands into a horizontal block of three pixels of the same color. This expansion involves changing the white pixels immediately to the left and right of the original single pixel to match its color. Existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output. The transformation appears to happen simultaneously for all identified single pixels based on the initial state of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel of the *original* input grid, checking its color and its immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right). Let the current pixel be at index `i` and have color `C`.\n3.  Identify if the pixel at index `i` is a \"single non-white pixel\". This condition is met if:\n    *   The pixel's color `C` is not white (0).\n    *   The pixel to the left (at index `i-1`) is white (0) or does not exist (i.e., `i` is 0).\n    *   The pixel to the right (at index `i+1`) is white (0) or does not exist (i.e., `i` is the last index).\n4.  If a pixel at index `i` with color `C` is identified as a \"single non-white pixel\":\n    *   In the *output grid copy*, change the color of the pixel at index `i-1` to `C`, provided index `i-1` is within the grid bounds.\n    *   In the *output grid copy*, change the color of the pixel at index `i+1` to `C`, provided index `i+1` is within the grid bounds.\n    *   (The pixel at index `i` in the output grid copy already has the correct color `C`).\n5.  After checking all pixels in the original input grid and applying necessary changes to the output grid copy, the resulting output grid copy is the final output."
