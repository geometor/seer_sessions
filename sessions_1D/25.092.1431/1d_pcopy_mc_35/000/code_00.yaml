Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Background: white (0)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output

Objects:
  - Type: Single Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (1-9)
      - Context: Surrounded horizontally by white (0) pixels (or grid boundary)
    Action: Expansion
  - Type: Pixel Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (1-9)
      - Shape: Horizontal block of 3 identical pixels
      - Context: Present in the input
    Action: No change

Transformation:
  Rule: Expand single non-white pixels into 3-pixel blocks.
  Mechanism:
    - Identify all single non-white pixels 'C' at index 'i' in the input.
    - A pixel is 'single' if its left neighbor (i-1) and right neighbor (i+1) are both white (0), considering boundary conditions.
    - For each identified single pixel 'C' at index 'i':
      - If index 'i-1' exists and input[i-1] is white (0), change output[i-1] to 'C'.
      - If index 'i+1' exists and input[i+1] is white (0), change output[i+1] to 'C'.
      - The pixel at output[i] retains the color 'C'.
  Concurrency: All expansions are based on the original input state and applied simultaneously to create the output.
  Invariance: Pixels that are not part of an expansion (either original white pixels not adjacent to a single non-white pixel, or pixels within existing 3-blocks) remain unchanged.
