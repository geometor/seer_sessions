"""
Transformation Rule:
Identify single, isolated non-white pixels in the input grid's single row. 
A pixel is considered isolated if its immediate left and right neighbors are white (0), or if it's at an edge and the neighbor on the other side is white.
For each identified isolated pixel based on the *original* input state, expand it into a horizontal block of three pixels of the same color in the output grid. 
This involves changing the white pixels immediately to the left and right (if they exist and are within bounds) of the original single pixel in a *copy* of the input row to match its color. 
Pixels that are not part of such an expansion retain their original color in the output copy, unless overwritten by an adjacent expansion.
The final output is the modified copy of the row, presented as a grid (list of lists).
