            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core error, \"ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous,\" indicates that the input grids are being passed to the `transform` function as NumPy arrays, not as standard Python lists of lists as initially assumed in the code structure. The comparison operations (like `grid_row[index] == 0` or `grid_row[index - 1] == 0`) within the `is_isolated` function are failing because they are being performed on NumPy array elements or slices in a boolean context where NumPy expects explicit `a.any()` or `a.all()`.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input data type using `tool_code`.\n2.  Modify the `transform` function to correctly handle NumPy array inputs. The simplest approach is to convert the relevant row of the input NumPy array into a standard Python list near the beginning of the function. This allows the existing comparison logic within `is_isolated` and the pixel manipulation logic to work as intended without needing NumPy-specific syntax.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the handling of NumPy arrays and the conversion step.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
