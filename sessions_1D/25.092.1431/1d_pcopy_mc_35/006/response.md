**General Assessment and Strategy**

The core error, "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous," indicates that the input grids are being passed to the `transform` function as NumPy arrays, not as standard Python lists of lists as initially assumed in the code structure. The comparison operations (like `grid_row[index] == 0` or `grid_row[index - 1] == 0`) within the `is_isolated` function are failing because they are being performed on NumPy array elements or slices in a boolean context where NumPy expects explicit `a.any()` or `a.all()`.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input data type using `tool_code`.
2.  Modify the `transform` function to correctly handle NumPy array inputs. The simplest approach is to convert the relevant row of the input NumPy array into a standard Python list near the beginning of the function. This allows the existing comparison logic within `is_isolated` and the pixel manipulation logic to work as intended without needing NumPy-specific syntax.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the handling of NumPy arrays and the conversion step.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Type: NumPy ndarray
  Dimensions: 2D, typically shape (1, W) where W is width <= 30.
  PixelType: Integer (0-9)
  Background: Typically white (0)

OutputGrid:
  Type: NumPy ndarray (consistent with input)
  Dimensions: Same as input grid
  PixelType: Integer (0-9)

Objects:
  - Type: Single Isolated Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (1-9)
      - Location: In the single row of the input grid
      - Context: Horizontally adjacent pixels (if they exist within bounds) are white (0) in the *original* input grid.
    Action: Center of Expansion
  - Type: Pixel Block (or Non-Isolated Pixel)
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (1-9)
      - Location: In the single row of the input grid
      - Context: At least one horizontally adjacent pixel (within bounds) is non-white (0) in the *original* input grid. This includes existing blocks like (2, 2, 2).
    Action: No direct action (retains original color unless overwritten by an adjacent expansion).
  - Type: White Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: white (0)
    Action: Retains color unless adjacent to a 'Single Isolated Pixel' in the original input, in which case it takes the color of that adjacent pixel in the output.

Transformation:
  Rule: Expand single isolated non-white pixels into 3-pixel horizontal blocks.
  InputProcessing: Extract the first row from the input NumPy array and convert it to a Python list for processing.
  Mechanism:
    - Create a list copy of the input row.
    - Iterate through the *original* input row (list version).
    - Identify indices `i` corresponding to 'Single Isolated Pixels' based on their color and the colors of neighbors at `i-1` and `i+1` in the original list.
    - For each identified index `i` with color `C`:
      - In the *copied list*, set the pixel at index `i-1` to `C` (if `i > 0`).
      - In the *copied list*, set the pixel at index `i+1` to `C` (if `i < width - 1`).
      - The pixel at index `i` in the copy retains color `C`.
  OutputProcessing: Convert the modified list copy back into a NumPy array with the original shape (1, W).
  Concurrency: Identification of isolated pixels is based solely on the original input state. Modifications are applied based on these identifications to the copied list.
  Invariance: Pixels in the input row that are not identified as 'Single Isolated Pixel' and are not adjacent to one retain their original color in the output copy.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array, expected to have a shape of (1, Width).
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input NumPy array.
3.  Convert this extracted row into a standard Python list. Let this be `input_row_list`.
4.  Create a separate copy of `input_row_list`. Let this be `output_row_list`. This copy will be modified to create the output.
5.  Get the width (number of elements) of the row.
6.  Iterate through each index `i` from 0 to width-1 of the *original* `input_row_list`.
7.  For each index `i`, check if the pixel meets the "single isolated non-white pixel" criteria using the `input_row_list`:
    *   The pixel's color `C` at `input_row_list[i]` must not be white (0).
    *   The pixel to the left (`input_row_list[i-1]`) must be white (0) OR `i` must be 0 (left boundary).
    *   The pixel to the right (`input_row_list[i+1]`) must be white (0) OR `i` must be the last index (width-1, right boundary).
8.  If the pixel at index `i` in `input_row_list` is identified as isolated:
    *   Get its color `C = input_row_list[i]`.
    *   Modify the `output_row_list`:
        *   If `i > 0`, set `output_row_list[i-1] = C`.
        *   Set `output_row_list[i] = C` (it should already be this from the copy, but explicit assignment is safe).
        *   If `i < width - 1`, set `output_row_list[i+1] = C`.
9.  After iterating through all indices of the `input_row_list`, the `output_row_list` contains the transformed row.
10. Convert the `output_row_list` back into a 2D NumPy array with the original shape (1, Width).
11. Return the resulting NumPy array.
