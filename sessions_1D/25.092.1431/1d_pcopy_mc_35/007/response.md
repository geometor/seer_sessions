"""
Transformation Rule:
Accepts a 2D NumPy array representing a grid, expected to have a single row (shape 1xW).
Identifies single, isolated non-white pixels within this row based on the original input state. 
A pixel is considered isolated if its immediate left and right neighbors in the original row are white (0), or if it's at an edge and the neighbor on the existing side is white.
For each identified isolated pixel, expand it into a horizontal block of three pixels of the same color in a copy of the row. 
This involves changing the pixels immediately to the left and right (if they exist within bounds) of the original single pixel's position in the copy to match its color. 
Pixels that are not part of such an expansion retain their original color in the copy, unless overwritten by an adjacent expansion.
The final output is the modified copied row, converted back into a 2D NumPy array with the original shape (1xW).
