Transformation Rule:
Identify single, isolated non-white pixels in the input grid's row. 
A pixel is considered isolated if its immediate left and right neighbors are white (0), or if it's at an edge and the neighbor on the other side is white.
For each identified isolated pixel, expand it into a horizontal block of three pixels of the same color in the output grid. 
This involves changing the white pixels immediately to the left and right (if they exist and are within bounds) of the original single pixel to match its color. 
Pixels that are not part of such an expansion (either original white pixels not adjacent to an expanding pixel, or pixels already part of a 3-block in the input) remain unchanged. 
The analysis of isolated pixels is based entirely on the original input grid state.
