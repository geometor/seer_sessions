Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels represented by integers 0-9. The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.
*   **Colors:** The primary background color is white (0). Various other colors appear as significant elements.
*   **Objects:** The significant elements are non-white pixels. These appear either as isolated single pixels surrounded by white pixels or as contiguous horizontal blocks of three identical non-white pixels.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation targets isolated, single, non-white pixels. Each such pixel expands into a horizontal block of three pixels of the same color. This expansion involves changing the white pixels immediately to the left and right of the original single pixel to match its color. Existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output. The transformation appears to happen simultaneously for all identified single pixels based on the initial state of the input grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D array (single row)
  Background: white (0)
  Dimensions: Constant between input and output

Objects:
  - Type: Single Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (1-9)
      - Context: Surrounded horizontally by white (0) pixels (or grid boundary)
    Action: Expansion
  - Type: Pixel Block
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-white (1-9)
      - Shape: Horizontal block of 3 identical pixels
      - Context: Present in the input
    Action: No change

Transformation:
  Rule: Expand single non-white pixels into 3-pixel blocks.
  Mechanism:
    - Identify all single non-white pixels 'C' at index 'i' in the input.
    - A pixel is 'single' if its left neighbor (i-1) and right neighbor (i+1) are both white (0), considering boundary conditions.
    - For each identified single pixel 'C' at index 'i':
      - If index 'i-1' exists and input[i-1] is white (0), change output[i-1] to 'C'.
      - If index 'i+1' exists and input[i+1] is white (0), change output[i+1] to 'C'.
      - The pixel at output[i] retains the color 'C'.
  Concurrency: All expansions are based on the original input state and applied simultaneously to create the output.
  Invariance: Pixels that are not part of an expansion (either original white pixels not adjacent to a single non-white pixel, or pixels within existing 3-blocks) remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the *original* input grid, checking its color and its immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right). Let the current pixel be at index `i` and have color `C`.
3.  Identify if the pixel at index `i` is a "single non-white pixel". This condition is met if:
    *   The pixel's color `C` is not white (0).
    *   The pixel to the left (at index `i-1`) is white (0) or does not exist (i.e., `i` is 0).
    *   The pixel to the right (at index `i+1`) is white (0) or does not exist (i.e., `i` is the last index).
4.  If a pixel at index `i` with color `C` is identified as a "single non-white pixel":
    *   In the *output grid copy*, change the color of the pixel at index `i-1` to `C`, provided index `i-1` is within the grid bounds.
    *   In the *output grid copy*, change the color of the pixel at index `i+1` to `C`, provided index `i+1` is within the grid bounds.
    *   (The pixel at index `i` in the output grid copy already has the correct color `C`).
5.  After checking all pixels in the original input grid and applying necessary changes to the output grid copy, the resulting output grid copy is the final output.

"""
Transformation Rule:
Identify single, isolated non-white pixels in the input grid's row. 
A pixel is considered isolated if its immediate left and right neighbors are white (0), or if it's at an edge and the neighbor on the other side is white.
For each identified isolated pixel, expand it into a horizontal block of three pixels of the same color in the output grid. 
This involves changing the white pixels immediately to the left and right (if they exist and are within bounds) of the original single pixel to match its color. 
Pixels that are not part of such an expansion (either original white pixels not adjacent to an expanding pixel, or pixels already part of a 3-block in the input) remain unchanged. 
The analysis of isolated pixels is based entirely on the original input grid state.
