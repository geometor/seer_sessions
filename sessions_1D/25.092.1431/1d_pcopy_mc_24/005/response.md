"""
Expand isolated single non-white pixels horizontally into triplets within each row of the grid.

The transformation identifies patterns of the form [0, C, 0] occurring horizontally within each row 
of the input grid, where 0 represents the white background color and C represents any non-white color (1-9).
Each such identified pattern is replaced in the corresponding row of the output grid by [C, C, C] 
at the same horizontal position. Pixels not part of such a pattern remain unchanged.
The transformation is applied independently to each row.
