task_description: "Expand isolated single non-white pixels within a single row into horizontal triplets of the same color."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # Task operates on a single row (grid height is 1).
  width: 33 # Constant across training examples.
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - object_type: target_pattern
    definition: "A sequence of three adjacent pixels [P_left, P_center, P_right] in the input row."
    properties:
      - location: indices [i-1, i, i+1]
      - structure: P_left is white (0), P_center (C) is non-white (C != 0), and P_right is white (0).
  - object_type: replacement_pattern
    definition: "A sequence of three identical non-white pixels [C, C, C] in the output row."
    properties:
      - color: C (matches the P_center color from the corresponding target_pattern)
      - location: indices [i-1, i, i+1] (same location as the target_pattern)
actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    description: "Create an output row initially identical to the input row."
  - action: scan_for_pattern
    description: "Iterate through the input row, examining each three-pixel window centered at index `i` (from i=1 to width-2)."
    condition: "Check if the window [input[i-1], input[i], input[i+1]] matches the 'target_pattern' structure."
  - action: apply_transformation
    description: "If a 'target_pattern' with center color C is found at indices [i-1, i, i+1], modify the *output* row at these same indices to become the 'replacement_pattern' [C, C, C]."
  - action: preserve_others
    description: "Pixels in the output row that are not part of a 'replacement_pattern' retain their original values from the input row (due to the initialization step)."
relationships:
  - type: locality
    description: "The decision to transform depends only on a pixel and its immediate horizontal neighbors."
  - type: pattern_replacement
    description: "A specific input pattern [0, C, 0] is replaced by a corresponding output pattern [C, C, C]."
  - type: color_inheritance
    description: "The color of the replacement pattern is determined by the central pixel of the target pattern."
  - type: positional_invariance
    description: "The transformation happens at the location of the identified pattern; no shifts occur."
  - type: element_invariance
    description: "Pixels not involved in the [0, C, 0] -> [C, C, C] transformation remain unchanged."
