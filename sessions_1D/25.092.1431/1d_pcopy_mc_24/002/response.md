**General Assessment & Strategy:**

The transformation rule appears consistently applied across all three training examples. The core operation involves identifying a specific local pattern: a single non-white pixel (`C`) surrounded by white pixels (`0`) on its immediate left and right (`[0, C, 0]`). When this pattern is found in the input row, it is replaced by a triplet of the non-white color (`[C, C, C]`) in the output row at the same position. All other pixels and patterns remain unchanged.

The previous code execution failed, potentially due to data type mismatches or issues within the testing framework, rather than a flaw in the core transformation logic. The strategy is to refine the description of this logic based on the combined evidence from all examples, ensuring clarity and precision, especially regarding the 1D nature of the data and the local pattern matching.

**Metrics:**

Based on the provided examples and the code execution results:

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Input Colors | Output Colors | Patterns `[0, C!=0, 0]` Found (Index of C) | Notes                                   |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| train_1 | (1, 33)     | (1, 33)      | {0, 6, 8}    | {0, 6, 8}     | 6 (color 6), 10 (color 8)                | Existing `[6, 6, 6]` is unchanged.      |
| train_2 | (1, 33)     | (1, 33)      | {0, 5, 6}    | {0, 5, 6}     | 8 (color 5), 13 (color 5)                | Two separate `[0, 5, 0]` patterns found. |
| train_3 | (1, 33)     | (1, 33)      | {0, 1, 4}    | {0, 1, 4}     | 7 (color 4)                              | Existing `[1, 1, 1]` is unchanged.      |

The metrics confirm that the operation focuses on 1x33 grids and replaces the specific `[0, C, 0]` pattern.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a working copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
2.  Examine the input row element by element, focusing on each element from the second position up to the second-to-last position. Let the index of the current element be `i`.
3.  At each position `i`, look at the triplet of elements: the element at `i-1` (left neighbor), the element at `i` (current), and the element at `i+1` (right neighbor).
4.  Check if this triplet matches the specific pattern: `[white, non-white, white]`. That is, verify if `input[i-1]` is 0, `input[i]` is not 0, and `input[i+1]` is 0.
5.  If the pattern is matched, let `C` be the non-white color found at `input[i]`. Modify the *output* row by setting the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to this color `C`.
6.  Continue this process for all possible central positions `i`.
7.  The final state of the working copy (the output row) is the result. Return this row (formatted as a grid with one row).
