task_description: "Expand isolated single non-white pixels into horizontal triplets of the same color."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # The grid behaves like a 1D sequence or a single row.
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - object_type: isolated_pixel
    definition: "A single non-white pixel C at index i, where the pixel at i-1 is white (0) and the pixel at i+1 is white (0)."
    properties:
      - color: C (non-zero)
      - position: index i
      - context: flanked by white pixels (0)
  - object_type: pixel_triplet
    definition: "A sequence of three identical non-white pixels (C, C, C)."
    properties:
      - color: C (non-zero)
      - length: 3
actions:
  - action: find_isolated_pixels
    description: "Scan the input row from the second pixel to the second-to-last pixel."
    condition: "Check if the pattern (0, C, 0) exists, where C is non-zero."
  - action: expand_pixel
    description: "Replace the identified (0, C, 0) pattern with (C, C, C) in the output."
    input_pattern: [0, C, 0] # C != 0
    output_pattern: [C, C, C]
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "The transformation depends on the immediate left and right neighbors of a non-white pixel."
  - type: invariance
    description: "Pixels not part of the (0, C, 0) pattern and existing (C, C, C) patterns remain unchanged."
