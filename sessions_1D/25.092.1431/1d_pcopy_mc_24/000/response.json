The primary colors involved are white (0) and various other colors like magenta (6), azure (8), gray (5), blue (1), and yellow (4). The transformation seems local, affecting small patterns within the row.\n\nSpecifically, the transformation identifies single, non-white pixels that are surrounded by white pixels on both their left and right. When such a pattern (`0, C, 0`, where `C` is any non-white color) is found, it is replaced by a triplet of that non-white color (`C, C, C`). Existing sequences of three identical non-white colors (`C, C, C`) remain unchanged, as do other patterns. The background white pixels are only changed if they are adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel that gets expanded.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
