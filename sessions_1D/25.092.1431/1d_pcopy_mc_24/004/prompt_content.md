```python
import copy

"""
Expand isolated single non-white pixels within a single row into horizontal triplets of the same color.

The transformation identifies patterns of the form [0, C, 0] in the input row, where 0 represents the white background color and C represents any non-white color (1-9).
Each such identified pattern is replaced in the output row by [C, C, C] at the same position. 
Pixels not part of such a pattern remain unchanged.
The input is assumed to be a grid containing exactly one row.
