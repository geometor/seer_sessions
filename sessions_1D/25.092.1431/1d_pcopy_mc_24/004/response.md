**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code correctly implemented the logic derived from the 1-row examples: find `[0, C, 0]` patterns (where C is non-zero) horizontally and replace them with `[C, C, C]`. The code assumed the input grid would always contain exactly one row. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous..." strongly suggests that the code, or the test harness interacting with it, encountered unexpected data structures. Given that ARC tasks use 2D grids, the most likely cause is that the test cases included inputs with multiple rows, which the original code wasn't designed to handle. It only processed the first row (`input_grid[0]`) and ignored others.

The strategy is to revise the code and the natural language program to operate on a general 2D grid. The transformation rule observed (horizontal expansion of isolated pixels) will be applied independently to each row of the grid. The code should also explicitly handle potential NumPy array inputs from the test environment by converting them to standard Python lists before processing.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Based on the provided training examples:
All three examples have input grids of size 1x33 and output grids of size 1x33.
The transformation involves finding isolated non-white pixels (`C`) flanked by white pixels (`0`) horizontally (`[0, C, 0]`) and expanding them into triplets (`[C, C, C]`).

Let's verify the transformation counts for each example:
