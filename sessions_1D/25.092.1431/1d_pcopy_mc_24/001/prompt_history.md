Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are single rows (or 1D sequences) of pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0) and various other colors like magenta (6), azure (8), gray (5), blue (1), and yellow (4). The transformation seems local, affecting small patterns within the row.

Specifically, the transformation identifies single, non-white pixels that are surrounded by white pixels on both their left and right. When such a pattern (`0, C, 0`, where `C` is any non-white color) is found, it is replaced by a triplet of that non-white color (`C, C, C`). Existing sequences of three identical non-white colors (`C, C, C`) remain unchanged, as do other patterns. The background white pixels are only changed if they are adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel that gets expanded.

**Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial output row.
2.  Iterate through the input row from the second position (index 1) up to, but not including, the last position (index `length - 1`). Let the current index be `i` and the color at this position be `C`.
3.  At each position `i`, check the following conditions:
    a.  The current pixel's color `C` is not white (i.e., `input[i] != 0`).
    b.  The pixel to the left (at index `i-1`) is white (i.e., `input[i-1] == 0`).
    c.  The pixel to the right (at index `i+1`) is white (i.e., `input[i+1] == 0`).
4.  If all three conditions are true, modify the *output* row by setting the colors at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `C`.
5.  After iterating through all applicable positions, return the modified output row.
