"""
Expand isolated single non-white pixels into horizontal triplets of the same color.
An isolated pixel is defined as a non-white pixel C at index i, flanked by 
white pixels (0) at indices i-1 and i+1.
The transformation replaces the pattern [0, C, 0] with [C, C, C].
Other patterns remain unchanged.
The input is assumed to be a grid with a single row.
