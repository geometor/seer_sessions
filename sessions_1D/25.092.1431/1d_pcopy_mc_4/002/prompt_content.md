```python
import copy

"""
Expand isolated single colored pixels into blocks of three.

This function takes a 1xN grid as input. It identifies any non-white pixel (color C > 0) 
that is surrounded by white pixels (0 C 0). For each such identified pixel at index i, 
it changes the color of the adjacent white pixels at indices i-1 and i+1 to C, 
effectively transforming the pattern '0 C 0' into 'C C C'. Pixels that are already 
part of a block of three identical colors or are white pixels not adjacent to an 
isolated single colored pixel remain unchanged.
