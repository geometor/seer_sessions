Data_Structure:
  - Type: NumPy array
  - Shape: Consistent (1, N) for both input and output in examples. N=33 for all training examples.
  - DType: int64
Grid_Properties:
  - Dimensionality: Single row (height 1).
  - Width: Variable, but consistent between input and output for a given example.
Pixel_Values:
  - Background: White (0)
  - Foreground: Colored (1-9)
Objects_Input:
  - Type: Single_Pixel_Island
    Structure: A non-white pixel C at index `i` where `input[0, i-1]` is 0 and `input[0, i+1]` is 0.
    Location: Cannot occur at index 0 or N-1.
    Examples:
      - train_1: 1 at (0, 9), 2 at (0, 15), 9 at (0, 20)
      - train_2: 7 at (0, 6), 8 at (0, 10)
      - train_3: 2 at (0, 8), 5 at (0, 14), 9 at (0, 20)
  - Type: Triple_Block
    Structure: Three identical non-white pixels C C C flanked by white pixels (0 C C C 0).
    Location: Sequence `C C C` occurs at indices `i, i+1, i+2`. `input[0, i-1]` is 0 and `input[0, i+3]` is 0 (if indices exist).
    Examples:
      - train_1: 9 9 9 at (0, 2-4)
      - train_2: 6 6 6 at (0, 1-3)
      - train_3: 5 5 5 at (0, 1-3)
  - Type: Background
    Structure: White pixels (0).
Action:
  - Name: Horizontal_Expansion
  - Target: Single_Pixel_Island objects.
  - Mechanism: For each Single_Pixel_Island with color C at index `i`, change the pixels at `(0, i-1)` and `(0, i+1)` in the output grid to color C.
Invariance:
  - Triple_Block objects are unchanged in the output.
  - Background pixels (0) are unchanged unless they are direct horizontal neighbors of a Single_Pixel_Island.
Output_Structure:
  - Identical shape and data type to the input grid.
  - Contains expanded blocks (`C C C`) where Single_Pixel_Islands (`0 C 0`) existed in the input.
  - Preserves original Triple_Blocks and other background pixels.
