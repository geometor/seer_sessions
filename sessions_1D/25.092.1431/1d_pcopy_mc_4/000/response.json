These objects appear in two forms in the input:\n    *   Single colored pixels, always surrounded by white pixels (`0 C 0`).\n    *   Blocks of three identical colored pixels, also surrounded by white pixels (`0 C C C 0`).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation acts on the single colored pixels. Blocks of three pixels seem unchanged.\n5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The transformation involves the immediate neighbors (left and right) of single colored pixels.\n6.  **Color Preservation:** The color of the pixels involved in the transformation is preserved. A single blue pixel expands into three blue pixels, etc.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the input grid, examining each pixel at index `i`, specifically focusing on indices from 1 up to (but not including) the last index (i.e., `1 <= i < length - 1`).\n3.  For each pixel `C` at index `i`:\n    a.  Check if the pixel `C` is non-white (`C > 0`).\n    b.  Check if the pixel to its left (`input[i-1]`) is white (0).\n    c.  Check if the pixel to its right (`input[i+1]`) is white (0).\n4.  If all three conditions (3a, 3b, 3c) are true, then this pixel `C` is an isolated single colored pixel. Modify the *output* grid by changing the color of the pixels at indices `i-1` and `i+1` to `C`. (The pixel at `output[i]` is already `C` from the initial copy).\n5.  If the conditions in step 3 are not met (e.g., the pixel is white, or it's part of a block of three like `C C C`), make no changes to the output grid for this position `i`, relying on the initial copy.\n6.  Return the final modified output grid."
