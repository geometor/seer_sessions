Grid_Dimensions:
  - Input: 1xN
  - Output: 1xN (Same as input)
Pixel_Types:
  - Background: White (0)
  - Foreground: Colored (1-9)
Objects:
  - Type: Single_Pixel
    Structure: A non-white pixel C flanked by white pixels (0 C 0).
    Examples:
      - train_1: 1 at index 9, 2 at index 15, 9 at index 20
      - train_2: 7 at index 6, 8 at index 10
      - train_3: 2 at index 8, 5 at index 14, 9 at index 20
  - Type: Triple_Block
    Structure: Three identical non-white pixels C C C flanked by white pixels (0 C C C 0).
    Examples:
      - train_1: 9 9 9 at indices 2-4
      - train_2: 6 6 6 at indices 1-3
      - train_3: 5 5 5 at indices 1-3
Transformation:
  - Name: Expansion
  - Input_Object: Single_Pixel (0 C 0) at indices i-1, i, i+1
  - Output_Object: Triple_Block (C C C) at indices i-1, i, i+1
  - Condition: Applied only to Single_Pixel objects.
  - Invariance: Triple_Block objects and background white pixels remain unchanged unless they are adjacent to a Single_Pixel undergoing expansion.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: The transformation rule depends on the immediate left and right neighbors of a non-white pixel.
  - Identity: The color value of the pixel determines the color of the expanded block.
