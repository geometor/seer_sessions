It identifies any non-white pixel \n(color C > 0) at index `i` that is surrounded by white pixels (0) at indices `i-1` \nand `i+1`. For each such identified pixel, it changes the color of the adjacent \nwhite pixels at indices `i-1` and `i+1` in the output grid to the color C, \neffectively transforming the pattern '0 C 0' into 'C C C'. Pixels that are already \npart of a block of three or more identical colors, or are white pixels not \nadjacent to an isolated single colored pixel, remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the expansion transformation to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.ndarray): A NumPy array of shape (1, N) representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: The transformed grid, also a NumPy array of shape (1, N).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a 2D numpy array with at least one row and one column\n    if input_grid.ndim != 2 or input_grid.shape[0] == 0 or input_grid.shape[1] == 0:\n        # Return an empty array or handle error as appropriate for the framework\n        # Returning a copy might be safer if modification in place is undesirable\n        return np.copy(input_grid) \n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid\n    # This ensures that pixels not involved in the transformation are preserved\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Get the dimensions (height should be 1, width is N)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Iterate through the columns of the single row, checking for the '0 C 0' pattern\n    # We only need to check indices from 1 to width-2, as the pattern requires neighbors\n    for i in range(1, width - 1):\n        # Get the color of the current pixel and its immediate horizontal neighbors from the *input* grid\n        center_pixel_color = input_grid[0, i]\n        left_pixel_color = input_grid[0, i-1]\n        right_pixel_color = input_grid[0, i+1]\n        \n        # Check if the pattern matches: center is non-white ( > 0) and neighbors are white ( == 0)\n        if center_pixel_color > 0 and left_pixel_color == 0 and right_pixel_color == 0:\n            # If the pattern is found, modify the *output* grid\n            # Change the left neighbor to the center pixel's color\n            output_grid[0, i-1] = center_pixel_color\n            # Change the right neighbor to the center pixel's color\n            output_grid[0, i+1] = center_pixel_color\n            # The center pixel output_grid[0, i] is already correct due to the initial copy\n\n    # Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
