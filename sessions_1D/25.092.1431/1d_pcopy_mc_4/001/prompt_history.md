Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional grids (single rows).
2.  **Pixel Values:** Grids contain white pixels (0) and various colored pixels (1-9).
3.  **Objects:** Non-white pixels form distinct objects. These objects appear in two forms in the input:
    *   Single colored pixels, always surrounded by white pixels (`0 C 0`).
    *   Blocks of three identical colored pixels, also surrounded by white pixels (`0 C C C 0`).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation acts on the single colored pixels. Blocks of three pixels seem unchanged.
5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The transformation involves the immediate neighbors (left and right) of single colored pixels.
6.  **Color Preservation:** The color of the pixels involved in the transformation is preserved. A single blue pixel expands into three blue pixels, etc.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Dimensions:
  - Input: 1xN
  - Output: 1xN (Same as input)
Pixel_Types:
  - Background: White (0)
  - Foreground: Colored (1-9)
Objects:
  - Type: Single_Pixel
    Structure: A non-white pixel C flanked by white pixels (0 C 0).
    Examples:
      - train_1: 1 at index 9, 2 at index 15, 9 at index 20
      - train_2: 7 at index 6, 8 at index 10
      - train_3: 2 at index 8, 5 at index 14, 9 at index 20
  - Type: Triple_Block
    Structure: Three identical non-white pixels C C C flanked by white pixels (0 C C C 0).
    Examples:
      - train_1: 9 9 9 at indices 2-4
      - train_2: 6 6 6 at indices 1-3
      - train_3: 5 5 5 at indices 1-3
Transformation:
  - Name: Expansion
  - Input_Object: Single_Pixel (0 C 0) at indices i-1, i, i+1
  - Output_Object: Triple_Block (C C C) at indices i-1, i, i+1
  - Condition: Applied only to Single_Pixel objects.
  - Invariance: Triple_Block objects and background white pixels remain unchanged unless they are adjacent to a Single_Pixel undergoing expansion.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: The transformation rule depends on the immediate left and right neighbors of a non-white pixel.
  - Identity: The color value of the pixel determines the color of the expanded block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid, examining each pixel at index `i`, specifically focusing on indices from 1 up to (but not including) the last index (i.e., `1 <= i < length - 1`).
3.  For each pixel `C` at index `i`:
    a.  Check if the pixel `C` is non-white (`C > 0`).
    b.  Check if the pixel to its left (`input[i-1]`) is white (0).
    c.  Check if the pixel to its right (`input[i+1]`) is white (0).
4.  If all three conditions (3a, 3b, 3c) are true, then this pixel `C` is an isolated single colored pixel. Modify the *output* grid by changing the color of the pixels at indices `i-1` and `i+1` to `C`. (The pixel at `output[i]` is already `C` from the initial copy).
5.  If the conditions in step 3 are not met (e.g., the pixel is white, or it's part of a block of three like `C C C`), make no changes to the output grid for this position `i`, relying on the initial copy.
6.  Return the final modified output grid.
