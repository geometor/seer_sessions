task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  input_output_shape_relation: Input and output grids have the same shape (width).
  background_color: white (0)
  input_format_assumption: Assumes input is provided as a list containing a single list representing the row (e.g., [[0, 4, 4, 4, 0,...]]). The previous execution error suggests this assumption might be violated by the testing environment.
objects:
  - id: segment
    type: contiguous_horizontal_non_background_pixels
    properties:
      color: The color of the pixels in the segment (non-zero).
      input_length: The number of pixels in the input segment (observed as 1 or 3).
      output_length: The number of pixels in the output segment (always 3).
      input_start_index: The 0-based index of the first pixel of the segment in the input row.
      output_start_index: The 0-based index of the first pixel of the segment in the output row.
relationships:
  - type: transformation_rule
    description: Maps input segments to output segments based on input length.
    conditions:
      - if: input_length == 1
        then:
          output_color: same as input_color
          output_length: 3
          output_start_index: input_start_index - 1
      - if: input_length == 3
        then:
          output_color: same as input_color
          output_length: 3
          output_start_index: input_start_index
actions:
  - name: Initialize Output
    description: Create an output row of the same width as the input row, filled with the background color (0).
  - name: Scan Input Row
    description: Iterate through the input row pixel by pixel from left to right.
  - name: Identify Input Segment
    description: When a non-background pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed, identify the contiguous segment of the same color, recording its color, start index, and length.
  - name: Calculate Output Segment Properties
    description: Apply the transformation_rule based on the identified input segment's length to determine the output segment's start index. The output length is always 3.
  - name: Draw Output Segment
    description: Write the transformed segment (color, length 3) onto the output row at the calculated output start index. Handle boundary conditions (indices must be within the row bounds [0, width-1]). Overwrite any existing pixels.
  - name: Advance Scan
    description: Move the scan position to the pixel immediately following the identified input segment.
  - name: Finalize
    description: Once the entire input row is scanned, return the completed output row (wrapped in a list).
