Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids).
2.  **Colors**: The grids use white (0) as the background and various other colors (yellow, azure, orange, blue, red, green) for foreground elements.
3.  **Objects**: The significant elements appear to be contiguous horizontal blocks of non-white pixels.
4.  **Input Patterns**: In the examples, these blocks seem to be either 1 pixel wide or 3 pixels wide.
5.  **Output Patterns**: In the outputs, all non-white blocks are exactly 3 pixels wide.
6.  **Transformation**: The core transformation modifies the width and potentially the position of the non-white blocks based on their original width.
    *   Blocks that are 3 pixels wide in the input seem to remain 3 pixels wide and keep their starting position in the output. (e.g., `4 4 4` in train_1, `1 1 1` in train_2, `2 2 2` in train_3).
    *   Blocks that are 1 pixel wide in the input become 3 pixels wide in the output. Their position seems to shift one step to the left relative to the original single pixel's position. (e.g., `8` at index 8 becomes `8 8 8` starting at index 7 in train_1; `7` at index 13 becomes `7 7 7` starting at index 12 in train_1; `4` at index 7 becomes `4 4 4` starting at index 6 in train_2; `3` at index 8 becomes `3 3 3` starting at index 7 in train_3).
7.  **Background**: The white pixels (0) form the background and fill the space not occupied by the transformed colored blocks. The output grid maintains the same overall dimensions as the input grid.

**Facts (YAML):**

      - If L_in is 3, Output Block is (Color C, Start Index S_in, Length 3).
  - name: Construct Output Grid
    description: Create a new grid of the same size as the input, initialized to white (0). Place the transformed blocks onto this grid according to their calculated start index and length (3). Overwrite existing pixels if necessary.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right.
3.  When a non-white pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet:
    a.  Identify the full contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    b.  Record the block's color (`C`), its starting index (`S_in`), and its length (`L_in`).
    c.  If `L_in` is 1, calculate the output starting index `S_out = S_in - 1`.
    d.  If `L_in` is 3, calculate the output starting index `S_out = S_in`.
    e.  Write a block of three pixels of color `C` into the output grid, starting at index `S_out`.
4.  Continue scanning the input grid from the position immediately after the identified block until the end of the grid is reached.
5.  Return the final output grid.

## Example 3:

**General Assessment:**

The primary issue identified in the previous run was a Python runtime error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") related to input validation, specifically how the presence of the input grid was checked using `if not input_grid`. This did not stem from an incorrect understanding of the core transformation rule but from an implementation detail in Python/NumPy.

The transformation logic observed initially appears consistent across all three training examples based on the input/output pairs:
1.  Non-white blocks of length 3 retain their color, starting position, and length (although the output length is consistently 3).
2.  Non-white blocks of length 1 retain their color, expand to length 3, and shift their starting position one index to the left.
3.  The background remains white (0).
4.  The grid dimensions (1 row, specific width) are preserved.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the block properties (color, start index, length) for inputs and outputs across all examples using code execution.
2.  Verify the transformation mapping (input block -> output block) holds true for all examples.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on this comprehensive analysis, ensuring the rule is accurately described.
4.  Note the specific Python error source for the coder phase to address.

    description: Color blocks are separated by one or more background (white) pixels in the input. Output blocks might become adjacent or overlap if input blocks were close.

    description: Create a new 1D grid (row) of the same width as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - name: Scan Input and Identify Blocks
    description: Iterate through the input row from left to right (index 0 to width-1).
    sub_actions:
      - When a non-white pixel is found that hasn't been processed as part of a block yet, identify the contiguous block of the same color starting at that index.
      - Record the block's color (C), starting index (S_in), and length (L_in).

      Input Block (Color C, Start Index S_in, Length L_in):
      - Define Output Length L_out = 3.
      - Define Output Start Index S_out:
        - If L_in is 1, then S_out = S_in - 1.
        - If L_in is 3, then S_out = S_in.
        - (Assume L_in is always 1 or 3 based on examples).
      - Place the Output Block: Write pixels of color C into the output grid at indices from S_out to S_out + L_out - 1. Ensure indices stay within the grid bounds [0, width-1]. Overwrite any existing pixels at these locations.
  - name: Finalize Output
    description: Return the completed output grid.
notes: |
  The transformation process involves resizing and repositioning blocks based on their initial length.
  The order of processing input blocks matters if output blocks could potentially overlap; processing left-to-right ensures later blocks might overwrite earlier ones if necessary (though overlap didn't occur in the examples).
  Potential Implementation Issue: The previous Python error arose from checking `if not input_grid` which is ambiguous for list-of-lists/numpy arrays. Validation should check list properties like length or use explicit checks like `input_grid is None` or `len(input_grid) == 0`.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output row with the same width as the input row, and fill it completely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input row from the leftmost pixel (index 0) to the rightmost pixel. Keep track of the current scanning index.
3.  If the pixel at the current index is non-white (not 0) and hasn't already been processed as part of a block:
    a.  Note this pixel's color (`C`) and its index (`S_in`). This marks the start of a block.
    b.  Determine the length (`L_in`) of this contiguous block by checking subsequent pixels until a different color or the end of the row is reached.
    c.  Based on the input block's length (`L_in`), determine the starting index (`S_out`) for the block in the output row:
        i.  If `L_in` is 1, set `S_out = S_in - 1`.
        ii. If `L_in` is 3, set `S_out = S_in`.
    d.  Draw a block of 3 pixels with color `C` onto the output row, starting at index `S_out`. Specifically, fill the pixels at indices `S_out`, `S_out + 1`, and `S_out + 2` with color `C`, but only if these indices are valid (within the row's bounds, i.e., >= 0 and < width). If pixels are already colored, they should be overwritten.
    e.  Advance the scanning index to the position immediately after the processed input block (i.e., to `S_in + L_in`).
4.  If the pixel at the current index is white (0), simply advance the scanning index by one.
5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the scanning index reaches the end of the input row.
6.  Return the completed output row.
