Transformation Rule Natural Language Program:

1.  Create a new output row with the same width as the input row, and fill it completely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input row from the leftmost pixel (index 0) to the rightmost pixel. Keep track of the current scanning index.
3.  If the pixel at the current index is non-white (not 0) and hasn't already been processed as part of a block:
    a.  Note this pixel's color (`C`) and its index (`S_in`). This marks the start of a block.
    b.  Determine the length (`L_in`) of this contiguous block by checking subsequent pixels until a different color or the end of the row is reached.
    c.  Based on the input block's length (`L_in`), determine the starting index (`S_out`) for the block in the output row:
        i.  If `L_in` is 1, set `S_out = S_in - 1`.
        ii. If `L_in` is 3, set `S_out = S_in`.
        iii. (Assumption: Only lengths 1 and 3 occur in input blocks based on examples).
    d.  Draw a block of 3 pixels with color `C` onto the output row, starting at index `S_out`. Specifically, fill the pixels at indices `S_out`, `S_out + 1`, and `S_out + 2` with color `C`, but only if these indices are valid (within the row's bounds, i.e., >= 0 and < width). If pixels are already colored, they should be overwritten.
    e.  Advance the scanning index to the position immediately after the processed input block (i.e., to `S_in + L_in`).
4.  If the pixel at the current index is white (0), simply advance the scanning index by one.
5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the scanning index reaches the end of the input row.
6.  Return the completed output row, formatted as a list containing one list.
