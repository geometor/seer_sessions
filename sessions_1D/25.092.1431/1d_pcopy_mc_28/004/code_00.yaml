task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_shape: Input and Output grids are 1xN (single row, variable width). Examples show 1x33.
  expected_input_format: List containing a single list representing the row (e.g., [[p1, p2, ...]]).
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - id: color_segment
    type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (values 1-9)
      length: Integer > 0
      start_index: Integer >= 0 (column index within the row)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Color segments are separated by one or more background (white) pixels within the row.
actions:
  - name: Initialize Output
    description: Create an output grid of the same shape as the input grid (1xN), filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - name: Scan Input Row
    description: Iterate through the single row of the input grid from left to right (index 0 to N-1).
  - name: Identify Segments
    description: When a non-white pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed, identify the complete contiguous horizontal segment of the same color. Record its color (C), start index (S_in), and length (L_in).
  - name: Transform Segment
    description: Determine the properties of the corresponding segment in the output grid based on the input segment's length.
    rule: |
      Input Segment (Color C, Start S_in, Length L_in):
      - If L_in is 1: Output segment is Color C, Start S_out = S_in - 1, Length L_out = 3.
      - If L_in is 3: Output segment is Color C, Start S_out = S_in, Length L_out = 3.
      - Assumption: Only input segments of length 1 or 3 appear based on examples.
  - name: Draw Output Segment
    description: Draw the transformed segment onto the output grid. For a segment (Color C, Start S_out, Length 3), fill pixels at indices [S_out, S_out+1, S_out+2] with color C, respecting grid boundaries (index >= 0 and index < N). Overwrite any existing pixels.
  - name: Advance Scan
    description: After processing an input segment, continue scanning the input row from the index immediately following the segment (S_in + L_in). If the current pixel was background, advance by one.
