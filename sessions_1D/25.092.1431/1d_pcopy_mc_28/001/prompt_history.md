Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids).
2.  **Colors**: The grids use white (0) as the background and various other colors (yellow, azure, orange, blue, red, green) for foreground elements.
3.  **Objects**: The significant elements appear to be contiguous horizontal blocks of non-white pixels.
4.  **Input Patterns**: In the examples, these blocks seem to be either 1 pixel wide or 3 pixels wide.
5.  **Output Patterns**: In the outputs, all non-white blocks are exactly 3 pixels wide.
6.  **Transformation**: The core transformation modifies the width and potentially the position of the non-white blocks based on their original width.
    *   Blocks that are 3 pixels wide in the input seem to remain 3 pixels wide and keep their starting position in the output. (e.g., `4 4 4` in train_1, `1 1 1` in train_2, `2 2 2` in train_3).
    *   Blocks that are 1 pixel wide in the input become 3 pixels wide in the output. Their position seems to shift one step to the left relative to the original single pixel's position. (e.g., `8` at index 8 becomes `8 8 8` starting at index 7 in train_1; `7` at index 13 becomes `7 7 7` starting at index 12 in train_1; `4` at index 7 becomes `4 4 4` starting at index 6 in train_2; `3` at index 8 becomes `3 3 3` starting at index 7 in train_3).
7.  **Background**: The white pixels (0) form the background and fill the space not occupied by the transformed colored blocks. The output grid maintains the same overall dimensions as the input grid.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input and output are single rows
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - id: color_block
    type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    properties:
      color: non-white (values 1-9)
      length: 
        input: 1 or 3 (observed)
        output: 3 (always)
      start_index: integer >= 0
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Color blocks are separated by one or more background (white) pixels.
actions:
  - name: Scan and Identify Blocks
    description: Iterate through the input row to find contiguous segments of non-white pixels. Record their color, start index, and length.
  - name: Transform Blocks
    description: Process each identified block based on its length to determine its properties in the output grid.
    rule: |
      Input Block (Color C, Start Index S_in, Length L_in):
      - If L_in is 1, Output Block is (Color C, Start Index S_in - 1, Length 3).
      - If L_in is 3, Output Block is (Color C, Start Index S_in, Length 3).
  - name: Construct Output Grid
    description: Create a new grid of the same size as the input, initialized to white (0). Place the transformed blocks onto this grid according to their calculated start index and length (3). Overwrite existing pixels if necessary.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right.
3.  When a non-white pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet:
    a.  Identify the full contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    b.  Record the block's color (`C`), its starting index (`S_in`), and its length (`L_in`).
    c.  If `L_in` is 1, calculate the output starting index `S_out = S_in - 1`.
    d.  If `L_in` is 3, calculate the output starting index `S_out = S_in`.
    e.  Write a block of three pixels of color `C` into the output grid, starting at index `S_out`.
4.  Continue scanning the input grid from the position immediately after the identified block until the end of the grid is reached.
5.  Return the final output grid.
