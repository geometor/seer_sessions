Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid (which is a single row) from left to right.
3.  When a non-white pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet:
    a.  Identify the full contiguous horizontal block of pixels of the same color starting at the current position.
    b.  Record the block's color (`C`), its starting index (`S_in`), and its length (`L_in`).
    c.  Determine the output starting index (`S_out`):
        - If the input block length `L_in` is 1, the output starting index `S_out` is `S_in - 1`.
        - If the input block length `L_in` is 3, the output starting index `S_out` is `S_in`.
        - (Assume only blocks of length 1 or 3 appear based on examples).
    d.  Write a block of three pixels of color `C` into the output grid, starting at index `S_out`. Ensure writing stays within the grid boundaries.
4.  Continue scanning the input grid from the position immediately after the identified block until the end of the grid is reached.
5.  Return the final output grid.

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the rules derived from the examples.
    Specifically, it identifies horizontal blocks of color in the single input row.
    Blocks of length 3 retain their start position and length.
    Blocks of length 1 are expanded to length 3, starting one position to the left.

    Args:
        input_grid (list): A list containing a single list representing the input row.

    Returns:
        list: A list containing a single list representing the transformed row.
