Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n2.  Scan the input grid (which is a single row) from left to right.\n3.  When a non-white pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet:\n    a.  Identify the full contiguous horizontal block of pixels of the same color starting at the current position.\n    b.  Record the block's color (`C`), its starting index (`S_in`), and its length (`L_in`).\n    c.  Determine the output starting index (`S_out`):\n        - If the input block length `L_in` is 1, the output starting index `S_out` is `S_in - 1`.\n        - If the input block length `L_in` is 3, the output starting index `S_out` is `S_in`.\n        - (Assume only blocks of length 1 or 3 appear based on examples).\n    d.  Write a block of three pixels of color `C` into the output grid, starting at index `S_out`. Ensure writing stays within the grid boundaries.\n4.  Continue scanning the input grid from the position immediately after the identified block until the end of the grid is reached.\n5.  Return the final output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rules derived from the examples.\n    Specifically, it identifies horizontal blocks of color in the single input row.\n    Blocks of length 3 retain their start position and length.\n    Blocks of length 1 are expanded to length 3, starting one position to the left.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list): A list containing a single list representing the input row.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing a single list representing the transformed row.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is treated as a single row, using numpy for easier slicing\n    # ARC grids are lists of lists, even for 1D\n    if not input_grid or not isinstance(input_grid, list) or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):\n         raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be a list containing at least one list (row)\")\n         \n    input_row = np.array(input_grid[0], dtype=int)\n    width = len(input_row)\n\n    # Initialize output grid with background color (0)\n    output_row = np.zeros(width, dtype=int)\n\n    # Iterate through the input row to find blocks\n    i = 0\n    while i < width:\n        pixel_color = input_row[i]\n\n        # Check if it's a non-white pixel (start of a potential block)\n        if pixel_color != 0:\n            start_index_in = i\n            block_color = pixel_color\n            block_length_in = 0\n\n            # Find the end of the contiguous block of the same color\n            j = i\n            while j < width and input_row[j] == block_color:\n                block_length_in += 1\n                j += 1\n\n            # Determine output start index based on input block length\n            output_start_index = -1 # Default invalid start index\n            if block_length_in == 1:\n                # A block of length 1 shifts left by 1 and becomes length 3\n                output_start_index = start_index_in - 1\n            elif block_length_in == 3:\n                # A block of length 3 stays in place and remains length 3\n                output_start_index = start_index_in\n            # else: Block lengths other than 1 or 3 are not handled based on examples.\n\n            # Write the 3-pixel block to the output grid if the start index is valid\n            if output_start_index >= -1: # Allow for start index potentially being -1 initially\n                 output_length = 3\n                 # Iterate k from 0 to output_length - 1 (i.e., 0, 1, 2)\n                 for k in range(output_length):\n                     write_index = output_start_index + k\n                     # Check if the calculated write index is within the grid bounds\n                     if 0 <= write_index < width:\n                         output_row[write_index] = block_color\n\n\n            # Move the main iterator past the processed block\n            # j is already at the position after the block ends\n            i = j\n        else:\n            # If it's a white pixel, just move to the next one\n            i += 1\n\n    # Return the output row wrapped in a list structure expected by ARC\n    return [output_row.tolist()]\n```"
