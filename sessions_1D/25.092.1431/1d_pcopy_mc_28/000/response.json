(e.g., `4 4 4` in train_1, `1 1 1` in train_2, `2 2 2` in train_3).\n    *   Blocks that are 1 pixel wide in the input become 3 pixels wide in the output. Their position seems to shift one step to the left relative to the original single pixel's position. (e.g., `8` at index 8 becomes `8 8 8` starting at index 7 in train_1; `7` at index 13 becomes `7 7 7` starting at index 12 in train_1; `4` at index 7 becomes `4 4 4` starting at index 6 in train_2; `3` at index 8 becomes `3 3 3` starting at index 7 in train_3).\n7.  **Background**: The white pixels (0) form the background and fill the space not occupied by the transformed colored blocks. The output grid maintains the same overall dimensions as the input grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
