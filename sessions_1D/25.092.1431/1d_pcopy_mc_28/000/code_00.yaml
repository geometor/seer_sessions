task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input and output are single rows
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - id: color_block
    type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    properties:
      color: non-white (values 1-9)
      length: 
        input: 1 or 3 (observed)
        output: 3 (always)
      start_index: integer >= 0
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Color blocks are separated by one or more background (white) pixels.
actions:
  - name: Scan and Identify Blocks
    description: Iterate through the input row to find contiguous segments of non-white pixels. Record their color, start index, and length.
  - name: Transform Blocks
    description: Process each identified block based on its length to determine its properties in the output grid.
    rule: |
      Input Block (Color C, Start Index S_in, Length L_in):
      - If L_in is 1, Output Block is (Color C, Start Index S_in - 1, Length 3).
      - If L_in is 3, Output Block is (Color C, Start Index S_in, Length 3).
  - name: Construct Output Grid
    description: Create a new grid of the same size as the input, initialized to white (0). Place the transformed blocks onto this grid according to their calculated start index and length (3). Overwrite existing pixels if necessary.
