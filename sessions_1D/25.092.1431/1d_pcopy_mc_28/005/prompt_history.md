Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids).
2.  **Colors**: The grids use white (0) as the background and various other colors (yellow, azure, orange, blue, red, green) for foreground elements.
3.  **Objects**: The significant elements appear to be contiguous horizontal blocks of non-white pixels.
4.  **Input Patterns**: In the examples, these blocks seem to be either 1 pixel wide or 3 pixels wide.
5.  **Output Patterns**: In the outputs, all non-white blocks are exactly 3 pixels wide.
6.  **Transformation**: The core transformation modifies the width and potentially the position of the non-white blocks based on their original width.
    *   Blocks that are 3 pixels wide in the input seem to remain 3 pixels wide and keep their starting position in the output. (e.g., `4 4 4` in train_1, `1 1 1` in train_2, `2 2 2` in train_3).
    *   Blocks that are 1 pixel wide in the input become 3 pixels wide in the output. Their position seems to shift one step to the left relative to the original single pixel's position. (e.g., `8` at index 8 becomes `8 8 8` starting at index 7 in train_1; `7` at index 13 becomes `7 7 7` starting at index 12 in train_1; `4` at index 7 becomes `4 4 4` starting at index 6 in train_2; `3` at index 8 becomes `3 3 3` starting at index 7 in train_3).
7.  **Background**: The white pixels (0) form the background and fill the space not occupied by the transformed colored blocks. The output grid maintains the same overall dimensions as the input grid.

**Facts (YAML):**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right.
3.  When a non-white pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet:
    a.  Identify the full contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    b.  Record the block's color (`C`), its starting index (`S_in`), and its length (`L_in`).
    c.  If `L_in` is 1, calculate the output starting index `S_out = S_in - 1`.
    d.  If `L_in` is 3, calculate the output starting index `S_out = S_in`.
    e.  Write a block of three pixels of color `C` into the output grid, starting at index `S_out`.
4.  Continue scanning the input grid from the position immediately after the identified block until the end of the grid is reached.
5.  Return the final output grid.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing exactly one list (row)

## Example 2:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing exactly one list (row)

## Example 3:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing exactly one list (row)
**General Assessment:**

The error message "Input grid must be a list containing exactly one list (row)" across all examples indicates a fundamental mismatch between the input data structure expected by the `transform` function and the structure it actually received during testing. The function was designed to handle a standard ARC grid format where even a single row is represented as a list containing one list (e.g., `[[0, 1, 1, ...]]`). The error implies the input was likely passed in a different format (e.g., a flat list `[0, 1, 1, ...]`, or potentially `None`, or an empty list).

The core transformation logic identified previously (modifying horizontal blocks based on length: 1 -> 3 shifted left, 3 -> 3 unchanged) appears consistent with the visual input/output pairs. The issue seems to be at the interface/data handling level rather than a misunderstanding of the transformation rule itself.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The underlying transformation rules seem correct based on the examples.
2.  **Reinforce Input Structure Assumption:** Explicitly state the expectation that the input grid is a list containing a single list representing the row, conforming to ARC standards.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to clearly define the input structure and the transformation steps, ensuring robustness in description.
4.  **Code Metrics:** Use `tool_code` to verify the properties (dimensions, block details) of the examples assuming the correct `[[...]]` structure.

**Metrics Gathering:**

We will analyze the structure and content of each training example assuming the standard ARC format `[[row]]`.

**Note:** The metrics calculation showed an output width of 34 for train_3, which seems inconsistent with the provided output string (length 33). Assuming this is a calculation artifact or copy-paste error in the tool code output presentation and that the output width should match the input width (33) based on visual inspection of the string data. Recalculating train_3 output manually: `0 2 2 2 0 0 0 3 3 3 ...` (length 33). The block analysis itself seems correct.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_shape: Input and Output grids are 1xN (single row, variable width). Examples show 1x33.
  expected_input_format: List containing a single list representing the row (e.g., [[p1, p2, ...]]).
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - id: color_segment
    type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (values 1-9)
      length: Integer > 0
      start_index: Integer >= 0 (column index within the row)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Color segments are separated by one or more background (white) pixels within the row.
actions:
  - name: Initialize Output
    description: Create an output grid of the same shape as the input grid (1xN), filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - name: Scan Input Row
    description: Iterate through the single row of the input grid from left to right (index 0 to N-1).
  - name: Identify Segments
    description: When a non-white pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed, identify the complete contiguous horizontal segment of the same color. Record its color (C), start index (S_in), and length (L_in).
  - name: Transform Segment
    description: Determine the properties of the corresponding segment in the output grid based on the input segment's length.
    rule: |
      Input Segment (Color C, Start S_in, Length L_in):
      - If L_in is 1: Output segment is Color C, Start S_out = S_in - 1, Length L_out = 3.
      - If L_in is 3: Output segment is Color C, Start S_out = S_in, Length L_out = 3.
      - Assumption: Only input segments of length 1 or 3 appear based on examples.
  - name: Draw Output Segment
    description: Draw the transformed segment onto the output grid. For a segment (Color C, Start S_out, Length 3), fill pixels at indices [S_out, S_out+1, S_out+2] with color C, respecting grid boundaries (index >= 0 and index < N). Overwrite any existing pixels.
  - name: Advance Scan
    description: After processing an input segment, continue scanning the input row from the index immediately following the segment (S_in + L_in). If the current pixel was background, advance by one.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Verify the input grid is a list containing exactly one list (the row). Let the width of this row be `N`.
2.  Create a new output row of width `N`, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Initialize a scan index `i` to 0.
4.  While the scan index `i` is less than `N`:
    a.  Get the color `C_in` of the pixel at index `i` in the input row.
    b.  If `C_in` is the background color (0), increment `i` by 1 and continue to the next iteration.
    c.  If `C_in` is not the background color:
        i.   Record the starting index `S_in = i` and the color `C = C_in`.
        ii.  Determine the length `L_in` of the contiguous segment of color `C` starting at `S_in`. Scan forward from `i` until the color changes or the end of the row is reached.
        iii. Based on `L_in`:
             - If `L_in` is 1, set the output start index `S_out = S_in - 1`.
             - If `L_in` is 3, set the output start index `S_out = S_in`.
             - (Assume no other lengths occur based on examples).
        iv.  Set the output segment length `L_out = 3`.
        v.   Draw the output segment: For each position `k` from 0 to `L_out - 1` (i.e., 0, 1, 2), calculate the target index `idx = S_out + k`. If `idx` is a valid index within the output row (i.e., `0 <= idx < N`), set the pixel at `idx` in the output row to color `C`.
        vi.  Update the scan index `i` to `S_in + L_in` to move past the segment just processed.
5.  Once the loop finishes (i >= N), wrap the completed output row in a list.
6.  Return the resulting list containing the single output row.
