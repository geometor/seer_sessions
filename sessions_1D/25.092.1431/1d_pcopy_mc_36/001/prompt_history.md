**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a single row of pixels. Each input row contains at least two distinct non-white colors. One color appears as a contiguous block of three identical pixels (e.g., red `2 2 2`, blue `1 1 1`, magenta `6 6 6`). Another color appears as a single, isolated pixel (e.g., gray `5`, yellow `4`), separated from the block and other non-white pixels by white `0` pixels.

The transformation focuses solely on the single, isolated pixel. This pixel's color is used to create a new block of three identical pixels in the output. The position of this new block seems related to the original position of the single pixel. Specifically, the new three-pixel block overwrites the original single pixel, the pixel immediately to its left, and the pixel immediately to its right. The original three-pixel block and all other white pixels remain unchanged unless overwritten by the expansion of the single pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Observations:
  GridType: 1D array (single row)
  InputFeatures:
    - Contains white pixels (0) acting as background/separators.
    - Contains at least one block of 3 identical non-white pixels (SourceBlock - appears unchanged in output unless overwritten).
    - Contains exactly one single, isolated non-white pixel (TargetPixel - isolated by white pixels or grid boundaries).
  Objects:
    - ID: TargetPixel
      Description: A single non-white pixel isolated by white pixels (0) or grid boundaries.
      Properties:
        - Color: C (variable, e.g., gray, yellow)
        - Location: Index `i`
    - ID: SurroundingPixels
      Description: The pixels immediately to the left (index `i-1`) and right (index `i+1`) of the TargetPixel.
      Properties:
        - Initial Color: Typically white (0) in examples.
    - ID: OtherPixels
      Description: All other pixels in the input grid not part of the TargetPixel or its immediate neighbors involved in the transformation.
      Properties:
        - Colors: Various, including white and potentially a block of 3 identical non-white pixels.
  TransformationRule:
    - Action: Expand and overwrite.
    - Trigger: Presence of a single, isolated non-white pixel (TargetPixel).
    - Steps:
        1. Identify the TargetPixel's color `C` and index `i`.
        2. In the output grid, replace the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` with the color `C`.
    - Invariant: OtherPixels retain their original color and position unless overwritten by the expansion step.
  Assumptions:
    - Only one isolated single non-white pixel exists in the input.
    - The input is always a single row.
    - Indices `i-1` and `i+1` are within the grid boundaries (implied by examples).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid (which is a single row).
2.  Iterate through the input grid from the second pixel (index 1) up to the second-to-last pixel (index width-2) to find a non-white pixel at index `i`.
3.  Check if the pixel at `i` is isolated, meaning the pixel at index `i-1` is white (0) and the pixel at index `i+1` is white (0).
4.  If such an isolated pixel is found:
    a.  Store its color `C`.
    b.  Modify the output grid by setting the color of the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to `C`.
    c.  Assume only one such pixel exists and stop searching.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
