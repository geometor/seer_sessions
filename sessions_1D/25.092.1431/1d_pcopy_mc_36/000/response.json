            "text": "**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a single row of pixels. Each input row contains at least two distinct non-white colors. One color appears as a contiguous block of three identical pixels (e.g., red `2 2 2`, blue `1 1 1`, magenta `6 6 6`). Another color appears as a single, isolated pixel (e.g., gray `5`, yellow `4`), separated from the block and other non-white pixels by white `0` pixels.\n\nThe transformation focuses solely on the single, isolated pixel. This pixel's color is used to create a new block of three identical pixels in the output. The position of this new block seems related to the original position of the single pixel. Specifically, the new three-pixel block overwrites the original single pixel, the pixel immediately to its left, and the pixel immediately to its right. The original three-pixel block and all other white pixels remain unchanged unless overwritten by the expansion of the single pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
