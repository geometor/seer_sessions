*   **Perception:** The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (single rows) of colored pixels. The core transformation involves identifying specific patterns and replacing them. The background color is white (0). The key pattern involves a single non-white pixel `C` that is preceded by a white pixel and followed by two white pixels (`0, C, 0, 0`). When this pattern is found, it is replaced by a block of three pixels of color `C`, followed by a white pixel (`C, C, C, 0`). Existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels are left unchanged. The transformation seems to apply simultaneously based on the input state, meaning all occurrences of the pattern in the input are identified first, and then the replacements are made in the output grid.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Grid:
      Type: 1D array of integers (pixels)
      Colors: 0 (white) is background, 1-9 are foreground colors.
    Objects:
      - Pixel: { color: Integer (0-9), position: index }
      - PatternInstance:
          Type: Sequence of 4 adjacent pixels in the input grid.
          Condition: Pixels at indices `i-1, i, i+1, i+2` match `[0, C, 0, 0]` where `C` is not 0.
          Property: `trigger_color: C` (color of the pixel at index `i`)
          Property: `start_index: i-1`
      - UnchangedBlock:
          Type: Sequence of 3 adjacent pixels in the input grid.
          Condition: Pixels are identical and non-white (e.g., `[5, 5, 5]`).
    Transformation:
      Action: Pattern Replacement
      Input_Pattern: `[0, C, 0, 0]` at indices `k, k+1, k+2, k+3`
      Output_Pattern: `[C, C, C, 0]` at indices `k, k+1, k+2, k+3`
      Scope: Applied to all instances of `PatternInstance` found in the input grid.
      Processing: Changes are based on the input state and reflected in a separate output grid. Unchanged blocks remain the same in the output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new grid (output grid) identical to the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through the input grid, examining each possible starting position `k` for a 4-pixel sequence (from index 0 up to length-4).
    3.  Check if the pixels at indices `k, k+1, k+2, k+3` in the input grid match the pattern `[white, C, white, white]`, where `C` represents any non-white color (1 through 9).
    4.  If the pattern is matched:
        a.  Identify the color `C` (the color of the pixel at index `k+1` in the input).
        b.  Modify the output grid by setting the pixels at indices `k`, `k+1`, and `k+2` to color `C`.
        c.  Ensure the pixel at index `k+3` in the output grid remains white (0). (Note: it is already white in the matched input pattern).
    5.  Continue iterating through all possible starting positions `k` in the input grid. Note that multiple patterns might be found, and their corresponding transformations should all be applied to the output grid based on the *original* input grid state.
    6.  Return the final modified output grid.
