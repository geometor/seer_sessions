The background color is white (0). The key pattern involves a single non-white pixel `C` that is preceded by a white pixel and followed by two white pixels (`0, C, 0, 0`). When this pattern is found, it is replaced by a block of three pixels of color `C`, followed by a white pixel (`C, C, C, 0`). Existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels are left unchanged. The transformation seems to apply simultaneously based on the input state, meaning all occurrences of the pattern in the input are identified first, and then the replacements are made in the output grid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Check if the pixels at indices `k, k+1, k+2, k+3` in the input grid match the pattern `[white, C, white, white]`, where `C` represents any non-white color (1 through 9).\n    4.  If the pattern is matched:\n        a.  Identify the color `C` (the color of the pixel at index `k+1` in the input).\n        b.  Modify the output grid by setting the pixels at indices `k`, `k+1`, and `k+2` to color `C`.\n        c.  Ensure the pixel at index `k+3` in the output grid remains white (0). (Note: it is already white in the matched input pattern).\n    5.  Continue iterating through all possible starting positions `k` in the input grid. Note that multiple patterns might be found, and their corresponding transformations should all be applied to the output grid based on the *original* input grid state.\n    6.  Return the final modified output grid."
