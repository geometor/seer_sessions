task_context:
  data_representation: 1D array or single-row grid of pixels (colors 0-9).
  background_color: white (0).
  foreground_colors: non-zero colors.
objects:
  - object_type: pixel_block
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - pattern: sequence of three identical pixels (e.g., C C C)
      - role: static element
  - object_type: single_pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - pattern: isolated non-white pixel flanked by white pixels (e.g., 0 C 0)
      - role: trigger for transformation
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are arranged linearly; left and right neighbors are important.
  - type: pattern_matching
    description: The transformation depends on recognizing specific local patterns (0 C 0 vs C C C).
actions:
  - action_type: copy
    target: pixel_block (C C C)
    effect: Preserve the block in the output at the same location.
  - action_type: expand/replace
    target: single_pixel (0 C 0 pattern)
    effect: Replace the three-pixel sequence (0 C 0) with a new sequence (C C C) in the output.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (or effectively 1D transformation)
  - size: Constant length (32 in examples) between input and output.
