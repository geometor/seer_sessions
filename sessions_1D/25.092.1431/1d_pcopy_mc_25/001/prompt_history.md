Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Data Format:** The input and output data are presented as single lines of space-separated integers (colors 0-9). This strongly suggests they represent 1D arrays or flattened grids, likely single-row grids given the nature of the transformation. The length appears consistent (32 elements in these examples).
2.  **Color Usage:** White (0) acts as the background. Other colors (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) represent foreground elements.
3.  **Key Patterns:** Two main patterns involving non-white pixels seem relevant:
    *   **Triple Blocks:** Sequences of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., `2 2 2`, `4 4 4`, `9 9 9`).
    *   **Single Pixels:** Single non-white pixels flanked by white pixels (e.g., `0 7 0`, `0 6 0`, `0 9 0`, `0 8 0`, `0 5 0`).
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   Triple blocks in the input seem to be copied directly to the output in the same position.
    *   Single non-white pixels undergo an expansion: the sequence `0 C 0` (where C is a non-white color) in the input is transformed into `C C C` in the output, effectively replacing the triplet centered on the single pixel with a triple block of that pixel's color.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  data_representation: 1D array or single-row grid of pixels (colors 0-9).
  background_color: white (0).
  foreground_colors: non-zero colors.
objects:
  - object_type: pixel_block
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - pattern: sequence of three identical pixels (e.g., C C C)
      - role: static element
  - object_type: single_pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - pattern: isolated non-white pixel flanked by white pixels (e.g., 0 C 0)
      - role: trigger for transformation
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are arranged linearly; left and right neighbors are important.
  - type: pattern_matching
    description: The transformation depends on recognizing specific local patterns (0 C 0 vs C C C).
actions:
  - action_type: copy
    target: pixel_block (C C C)
    effect: Preserve the block in the output at the same location.
  - action_type: expand/replace
    target: single_pixel (0 C 0 pattern)
    effect: Replace the three-pixel sequence (0 C 0) with a new sequence (C C C) in the output.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (or effectively 1D transformation)
  - size: Constant length (32 in examples) between input and output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input 1D array to serve as the initial output array.
2.  Iterate through the input array, examining each pixel at index `i`, focusing on indices from 1 up to length-2 (to allow checking left and right neighbors).
3.  For each index `i`:
    a.  Check if the pixel `input[i]` is non-white (color `C != 0`).
    b.  If `input[i]` is non-white, check its immediate neighbors: `input[i-1]` and `input[i+1]`.
    c.  If both neighbors `input[i-1]` and `input[i+1]` are white (0), then this `input[i]` is an isolated single pixel triggering a transformation.
    d.  Apply the transformation to the *output* array: set `output[i-1] = C`, `output[i] = C`, and `output[i+1] = C`.
4.  After iterating through all applicable indices, the modified output array contains the final result. (Pixels not part of a `0 C 0` pattern remain as they were initially copied).
