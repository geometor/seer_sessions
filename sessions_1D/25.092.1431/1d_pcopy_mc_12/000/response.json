White pixels (0) primarily serve as background or separators.\n3.  **Object Identification**: The key objects are contiguous horizontal blocks (segments) of identical non-white colors. Examples show blocks of length 1 and length 3.\n4.  **Transformation Rule**: The length of these non-white blocks dictates the transformation:\n    *   Blocks of length 1 are expanded to length 3 in the output, using the block's original color. This expansion overwrites the two positions immediately following the original pixel's position in the output.\n    *   Blocks of length 3 remain unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Output Construction**: The output grid is constructed based on these transformed blocks, placed at their original starting positions. Background pixels (white) fill the remaining space unless overwritten by an expanded block. The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through the input grid from the leftmost column to the rightmost column using an index `i`.\n3.  If the pixel at index `i` in the input grid is non-white (color `C`) and has not already been processed as part of a previous segment:\n    a.  Identify the full contiguous segment of color `C` starting at index `i`. Determine its length, `L`.\n    b.  If the length `L` is 1:\n        i.  Place three pixels of color `C` into the output grid starting at index `i`. Make sure not to write past the end of the grid.\n    c.  If the length `L` is 3:\n        i.  Place three pixels of color `C` into the output grid starting at index `i`.\n    d.  Advance the main iteration index `i` by `L` steps to skip the pixels already processed within this segment. Continue the loop from the new index.\n4.  If the pixel at index `i` is white, or if it was part of a segment already processed, proceed to the next index `i+1`.

After iterating through all columns of the input grid, return the constructed output grid."
