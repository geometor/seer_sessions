grid_dimensionality: 1
grid_size:
  input_width: variable
  input_height: 1
  output_width: same as input_width
  output_height: 1
objects:
  - id: background_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: white (0)
  - id: colored_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: non-white (1-9)
  - id: segment
    type: group_of_pixels
    definition: a contiguous horizontal sequence of identical colored_pixels
    properties:
      - color: the color of the pixels in the segment
      - length: the number of pixels in the segment
      - start_index: the column index where the segment begins
transformation_rule:
  - description: |
      Segments are identified in the input grid.
      The transformation depends on the segment's length.
  - condition: segment length is 1
    action: Replace the segment with a new segment of the same color but length 3, starting at the original segment's start_index in the output grid.
  - condition: segment length is 3
    action: Copy the segment unchanged to the output grid at its original start_index.
output_construction:
  - Initialize the output grid with background_pixels.
  - Iterate through identified segments in the input grid.
  - Apply the transformation rule based on segment length.
  - Place the resulting (original or transformed) segment onto the output grid at the segment's start_index, overwriting any existing pixels.
