"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on the length of contiguous non-white segments.
Segments of length 1 are expanded to length 3 in the output.
Segments of length 3 are copied unchanged to the output.
White pixels (0) act as background and separators.
The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.
