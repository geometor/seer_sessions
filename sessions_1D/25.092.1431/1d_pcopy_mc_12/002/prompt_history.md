**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The task operates on single-row grids (effectively 1D arrays).
2.  **Color Significance**: The transformation focuses on non-white pixels (colors 1-9). White pixels (0) primarily serve as background or separators.
3.  **Object Identification**: The key objects are contiguous horizontal blocks (segments) of identical non-white colors. Examples show blocks of length 1 and length 3.
4.  **Transformation Rule**: The length of these non-white blocks dictates the transformation:
    *   Blocks of length 1 are expanded to length 3 in the output, using the block's original color. This expansion overwrites the two positions immediately following the original pixel's position in the output.
    *   Blocks of length 3 remain unchanged in the output.
5.  **Output Construction**: The output grid is constructed based on these transformed blocks, placed at their original starting positions. Background pixels (white) fill the remaining space unless overwritten by an expanded block. The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation_by_property
grid_dimensionality: 1
grid_size:
  input_width: variable
  input_height: 1
  output_width: same as input_width
  output_height: 1
objects:
  - id: background_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: white (0)
  - id: colored_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: non-white (1-9)
  - id: segment
    type: group_of_pixels
    definition: a contiguous horizontal sequence of identical colored_pixels
    properties:
      - color: the color of the pixels in the segment
      - length: the number of pixels in the segment
      - start_index: the column index where the segment begins
transformation_rule:
  - description: |
      Segments are identified in the input grid.
      The transformation depends on the segment's length.
  - condition: segment length is 1
    action: Replace the segment with a new segment of the same color but length 3, starting at the original segment's start_index in the output grid.
  - condition: segment length is 3
    action: Copy the segment unchanged to the output grid at its original start_index.
output_construction:
  - Initialize the output grid with background_pixels.
  - Iterate through identified segments in the input grid.
  - Apply the transformation rule based on segment length.
  - Place the resulting (original or transformed) segment onto the output grid at the segment's start_index, overwriting any existing pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid from the leftmost column to the rightmost column using an index `i`.
3.  If the pixel at index `i` in the input grid is non-white (color `C`) and has not already been processed as part of a previous segment:
    a.  Identify the full contiguous segment of color `C` starting at index `i`. Determine its length, `L`.
    b.  If the length `L` is 1:
        i.  Place three pixels of color `C` into the output grid starting at index `i`. Make sure not to write past the end of the grid.
    c.  If the length `L` is 3:
        i.  Place three pixels of color `C` into the output grid starting at index `i`.
    d.  Advance the main iteration index `i` by `L` steps to skip the pixels already processed within this segment. Continue the loop from the new index.
4.  If the pixel at index `i` is white, or if it was part of a segment already processed, proceed to the next index `i+1`. (No action is needed for white pixels as the output grid is initialized to white, and non-white pixels are handled in step 3).
5.  After iterating through all columns of the input grid, return the constructed output grid.
