**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The task operates on single-row grids (effectively 1D arrays).
2.  **Color Significance**: The transformation focuses on non-white pixels (colors 1-9). White pixels (0) primarily serve as background or separators.
3.  **Object Identification**: The key objects are contiguous horizontal blocks (segments) of identical non-white colors. Examples show blocks of length 1 and length 3.
4.  **Transformation Rule**: The length of these non-white blocks dictates the transformation:
    *   Blocks of length 1 are expanded to length 3 in the output, using the block's original color. This expansion overwrites the two positions immediately following the original pixel's position in the output.
    *   Blocks of length 3 remain unchanged in the output.
5.  **Output Construction**: The output grid is constructed based on these transformed blocks, placed at their original starting positions. Background pixels (white) fill the remaining space unless overwritten by an expanded block. The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.

transformation_rule:
  - description: |
      Segments are identified in the input grid.
      The transformation depends on the segment's length.
  - condition: segment length is 1
    action: Replace the segment with a new segment of the same color but length 3, starting at the original segment's start_index in the output grid.
  - condition: segment length is 3
    action: Copy the segment unchanged to the output grid at its original start_index.
output_construction:
  - Initialize the output grid with background_pixels.
  - Iterate through identified segments in the input grid.
  - Apply the transformation rule based on segment length.
  - Place the resulting (original or transformed) segment onto the output grid at the segment's start_index, overwriting any existing pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid from the leftmost column to the rightmost column using an index `i`.
3.  If the pixel at index `i` in the input grid is non-white (color `C`) and has not already been processed as part of a previous segment:
    a.  Identify the full contiguous segment of color `C` starting at index `i`. Determine its length, `L`.
    b.  If the length `L` is 1:
        i.  Place three pixels of color `C` into the output grid starting at index `i`. Make sure not to write past the end of the grid.
    c.  If the length `L` is 3:
        i.  Place three pixels of color `C` into the output grid starting at index `i`.
    d.  Advance the main iteration index `i` by `L` steps to skip the pixels already processed within this segment. Continue the loop from the new index.
4.  If the pixel at index `i` is white, or if it was part of a segment already processed, proceed to the next index `i+1`. (No action is needed for white pixels as the output grid is initialized to white, and non-white pixels are handled in step 3).
5.  After iterating through all columns of the input grid, return the constructed output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the transformation's dependence on the length of contiguous non-white segments (objects). However, the implementation failed because the exact placement rule for transformed segments (specifically, those originating from length-1 segments) was misinterpreted.

The errors show a consistent pattern: segments generated from single pixels in the input are placed one position to the *left* in the output compared to the original pixel's position, but only when the position immediately to the left in the input was empty (white, color 0). Segments of length 3 are copied directly.

The strategy is to refine the transformation rule to incorporate this conditional placement for length-1 segments and update the natural language program and subsequent code implementation accordingly.

task_type: object_transformation_by_property_and_context
grid_dimensionality: 1
grid_size:
  input_width: variable

objects:
  - id: background_pixel

  - id: colored_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: non-white (1-9)
  - id: segment
    type: group_of_pixels
    definition: a contiguous horizontal sequence of identical colored_pixels
    properties:
      - color: the color of the pixels in the segment
      - length: the number of pixels in the segment (relevant lengths are 1 and 3)
      - start_index: the column index where the segment begins
      - preceding_pixel_color: the color of the pixel at start_index - 1 in the input grid (if start_index > 0)
transformation_rule:
  - description: |
      Segments are identified in the input grid.
      The transformation depends on the segment's length and its left neighbor in the input.
  - condition: segment length is 3
    action: Copy the segment unchanged to the output grid, starting at the segment's original start_index.
  - condition: segment length is 1 AND start_index > 0 AND preceding_pixel_color is white (0)
    action: Replace the segment with a new segment of the same color but length 3, starting at start_index - 1 in the output grid.
  - condition: segment length is 1 AND (start_index is 0 OR preceding_pixel_color is non-white)
    action: Copy the single-pixel segment unchanged to the output grid at its original start_index. (Inferred, as no examples show this case being transformed differently).
  - condition: segment length is not 1 or 3
    action: Copy the segment unchanged to the output grid at its original start_index. (Inferred default behavior).
output_construction:
  - Initialize the output grid with background_pixels (white, 0).
  - Iterate through identified segments in the input grid.
  - Apply the transformation rule based on segment length and context (preceding pixel).
  - Place the resulting (original or transformed) segment onto the output grid at the determined start index, overwriting any existing pixels. Handle boundary conditions carefully when writing segments.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid from the leftmost column to the rightmost column using an index `i`.
3.  If the pixel at index `i` in the input grid is non-white (color `C`) and has not already been processed as part of a previous segment:
    a.  Identify the full contiguous segment of color `C` starting at index `i`. Determine its length, `L`.
    b.  If the length `L` is 3:
        i.  Copy the three pixels of color `C` into the output grid starting at index `i`.
        ii. Advance the main iteration index `i` by 3.
    c.  If the length `L` is 1:
        i.  Check if the current index `i` is greater than 0 AND if the pixel at index `i-1` in the *input* grid is white (0).
        ii. If both conditions are true (segment is preceded by white): Place three pixels of color `C` into the output grid starting at index `i-1`.
        iii. If either condition is false (segment is at the start of the grid or preceded by a non-white pixel): Place one pixel of color `C` into the output grid at index `i`. (Based on inference, needs confirmation if such cases appear).
        iv. Advance the main iteration index `i` by 1.
    d.  If the length `L` is neither 1 nor 3:
        i. Copy the `L` pixels of color `C` into the output grid starting at index `i`. (Default behavior assumption).
        ii. Advance the main iteration index `i` by `L`.
    e. Continue the loop from the new index `i`.
4.  If the pixel at index `i` is white, or if it was part of a segment already processed, advance the index `i` by 1 and continue the loop.
5.  After iterating through all columns of the input grid, return the constructed output grid.
