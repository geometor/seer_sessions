"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on the length and context of contiguous non-white segments.
Segments of length 3 are copied directly to the output at the same starting position.
Segments of length 1 are transformed into segments of length 3 in the output.
The starting position of this transformed length-3 segment depends on the pixel preceding the original length-1 segment in the input:
 - If the preceding pixel is white (0), the output segment starts one position to the left (index - 1).
 - Otherwise (at the beginning of the grid or preceded by a non-white pixel), the output segment starts at the original position (index).
White pixels (0) act as background and separators. Segments with lengths other than 1 or 3 are copied directly (inferred behavior).
The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.
