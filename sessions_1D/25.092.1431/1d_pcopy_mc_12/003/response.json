Segments with lengths other than 1 or 3 are copied directly (inferred behavior).\nThe output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_segment(row, start_index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the color and length of a contiguous segment of the same non-white color.\n\n    Args:\n        row (np.array): The 1D input array.\n        start_index (int): The starting index to check for a segment.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (color, length) of the segment, or (None, 0) if the pixel at start_index is white (0).\n    \"\"\"\n    if start_index >= len(row) or row[start_index] == 0:\n        return None, 0  # It's a background pixel or out of bounds\n\n    color = row[start_index]\n    length = 0\n    for i in range(start_index, len(row)):\n        if row[i] == color:\n            length += 1\n        else:\n            break # Segment ended\n    return color, length\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the segment transformation based on length and context.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid (expected to be 1xN).\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a numpy array and extract the first (and only) row\n    if isinstance(input_grid, list):\n        input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    if input_grid.ndim == 0: # Handle scalar case if needed, although ARC grids are >= 1x1\n        return [[int(input_grid)]] # Return as 1x1 grid list\n    if input_grid.ndim == 1: # Handle case where input is already 1D array\n         input_row = input_grid\n    elif input_grid.shape[0] > 0:\n         input_row = input_grid[0]\n    else: # Handle empty input grid case\n         return [[]]\n\n    height = 1\n    width = len(input_row)\n\n    # Initialize output_row with the same dimensions, filled with white (0)\n    output_row = np.zeros(width, dtype=int)\n\n    # Iterate through the input row\n    i = 0\n    while i < width:\n        # Check the current pixel\n        current_pixel_color = input_row[i]\n\n        if current_pixel_color == 0:\n            # If it's background, just move to the next pixel\n            i += 1\n            continue\n\n        # If it's not background, find the segment starting here\n        color, length = find_segment(input_row, i)\n\n        if color is not None: # Found a non-white segment\n            if length == 3:\n                # Copy segment of length 3 directly\n                start_write_index = i\n                for j in range(length):\n                    write_pos = start_write_index + j\n                    if write_pos < width: # Boundary check\n                        output_row[write_pos] = color\n                # Advance index past this segment\n                i += length\n            elif length == 1:\n                # Process segment of length 1\n                # Check the preceding pixel in the input grid\n                preceded_by_white = (i > 0 and input_row[i - 1] == 0)\n\n                if preceded_by_white:\n                    # Expand to length 3, starting one position left\n                    start_write_index = i - 1\n                else:\n                    # Expand to length 3, starting at the current position\n                    # Based on re-analysis: examples show ALL length 1 segments become length 3.\n                    # The shift left happens ONLY if preceded by white.\n                    # Let's refine this: If not preceded by white OR at index 0, where should it start?\n                    # The failed tests indicate the initial code was placing them at index `i`.\n                    # The successful analysis indicates they should be placed at `i-1` *if* preceded by white.\n                    # The logical opposite is: if i==0 OR input_row[i-1] != 0, place the 3 blocks starting at `i`.\n                    # Let's confirm example 2: input[1]=1, input[0]=0 -> preceded by white -> output starts at 0?
