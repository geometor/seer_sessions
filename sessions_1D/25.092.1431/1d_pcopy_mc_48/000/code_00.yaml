grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0  # white
  - dimensions_preserved: True

elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

objects:
  - type: dot
    definition: A single non-white pixel with no horizontal neighbors of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: C (non-white)
      - position: (r, c)
  - type: h_line_3
    definition: A horizontal sequence of exactly 3 contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: C (non-white)
      - position: spans from (r, c) to (r, c+2)

transformations:
  - object: dot
    action: expand_horizontally
    details: Replace the dot at (r, c) with a horizontal line of the same color, spanning columns c-1, c, and c+1 (within grid bounds) on the same row r.
  - object: h_line_3
    action: copy
    details: Keep the line unchanged in the output grid at the same position and with the same color.
  - object: background / other pixels
    action: copy
    details: Keep white pixels and any other non-white pixels not matching 'dot' or 'h_line_3' definitions unchanged.

processing_order:
  - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - Identify all 'dots' in the input grid.
  - For each identified 'dot' at input position (r, c) with color C:
      - Modify the output grid by setting pixels (r, c-1), (r, c), and (r, c+1) to color C, ensuring column indices stay within grid boundaries.
