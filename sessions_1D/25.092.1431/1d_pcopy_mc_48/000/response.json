The background is white (0) and remains unchanged.\nThe task involves identifying specific patterns of colored pixels in the input and modifying them in the output.\nTwo types of patterns are relevant:\n1.  Single, isolated colored pixels (dots).\n2.  Horizontal lines consisting of exactly three consecutive pixels of the same color.\n\nObservations across examples:\n-   Horizontal lines of length 3 present in the input are preserved in the output at the same location and with the same color. (e.g., `777` in train_1, `666` in train_2, `111` in train_3).\n-   Single colored pixels (dots) in the input are transformed into horizontal lines of length 3 in the output. The line has the same color as the original dot and is centered horizontally at the column where the dot was located. (e.g., the magenta `6` at col 7 in train_1 becomes `666` at cols 6, 7, 8; the green `3` at col 6 in train_2 becomes `333` at cols 5, 6, 7; the azure `8` at col 8 in train_3 becomes `888` at cols 7, 8, 9).\n-   The transformations seem to happen independently for each identified pattern. The row of the transformation is the same as the row of the original pattern.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
