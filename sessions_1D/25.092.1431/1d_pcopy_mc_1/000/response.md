**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 1D sequence of pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The core operation identifies specific patterns within the sequence and replaces them. The background color is white (0). The transformation focuses on isolated non-white pixels, specifically those flanked immediately by white pixels on both sides. When such a pattern is found, the isolated pixel's color "expands" to fill the triplet. Existing blocks of non-white colors remain unchanged. All three examples consistently follow this rule when treated as 1D sequences, despite the sequence length (33) potentially suggesting a 2D grid (e.g., 3x11 or 11x3). The 1D interpretation provides the simplest and most consistent explanation across the examples.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_domain: sequence transformation
input_data: sequence of integers (0-9) representing pixel colors
output_data: sequence of integers (0-9) representing pixel colors
data_dimensionality: 1D sequence (though potentially representable as 2D)
background_color_code: 0
foreground_color_codes: 1-9
objects_of_interest:
  - type: isolated_colored_pixel
    definition: A non-zero pixel C located at index `i` such that the pixel at `i-1` is 0 and the pixel at `i+1` is 0.
    pattern: [0, C, 0] where C != 0
  - type: contiguous_colored_block
    definition: A sequence of two or more identical non-zero pixels.
    example: [3, 3, 3] or [6, 6, 6]
transformation_rule:
  - type: pattern_replacement
    input_pattern: [0, C, 0] (where C is any color 1-9)
    output_pattern: [C, C, C] (using the same color C)
    scope: Applied wherever the input pattern occurs in the original sequence.
    behavior: Pixels not part of a matched `[0, C, 0]` pattern are copied directly from input to output. Matches are based on the original input sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization**: Create a new sequence, `output_sequence`, initially identical to the `input_sequence`.
2.  **Scan for Pattern**: Iterate through the `input_sequence` using an index `i`, examining triplets of pixels from index `i-1` to `i+1`. The loop should cover all possible center indices, so `i` ranges from 1 to `length - 2`.
3.  **Pattern Matching**: For each index `i`, check if the pixels in the `input_sequence` at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` match the pattern `[0, C, 0]`, where `C` is any non-zero color (`input_sequence[i-1] == 0` AND `input_sequence[i] != 0` AND `input_sequence[i+1] == 0`).
4.  **Transformation**: If the pattern is matched:
    a.  Identify the color `C = input_sequence[i]`.
    b.  Modify the `output_sequence` by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `C`. (`output_sequence[i-1] = C`, `output_
