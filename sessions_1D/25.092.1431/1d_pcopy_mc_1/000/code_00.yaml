task_domain: sequence transformation
input_data: sequence of integers (0-9) representing pixel colors
output_data: sequence of integers (0-9) representing pixel colors
data_dimensionality: 1D sequence (though potentially representable as 2D)
background_color_code: 0
foreground_color_codes: 1-9
objects_of_interest:
  - type: isolated_colored_pixel
    definition: A non-zero pixel C located at index `i` such that the pixel at `i-1` is 0 and the pixel at `i+1` is 0.
    pattern: [0, C, 0] where C != 0
  - type: contiguous_colored_block
    definition: A sequence of two or more identical non-zero pixels.
    example: [3, 3, 3] or [6, 6, 6]
transformation_rule:
  - type: pattern_replacement
    input_pattern: [0, C, 0] (where C is any color 1-9)
    output_pattern: [C, C, C] (using the same color C)
    scope: Applied wherever the input pattern occurs in the original sequence.
    behavior: Pixels not part of a matched `[0, C, 0]` pattern are copied directly from input to output. Matches are based on the original input sequence.
