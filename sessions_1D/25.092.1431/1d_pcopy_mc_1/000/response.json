The core operation identifies specific patterns within the sequence and replaces them. The background color is white (0). The transformation focuses on isolated non-white pixels, specifically those flanked immediately by white pixels on both sides. When such a pattern is found, the isolated pixel's color \"expands\" to fill the triplet. Existing blocks of non-white colors remain unchanged. All three examples consistently follow this rule when treated as 1D sequences, despite the sequence length (33) potentially suggesting a 2D grid (e.g., 3x11 or 11x3). The 1D interpretation provides the simplest and most consistent explanation across the examples.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
