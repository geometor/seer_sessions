**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 1D sequence of pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The core operation identifies specific patterns within the sequence and replaces them. The background color is white (0). The transformation focuses on isolated non-white pixels, specifically those flanked immediately by white pixels on both sides. When such a pattern is found, the isolated pixel's color "expands" to fill the triplet. Existing blocks of non-white colors remain unchanged. All three examples consistently follow this rule when treated as 1D sequences, despite the sequence length (33) potentially suggesting a 2D grid (e.g., 3x11 or 11x3). The 1D interpretation provides the simplest and most consistent explanation across the examples.

**Facts:**

    definition: A non-zero pixel C located at index `i` such that the pixel at `i-1` is 0 and the pixel at `i+1` is 0.
    pattern: [0, C, 0] where C != 0
  - type: contiguous_colored_block
    definition: A sequence of two or more identical non-zero pixels.
    example: [3, 3, 3] or [6, 6, 6]

  - type: pattern_replacement
    input_pattern: [0, C, 0] (where C is any color 1-9)
    output_pattern: [C, C, C] (using the same color C)
    scope: Applied wherever the input pattern occurs in the original sequence.
    behavior: Pixels not part of a matched `[0, C, 0]` pattern are copied directly from input to output. Matches are based on the original input sequence.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization**: Create a new sequence, `output_sequence`, initially identical to the `input_sequence`.
2.  **Scan for Pattern**: Iterate through the `input_sequence` using an index `i`, examining triplets of pixels from index `i-1` to `i+1`. The loop should cover all possible center indices, so `i` ranges from 1 to `length - 2`.
3.  **Pattern Matching**: For each index `i`, check if the pixels in the `input_sequence` at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` match the pattern `[0, C, 0]`, where `C` is any non-zero color (`input_sequence[i-1] == 0` AND `input_sequence[i] != 0` AND `input_sequence[i+1] == 0`).
4.  **Transformation**: If the pattern is matched:
    a.  Identify the color `C = input_sequence[i]`.
    b.  Modify the `output_sequence` by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `C`. (`output_sequence[i-1] = C`, `output_

**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed to produce the correct transformations, yielding outputs identical to the inputs. The code's logic aimed to find `[0, C, 0]` patterns (where 0 is white and C is any other color) in the input sequence and replace them with `[C, C, C]` in the output. A detailed analysis of the input/output pairs confirms this transformation rule is correct when the data is treated as a 1D sequence.

The failure likely occurred because the transformation condition (`input_sequence[i-1] == 0 and input_sequence[i] != 0 and input_sequence[i+1] == 0`) was never met during execution. The most plausible explanation is an input type mismatch: the test environment might have passed the input as a raw string instead of a list of integers, causing the comparisons (`== 0`, `!= 0`) to fail.

The strategy is to refine the understanding and documentation, assuming the core logic is correct but emphasizing the 1D sequence nature and the specific pattern replacement. The implementation details regarding input parsing might need adjustment in the coder phase if the standard test harness doesn't automatically handle the conversion from the task's string format to a list of integers.

**Metrics:**

The analysis code executed confirms the following for each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Length: 33
    *   Patterns found: 2 (`[0, 2, 0]` at index 5, `[0, 7, 0]` at index 9)
    *   Transformations in Output: The output correctly shows `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0]` starting at index 5 and `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0]` starting at index 9 (relative to the original pattern locations).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Length: 33
    *   Patterns found: 3 (`[0, 5, 0]` at index 6, `[0, 8, 0]` at index 12, `[0, 2, 0]` at index 17)
    *   Transformations in Output: The output correctly reflects the `[C, C, C]` replacements for each identified pattern.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Length: 33
    *   Patterns found: 3 (`[0, 6, 0]` at index 8, `[0, 4, 0]` at index 14, `[0, 2, 0]` at index 18)
    *   Transformations in Output: The output correctly reflects the `[C, C, C]` replacements for each identified pattern.

Across all examples, the data is consistently treated as a 1D sequence of length 33. The transformation rule is applied wherever a non-white pixel is surrounded by white pixels in the original input sequence. Existing blocks of contiguous non-white pixels are unaffected.

**Facts:**

  effect: Replaces the `[0, C, 0]` triplet in the output sequence corresponding to the matched location in the input.
unaffected_elements:
  - white pixels not part of a matched `[0, C, 0]` pattern.
  - colored_block objects.
  - non-white pixels adjacent to other non-white pixels (unless they are the center of a `[0,C,0]` that gets overwritten). # Example: `[0,3,3,3,0]` - the 3s are untouched.
processing_mode: Iterative scan over the input sequence, checking for the pattern at each possible center position. Transformations are based solely on the original input state.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize**: Create an `output_sequence` as a direct copy of the `input_sequence`.
2.  **Iterate**: Scan through the `input_sequence` by examining each possible index `i` that can serve as the center of a three-pixel triplet (i.e., from index 1 up to length - 2).
3.  **Identify Pattern**: At each index `i`, check if the pixels in the *original* `input_sequence` at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` form the pattern `[white, C, white]`, which means:
    *   `input_sequence[i-1]` is white (0).
    *   `input_sequence[i]` is a non-white color (`C`, where `C` is 1-9).
    *   `input_sequence[i+1]` is white (0).
4.  **Apply Transformation**: If the pattern is found:
    *   Retrieve the non-white color `C` from `input_sequence[i]`.
    *   Modify the `output_sequence` by setting the values at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `C`.
5.  **Finalize**: After checking all possible triplets in the input sequence, return the modified `output_sequence`. Pixels that were not part of a detected `[white, C, white]` pattern in the input remain unchanged in the output (due to the initial copy).
