            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code failed to produce the correct transformations, yielding outputs identical to the inputs. The code's logic aimed to find `[0, C, 0]` patterns (where 0 is white and C is any other color) in the input sequence and replace them with `[C, C, C]` in the output. A detailed analysis of the input/output pairs confirms this transformation rule is correct when the data is treated as a 1D sequence.\n\nThe failure likely occurred because the transformation condition (`input_sequence[i-1] == 0 and input_sequence[i] != 0 and input_sequence[i+1] == 0`) was never met during execution. The most plausible explanation is an input type mismatch: the test environment might have passed the input as a raw string instead of a list of integers, causing the comparisons (`== 0`, `!= 0`) to fail.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the understanding and documentation, assuming the core logic is correct but emphasizing the 1D sequence nature and the specific pattern replacement. The implementation details regarding input parsing might need adjustment in the coder phase if the standard test harness doesn't automatically handle the conversion from the task's string format to a list of integers.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe analysis code executed confirms the following for each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Length: 33\n    *   Patterns found: 2 (`[0, 2, 0]` at index 5, `[0, 7, 0]` at index 9)\n    *   Transformations in Output: The output correctly shows `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0]` starting at index 5 and `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0]` starting at index 9 (relative to the original pattern locations).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Length: 33\n    *   Patterns found: 3 (`[0, 5, 0]` at index 6, `[0, 8, 0]` at index 12, `[0, 2, 0]` at index 17)\n    *   Transformations in Output: The output correctly reflects the `[C, C, C]` replacements for each identified pattern.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Length: 33\n    *   Patterns found: 3 (`[0, 6, 0]` at index 8, `[0, 4, 0]` at index 14, `[0, 2, 0]` at index 18)\n    *   Transformations in Output: The output correctly reflects the `[C, C, C]` replacements for each identified pattern.\n\nAcross all examples, the data is consistently treated as a 1D sequence of length 33. The transformation rule is applied wherever a non-white pixel is surrounded by white pixels in the original input sequence. Existing blocks of contiguous non-white pixels are unaffected.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
