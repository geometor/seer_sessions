import copy

"""
Transform a 1D sequence of pixels based on a local pattern.
Identify triplets of pixels in the input sequence matching the pattern [0, C, 0], 
where C is any non-zero color (1-9) and 0 is the background color.
For each matched pattern, replace the triplet [0, C, 0] in the output sequence 
with [C, C, C], using the color C found in the middle of the input pattern.
Pixels not part of such a matched pattern remain unchanged in the output.
The transformation is applied based on the original input sequence.

    Args:
        input_sequence: A list of integers representing the 1D pixel sequence.

    Returns:
        A list of integers representing the transformed 1D pixel sequence.
