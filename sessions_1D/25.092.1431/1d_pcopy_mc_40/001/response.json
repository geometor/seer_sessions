Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n2. Scan the input grid row from left to right to identify contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of non-white pixels. Record the color, starting position, and length of each object.\n3. For each identified object:\n    a. If the object's length is 3, copy this object (same color, length, and position) directly onto the output grid.\n    b. If the object's length is 1:\n        i. Determine the object's color and its single pixel position (index `i`).\n        ii. Place a segment of the same color with length 3 onto the output grid, such that it occupies the positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`. Ensure this placement stays within the grid boundaries.\n4. The final state of the output grid represents the result.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(row: np.ndarray) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous segments of non-zero pixels in a 1D numpy array.\n\n    Args:\n        row: A 1D numpy array representing a grid row.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, where each tuple represents an object\n        (color, start_index, length).\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    current_object_color = 0\n    current_object_start = -1\n    current_object_length = 0\n\n    for i, pixel_color in enumerate(row):\n        if pixel_color != 0:\n            # Pixel is part of an object\n            if current_object_length == 0:\n                # Start of a new object\n                current_object_color = pixel_color\n                current_object_start = i\n                current_object_length = 1\n            elif pixel_color == current_object_color:\n                # Continuation of the current object\n                current_object_length += 1\n            else:\n                # End of the previous object (different color)\n                objects.append((current_object_color, current_object_start, current_object_length))\n                # Start of a new object\n                current_object_color = pixel_color\n                current_object_start = i\n                current_object_length = 1\n        else:\n            # Pixel is background (0)\n            if current_object_length > 0:\n                # End of the previous object\n                objects.append((current_object_color, current_object_start, current_object_length))\n                current_object_color = 0\n                current_object_start = -1\n                current_object_length = 0\n\n    # Check if an object extends to the end of the row\n    if current_object_length > 0:\n        objects.append((current_object_color, current_object_start, current_object_length))\n\n    return objects\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the identified rules:\n    - Objects of length 3 are copied.\n    - Objects of length 1 are expanded to length 3, centered at the original position.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Assuming input is always a single row based on examples\n    if input_np.shape[0] != 1:\n        # Handle potential multi-row cases if needed, but examples are 1D\n        # For now, we'll focus on the 1xN case.\n        # Consider raising an error or adapting logic if multi-row inputs are expected.\n        pass # Sticking to the 1xN assumption derived from examples\n\n    input_row = input_np[0]\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # Initialize output grid with background color (0)\n    output_np = np.zeros_like(input_np)\n    output_row = output_np[0]\n\n    # Find all non-background objects in the input row\n    objects = find_objects(input_row)\n\n    # Process each found object\n    for color, start, length in objects:\n        if length == 3:\n            # Copy object of length 3 directly\n            # Ensure indices are within bounds (though start+3 should be safe if object was found)\n            end = min(start + length, width)\n            output_row[start:end] = color\n        elif length == 1:\n            # Expand object of length 1 to length 3\n            center = start\n            target_start = center - 1\n            target_end = center + 2 # Exclusive end index for slicing\n\n            # Clip target indices to grid boundaries\n            actual_start = max(0, target_start)\n            actual_end = min(width, target_end)\n\n            # Place the expanded object\n            output_row[actual_start:actual_end] = color\n        # else: # Handle other lengths if necessary, based on task constraints\n            # According to examples, only lengths 1 and 3 occur in input.\n            # Objects of other lengths would presumably be copied or ignored.\n            # Copying seems more likely based on length 3 behavior.\n            # If a length 2 object appeared, copying seems the default:\n            # end = min(start + length, width)\n            # output_row[start:end] = color\n            # However, sticking strictly to observed rules for now.\n\n\n    # Convert the result back to a list of lists\n    output_grid = output_np.tolist()\n    return output_grid\n\n```"
