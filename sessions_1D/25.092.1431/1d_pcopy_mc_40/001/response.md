Transformation Rule Description:

1. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2. Scan the input grid row from left to right to identify contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of non-white pixels. Record the color, starting position, and length of each object.
3. For each identified object:
    a. If the object's length is 3, copy this object (same color, length, and position) directly onto the output grid.
    b. If the object's length is 1:
        i. Determine the object's color and its single pixel position (index `i`).
        ii. Place a segment of the same color with length 3 onto the output grid, such that it occupies the positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`. Ensure this placement stays within the grid boundaries.
4. The final state of the output grid represents the result.
