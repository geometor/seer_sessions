task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 2D with height 1)
color_palette: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon] # 0-9

elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    properties:
      - shape: horizontal segment
      - color: any non-white color
      - length: variable (observed lengths: 1 or 3 in input)
      - position: starting column index

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: objects are separated by one or more white pixels.
  - type: identity
    condition: input object length is 3
    effect: object properties (color, length, position) are preserved in the output.
  - type: transformation
    condition: input object length is 1
    effect:
      - object length becomes 3 in the output.
      - object color is preserved.
      - object position shifts: the original pixel becomes the center of the new 3-pixel segment (start index shifts left by 1).

actions:
  - identify_objects: find contiguous segments of non-white pixels in the input row.
  - check_length: determine the length of each identified object.
  - apply_transformation:
      - if length is 3, copy the object to the output at the same location.
      - if length is 1, create a new object of the same color but length 3, centered at the original pixel's position, in the output.
  - maintain_background: ensure pixels not part of input or transformed objects are white in the output.
