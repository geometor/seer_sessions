The transformation appears to operate on contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of non-white pixels. There seem to be two types of objects based on their length in the input: those with length 3 and those with length 1. Objects with length 3 in the input remain unchanged in the output. Objects with length 1 in the input are expanded to length 3 in the output, maintaining their original color. This expansion occurs symmetrically around the original pixel's position, meaning the original pixel becomes the center of the new 3-pixel segment. Consequently, the start position of these expanded segments shifts one position to the left compared to the original single pixel's position. The background white pixels remain white unless overwritten by an expanded segment.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Place a segment of the same color with length 3 onto the output grid, such that it occupies the positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`. Ensure this placement stays within the grid boundaries (although not strictly necessary based on examples, it's good practice).\n4.  The final state of the output grid represents the result."
