Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input and output are both single-row grids. The transformation appears to operate on contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of non-white pixels. There seem to be two types of objects based on their length in the input: those with length 3 and those with length 1. Objects with length 3 in the input remain unchanged in the output. Objects with length 1 in the input are expanded to length 3 in the output, maintaining their original color. This expansion occurs symmetrically around the original pixel's position, meaning the original pixel becomes the center of the new 3-pixel segment. Consequently, the start position of these expanded segments shifts one position to the left compared to the original single pixel's position. The background white pixels remain white unless overwritten by an expanded segment.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 2D with height 1)
color_palette: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon] # 0-9

elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    properties:
      - shape: horizontal segment
      - color: any non-white color
      - length: variable (observed lengths: 1 or 3 in input)
      - position: starting column index

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: objects are separated by one or more white pixels.
  - type: identity
    condition: input object length is 3
    effect: object properties (color, length, position) are preserved in the output.
  - type: transformation
    condition: input object length is 1
    effect:
      - object length becomes 3 in the output.
      - object color is preserved.
      - object position shifts: the original pixel becomes the center of the new 3-pixel segment (start index shifts left by 1).

actions:
  - identify_objects: find contiguous segments of non-white pixels in the input row.
  - check_length: determine the length of each identified object.
  - apply_transformation:
      - if length is 3, copy the object to the output at the same location.
      - if length is 1, create a new object of the same color but length 3, centered at the original pixel's position, in the output.
  - maintain_background: ensure pixels not part of input or transformed objects are white in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white).
2.  Scan the input grid row from left to right to identify contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of non-white pixels. Record the color, starting position, and length of each object.
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  If the object's length is 3, copy this object (same color, length, and position) directly onto the output grid.
    b.  If the object's length is 1:
        i.  Determine the object's color and its single pixel position (index `i`).
        ii. Place a segment of the same color with length 3 onto the output grid, such that it occupies the positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`. Ensure this placement stays within the grid boundaries (although not strictly necessary based on examples, it's good practice).
4.  The final state of the output grid represents the result.
