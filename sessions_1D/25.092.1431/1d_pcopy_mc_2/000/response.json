In the inputs, these objects appear either as single isolated pixels or as horizontal lines of three contiguous pixels.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation seems to involve the single, isolated colored pixels. These isolated pixels expand horizontally into lines of three pixels of the same color in the output. The expansion is centered on the original pixel's position. Existing lines of three colored pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output. White pixels remain white unless they are adjacent to an isolated colored pixel being expanded.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel of the input grid from left to right, keeping track of its index (position).\n3.  For the current pixel at index `i`:\n    a.  Get its color `C`.\n    b.  Copy the color `C` to the output grid at the same index `i`.\n    c.  Check if the color `C` is non-white (not 0).\n    d.  If `C` is non-white, check the color of the pixel immediately to its left (at index `i-1`) and the pixel immediately to its right (at index `i+1`) in the *input* grid.

If the current pixel `C` is non-white AND it has a left neighbor AND that left neighbor is white (0) in the input grid AND it has a right neighbor AND that right neighbor is white (0) in the input grid:\n        i.
