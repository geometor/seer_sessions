task_description: Expand isolated non-white pixels into horizontal lines of three.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white color (1-9)
      - shape:
          - single isolated pixel (surrounded horizontally by white)
          - horizontal line of 3 pixels
actions:
  - name: expand_pixel
    target: single isolated non-white pixel
    result: Creates a horizontal line of 3 pixels of the same color, centered on the original pixel's location. The original pixel remains, and its immediate left and right white neighbors are changed to its color.
  - name: copy_pixel
    target:
      - white pixels (0)
      - non-white pixels that are part of a 3-pixel horizontal line in the input
    result: The pixel's color and position are copied unchanged to the output.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    direction: horizontal (left/right neighbors)
    relevance: Determines if a non-white pixel is isolated (both horizontal neighbors are white).
constraints:
  - Expansion only occurs if a non-white pixel has white pixels on both its immediate left and right sides.
  - Existing horizontal lines of 3 non-white pixels are preserved.
