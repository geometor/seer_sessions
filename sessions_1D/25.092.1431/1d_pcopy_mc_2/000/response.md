Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure**: Both input and output are 1-dimensional grids (represented as single rows).
2.  **Colors**: The grids use white (0) as the background and various other colors (gray-5, magenta-6, yellow-4, green-3, azure-8).
3.  **Objects**: The non-white pixels can be considered objects. In the inputs, these objects appear either as single isolated pixels or as horizontal lines of three contiguous pixels.
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation seems to involve the single, isolated colored pixels. These isolated pixels expand horizontally into lines of three pixels of the same color in the output. The expansion is centered on the original pixel's position. Existing lines of three colored pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output. White pixels remain white unless they are adjacent to an isolated colored pixel being expanded.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Expand isolated non-white pixels into horizontal lines of three.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white color (1-9)
      - shape:
          - single isolated pixel (surrounded horizontally by white)
          - horizontal line of 3 pixels
actions:
  - name: expand_pixel
    target: single isolated non-white pixel
    result: Creates a horizontal line of 3 pixels of the same color, centered on the original pixel's location. The original pixel remains, and its immediate left and right white neighbors are changed to its color.
  - name: copy_pixel
    target:
      - white pixels (0)
      - non-white pixels that are part of a 3-pixel horizontal line in the input
    result: The pixel's color and position are copied unchanged to the output.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    direction: horizontal (left/right neighbors)
    relevance: Determines if a non-white pixel is isolated (both horizontal neighbors are white).
constraints:
  - Expansion only occurs if a non-white pixel has white pixels on both its immediate left and right sides.
  - Existing horizontal lines of 3 non-white pixels are preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid from left to right, keeping track of its index (position).
3.  For the current pixel at index `i`:
    a.  Get its color `C`.
    b.  Copy the color `C` to the output grid at the same index `i`.
    c.  Check if the color `C` is non-white (not 0).
    d.  If `C` is non-white, check the color of the pixel immediately to its left (at index `i-1`) and the pixel immediately to its right (at index `i+1`) in the *input* grid. (Handle boundary conditions: if `i` is 0, there is no left neighbor; if `i` is the last index, there is no right neighbor).
    e.  If the current pixel `C` is non-white AND it has a left neighbor AND that left neighbor is white (0) in the input grid AND it has a right neighbor AND that right neighbor is white (0) in the input grid:
        i.  Change the color of the pixel at index `i-1` in the *output* grid to `C`.
        ii. Change the color of the pixel at index `i+1` in the *output* grid to `C`.
4.  After iterating through all input pixels, the output grid contains the transformed result.
