Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (single row)
  Background: white (0)
Objects:
  Definition: Contiguous horizontal sequences of non-white pixels.
  Properties:
    - Color: The specific non-white value (1-9).
    - Length: The number of contiguous pixels in the sequence.
    - Position: Start index within the row.
Separators:
  Definition: Sequences of one or more white pixels (0).
Transformation:
  Action: Modify object length based on a condition.
  Condition: Check the length of each non-white object.
  Rule:
    - If Object.Length < 3:
        Action: Extend the object to Length = 3.
        Mechanism: Repeat the object's Color to the right, starting from its original position, for a total of 3 pixels. Overwrite existing pixels if necessary.
    - If Object.Length >= 3:
        Action: Keep the object unchanged.
Relationships:
  - Objects are separated by white pixels.
  - The transformation preserves the relative order of objects.
  - The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.
