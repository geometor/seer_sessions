            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples operate on single-row grids (1xN).\n2.  **Color Usage:** The grids use white (0) as a background/separator and various other colors (red, azure, gray, yellow, blue, green, magenta) to form segments.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** The input grids contain contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels separated by one or more white pixels. These segments vary in length.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids retain the same overall structure and colors as the input, but the lengths of some non-white segments are modified.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** By comparing input and output pairs:\n    *   Segments that are already 3 pixels long in the input remain unchanged in the output (e.g., `2 2 2` in train_1, `1 1 1` in train_2, `3 3 3` in train_3).\n    *   Segments that are 1 pixel long in the input are extended to 3 pixels long in the output by repeating the original color (e.g., `8` -> `8 8 8`, `5` -> `5 5 5`, `4` -> `4 4 4` in train_1; `5` -> `5 5 5` in train_2; `6` -> `6 6 6`, `1` -> `1 1 1` in train_3).\n    *   The extension occurs to the right of the original pixel, potentially overwriting background white pixels.\n    *   The relative order and colors of the segments are preserved.\n    *   White pixels acting as separators are preserved unless they are replaced by the extension of a segment.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
