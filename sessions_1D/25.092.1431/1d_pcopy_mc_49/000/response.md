Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples operate on single-row grids (1xN).
2.  **Color Usage:** The grids use white (0) as a background/separator and various other colors (red, azure, gray, yellow, blue, green, magenta) to form segments.
3.  **Input Pattern:** The input grids contain contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels separated by one or more white pixels. These segments vary in length.
4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids retain the same overall structure and colors as the input, but the lengths of some non-white segments are modified.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** By comparing input and output pairs:
    *   Segments that are already 3 pixels long in the input remain unchanged in the output (e.g., `2 2 2` in train_1, `1 1 1` in train_2, `3 3 3` in train_3).
    *   Segments that are 1 pixel long in the input are extended to 3 pixels long in the output by repeating the original color (e.g., `8` -> `8 8 8`, `5` -> `5 5 5`, `4` -> `4 4 4` in train_1; `5` -> `5 5 5` in train_2; `6` -> `6 6 6`, `1` -> `1 1 1` in train_3).
    *   The extension occurs to the right of the original pixel, potentially overwriting background white pixels.
    *   The relative order and colors of the segments are preserved.
    *   White pixels acting as separators are preserved unless they are replaced by the extension of a segment.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D Array (single row)
  Background: white (0)
Objects:
  Definition: Contiguous horizontal sequences of non-white pixels.
  Properties:
    - Color: The specific non-white value (1-9).
    - Length: The number of contiguous pixels in the sequence.
    - Position: Start index within the row.
Separators:
  Definition: Sequences of one or more white pixels (0).
Transformation:
  Action: Modify object length based on a condition.
  Condition: Check the length of each non-white object.
  Rule:
    - If Object.Length < 3:
        Action: Extend the object to Length = 3.
        Mechanism: Repeat the object's Color to the right, starting from its original position, for a total of 3 pixels. Overwrite existing pixels if necessary.
    - If Object.Length >= 3:
        Action: Keep the object unchanged.
Relationships:
  - Objects are separated by white pixels.
  - The transformation preserves the relative order of objects.
  - The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty output row with the same length as the input row, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through the input row from left to right, keeping track of the current position (index).
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy it to the corresponding position in the output row and move to the next pixel.
4.  If the current pixel is non-white:
    a.  Identify the color and the full extent (length) of the contiguous non-white segment starting at the current position.
    b.  Check the length of this segment.
    c.  If the length is less than 3:
        i.  Write the segment's color into the output row starting at the current position, repeated 3 times.
        ii. Advance the main iteration index past the original segment's position in the input (by its original length). Skip processing the pixels that were part of this original segment as they've been handled. Note that the output pointer implicitly advances by 3.
    d.  If the length is 3 or greater:
        i.  Copy the entire original segment (all its pixels) to the corresponding positions in the output row.
        ii. Advance the main iteration index past the end of this segment in the input.
5.  Continue iterating until the end of the input row is processed.
6.  Return the completed output row.
