## Perception

The task operates on single-row grids. The core transformation involves identifying specific patterns of pixels and modifying them. The key pattern is a single non-white pixel horizontally surrounded by two white pixels (`0 C 0`). When this pattern is detected in the input, it is replaced by a block of three pixels of that same non-white color (`C C C`) in the output. Existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels (`C C C`) in the input are preserved in the output. All other pixels, primarily the white background, remain unchanged unless they are part of the `0 C 0` pattern being replaced. The transformation seems local, focusing on 3-pixel wide neighborhoods.

## Facts


```yaml
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (effectively, operates on a single row)
  height: 1
  width: variable (e.g., 32 in examples)
  input_output_size_relation: output width is identical to input width

pixel_colors:
  - background: 0 (white)
  - active_colors: 1-9 (non-white colors involved in patterns)

identified_patterns:
  - pattern_name: isolated_single
    structure: A sequence of three pixels `[P1, P2, P3]` where P1 is white (0), P2 is non-white (C), and P3 is white (0).
    location: Occurs at indices `[i-1, i, i+1]` in the input row.
  - pattern_name: solid_triplet
    structure: A sequence of three pixels `[P1, P2, P3]` where P1, P2, and P3 are the same non-white color (C).
    location: Occurs at indices `[j, j+1, j+2]` in the input row.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: expansion
    input_pattern: isolated_single (0, C, 0) at indices `[i-1, i, i+1]`
    output_pattern: solid_triplet (C, C, C) at indices `[i-1, i, i+1]`
    condition: Applies when the isolated_single pattern is found in the input.
  - rule: preservation
    input_elements: All pixels not part of an 'isolated_single' pattern detected in the input.
    output_elements: Copied directly from the input to the output at the same position.
    effect: This implicitly preserves existing 'solid_triplet' patterns and background pixels not overwritten by the 'expansion' rule.

processing_flow:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Iterate through the input grid, checking for the 'isolated_single' pattern `(0, C, 0)` at each possible center position `i` (from index 1 to width-2).
  - step: If the 'isolated_single' pattern is found at input indices `[i-1, i, i+1]`, modify the output grid at indices `[i-1, i, i+1]` to `(C, C, C)`.
  - step: The final state of the output grid after checking all positions is the result.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid, `output_grid`, identical in size and content to the `input_grid`.
2.  Iterate through the `input_grid` row, focusing on each pixel from the second position (index 1) to the second-to-last position (index `width - 2`). Let the index of the current central pixel be `i`.
3.  For each central pixel at index `i`, examine the triplet of pixels in the `input_grid` at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
4.  Check if this triplet matches the pattern: `white`, `non-white color C`, `white` (i.e., `input_grid[i-1] == 0`, `input_grid[i] == C` where `C != 0`, and `input_grid[i+1] == 0`).
5.  If the pattern is matched, update the `output_grid` by setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `C` identified in the pattern.
6.  Continue this process for all possible central positions `i`.
7.  The final `output_grid` is the result of the transformation.

## General Assessment

The previous transformation logic, based on identifying a `white, non-white, white` (0 C 0) pattern and replacing it with `C C C`, failed to produce the correct outputs for the training examples. The execution results indicated that the provided code returned the input grid unchanged, despite the logic appearing to correctly identify and modify based on the `0 C 0` pattern during manual tracing.

This discrepancy suggests either:
1.  A subtle error in the previous code or its execution environment led to the modifications not being applied or reflected correctly.
2.  The initial perception of the pattern was incorrect.

Re-examining the examples strongly supports the second point. The transformation consistently occurs where a non-white pixel `C` is surrounded by *two* white pixels on each side (`0 0 C 0 0`). The transformation replaces the central `0 C 0` sequence with `C C C`, resulting in `0 C C C 0`. This refined understanding perfectly matches all training examples.

The strategy is to update the analysis and transformation description based on this `0 0 C 0 0` pattern.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the occurrence of the `0 0 C 0 0` pattern in the inputs and the corresponding `0 C C C 0` pattern in the outputs.

## Facts


```yaml
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (effectively, operates on a single row)
  height: 1
  width: variable (e.g., 32 in examples)
  input_output_size_relation: output width is identical to input width

pixel_colors:
  - background: 0 (white)
  - active_colors: 1-9 (non-white colors involved in patterns)

identified_objects:
  - object_name: isolated_pixel_marker
    description: A non-white pixel 'C' surrounded by two white pixels on each side.
    structure: A sequence of five pixels `[P1, P2, P3, P4, P5]` where P1, P2, P4, P5 are white (0) and P3 is non-white (C). Represented as `(0, 0, C, 0, 0)`.
    location: Occurs at indices `[i-2, i-1, i, i+1, i+2]` in the input row.

  - object_name: solid_triplet
    description: A sequence of three pixels of the same non-white color 'C'.
    structure: `(C, C, C)` where C is not white (0).
    location: Can occur in input or output.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: expansion_from_marker
    input_pattern: `isolated_pixel_marker` `(0, 0, C, 0, 0)` centered at index `i` in the input.
    output_pattern: Replaces the central three pixels `(0, C, 0)` at input indices `[i-1, i, i+1]` with `(C, C, C)` in the output at the same indices. The flanking white pixels at `i-2` and `i+2` remain white. The net effect transforms the 5-pixel input `(0, 0, C, 0, 0)` to the output `(0, C, C, C, 0)`.
    condition: Applies when the `isolated_pixel_marker` pattern is found in the input.

  - rule: preservation
    input_elements: All pixels not part of the central `(0, C, 0)` segment of an identified `isolated_pixel_marker`.
    output_elements: Copied directly from the input to the output at the same position unless overwritten by the `expansion_from_marker` rule.
    effect: This preserves existing `solid_triplet` patterns from the input unless they overlap with a transformation site (which doesn't occur in examples), and preserves background pixels not involved in the transformation.

processing_flow:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Iterate through the input grid row, checking for the `isolated_pixel_marker` pattern `(0, 0, C, 0, 0)` centered at each possible position `i` (from index 2 to width-3).
  - step: If the pattern is found centered at input index `i` with non-white color `C`:
      - Modify the output grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by setting them all to the color `C`.
  - step: The final state of the output grid after checking all positions is the result. Reads are always from the original input; writes are always to the output copy.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid, `output_grid`, which is an identical copy of the `input_grid`. Assume the grid has a single row.
2.  Let `input_row` be the single row from `input_grid` and `output_row` be the single row from `output_grid`. Let the width be `W`.
3.  Iterate through the `input_row`, examining 5-pixel sequences. Consider each index `i` from 2 up to `W-3` as the potential center of the pattern.
4.  For each index `i`, check if the pixels in the `input_row` at indices `[i-2, i-1, i, i+1, i+2]` match the pattern: `white, white, non-white color C, white, white` (i.e., `input_row[i-2]==0`, `input_row[i-1]==0`, `input_row[i]==C` where `C!=0`, `input_row[i+1]==0`, `input_row[i+2]==0`).
5.  If this 5-pixel pattern is matched in the `input_row`:
    a. Identify the non-white color `C` (which is `input_row[i]`).
    b. Modify the `output_row`: set the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to color `C`.
6.  After checking all possible center indices `i`, the `output_grid` (containing the modified `output_row`) is the final result.
