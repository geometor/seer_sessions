            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe primary issue identified is a mismatch between the expected input format (`list[list[int]]`) by the Python `transform` function and the format likely provided during the failed test execution. The error message `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists` confirms this. The core transformation logic, which identifies `white, non-white, white` sequences (`0 C 0`) and replaces them with `non-white, non-white, non-white` (`C C C`), appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Assume the standard ARC input format (`list[list[int]]`) will be used in subsequent executions.\n2.  Verify the transformation logic against the examples represented in the correct format.\n3.  Refine the documentation (YAML Facts and Natural Language Program) to clearly reflect the grid structure and the transformation rule operating on the single row within that structure.\n4.  The existing Python code already handles the `list[list[int]]` format and implements the correct logic, so it likely doesn't need changes, assuming the input format issue is resolved externally.\n\n## Metrics\n\nSince the code failed due to an input type error before processing could begin, no output metrics related to the transformation logic itself were generated. The crucial information is the input format discrepancy.\n\n**Re-parsed Example Data (Assuming `list[list[int]]` format):**\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Output: `[[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Identified Patterns in Input: `(0, 2, 0)` at index 8, `(0, 3, 0)` at index 13.\n    *   Transformations: `(0, 2, 0)` -> `(2, 2, 2)`, `(0, 3, 0)` -> `(3, 3, 3)`.\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Identified Patterns in Input: `(0, 8, 0)` at index 8, `(0, 4, 0)` at index 13.\n    *   Transformations: `(0, 8, 0)` -> `(8, 8, 8)`, `(0, 4, 0)` -> `(4, 4, 4)`.\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Output: `[[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Identified Patterns in Input: `(0, 4, 0)` at index 8, `(0, 9, 0)` at index 14.\n    *   Transformations: `(0, 4, 0)` -> `(4, 4, 4)`, `(0, 9, 0)` -> `(9, 9, 9)`.\n\nThe logic holds across all examples when assuming the correct input format.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
