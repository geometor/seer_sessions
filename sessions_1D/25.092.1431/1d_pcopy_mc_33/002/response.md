## General Assessment

The primary issue identified is a mismatch between the expected input format (`list[list[int]]`) by the Python `transform` function and the format likely provided during the failed test execution. The error message `TypeError: Input grid must be a list of lists` confirms this. The core transformation logic, which identifies `white, non-white, white` sequences (`0 C 0`) and replaces them with `non-white, non-white, non-white` (`C C C`), appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Assume the standard ARC input format (`list[list[int]]`) will be used in subsequent executions.
2.  Verify the transformation logic against the examples represented in the correct format.
3.  Refine the documentation (YAML Facts and Natural Language Program) to clearly reflect the grid structure and the transformation rule operating on the single row within that structure.
4.  The existing Python code already handles the `list[list[int]]` format and implements the correct logic, so it likely doesn't need changes, assuming the input format issue is resolved externally.

## Metrics

Since the code failed due to an input type error before processing could begin, no output metrics related to the transformation logic itself were generated. The crucial information is the input format discrepancy.

**Re-parsed Example Data (Assuming `list[list[int]]` format):**

*   **train_1:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Output: `[[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Identified Patterns in Input: `(0, 2, 0)` at index 8, `(0, 3, 0)` at index 13.
    *   Transformations: `(0, 2, 0)` -> `(2, 2, 2)`, `(0, 3, 0)` -> `(3, 3, 3)`.
*   **train_2:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Identified Patterns in Input: `(0, 8, 0)` at index 8, `(0, 4, 0)` at index 13.
    *   Transformations: `(0, 8, 0)` -> `(8, 8, 8)`, `(0, 4, 0)` -> `(4, 4, 4)`.
*   **train_3:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Output: `[[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Identified Patterns in Input: `(0, 4, 0)` at index 8, `(0, 9, 0)` at index 14.
    *   Transformations: `(0, 4, 0)` -> `(4, 4, 4)`, `(0, 9, 0)` -> `(9, 9, 9)`.

The logic holds across all examples when assuming the correct input format.

  output_dimensions: 1xN (same as input)
  input_output_size_relation: Identical dimensions.

  - object_name: isolated_pixel
    description: A single pixel of a non-white color C.
    pattern_context: Appears horizontally flanked by white pixels (0 C 0).
  - object_name: solid_triplet
    description: Three adjacent pixels of the same non-white color C (C C C).

transformations:
  - transformation_name: expand_isolated_pixel
    input_pattern: A triplet `(P1, P2, P3)` in the input grid's row where `P1=0`, `P2=C` (non-white), `P3=0`. Occurs at indices `(i-1, i, i+1)`.
    output_pattern: Replaces the corresponding triplet in the output grid's row with `(C, C, C)`.
    condition: Must identify the pattern in the original input grid.
  - transformation_name: preserve_pixels
    input_elements: Any pixel in the input grid's row that is *not* part of a detected `(0, C, 0)` input pattern (considering the central pixel C).
    output_elements: Copied directly to the same position in the output grid's row.
    effect: Preserves background pixels (unless overwritten by expansion) and existing solid_triplets.

processing_flow:
  - step: Define the input grid (a list containing one list/row of integers).
  - step: Create the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
  - step: Extract the single row from the input grid. Let its width be W.
  - step: Iterate through the input row using an index `i` from 1 to `W-2`.
  - step: At each index `i`, examine the input triplet `(input_row[i-1], input_row[i], input_row[i+1])`.
  - step: If the input triplet is `(0, C, 0)` where `C != 0`:
      - Modify the output grid's row at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to be `C`, `C`, `C`.
  - step: After iterating through all possible indices `i`, the modified output grid is the result.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels (represented as `[[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]`).
2.  Create a new output grid that is an identical copy of the input grid.
3.  Examine the single row within the *input* grid. Let the number of pixels (width) in the row be `W`.
4.  Iterate through the input row by looking at consecutive triplets of pixels. Consider each pixel from the second position (index 1) up to the second-to-last position (index `W-2`) as the center of a potential triplet.
5.  For each triplet centered at index `i` (i.e., pixels at `i-1`, `i`, `i+1` in the input row):
    a.  Check if the pixel at `i-1` is white (0).
    b.  Check if the pixel at `i` is non-white (let its color be `C`).
    c.  Check if the pixel at `i+1` is white (0).
6.  If all three conditions (5a, 5b, 5c) are true for the triplet in the *input* row, then modify the *output* grid's row: set the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to color `C`.
7.  After checking all possible triplets (from index 1 to `W-2`), the final state of the output grid is the result.
