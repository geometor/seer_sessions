```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a single-row grid by identifying pixels of a non-white color C that are horizontally surrounded by white pixels (0 C 0). 
Each such identified pattern (0 C 0) in the input is replaced in the output by a sequence of three pixels of color C (C C C). 
Pixels not involved in this specific replacement pattern are copied directly from the input to the output. Existing blocks of three identical non-white colors (e.g., D D D) are preserved unless they happen to overlap with a transformation site (which shouldn't happen based on the 0 C 0 trigger).
