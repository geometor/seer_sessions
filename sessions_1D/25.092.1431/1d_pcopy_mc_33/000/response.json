The key pattern is a single non-white pixel horizontally surrounded by two white pixels (`0 C 0`). When this pattern is detected in the input, it is replaced by a block of three pixels of that same non-white color (`C C C`) in the output. Existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels (`C C C`) in the input are preserved in the output. All other pixels, primarily the white background, remain unchanged unless they are part of the `0 C 0` pattern being replaced. The transformation seems local, focusing on 3-pixel wide neighborhoods.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
