## General Assessment

The previous transformation logic, based on identifying a `white, non-white, white` (0 C 0) pattern and replacing it with `C C C`, failed to produce the correct outputs for the training examples. The execution results indicated that the provided code returned the input grid unchanged, despite the logic appearing to correctly identify and modify based on the `0 C 0` pattern during manual tracing.

This discrepancy suggests either:
1.  A subtle error in the previous code or its execution environment led to the modifications not being applied or reflected correctly.
2.  The initial perception of the pattern was incorrect.

Re-examining the examples strongly supports the second point. The transformation consistently occurs where a non-white pixel `C` is surrounded by *two* white pixels on each side (`0 0 C 0 0`). The transformation replaces the central `0 C 0` sequence with `C C C`, resulting in `0 C C C 0`. This refined understanding perfectly matches all training examples.

The strategy is to update the analysis and transformation description based on this `0 0 C 0 0` pattern.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the occurrence of the `0 0 C 0 0` pattern in the inputs and the corresponding `0 C C C 0` pattern in the outputs.

## Facts


```yaml
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (effectively, operates on a single row)
  height: 1
  width: variable (e.g., 32 in examples)
  input_output_size_relation: output width is identical to input width

pixel_colors:
  - background: 0 (white)
  - active_colors: 1-9 (non-white colors involved in patterns)

identified_objects:
  - object_name: isolated_pixel_marker
    description: A non-white pixel 'C' surrounded by two white pixels on each side.
    structure: A sequence of five pixels `[P1, P2, P3, P4, P5]` where P1, P2, P4, P5 are white (0) and P3 is non-white (C). Represented as `(0, 0, C, 0, 0)`.
    location: Occurs at indices `[i-2, i-1, i, i+1, i+2]` in the input row.

  - object_name: solid_triplet
    description: A sequence of three pixels of the same non-white color 'C'.
    structure: `(C, C, C)` where C is not white (0).
    location: Can occur in input or output.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: expansion_from_marker
    input_pattern: `isolated_pixel_marker` `(0, 0, C, 0, 0)` centered at index `i` in the input.
    output_pattern: Replaces the central three pixels `(0, C, 0)` at input indices `[i-1, i, i+1]` with `(C, C, C)` in the output at the same indices. The flanking white pixels at `i-2` and `i+2` remain white. The net effect transforms the 5-pixel input `(0, 0, C, 0, 0)` to the output `(0, C, C, C, 0)`.
    condition: Applies when the `isolated_pixel_marker` pattern is found in the input.

  - rule: preservation
    input_elements: All pixels not part of the central `(0, C, 0)` segment of an identified `isolated_pixel_marker`.
    output_elements: Copied directly from the input to the output at the same position unless overwritten by the `expansion_from_marker` rule.
    effect: This preserves existing `solid_triplet` patterns from the input unless they overlap with a transformation site (which doesn't occur in examples), and preserves background pixels not involved in the transformation.

processing_flow:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Iterate through the input grid row, checking for the `isolated_pixel_marker` pattern `(0, 0, C, 0, 0)` centered at each possible position `i` (from index 2 to width-3).
  - step: If the pattern is found centered at input index `i` with non-white color `C`:
      - Modify the output grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by setting them all to the color `C`.
  - step: The final state of the output grid after checking all positions is the result. Reads are always from the original input; writes are always to the output copy.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid, `output_grid`, which is an identical copy of the `input_grid`. Assume the grid has a single row.
2.  Let `input_row` be the single row from `input_grid` and `output_row` be the single row from `output_grid`. Let the width be `W`.
3.  Iterate through the `input_row`, examining 5-pixel sequences. Consider each index `i` from 2 up to `W-3` as the potential center of the pattern.
4.  For each index `i`, check if the pixels in the `input_row` at indices `[i-2, i-1, i, i+1, i+2]` match the pattern: `white, white, non-white color C, white, white` (i.e., `input_row[i-2]==0`, `input_row[i-1]==0`, `input_row[i]==C` where `C!=0`, `input_row[i+1]==0`, `input_row[i+2]==0`).
5.  If this 5-pixel pattern is matched in the `input_row`:
    a. Identify the non-white color `C` (which is `input_row[i]`).
    b. Modify the `output_row`: set the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to color `C`.
6.  After checking all possible center indices `i`, the `output_grid` (containing the modified `output_row`) is the final result.
