```python
import copy

"""
Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels (represented as [[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]).
Create a new output grid that is an identical copy of the input grid.
Examine the single row within the *input* grid. Let the number of pixels (width) in the row be W.
Iterate through the input row by looking at consecutive triplets of pixels. Consider each pixel from the second position (index 1) up to the second-to-last position (index W-2) as the center of a potential triplet.
For each triplet centered at index i (i.e., pixels at i-1, i, i+1 in the input row):
    a. Check if the pixel at i-1 is white (0).
    b. Check if the pixel at i is non-white (let its color be C).
    c. Check if the pixel at i+1 is white (0).
If all three conditions (5a, 5b, 5c) are true for the triplet in the *input* row, then modify the *output* grid's row: set the pixels at indices i-1, i, and i+1 all to color C.
After checking all possible triplets (from index 1 to W-2), the final state of the output grid is the result.
