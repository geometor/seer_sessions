Let the number of pixels (width) in the row be W.\nIterate through the input row by looking at consecutive triplets of pixels. Consider each pixel from the second position (index 1) up to the second-to-last position (index W-2) as the center of a potential triplet.\nFor each triplet centered at index i (i.e., pixels at i-1, i, i+1 in the input row):\n    a. Check if the pixel at i-1 is white (0).\n    b. Check if the pixel at i is non-white (let its color be C).\n    c. Check if the pixel at i+1 is white (0).\nIf all three conditions (5a, 5b, 5c) are true for the triplet in the *input* row, then modify the *output* grid's row: set the pixels at indices i-1, i, and i+1 all to color C.\nAfter checking all possible triplets (from index 1 to W-2), the final state of the output grid is the result.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): A 2D list representing the input grid. \n                                     Expected to have only one row.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: A 2D list representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a list of lists and has at least one row\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or not input_grid or not all(isinstance(row, list) for row in input_grid):\n        # Handle error: Invalid input format\n        # Depending on expected behavior, could raise TypeError or return input unchanged/empty\n        print(\"Warning: Invalid input format.
