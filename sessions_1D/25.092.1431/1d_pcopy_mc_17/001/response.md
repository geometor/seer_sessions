```python
import copy

"""
Identifies isolated non-white pixels in a 1D grid (represented as a 1xN 2D list) 
and expands them into 3-pixel segments of the same color in the output grid. 
Existing non-isolated pixels or segments are preserved. Isolation is defined by 
having white (0) pixels on both immediate left and right sides (handling edge cases).
