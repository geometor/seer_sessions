Okay, let's analyze the provided example pair for task `train_1`.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color. Non-white colors present are gray (5) and green (3).
3.  **Input Objects:**
    *   A contiguous segment of three gray pixels (`5 5 5`).
    *   A single green pixel (`3`) isolated by white pixels on both sides.
4.  **Output Objects:**
    *   The segment of three gray pixels (`5 5 5`) remains unchanged in the same position.
    *   The single green pixel (`3`) from the input has been expanded into a segment of three green pixels (`3 3 3`). This new segment is centered where the original single green pixel was located.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be identifying isolated, non-white pixels and expanding them into a 3-pixel segment of the same color, replacing the original pixel and its immediate left and right white neighbors. Existing segments of 3 non-white pixels are preserved.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify isolated non-white pixels in a 1D grid and expand them into 3-pixel segments, while preserving existing 3-pixel segments.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - length: 3
      - contiguity: yes
    actions:
      - preserved: copy position and color to output
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - length: 1
      - context: isolated (adjacent pixels are background color 0)
    actions:
      - expanded: replace the pixel and its immediate neighbors (left and right) with a 3-pixel segment of the same color in the output.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - role: background / separator
    actions:
      - potentially_overwritten: can be changed if adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel during expansion.
      - otherwise_preserved: copied to output if not part of an expansion.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are arranged linearly in a single row.
  - type: adjacency
    description: Isolation is defined by adjacent pixels being the background color (0). Expansion affects adjacent background pixels.
boundary_conditions:
  - Expansion near edges needs consideration (though not explicitly shown in this single example, it's implied by the centered expansion logic). An isolated pixel at index 0 would likely expand to indices 0, 1, 2. An isolated pixel at the last index `N-1` would likely expand to `N-3, N-2, N-1`. However, the provided examples suggest centered expansion (`i-1, i, i+1`) is the primary rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its index `i`.
3.  For the pixel at index `i`, check if it meets the following conditions:
    *   It is a non-white pixel (value > 0).
    *   It is an "isolated" pixel:
        *   If `i > 0`, the pixel at `i-1` must be white (0).
        *   If `i < length - 1`, the pixel at `i+1` must be white (0).
        *   Handle edge cases: If `i == 0`, only check `i+1`. If `i == length - 1`, only check `i-1`.
4.  If all conditions in step 3 are met (the pixel is non-white and isolated):
    *   Identify the color `C` of the pixel at `input[i]`.
    *   In the **output** grid, set the color of the pixel at index `i` to `C`.
    *   If `i > 0`, set the color of the pixel at index `i-1` in the output grid to `C`.
    *   If `i < length - 1`, set the color of the pixel at index `i+1` in the output grid to `C`.
5.  If the conditions in step 3 are *not* met, the pixel in the output grid retains the value copied from the input grid in step 1.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
