task_description: Identify isolated non-white pixels in a 1D grid and expand them into 3-pixel segments, while preserving existing 3-pixel segments.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - length: 3
      - contiguity: yes
    actions:
      - preserved: copy position and color to output
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - length: 1
      - context: isolated (adjacent pixels are background color 0)
    actions:
      - expanded: replace the pixel and its immediate neighbors (left and right) with a 3-pixel segment of the same color in the output.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - role: background / separator
    actions:
      - potentially_overwritten: can be changed if adjacent to an isolated non-white pixel during expansion.
      - otherwise_preserved: copied to output if not part of an expansion.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are arranged linearly in a single row.
  - type: adjacency
    description: Isolation is defined by adjacent pixels being the background color (0). Expansion affects adjacent background pixels.
boundary_conditions:
  - Expansion near edges needs consideration (though not explicitly shown in this single example, it's implied by the centered expansion logic). An isolated pixel at index 0 would likely expand to indices 0, 1, 2. An isolated pixel at the last index `N-1` would likely expand to `N-3, N-2, N-1`. However, the provided examples suggest centered expansion (`i-1, i, i+1`) is the primary rule.
