Non-white colors present are gray (5) and green (3).\n3.  **Input Objects:**\n    *   A contiguous segment of three gray pixels (`5 5 5`).\n    *   A single green pixel (`3`) isolated by white pixels on both sides.\n4.  **Output Objects:**\n    *   The segment of three gray pixels (`5 5 5`) remains unchanged in the same position.\n    *   The single green pixel (`3`) from the input has been expanded into a segment of three green pixels (`3 3 3`). This new segment is centered where the original single green pixel was located.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be identifying isolated, non-white pixels and expanding them into a 3-pixel segment of the same color, replacing the original pixel and its immediate left and right white neighbors. Existing segments of 3 non-white pixels are preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Expansion affects adjacent background pixels.\nboundary_conditions:\n  - Expansion near edges needs consideration (though not explicitly shown in this single example, it's implied by the centered expansion logic). An isolated pixel at index 0 would likely expand to indices 0, 1, 2. An isolated pixel at the last index `N-1` would likely expand to `N-3, N-2, N-1`. However, the provided examples suggest centered expansion (`i-1, i, i+1`) is the primary rule.\n```"
