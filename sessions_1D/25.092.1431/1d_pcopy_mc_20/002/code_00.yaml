task_description: Transform a 1xN grid based on lengths of contiguous non-zero color sequences within the single row.
elements:
  - type: grid
    representation: 2D NumPy array of integers (colors) with shape (1, N), where 1 <= N <= 30.
  - type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: separator between objects within the row
  - type: object
    definition: contiguous sequence of identical non-zero pixels within the row
    properties:
      - color: the integer value (1-9)
      - length: number of pixels in the sequence
      - observed_lengths: [1, 3]
objects_in_examples: # Refers to sequences within the single row
  - train_1_input: [{color: 9, length: 3}, {color: 4, length: 1}, {color: 7, length: 1}]
  - train_1_output: [{color: 9, length: 3}, {color: 4, length: 3}, {color: 7, length: 3}]
  - train_2_input: [{color: 1, length: 3}, {color: 7, length: 1}, {color: 3, length: 1}]
  - train_2_output: [{color: 1, length: 3}, {color: 7, length: 3}, {color: 3, length: 3}]
  - train_3_input: [{color: 3, length: 3}, {color: 1, length: 1}, {color: 7, length: 1}]
  - train_3_output: [{color: 3, length: 3}, {color: 1, length: 3}, {color: 7, length: 3}]
transformation:
  - action: prepare_output
    description: Initialize an empty list to build the output row's pixel values. Initialize a counter variable `single_pixel_count` to 0.
  - action: iterate_input_row
    description: Scan the input grid's single row (row index 0) from left (column index 0) to right.
  - action: identify_segment
    description: Determine if the current segment is a gap (sequence of zeros) or an object (sequence of identical non-zero values).
  - action: process_gap
    description: If the segment is a gap, determine its length. Look ahead to the next segment (if any) to see if it's a single-pixel object.
    conditions:
      - if: gap is followed by a single-pixel object
        then:
          - Calculate the reduction amount based on `single_pixel_count` (using `single_pixel_count + 1` because the count increments when the object itself is processed).
          - Calculate the new gap length: `new_gap_length = max(0, current_gap_length - (single_pixel_count + 1))`.
          - Append `new_gap_length` zeros to the output list.
      - else: # Gap is followed by a 3-pixel object or is a trailing gap
        then:
          - Append the original number of zeros (`current_gap_length`) to the output list.
    update_iterator: Advance the scan index past the gap.
  - action: process_object
    description: If the segment is an object, determine its color and length.
    conditions:
      - if: object length is 1
        then:
          - Increment `single_pixel_count`.
          - Append the object's color three times to the output list.
      - if: object length is 3
        then:
          - Append the object's three pixels (color repeated 3 times) to the output list.
      - else: # Handle unexpected lengths if necessary (e.g., append as is)
          - Append the original object's pixels to the output list.
    update_iterator: Advance the scan index past the object.
  - action: finalize_output
    description: Once the entire input row is scanned, convert the constructed output list into a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, New_N).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are separated by gaps of zero pixels within the row.
  - type: dependency
    description: The modification of a gap depends on whether the immediately following object is a single pixel and how many single pixels have been encountered previously in the scan.
