            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly indicates that the input `input_grid` is being treated as a NumPy array, likely a 2D array with shape (1, N), rather than a simple Python list as initially assumed by the Python code. Accessing an element like `input_grid[i]` in a (1, N) array would return a sub-array (e.g., `[value]`), not a scalar value. When this sub-array is used in a boolean context (like an `if` statement), Python cannot determine a single truth value, leading to the error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Input Structure:** Use `tool_code` to parse the input examples and confirm their type and shape (likely NumPy arrays of shape (1, Width)).\n2.  **Adjust Access Method:** Modify the logic (both in the natural language program and subsequent code) to access individual pixel values correctly, likely using 2D indexing (e.g., `grid[0, col_index]`).\n3.  **Re-validate Logic:** Ensure the core logic of identifying objects (sequences of non-zeros), expanding single-pixel objects, and reducing preceding gaps based on the count of single-pixel objects encountered remains valid with the corrected access method.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's parse the first example to check its structure."
