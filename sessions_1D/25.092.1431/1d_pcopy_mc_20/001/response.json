In the examples, objects have lengths of 1 or 3.\n- Background is color 0 (white), forming gaps between objects.\n- The transformation rules are:\n    1. If an object has length 3, it remains unchanged, and its preceding gap of zeros also remains unchanged.\n    2. If an object has length 1 (a single pixel), it is expanded to a length of 3 (repeating its color).\n    3. The gap of zeros immediately preceding a single-pixel object is reduced. The amount of reduction is equal to the count of single-pixel objects encountered so far (including the current one). The gap length cannot be negative (minimum 0).\n- The transformation proceeds sequentially from left to right.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the described transformation to a 1D input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list): A list of integers representing the input 1D grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the transformed 1D grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = []\n    single_pixel_count = 0\n    i = 0\n    n = len(input_grid)\n\n    while i < n:\n        # Find the start of the current segment (either gap or object)\n        start_index = i\n\n        # Check if it's a gap (sequence of zeros)\n        if input_grid[i] == 0:\n            # Find the end of the gap\n            while i < n and input_grid[i] == 0:\n                i += 1\n            current_gap_length = i - start_index\n\n            # If this gap is followed by an object (i.e., we are not at the end)\n            if i < n:\n                # Look ahead to find the object length without consuming it yet\n                object_start = i\n                object_color = input_grid[i]\n                object_end = i\n                while object_end < n and input_grid[object_end] == object_color:\n                    object_end += 1\n                object_length = object_end - object_start\n\n                # Decide gap length based on the upcoming object\n                if object_length == 1:\n                     # Gap precedes a single-pixel object, calculate reduction\n                     # Note: single_pixel_count will be incremented *after* this gap calculation\n                     #       when the object itself is processed.
