task_description: Transform a 1D array based on lengths of contiguous non-zero color sequences.
elements:
  - type: grid
    representation: 1D array of integers (colors)
  - type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: separator between objects
  - type: object
    definition: contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels
    properties:
      - color: the integer value (1-9)
      - length: number of pixels in the sequence
      - observed_lengths: [1, 3]
objects_in_examples:
  - train_1_input: [{color: 9, length: 3}, {color: 4, length: 1}, {color: 7, length: 1}]
  - train_1_output: [{color: 9, length: 3}, {color: 4, length: 3}, {color: 7, length: 3}]
  - train_2_input: [{color: 1, length: 3}, {color: 7, length: 1}, {color: 3, length: 1}]
  - train_2_output: [{color: 1, length: 3}, {color: 7, length: 3}, {color: 3, length: 3}]
  - train_3_input: [{color: 3, length: 3}, {color: 1, length: 1}, {color: 7, length: 1}]
  - train_3_output: [{color: 3, length: 3}, {color: 1, length: 3}, {color: 7, length: 3}]
transformation:
  - action: identify_objects_and_gaps
    description: Parse the input array into alternating sequences of zero pixels (gaps) and non-zero pixels (objects).
  - action: process_objects
    description: Iterate through the identified objects and their preceding gaps.
    conditions:
      - if: object length is 1
        then:
          - expand object length to 3 (repeat color 3 times).
          - increment a counter for 'single objects found'.
          - reduce the number of zeros in the preceding gap by the current value of the 'single objects found' counter (minimum 0 zeros).
      - if: object length is 3
        then:
          - keep object unchanged.
          - keep preceding gap unchanged.
  - action: reconstruct_output
    description: Assemble the modified gaps and objects sequentially to form the output array.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are separated by gaps of zero pixels.
  - type: dependency
    description: The modification of a gap depends on whether the following object is a single pixel and how many single pixels have been encountered previously.
