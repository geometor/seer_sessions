            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1D arrays (representing a single row) of integers (colors). The dominant color is white (0), acting as a background or separator.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-zero colors appear in contiguous sequences. We can consider these sequences as objects. In the examples, objects are either single pixels of a color (e.g., `4`, `7`, `1`, `3`) or sequences of three identical pixels (e.g., `9 9 9`, `1 1 1`, `3 3 3`).\n3.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation seems to affect the single-pixel objects. They are expanded into sequences of three identical pixels. The three-pixel objects remain unchanged.\n4.  **Spacing/Gaps:** The number of white (0) pixels between objects changes. This change appears related to the expansion of single-pixel objects. Specifically, the gap *before* an expanded object is reduced.\n5.  **Pattern in Gap Reduction:** Observing the examples:\n    *   In train\\_1: The gap before `4` (first single pixel) reduces by 1 (3 zeros -> 2 zeros). The gap before `7` (second single pixel) reduces by 2 (4 zeros -> 2 zeros).\n    *   In train\\_2: The gap before `7` (first single pixel) reduces by 1 (4 zeros -> 3 zeros). The gap before `3` (second single pixel) reduces by 2 (4 zeros -> 2 zeros).\n    *   In train\\_3: The gap before `1` (first single pixel) reduces by 1 (2 zeros -> 1 zero). The gap before `7` (second single pixel) reduces by 2 (3 zeros -> 1 zero).\n    *   It seems the reduction amount for the gap preceding a single-pixel object equals the ordinal position of that single-pixel object among all single-pixel objects found so far (1st single pixel -> reduce gap by 1, 2nd -> reduce gap by 2, etc.). The number of zeros cannot be negative, implying a minimum gap size of 0.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
