In the training examples, observed object lengths are 1 or 3.\n- The background color is 0 (white), forming gaps between objects.\n- The transformation rules are applied sequentially from left to right:\n    1. If an object has a length of 3, it remains unchanged in the output, and the gap of zeros immediately preceding it also remains unchanged.\n    2. If an object has a length of 1 (a single pixel), it is expanded in the output to a length of 3 (by repeating its color).\n    3. The gap of zeros immediately preceding a single-pixel object is reduced in length in the output. The amount of reduction is equal to the cumulative count of single-pixel objects encountered *so far* (including the current one). The gap length cannot become negative (minimum length is 0).\n    4.
