task_type: array_transformation_1d # Assuming 1D for now based on examples
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    subtype: triplet
    description: A sequence of three identical non-white pixels (C C C).
    action: preserved in the output in the same location.
  - type: object
    subtype: flanked_singlet
    description: A single non-white pixel (C) surrounded by white pixels (0 C 0).
    action: transformed into a triplet (C C C) in the output, replacing the original 0 C 0 sequence.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation rule depends on the immediate left and right neighbors of a non-white pixel.
constraints:
  - The flanked_singlet transformation requires the pixel to be non-white and its immediate neighbors to be white.
  - The transformation happens in place, modifying the local 3-pixel sequence.
