Given the context of ARC, they are likely rows.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), orange (7), azure (8), red (2), magenta (6), blue (1).\n3.  **Input Structure:** The inputs contain sequences of three identical non-white colors (e.g., `7 7 7`, `8 8 8`) and isolated single non-white colors surrounded by white (e.g., `0 8 0`, `0 2 0`, `0 6 0`, `0 7 0`, `0 1 0`, `0 2 0`).\n4.  **Output Structure:** In the outputs, the original sequences of three identical non-white colors remain unchanged. The isolated single non-white colors (`C`) that were previously surrounded by white (`0 C 0`) are expanded into sequences of three (`C C C`), replacing the adjacent white pixels.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be identifying single non-white pixels flanked by white pixels and expanding that single pixel into a triplet of the same color, occupying the original pixel's position and its white neighbors. Sequences that are already triplets of non-white colors are preserved.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the input array from the second element up to the second-to-last element (index `i` from 1 to length-2).\n3.  For each element at index `i`:\n    a.  Check if the element `input[i]` is a non-white color (value > 0).\n    b.  Check if the element to its left, `input[i-1]`, is white (value 0).\n    c.  Check if the element to its right, `input[i+1]`, is white (value 0).\n4.  If all three conditions (3a, 3b, 3c) are true, it means we found a \"flanked singlet\" pattern `0 C 0`.\n5.  In this case, modify the *output* array: set the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `C` (which is the value of `input[i]`).\n6.  After iterating through all relevant indices, the final state of the output array is the result."
