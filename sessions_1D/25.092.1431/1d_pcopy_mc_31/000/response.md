Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Dimensionality:** The input and output data are presented as single lines of numbers, suggesting they represent 1D arrays or single rows/columns of a 2D grid. Given the context of ARC, they are likely rows.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), orange (7), azure (8), red (2), magenta (6), blue (1).
3.  **Input Structure:** The inputs contain sequences of three identical non-white colors (e.g., `7 7 7`, `8 8 8`) and isolated single non-white colors surrounded by white (e.g., `0 8 0`, `0 2 0`, `0 6 0`, `0 7 0`, `0 1 0`, `0 2 0`).
4.  **Output Structure:** In the outputs, the original sequences of three identical non-white colors remain unchanged. The isolated single non-white colors (`C`) that were previously surrounded by white (`0 C 0`) are expanded into sequences of three (`C C C`), replacing the adjacent white pixels.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be identifying single non-white pixels flanked by white pixels and expanding that single pixel into a triplet of the same color, occupying the original pixel's position and its white neighbors. Sequences that are already triplets of non-white colors are preserved.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d # Assuming 1D for now based on examples
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    subtype: triplet
    description: A sequence of three identical non-white pixels (C C C).
    action: preserved in the output in the same location.
  - type: object
    subtype: flanked_singlet
    description: A single non-white pixel (C) surrounded by white pixels (0 C 0).
    action: transformed into a triplet (C C C) in the output, replacing the original 0 C 0 sequence.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation rule depends on the immediate left and right neighbors of a non-white pixel.
constraints:
  - The flanked_singlet transformation requires the pixel to be non-white and its immediate neighbors to be white.
  - The transformation happens in place, modifying the local 3-pixel sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array.
2.  Iterate through the input array from the second element up to the second-to-last element (index `i` from 1 to length-2).
3.  For each element at index `i`:
    a.  Check if the element `input[i]` is a non-white color (value > 0).
    b.  Check if the element to its left, `input[i-1]`, is white (value 0).
    c.  Check if the element to its right, `input[i+1]`, is white (value 0).
4.  If all three conditions (3a, 3b, 3c) are true, it means we found a "flanked singlet" pattern `0 C 0`.
5.  In this case, modify the *output* array: set the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `C` (which is the value of `input[i]`).
6.  After iterating through all relevant indices, the final state of the output array is the result.
