## General Assessment

The previous code failed due to a mismatch between the expected input format (`list[list[int]]` for a 1xN grid) and the actual format provided in the examples (which appears to be a flat sequence or string representation). The core logic identified - expanding isolated single non-white pixels into 3-pixel segments while preserving existing 3-pixel segments - appears consistent across all training examples when interpreting the inputs as single rows (1D arrays).

The strategy for resolution is to:
1.  Correctly interpret the input/output format as a single list or 1D array of integers.
2.  Re-validate the transformation rule against all examples using this correct format interpretation.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 1D array structure and the validated transformation rule.

## Metrics

Based on the provided examples, interpreting them as single rows (1D arrays):

**Train Example 1:**
*   Input: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Output: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Isolated Pixel: `8` at index 6 (input[5]==0, input[7]==0).
*   Transformation: Indices 5, 6, 7 become `8`.
*   Preserved Segment: `9, 9, 9` at indices 1, 2, 3.

**Train Example 2:**
*   Input: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Output: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Isolated Pixels:
    *   `9` at index 8 (input[7]==0, input[9]==0). Transformation: Indices 7, 8, 9 become `9`.
    *   `9` at index 13 (input[12]==0, input[14]==0). Transformation: Indices 12, 13, 14 become `9`.
*   Preserved Segment: `8, 8, 8` at indices 2, 3, 4.

**Train Example 3:**
*   Input: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Output: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Isolated Pixels:
    *   `5` at index 7 (input[6]==0, input[8]==0). Transformation: Indices 6, 7, 8 become `5`.
    *   `5` at index 13 (input[12]==0, input[14]==0). Transformation: Indices 12, 13, 14 become `5`.
*   Preserved Segment: `3, 3, 3` at indices 2, 3, 4.

**Observations:**
*   All inputs and outputs are single rows (1D arrays) of the same length (32 in these examples).
*   The transformation consistently identifies non-white pixels `c` at index `i` where `input[i-1]` and `input[i+1]` are white (0), and replaces `output[i-1]`, `output[i]`, `output[i+1]` with `c`.
*   Existing segments of three identical non-white pixels are unchanged.
*   Other white pixels remain white unless overwritten by an expansion.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row array/list)
  grid_size: Constant width within examples (e.g., 32), potentially variable between tasks. Output width matches input width.
  colors_used:
    - 0 (white): background/separator
    - 1-9: various foreground colors (maroon, azure, green, gray, yellow used in examples)

objects:
  - id: isolated_single_pixel
    description: A non-white pixel `P` with color `c` at index `i` in the input array where the pixel at `i-1` is white (0) and the pixel at `i+1` is white (0). This definition applies for indices `1 <= i <= width-2`.
    properties:
      - color: The color value `c` (1-9) of the pixel.
      - index: The position `i` in the array.
  - id: segment_len3
    description: A contiguous sequence of exactly three identical non-white pixels in the input array.
    properties:
      - color: The color value (1-9) of the pixels in the segment.
      - indices: The starting, middle, and ending indices of the segment.
  - id: background_pixel
    description: A white pixel (0) in the input array.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are evaluated based on their immediate left (`i-1`) and right (`i+1`) neighbors in the 1D array.
  - type: isolation
    description: A property of `isolated_single_pixel`, defined by white immediate neighbors.

actions_on_input:
  - action: scan_for_isolated_pixels
    description: Iterate through the input array (from index 1 to width-2) to find all pixels matching the `isolated_single_pixel` definition. Record their index `i` and color `c`.

transformation_rule:
  - step: 1. Initialize Output
    action: Create an output array as a copy of the input array.
  - step: 2. Apply Expansions
    trigger: For each `isolated_single_pixel` found in the *input* array at index `i` with color `c`.
    action: Modify the *output* array by setting the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `c`.
    effect: Overwrites original values at these three positions in the output array. Pixels not involved in any expansion retain their copied value.
    concurrency: All expansions are based on the original input state; the order of applying expansions to the output array does not matter if their target indices do not overlap (which they won't by definition of isolation).

output_generation:
  - The final state of the modified output array after applying all expansions is the result.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept a 1D input array (single row) of pixel values.
2.  Create a new 1D output array by making an exact copy of the input array.
3.  Determine the width (number of elements) of the input array.
4.  Iterate through the **input** array, examining each element from the second position (index 1) up to, but not including, the last position (index `width - 1`). Let the current index be `i`.
5.  At each index `i`:
    a.  Get the color `c` of the pixel at `input[i]`.
    b.  Get the color of the left neighbor at `input[i-1]`.
    c.  Get the color of the right neighbor at `input[i+1]`.
    d.  Check if the current pixel is non-white (`c != 0`), the left neighbor is white (`input[i-1] == 0`), and the right neighbor is white (`input[i+1] == 0`).
    e.  If all these conditions are true, then this pixel at index `i` is an "isolated single pixel".
    f.  If an isolated single pixel is found: Modify the **output** array by setting the values at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `c`.
6.  After iterating through all possible indices `i` (from 1 to `width - 2`) in the input array, the final **output** array contains the transformed result. Return this output array.
