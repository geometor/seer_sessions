            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed due to a mismatch between the expected input format (`list[list[int]]` for a 1xN grid) and the actual format provided in the examples (which appears to be a flat sequence or string representation). The core logic identified - expanding isolated single non-white pixels into 3-pixel segments while preserving existing 3-pixel segments - appears consistent across all training examples when interpreting the inputs as single rows (1D arrays).\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to:\n1.  Correctly interpret the input/output format as a single list or 1D array of integers.\n2.  Re-validate the transformation rule against all examples using this correct format interpretation.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 1D array structure and the validated transformation rule.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the provided examples, interpreting them as single rows (1D arrays):\n\n**Train Example 1:**\n*   Input: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)\n*   Output: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)\n*   Isolated Pixel: `8` at index 6 (input[5]==0, input[7]==0).\n*   Transformation: Indices 5, 6, 7 become `8`.\n*   Preserved Segment: `9, 9, 9` at indices 1, 2, 3.\n\n**Train Example 2:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)\n*   Output: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)\n*   Isolated Pixels:\n    *   `9` at index 8 (input[7]==0, input[9]==0). Transformation: Indices 7, 8, 9 become `9`.\n    *   `9` at index 13 (input[12]==0, input[14]==0). Transformation: Indices 12, 13, 14 become `9`.\n*   Preserved Segment: `8, 8, 8` at indices 2, 3, 4.\n\n**Train Example 3:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)\n*   Output: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)\n*   Isolated Pixels:\n    *   `5` at index 7 (input[6]==0, input[8]==0). Transformation: Indices 6, 7, 8 become `5`.\n    *   `5` at index 13 (input[12]==0, input[14]==0). Transformation: Indices 12, 13, 14 become `5`.\n*   Preserved Segment: `3, 3, 3` at indices 2, 3, 4.\n\n**Observations:**\n*   All inputs and outputs are single rows (1D arrays) of the same length (32 in these examples).\n*   The transformation consistently identifies non-white pixels `c` at index `i` where `input[i-1]` and `input[i+1]` are white (0), and replaces `output[i-1]`, `output[i]`, `output[i+1]` with `c`.\n*   Existing segments of three identical non-white pixels are unchanged.\n*   Other white pixels remain white unless overwritten by an expansion.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
