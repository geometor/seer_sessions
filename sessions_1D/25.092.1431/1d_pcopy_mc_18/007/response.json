Scan the original input list from the second element (index 1) to the second-to-last element (index width-2).\n3.  Identify any non-white pixel (value > 0) that is immediately surrounded by white pixels (value 0) on both its left and right sides in the input list. Such a pixel is called an \"isolated single pixel\".\n4.  For each isolated single pixel found at index `i` with color `c` in the input list, modify the output list by setting the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to the color `c`.\n5.
