```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on the following rule:
Identify any non-white pixel that is surrounded by white pixels (an "isolated single pixel").
For each such isolated single pixel found at index `i` with color `c` in the input grid, 
expand it into a three-pixel segment of color `c` in the output grid, centered at index `i`. 
This means setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the output grid to color `c`.
Pixels that are not part of such an expansion retain their original value from the input grid.
The process considers the original state of the input grid for identifying isolated pixels; 
expansions happen concurrently on a copy.
