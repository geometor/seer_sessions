## Perception

The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels. The grids contain segments of non-white colors separated by white (0) pixels.

Observing the examples:
1.  **Segments of three identical non-white pixels:** These segments appear unchanged in the output grid at the same position (e.g., `9 9 9` in `train_1`, `8 8 8` in `train_2`, `3 3 3` in `train_3`).
2.  **Single non-white pixels:** These pixels are isolated, meaning they have white pixels immediately to their left and right. In the output, each single pixel seems to expand into a segment of three pixels of the *same color*, centered at the original pixel's location. This expansion overwrites the original single pixel and its immediate left and right neighbors.
    *   In `train_1`, the single `8` at index 6 causes indices 5, 6, and 7 in the output to become `8`.
    *   In `train_2`, the single `9` at index 8 causes indices 7, 8, and 9 in the output to become `9`. The single `9` at index 13 causes indices 12, 13, and 14 to become `9`.
    *   In `train_3`, the single `5` at index 7 causes indices 6, 7, and 8 to become `5`. The single `5` at index 13 causes indices 12, 13, and 14 to become `5`.
3.  **White pixels:** White pixels (0) generally remain white, unless they are overwritten by the expansion of a nearby single non-white pixel.

The core transformation identifies isolated non-white pixels and expands them horizontally into a 3-pixel segment, replacing the original pixel and its immediate neighbors. Segments already of length 3 are preserved.

transformation:
  - based_on: identified `single_pixel` at input index `i` with color `c`.
  - action: expand_pixel
    target: output grid
    effect: Set the pixels at output indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `c`.
  - based_on: identified `preserved_elements`.
  - action: copy_pixel
    target: output grid
    effect: Copy the color of the preserved element from the input grid to the corresponding index in the output grid.

processing_notes:
  - The identification of single pixels must happen based entirely on the input grid state *before* any transformations are applied to the output grid.
  - The output grid is constructed by first potentially copying the input, then applying the `expand_pixel` transformation for all identified single pixels. This overwrites the original single pixel and its neighbors (which could be background or part of another segment).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying all values from the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from the second pixel (index 1) up to the second-to-last pixel (index `width - 2`).
3.  For each pixel at index `i` in the input grid:
    a.  Check if the pixel's color is non-white (not 0).
    b.  Check if the pixel to its left (at index `i-1`) is white (0).
    c.  Check if the pixel to its right (at index `i+1`) is white (0).
    d.  If all three conditions (non-white current pixel, white left neighbor, white right neighbor) are true, then this pixel is an "isolated single pixel".
    e.  If an isolated single pixel with color `c` is found at index `i` in the input grid:
        i.  Modify the **output** grid: Set the pixel at index `i-1` to color `c`.
        ii. Modify the **output** grid: Set the pixel at index `i` to color `c`.
        iii. Modify the **output** grid: Set the pixel at index `i+1` to color `c`.
4.  After checking all relevant pixels in the input grid and performing all necessary modifications on the output grid, the resulting output grid is the final result. (Pixels not part of a 3-pixel expansion centered on an isolated single pixel retain their original copied value).

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN dimensions)

## Example 2:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN dimensions)

## Example 3:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN dimensions)
## General Assessment

The previous execution attempt failed uniformly across all training examples with an input validation error: `Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN dimensions)`. This indicates that the `transform` function's expectation of the input format (`list[list[int]]` for a 1xN grid) did not match the format provided during testing.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Assume Correct Input Format:** Proceed under the assumption that the function *will* receive the input correctly formatted as `list[list[int]]` (a list containing one list representing the single row). The error likely stemmed from the testing environment's data preparation or an overly sensitive validation check in the previous code attempt.
2.  **Focus on Transformation Logic:** Re-validate the core transformation logic against the examples: isolated non-white pixels expand to three pixels of the same color, overwriting neighbors; existing segments of three identical non-white pixels remain unchanged.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this logic, ensuring clarity for the coder phase. The core logic identified previously appears correct based on the visual examples.

**Metric Summary:**

*   **Dimensions:** All examples use 1x32 grids for both input and output.
*   **Colors:** Examples use white (0) and various other colors (3, 5, 8, 9). The set of unique colors remains the same between input and output within each example.
*   **Pixel Counts:** The number of non-white pixels increases from input to output in all examples (4->6, 5->9, 5->9). This is consistent with the expansion rule where one pixel becomes three. For each isolated pixel identified, the non-white count increases by 2 (1 original + 2 new = 3 total, replacing 3 original pixels which included 2 white ones).

  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are evaluated based on their immediate left (i-1) and right (i+1) neighbors within the row.
  - type: isolation
    description: A property determining if a non-white pixel qualifies as `isolated_single_pixel` based on white neighbors.

actions_on_input:
  - action: identify_isolated_pixels
    description: Scan the input row (indices 1 to width-2) to find all pixels matching the `isolated_single_pixel` definition. Record their index `i` and color `C`.

transformation:
  - step: 1_initialize_output
    action: Create a new output row by making a deep copy of the input row.
  - step: 2_apply_expansions
    based_on: Each identified `isolated_single_pixel` (color `C`, index `i`) from the input row.
    action: Modify the **output** row.
    effect: Set the pixels at output indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`. This overwrites the original values at these positions in the copied output row.
  - step: 3_finalize
    action: Pixels in the output row not overwritten by step 2 retain their values from the initial copy.
    result: The modified output row represents the final transformed grid.

processing_notes:
  - The identification of isolated pixels (action `identify_isolated_pixels`) must be based entirely on the original state of the input row.
  - Modifications are applied to the copied output row, preventing changes from affecting the identification of other isolated pixels in the same pass.
  - Boundary conditions: Pixels at index 0 and `width-1` cannot be `isolated_single_pixel` by definition as they lack a neighbor on one side for the check.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to be a single row (represented as a list containing one list of integers).
2.  Create a deep copy of the input row to serve as the initial state of the output row.
3.  Iterate through the **input** row, examining each pixel from the second position (index 1) up to, but not including, the last position (index `width - 1`). Let the current index be `i`.
4.  For the pixel at index `i` in the **input** row:
    a.  Check if its color (`input_row[i]`) is non-white (not 0).
    b.  Check if the color of the pixel to its left (`input_row[i-1]`) is white (0).
    c.  Check if the color of the pixel to its right (`input_row[i+1]`) is white (0).
5.  If all three conditions (current pixel is non-white, left neighbor is white, right neighbor is white) are true:
    a.  Identify the color `C` of the pixel at `input_row[i]`.
    b.  Modify the **output** row: Set the color of the pixel at index `i-1` to `C`.
    c.  Modify the **output** row: Set the color of the pixel at index `i` to `C`.
    d.  Modify the **output** row: Set the color of the pixel at index `i+1` to `C`.
6.  After iterating through all applicable indices (`1` to `width-2`) of the input row, the modifications on the output row are complete.
7.  Return the final modified output row, wrapped in a list to match the required `list[list[int]]` grid format.
