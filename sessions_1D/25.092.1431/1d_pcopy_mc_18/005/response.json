Such a pixel is called an \"isolated single pixel\".\nFor each isolated single pixel found at index `i` with color `c` in the input grid, expand it into a three-pixel segment of color `c` in the output grid, centered at index `i`. This means setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the output grid to color `c`.\nPixels in the output grid that are not part of such an expansion retain their original value from the input grid (achieved by initially copying the input to the output).\nThe identification of isolated pixels uses the original input grid state only.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the expansion transformation to isolated single pixels in a 1D grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A 1xN grid represented as a list containing one list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: The transformed 1xN grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate input format and extract the single row\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or len(input_grid) != 1 or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):\n        # Handle invalid input format - returning input unchanged or raising error.\n        # Let's raise an error for clarity as it indicates a problem upstream.\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN dimensions)\")\n        \n    input_row = input_grid[0]\n    width = len(input_row)\n\n    # Initialize output_row as a deep copy of the input_row.\n    # Modifications will be made to this copy based on analysis of the original input_row.\n    output_row = copy.deepcopy(input_row)\n\n    # Iterate through the input row to find isolated single pixels.\n    # We only need to check indices from 1 up to width - 2 (exclusive).\n    # Pixels at index 0 and width-1 cannot be surrounded by two neighbors.\n    for i in range(1, width - 1):\n        # Get the color of the current pixel and its immediate neighbors from the original input row.\n        current_pixel_color = input_row[i]\n        left_neighbor_color = input_row[i-1]\n        right_neighbor_color = input_row[i+1]\n\n        # Check for the isolated single pixel condition:\n        # 1.
