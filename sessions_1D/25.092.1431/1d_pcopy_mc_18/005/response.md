```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (represented as a 1xN list of lists) based on the rule:
Identify any non-white pixel (value > 0) that is immediately surrounded by white pixels (value 0) on both its left and right sides in the input grid. Such a pixel is called an "isolated single pixel".
For each isolated single pixel found at index `i` with color `c` in the input grid, expand it into a three-pixel segment of color `c` in the output grid, centered at index `i`. This means setting the pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the output grid to color `c`.
Pixels in the output grid that are not part of such an expansion retain their original value from the input grid (achieved by initially copying the input to the output).
The identification of isolated pixels uses the original input grid state only.
