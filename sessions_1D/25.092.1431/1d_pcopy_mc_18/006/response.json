            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: isolated non-white pixels expand into 3-pixel segments of the same color, while existing 3-pixel segments are preserved. However, the implementation failed because it assumed the input/output format was a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[0, 9, ...]]`), representing a 1xN grid. The error messages (\"Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN dimensions)\") clearly indicate that the actual input format provided during testing was likely a simple list of integers (e.g., `[0, 9, ...]`), representing the single row directly.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to adjust the natural language program and subsequent code to expect and operate on a 1D list (`list[int]`) instead of a list of lists (`list[list[int]]`). The underlying pixel identification and expansion logic remains the same.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the provided examples and the error messages:\n\n*   **Input/Output Format:** Assumed to be `list[int]` (a single list representing the row), not `list[list[int]]`.\n*   **Grid Dimensionality:** Consistently 1D (a single row).\n*   **Transformation Rule:** Identify non-white pixels `c` at index `i` where `input[i-1] == 0` and `input[i+1] == 0`. Replace `output[i-1]`, `output[i]`, `output[i+1]` with `c`.\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, ...]` (Length 32)\n    *   Isolated Pixel: `8` at index 6 (neighbors at 5 and 7 are `0`).\n    *   Transformation: Pixels at indices 5, 6, 7 become `8`.\n    *   Output: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, ...]` (Length 32) - Matches expected transformation.\n*   **Example 2 Analysis:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, ...]` (Length 32)\n    *   Isolated Pixels: `9` at index 8, `9` at index 13.\n    *   Transformation 1: Indices 7, 8, 9 become `9`.\n    *   Transformation 2: Indices 12, 13, 14 become `9`.\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, ...]` (Length 32) - Matches expected transformation.\n*   **Example 3 Analysis:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, ...]` (Length 32)\n    *   Isolated Pixels: `5` at index 7, `5` at index 13.\n    *   Transformation 1: Indices 6, 7, 8 become `5`.\n    *   Transformation 2: Indices 12, 13, 14 become `5`.\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, ...]` (Length 32) - Matches expected transformation.\n\nThe core logic seems correct, only the data structure handling needs adjustment.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
