```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (represented as a 1xN list of lists) based on the following rule:
1. Create a copy of the input grid's single row to serve as the initial output row.
2. Scan the original input row from the second element (index 1) to the second-to-last element (index width-2).
3. Identify any non-white pixel (value > 0) that is immediately surrounded by white pixels (value 0) on both its left and right sides. Such a pixel is called an "isolated single pixel".
4. For each isolated single pixel found at index `i` with color `c` in the input row, modify the output row by setting the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to the color `c`.
5. Pixels in the output row that are not part of such a 3-pixel expansion retain their original copied value from the input row.
6. Return the final modified output row, wrapped in a list to maintain the 1xN grid format.
