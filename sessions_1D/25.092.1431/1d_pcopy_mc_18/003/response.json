Create a copy of the input grid's single row to serve as the initial output row.\n2. Scan the original input row from the second element (index 1) to the second-to-last element (index width-2).\n3. Identify any non-white pixel (value > 0) that is immediately surrounded by white pixels (value 0) on both its left and right sides. Such a pixel is called an \"isolated single pixel\".\n4. For each isolated single pixel found at index `i` with color `c` in the input row, modify the output row by setting the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to the color `c`.\n5. Pixels in the output row that are not part of such a 3-pixel expansion retain their original copied value from the input row.\n6.
