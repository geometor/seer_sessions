## Perception

The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels. The grids contain segments of non-white colors separated by white (0) pixels.

Observing the examples:
1.  **Segments of three identical non-white pixels:** These segments appear unchanged in the output grid at the same position (e.g., `9 9 9` in `train_1`, `8 8 8` in `train_2`, `3 3 3` in `train_3`).
2.  **Single non-white pixels:** These pixels are isolated, meaning they have white pixels immediately to their left and right. In the output, each single pixel seems to expand into a segment of three pixels of the *same color*, centered at the original pixel's location. This expansion overwrites the original single pixel and its immediate left and right neighbors.
    *   In `train_1`, the single `8` at index 6 causes indices 5, 6, and 7 in the output to become `8`.
    *   In `train_2`, the single `9` at index 8 causes indices 7, 8, and 9 in the output to become `9`. The single `9` at index 13 causes indices 12, 13, and 14 to become `9`.
    *   In `train_3`, the single `5` at index 7 causes indices 6, 7, and 8 to become `5`. The single `5` at index 13 causes indices 12, 13, and 14 to become `5`.
3.  **White pixels:** White pixels (0) generally remain white, unless they are overwritten by the expansion of a nearby single non-white pixel.

The core transformation identifies isolated non-white pixels and expands them horizontally into a 3-pixel segment, replacing the original pixel and its immediate neighbors. Segments already of length 3 are preserved.

transformation:
  - based_on: identified `single_pixel` at input index `i` with color `c`.
  - action: expand_pixel
    target: output grid
    effect: Set the pixels at output indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `c`.
  - based_on: identified `preserved_elements`.
  - action: copy_pixel
    target: output grid
    effect: Copy the color of the preserved element from the input grid to the corresponding index in the output grid.

processing_notes:
  - The identification of single pixels must happen based entirely on the input grid state *before* any transformations are applied to the output grid.
  - The output grid is constructed by first potentially copying the input, then applying the `expand_pixel` transformation for all identified single pixels. This overwrites the original single pixel and its neighbors (which could be background or part of another segment).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying all values from the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from the second pixel (index 1) up to the second-to-last pixel (index `width - 2`).
3.  For each pixel at index `i` in the input grid:
    a.  Check if the pixel's color is non-white (not 0).
    b.  Check if the pixel to its left (at index `i-1`) is white (0).
    c.  Check if the pixel to its right (at index `i+1`) is white (0).
    d.  If all three conditions (non-white current pixel, white left neighbor, white right neighbor) are true, then this pixel is an "isolated single pixel".
    e.  If an isolated single pixel with color `c` is found at index `i` in the input grid:
        i.  Modify the **output** grid: Set the pixel at index `i-1` to color `c`.
        ii. Modify the **output** grid: Set the pixel at index `i` to color `c`.
        iii. Modify the **output** grid: Set the pixel at index `i+1` to color `c`.
4.  After checking all relevant pixels in the input grid and performing all necessary modifications on the output grid, the resulting output grid is the final result. (Pixels not part of a 3-pixel expansion centered on an isolated single pixel retain their original copied value).

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN dimensions)

## Example 2:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN dimensions)

## Example 3:
Error: Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN dimensions)
## General Assessment

The previous code failed due to a mismatch between the expected input format (`list[list[int]]` for a 1xN grid) and the actual format provided in the examples (which appears to be a flat sequence or string representation). The core logic identified - expanding isolated single non-white pixels into 3-pixel segments while preserving existing 3-pixel segments - appears consistent across all training examples when interpreting the inputs as single rows (1D arrays).

The strategy for resolution is to:
1.  Correctly interpret the input/output format as a single list or 1D array of integers.
2.  Re-validate the transformation rule against all examples using this correct format interpretation.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 1D array structure and the validated transformation rule.

## Metrics

Based on the provided examples, interpreting them as single rows (1D arrays):

**Train Example 1:**
*   Input: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Output: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Isolated Pixel: `8` at index 6 (input[5]==0, input[7]==0).
*   Transformation: Indices 5, 6, 7 become `8`.
*   Preserved Segment: `9, 9, 9` at indices 1, 2, 3.

**Train Example 2:**
*   Input: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Output: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Isolated Pixels:
    *   `9` at index 8 (input[7]==0, input[9]==0). Transformation: Indices 7, 8, 9 become `9`.
    *   `9` at index 13 (input[12]==0, input[14]==0). Transformation: Indices 12, 13, 14 become `9`.
*   Preserved Segment: `8, 8, 8` at indices 2, 3, 4.

**Train Example 3:**
*   Input: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Output: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 32)
*   Isolated Pixels:
    *   `5` at index 7 (input[6]==0, input[8]==0). Transformation: Indices 6, 7, 8 become `5`.
    *   `5` at index 13 (input[12]==0, input[14]==0). Transformation: Indices 12, 13, 14 become `5`.
*   Preserved Segment: `3, 3, 3` at indices 2, 3, 4.

**Observations:**
*   All inputs and outputs are single rows (1D arrays) of the same length (32 in these examples).
*   The transformation consistently identifies non-white pixels `c` at index `i` where `input[i-1]` and `input[i+1]` are white (0), and replaces `output[i-1]`, `output[i]`, `output[i+1]` with `c`.
*   Existing segments of three identical non-white pixels are unchanged.
*   Other white pixels remain white unless overwritten by an expansion.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept a 1D input array (single row) of pixel values.
2.  Create a new 1D output array by making an exact copy of the input array.
3.  Determine the width (number of elements) of the input array.
4.  Iterate through the **input** array, examining each element from the second position (index 1) up to, but not including, the last position (index `width - 1`). Let the current index be `i`.
5.  At each index `i`:
    a.  Get the color `c` of the pixel at `input[i]`.
    b.  Get the color of the left neighbor at `input[i-1]`.
    c.  Get the color of the right neighbor at `input[i+1]`.
    d.  Check if the current pixel is non-white (`c != 0`), the left neighbor is white (`input[i-1] == 0`), and the right neighbor is white (`input[i+1] == 0`).
    e.  If all these conditions are true, then this pixel at index `i` is an "isolated single pixel".
    f.  If an isolated single pixel is found: Modify the **output** array by setting the values at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all to the color `c`.
6.  After iterating through all possible indices `i` (from 1 to `width - 2`) in the input array, the final **output** array contains the transformed result. Return this output array.
