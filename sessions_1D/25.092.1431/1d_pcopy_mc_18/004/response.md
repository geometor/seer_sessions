## General Assessment

The previous execution attempt failed uniformly across all training examples with an input validation error: `Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1xN dimensions)`. This indicates that the `transform` function's expectation of the input format (`list[list[int]]` for a 1xN grid) did not match the format provided during testing.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Assume Correct Input Format:** Proceed under the assumption that the function *will* receive the input correctly formatted as `list[list[int]]` (a list containing one list representing the single row). The error likely stemmed from the testing environment's data preparation or an overly sensitive validation check in the previous code attempt.
2.  **Focus on Transformation Logic:** Re-validate the core transformation logic against the examples: isolated non-white pixels expand to three pixels of the same color, overwriting neighbors; existing segments of three identical non-white pixels remain unchanged.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this logic, ensuring clarity for the coder phase. The core logic identified previously appears correct based on the visual examples.

## Metrics

Metrics are gathered assuming the string representations provided are parsed into `list[list[int]]` format.

**Metric Summary:**

*   **Dimensions:** All examples use 1x32 grids for both input and output.
*   **Colors:** Examples use white (0) and various other colors (3, 5, 8, 9). The set of unique colors remains the same between input and output within each example.
*   **Pixel Counts:** The number of non-white pixels increases from input to output in all examples (4->6, 5->9, 5->9). This is consistent with the expansion rule where one pixel becomes three. For each isolated pixel identified, the non-white count increases by 2 (1 original + 2 new = 3 total, replacing 3 original pixels which included 2 white ones).

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row, represented as list[list[int]])
  grid_size: 1x32 for all examples
  colors_used:
    - 0 (white): background/separator
    - 3, 5, 8, 9: foreground colors in examples

objects:
  - id: isolated_single_pixel
    description: A non-white pixel P (color C > 0) at index `i` in the input row where the pixel at `i-1` is white (0) and the pixel at `i+1` is white (0). This requires `1 <= i <= width-2`.
    properties:
      - color: The color value C (non-zero).
      - index: The position `i` in the row.
    examples:
      - train_1: pixel 8 at index 6
      - train_2: pixel 9 at index 8, pixel 9 at index 13
      - train_3: pixel 5 at index 7, pixel 5 at index 13
  - id: segment_len3
    description: A contiguous sequence of exactly three identical non-white pixels in the input row.
    properties:
      - color: The color value (non-zero).
      - indices: The start, middle, and end indices.
    examples:
      - train_1: 9 9 9 at indices 1, 2, 3
      - train_2: 8 8 8 at indices 2, 3, 4
      - train_3: 3 3 3 at indices 2, 3, 4
  - id: other_pixel
    description: Any pixel in the input row that is not an `isolated_single_pixel` and is not part of the 3-pixel expansion zone created by an `isolated_single_pixel`. This includes `segment_len3` pixels and background pixels not adjacent to an `isolated_single_pixel`.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are evaluated based on their immediate left (i-1) and right (i+1) neighbors within the row.
  - type: isolation
    description: A property determining if a non-white pixel qualifies as `isolated_single_pixel` based on white neighbors.

actions_on_input:
  - action: identify_isolated_pixels
    description: Scan the input row (indices 1 to width-2) to find all pixels matching the `isolated_single_pixel` definition. Record their index `i` and color `C`.

transformation:
  - step: 1_initialize_output
    action: Create a new output row by making a deep copy of the input row.
  - step: 2_apply_expansions
    based_on: Each identified `isolated_single_pixel` (color `C`, index `i`) from the input row.
    action: Modify the **output** row.
    effect: Set the pixels at output indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`. This overwrites the original values at these positions in the copied output row.
  - step: 3_finalize
    action: Pixels in the output row not overwritten by step 2 retain their values from the initial copy.
    result: The modified output row represents the final transformed grid.

processing_notes:
  - The identification of isolated pixels (action `identify_isolated_pixels`) must be based entirely on the original state of the input row.
  - Modifications are applied to the copied output row, preventing changes from affecting the identification of other isolated pixels in the same pass.
  - Boundary conditions: Pixels at index 0 and `width-1` cannot be `isolated_single_pixel` by definition as they lack a neighbor on one side for the check.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to be a single row (represented as a list containing one list of integers).
2.  Create a deep copy of the input row to serve as the initial state of the output row.
3.  Iterate through the **input** row, examining each pixel from the second position (index 1) up to, but not including, the last position (index `width - 1`). Let the current index be `i`.
4.  For the pixel at index `i` in the **input** row:
    a.  Check if its color (`input_row[i]`) is non-white (not 0).
    b.  Check if the color of the pixel to its left (`input_row[i-1]`) is white (0).
    c.  Check if the color of the pixel to its right (`input_row[i+1]`) is white (0).
5.  If all three conditions (current pixel is non-white, left neighbor is white, right neighbor is white) are true:
    a.  Identify the color `C` of the pixel at `input_row[i]`.
    b.  Modify the **output** row: Set the color of the pixel at index `i-1` to `C`.
    c.  Modify the **output** row: Set the color of the pixel at index `i` to `C`.
    d.  Modify the **output** row: Set the color of the pixel at index `i+1` to `C`.
6.  After iterating through all applicable indices (`1` to `width-2`) of the input row, the modifications on the output row are complete.
7.  Return the final modified output row, wrapped in a list to match the required `list[list[int]]` grid format.
