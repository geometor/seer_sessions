The input contains two distinct non-background (non-white) colored elements: one is a contiguous block of a certain color and size, and the other is a single pixel of a different color. The output grid modifies the single pixel element. Specifically, the single pixel expands into a contiguous block of the same color. The size of this new block matches the size of the *other* non-white block present in the input. The new block is centered around the original position of the single pixel. The original multi-pixel block remains unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
