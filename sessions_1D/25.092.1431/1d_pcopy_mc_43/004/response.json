            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed because it was designed to operate on 1D Python lists, while the ARC testing environment likely provides the input grids as 2D NumPy arrays. Even though the examples visually appear one-dimensional, they are represented as 1xN arrays. Iterating over a 1xN NumPy array yields the single row (which is itself an array), not individual pixel values. When the code attempts a boolean comparison (`pixel != 0`) where `pixel` is actually the entire row array, it results in a boolean array. Using this boolean array in an `if` condition leads to the observed `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to:\n1.  Modify the code to explicitly handle NumPy arrays as input.\n2.  Adjust the `find_objects` function to iterate through the *elements* of the relevant row (the first row, `grid[0]`, based on the examples) rather than iterating through the rows of the grid.\n3.  Use NumPy's array copying mechanism (`np.copy`) instead of `copy.deepcopy`.\n4.  Ensure all indexing and assignments operate correctly on the NumPy array.\n\nThe core logic identified previously (finding a single pixel and a multi-pixel block, then expanding the single pixel to the size of the multi-pixel block, centered at the original pixel's location) remains valid.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\n*   **Input Data Structure:** Confirmed via simulation and error analysis that the inputs are treated as 2D NumPy arrays.\n*   **Example Shapes:** All training inputs are 1x32 NumPy arrays.\n    *   `train_1`: `(1, 32)`\n    *   `train_2`: `(1, 32)`\n    *   `train_3`: `(1, 32)`\n*   **Object Identification (Re-evaluation on `grid[0]`):**\n    *   `train_1` (`grid[0]`): Object1={color:3, size:3, start:2}, Object2={color:2, size:1, start:9}. TargetPos=9, RefSize=3. Output range: `9 - floor(3/2)` to `9 - floor(3/2) + 3 - 1` => `9 - 1` to `8 + 2` => `8` to `10`. Output `grid[0, 8:11] = 2`. Matches example.\n    *   `train_2` (`grid[0]`): Object1={color:1, size:3, start:1}, Object2={color:6, size:1, start:6}. TargetPos=6, RefSize=3. Output range: `6 - floor(3/2)` to `6 - floor(3/2) + 3 - 1` => `6 - 1` to `5 + 2` => `5` to `7`. Output `grid[0, 5:8] = 6`. Matches example.\n    *   `train_3` (`grid[0]`): Object1={color:6, size:3, start:1}, Object2={color:5, size:1, start:6}. TargetPos=6, RefSize=3. Output range: `6 - floor(3/2)` to `6 - floor(3/2) + 3 - 1` => `6 - 1` to `5 + 2` => `5` to `7`. Output `grid[0, 5:8] = 5`. Matches example.\n*   **Error Source:** The error occurs in `find_objects` when `pixel != 0` is evaluated inside the loop, because `pixel` holds an entire row array.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
