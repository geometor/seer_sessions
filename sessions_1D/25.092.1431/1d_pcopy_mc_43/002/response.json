            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: find a single non-white pixel and a multi-pixel non-white block, then expand the single pixel into a block of the same size as the multi-pixel block, centered at the single pixel's original location, using the single pixel's color. The multi-pixel block remains unchanged.\n\nThe consistent `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...` across all examples strongly suggests an implementation issue rather than a flaw in the perceived transformation rule. This error typically occurs in Python when trying to use a NumPy array (or similar multi-element structure) in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`). This could stem from:\n1.  The input `grid` being a NumPy array and comparisons like `pixel != 0` or `pixel == current_object['color']` are inadvertently performed on array slices instead of individual elements at some point.\n2.  An issue in the testing harness comparing the output list/array with the expected output list/array element-wise, triggering the error if a direct array comparison (`==`) is used instead of an element-wise comparison method (like `numpy.array_equal`).\n\nGiven that the visual transformation logic holds true for all examples when manually traced, the natural language program and the underlying understanding of the task are likely correct. The focus should be on ensuring the implementation correctly handles the data types (assuming 1D lists of integers as per the problem description and examples) and performs comparisons appropriately.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's re-verify the object properties and transformation details for each example.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, ...]` (length 32)\n    *   Objects: Green block (color 3) at indices 2-4 (size 3); Red pixel (color 2) at index 9 (size 1).\n    *   Transformation: Expand Red pixel (color 2) at index 9 to size 3.\n    *   Centering: `center=9`, `size=3`. Offset is `floor(3/2)=1`. New block spans `9-1` to `9+1` = indices 8 to 10.\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...]` (Matches expected output).\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, ...]` (length 32)\n    *   Objects: Blue block (color 1) at indices 1-3 (size 3); Magenta pixel (color 6) at index 6 (size 1).\n    *   Transformation: Expand Magenta pixel (color 6) at index 6 to size 3.\n    *   Centering: `center=6`, `size=3`. Offset is `floor(3/2)=1`. New block spans `6-1` to `6+1` = indices 5 to 7.\n    *   Output: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, ...]` (Matches expected output).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, ...]` (length 32)\n    *   Objects: Magenta block (color 6) at indices 1-3 (size 3); Gray pixel (color 5) at index 6 (size 1).\n    *   Transformation: Expand Gray pixel (color 5) at index 6 to size 3.\n    *   Centering: `center=6`, `size=3`. Offset is `floor(3/2)=1`. New block spans `6-1` to `6+1` = indices 5 to 7.\n    *   Output: `[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, ...]` (Matches expected output).\n\nThe logic holds consistently. The implementation error needs correction, but the understanding of the transformation rule seems robust based on the training data.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all distinct contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (pixels with value != 0) in the input grid. Record their color, start index, end index, and size (number of pixels).\n3.  From the identified blocks, find the unique block that has a size of 1 (the 'target pixel'). Let its color be C_target and its index be P_target.\n4.  Find the unique block that has a size greater than 1 (the 'reference block'). Let its size be S_ref.\n5.  Calculate the extent of the new block to be created. The new block will have color C_target and size S_ref. Determine the start index for this new block by calculating `start_new = P_target - floor(S_ref / 2)`.\n6.  Determine the end index for the new block: `end_new = start_new + S_ref - 1`.\n7.  Modify the output grid: Iterate from `index = start_new` to `end_new`. For each index within the valid bounds of the grid (i.e., `0 <= index < grid_length`), set the pixel value in the output grid at that index to C_target. Ensure pixels outside the grid bounds are ignored.\n8.  The reference block remains unchanged in its original position in the output grid (unless overwritten by the creation of the new block, which doesn't happen in the examples but should be implicitly handled by step 7)."
