*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming a 1D grid (represented as a sequence of numbers). The input contains two distinct non-background (non-white) colored elements: one is a contiguous block of a certain color and size, and the other is a single pixel of a different color. The output grid modifies the single pixel element. Specifically, the single pixel expands into a contiguous block of the same color. The size of this new block matches the size of the *other* non-white block present in the input. The new block is centered around the original position of the single pixel. The original multi-pixel block remains unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation_1d
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: object_1
        description: Contiguous block of non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - color: C1 (e.g., green, blue, magenta)
          - size: S (number of pixels, S > 1)
          - position: P1 (start and end indices)
      - type: object_2
        description: Single non-white pixel.
        properties:
          - color: C2 (e.g., red, magenta, gray)
          - size: 1
          - position: P2 (single index)
    relationships:
      - object_1 and object_2 are distinct in color (C1 != C2).
      - object_1 and object_2 are separated by background pixels.
    actions:
      - identify: object_1 and object_2.
      - measure: size S of object_1.
      - locate: position P2 of object_2.
      - transform: object_2 into a new object (object_3).
        properties_new_object:
          - color: C2 (same as object_2)
          - size: S (same as object_1)
          - position: Centered at P2, extending floor(S/2) pixels to the left and floor(S/2) pixels to the right.
      - maintain: object_1 and background pixels (unless overwritten by the new object_3).
    output_composition:
      - Contains object_1 (unchanged).
      - Contains the new object_3 (replacing object_2 and potentially some background pixels).
      - Contains the remaining background pixels.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (objects). There will be exactly two such objects.
    3.  Identify the object consisting of a single pixel. Record its color (C) and its index (P).
    4.  Identify the other object (which consists of multiple pixels). Record its size (S), which is the number of pixels it contains.
    5.  Calculate the start index for the new block: `start_index = P - floor(S / 2)`.
    6.  Calculate the end index for the new block: `end_index = P + floor(S / 2)`.
    7.  Modify the output grid: Fill the pixels from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) with the color C.

Transforms a 1D grid by expanding a single non-white pixel into a block.
The size of the new block is determined by the size of the other non-white
