task_type: 1d_grid_transformation
input_format: list_of_integers (1D grid)
output_format: list_of_integers (1D grid)
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - role: reference_object
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - count: 1 per input grid
      - min_size: 2
      - color: C1 (any non-white)
      - persistence: Unchanged in the output grid.
  - role: target_object
    description: A single non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - count: 1 per input grid
      - size: 1
      - color: C2 (any non-white, C2 can be same or different from C1)
      - persistence: Replaced in the output grid by the transformed_object.
  - role: transformed_object
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels replacing the target_object in the output.
    properties:
      - color: C2 (same as the target_object)
      - size: S (equal to the size of the reference_object)
      - position: Centered at the original index of the target_object.
relationships:
  - The reference_object and target_object are the only non-white elements in the input.
  - They are spatially separated by background pixels.
actions:
  - identify: Find the reference_object (size > 1) and the target_object (size = 1).
  - extract: Determine the size (S) of the reference_object.
  - extract: Determine the color (C2) and index (P) of the target_object.
  - calculate: Determine the start and end indices for the transformed_object.
      - start_index = P - floor(S / 2)
      - end_index = start_index + S - 1
  - generate: Create the output grid.
      - Copy the input grid.
      - Overwrite the pixels from start_index to end_index (inclusive, respecting grid boundaries) with color C2.
constraints:
  - Input grid always contains exactly one single-pixel object and one multi-pixel object.
  - Grid boundaries must be respected when placing the transformed_object.
