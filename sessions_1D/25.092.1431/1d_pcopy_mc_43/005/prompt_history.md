*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming a 1D grid (represented as a sequence of numbers). The input contains two distinct non-background (non-white) colored elements: one is a contiguous block of a certain color and size, and the other is a single pixel of a different color. The output grid modifies the single pixel element. Specifically, the single pixel expands into a contiguous block of the same color. The size of this new block matches the size of the *other* non-white block present in the input. The new block is centered around the original position of the single pixel. The original multi-pixel block remains unchanged.

      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: object_1
        description: Contiguous block of non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - color: C1 (e.g., green, blue, magenta)
          - size: S (number of pixels, S > 1)
          - position: P1 (start and end indices)
      - type: object_2
        description: Single non-white pixel.
        properties:
          - color: C2 (e.g., red, magenta, gray)
          - size: 1
          - position: P2 (single index)
    relationships:
      - object_1 and object_2 are distinct in color (C1 != C2).
      - object_1 and object_2 are separated by background pixels.
    actions:
      - identify: object_1 and object_2.
      - measure: size S of object_1.
      - locate: position P2 of object_2.
      - transform: object_2 into a new object (object_3).
        properties_new_object:
          - color: C2 (same as object_2)
          - size: S (same as object_1)
          - position: Centered at P2, extending floor(S/2) pixels to the left and floor(S/2) pixels to the right.
      - maintain: object_1 and background pixels (unless overwritten by the new object_3).
    output_composition:
      - Contains object_1 (unchanged).
      - Contains the new object_3 (replacing object_2 and potentially some background pixels).
      - Contains the remaining background pixels.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (objects). There will be exactly two such objects.
    3.  Identify the object consisting of a single pixel. Record its color (C) and its index (P).
    4.  Identify the other object (which consists of multiple pixels). Record its size (S), which is the number of pixels it contains.
    5.  Calculate the start index for the new block: `start_index = P - floor(S / 2)`.
    6.  Calculate the end index for the new block: `end_index = P + floor(S / 2)`.
    7.  Modify the output grid: Fill the pixels from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) with the color C.

**General Assessment:**

The provided code failed because it was designed to operate on 1D Python lists, while the ARC testing environment likely provides the input grids as 2D NumPy arrays. Even though the examples visually appear one-dimensional, they are represented as 1xN arrays. Iterating over a 1xN NumPy array yields the single row (which is itself an array), not individual pixel values. When the code attempts a boolean comparison (`pixel != 0`) where `pixel` is actually the entire row array, it results in a boolean array. Using this boolean array in an `if` condition leads to the observed `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`.

The strategy for resolution is to:
1.  Modify the code to explicitly handle NumPy arrays as input.
2.  Adjust the `find_objects` function to iterate through the *elements* of the relevant row (the first row, `grid[0]`, based on the examples) rather than iterating through the rows of the grid.
3.  Use NumPy's array copying mechanism (`np.copy`) instead of `copy.deepcopy`.
4.  Ensure all indexing and assignments operate correctly on the NumPy array.

The core logic identified previously (finding a single pixel and a multi-pixel block, then expanding the single pixel to the size of the multi-pixel block, centered at the original pixel's location) remains valid.

**Metrics Gathering:**

*   **Input Data Structure:** Confirmed via simulation and error analysis that the inputs are treated as 2D NumPy arrays.
*   **Example Shapes:** All training inputs are 1x32 NumPy arrays.
    *   `train_1`: `(1, 32)`
    *   `train_2`: `(1, 32)`
    *   `train_3`: `(1, 32)`
*   **Object Identification (Re-evaluation on `grid[0]`):**
    *   `train_1` (`grid[0]`): Object1={color:3, size:3, start:2}, Object2={color:2, size:1, start:9}. TargetPos=9, RefSize=3. Output range: `9 - floor(3/2)` to `9 - floor(3/2) + 3 - 1` => `9 - 1` to `8 + 2` => `8` to `10`. Output `grid[0, 8:11] = 2`. Matches example.
    *   `train_2` (`grid[0]`): Object1={color:1, size:3, start:1}, Object2={color:6, size:1, start:6}. TargetPos=6, RefSize=3. Output range: `6 - floor(3/2)` to `6 - floor(3/2) + 3 - 1` => `6 - 1` to `5 + 2` => `5` to `7`. Output `grid[0, 5:8] = 6`. Matches example.
    *   `train_3` (`grid[0]`): Object1={color:6, size:3, start:1}, Object2={color:5, size:1, start:6}. TargetPos=6, RefSize=3. Output range: `6 - floor(3/2)` to `6 - floor(3/2) + 3 - 1` => `6 - 1` to `5 + 2` => `5` to `7`. Output `grid[0, 5:8] = 5`. Matches example.
*   **Error Source:** The error occurs in `find_objects` when `pixel != 0` is evaluated inside the loop, because `pixel` holds an entire row array.

relationships:
  - reference_object and target_object exist simultaneously in the input.
  - They have different colors.
  - They are separated by background pixels.
transformation:
  action: resize_and_replace
  target: target_object
  reference_property: size (S) of reference_object
  result:
    description: A new contiguous horizontal block replacing the target_object and potentially adjacent background pixels.
    properties:
      color: C2 (same as target_object)
      size: S (same as reference_object)
      location: Centered horizontally at the original target_object's column index (P). The new block spans columns from `P - floor(S/2)` to `P - floor(S/2) + S - 1`.
  constraints:
    - The reference_object remains unchanged in the output grid.
    - Pixel modifications are confined within the grid boundaries.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid as a 2D NumPy array (assume it has exactly one row based on examples).
2.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output array.
3.  Extract the first row of the input array for analysis.
4.  Scan the first row to identify all contiguous segments (objects) of non-zero pixels. Record the color, start index, end index, and size (number of pixels) for each object.
5.  Identify among these objects:
    *   The 'target object': the one with size 1. Record its color (C) and column index (P).
    *   The 'reference object': the one with size greater than 1. Record its size (S).
6.  Check if exactly one target object and one reference object were found. If not, return the original copied grid.
7.  Calculate the starting column index for the new block: `start_col = P - floor(S / 2)`.
8.  Calculate the ending column index for the new block: `end_col = start_col + S - 1`.
9.  Modify the output array's first row: For each column index `j` from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive):
    *   Check if `j` is a valid column index within the grid's width.
    *   If valid, set the pixel at `(0, j)` in the output array to the target object's color (C).
10. Return the modified output array.
