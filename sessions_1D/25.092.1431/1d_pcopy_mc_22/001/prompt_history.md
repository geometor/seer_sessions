Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grids contain isolated single pixels of various colors (non-white) and sometimes existing horizontal lines of 3 pixels of a single color. The background is white (0). The output grids show that the single colored pixels have been expanded horizontally into 1x3 lines of the same color. The original single pixel becomes the center of the new 3-pixel line. Existing 1x3 lines in the input remain unchanged in the output. The relative vertical positions (rows) of the colored elements are preserved.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Size: Variable height and width (observed up to 4x32).
  - Background Color: White (0).

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
  - Observed Input Shapes:
    - Single pixel (1x1).
    - Horizontal line (1x3).
  - Colors: Various (Yellow, Gray, Green, Red, Blue, Orange observed).

Relationships:
  - Objects are typically separated by white pixels.
  - Objects maintain their row position from input to output.

Actions/Transformations:
  - Identify Objects: Locate all non-white pixel groups.
  - Condition Check: Determine if an object is a single pixel (1x1 shape).
  - Transformation Rule:
    - If an object is a single pixel:
      - Action: Expand it horizontally into a 1x3 line.
      - Color: Use the original pixel's color.
      - Position: The original pixel's location becomes the center cell of the 1x3 line. The line extends one cell to the left and one cell to the right.
      - Overwrite: Overwrites existing pixels (typically white) at the target locations.
    - If an object is not a single pixel (e.g., already a 1x3 line):
      - Action: No change. The object is copied directly to the output.
  - Background: White pixels remain white unless overwritten by an expanding single pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.
3.  If a cell contains a non-white pixel, check if it represents a single-pixel object. To do this, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals): if all neighbors are either outside the grid boundary or are white (0), then the cell is a single-pixel object.
4.  If a cell is identified as a single-pixel object with color C at position (row, col):
    *   Change the color of the cell at (row, col-1) to C in the output grid (if col-1 is within grid bounds).
    *   Change the color of the cell at (row, col) to C in the output grid (this might already be the case, but ensures correctness).
    *   Change the color of the cell at (row, col+1) to C in the output grid (if col+1 is within grid bounds).
5.  If a non-white cell is part of a larger object (i.e., it has non-white neighbors), do nothing during this iteration (the object will be copied from the initial grid copy).
6.  Continue iterating through all cells.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
