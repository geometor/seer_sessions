The original single pixel becomes the center of the new line. Existing shapes (like 1x3 lines) are preserved.\n\n1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.\n3. If a cell contains a non-white pixel, check if it represents a single-pixel object by examining its 8 neighbors. If all neighbors are either outside the grid boundary or are white (0), then the cell is a single-pixel object.\n4. If a cell is identified as a single-pixel object with color C at position (row, col):\n    - Change the color of the cell at (row, col-1) to C in the output grid (if col-1 is within grid bounds).\n    - Change the color of the cell at (row, col) to C in the output grid.\n    - Change the color of the cell at (row, col+1) to C in the output grid (if col+1 is within grid bounds).\n5.
