Grid Properties:
  - Size: Variable height and width (observed up to 4x32).
  - Background Color: White (0).

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
  - Observed Input Shapes:
    - Single pixel (1x1).
    - Horizontal line (1x3).
  - Colors: Various (Yellow, Gray, Green, Red, Blue, Orange observed).

Relationships:
  - Objects are typically separated by white pixels.
  - Objects maintain their row position from input to output.

Actions/Transformations:
  - Identify Objects: Locate all non-white pixel groups.
  - Condition Check: Determine if an object is a single pixel (1x1 shape).
  - Transformation Rule:
    - If an object is a single pixel:
      - Action: Expand it horizontally into a 1x3 line.
      - Color: Use the original pixel's color.
      - Position: The original pixel's location becomes the center cell of the 1x3 line. The line extends one cell to the left and one cell to the right.
      - Overwrite: Overwrites existing pixels (typically white) at the target locations.
    - If an object is not a single pixel (e.g., already a 1x3 line):
      - Action: No change. The object is copied directly to the output.
  - Background: White pixels remain white unless overwritten by an expanding single pixel.
