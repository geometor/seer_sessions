Identify the next block (color and length) starting from the current position.\n2. If the block is non-white (color > 0):\n   - If the block length is 1, append a block of the same color but length 3 to the output. Set a pending reduction of 2 for the next white block.\n   - If the block length is 3, append a block of the same color and length 3 to the output. Set a pending reduction of 1 for the next white block.\n   - (If other non-white lengths occur, copy the block as-is and set pending reduction to 0 - based on examples, only lengths 1 and 3 appear).\n3. If the block is white (color == 0):\n   - Calculate its effective length by subtracting the pending reduction (minimum length is 0).\n   - Append a white block of this effective length to the output.\n   - Reset the pending reduction to 0.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the entire input row is processed.\n5. After processing, if the total length of the constructed output row is less than the input row length, append white pixels (0) to the end until the lengths match.\n6. If the output row is longer (unlikely based on analysis), truncate it to match the input length.\n7. The final result is a 1xN grid containing the transformed row.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_block_length(row: np.ndarray, start_index: int) -> (int, int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the color and length of a contiguous block starting at a specific index.\n\n    Args:\n        row: The 1D numpy array representing the row.\n        start_index: The starting index to check from.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (color, length) of the contiguous block.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_cols = len(row)\n    if start_index >= n_cols:\n        return (0, 0) # Should not happen in normal flow\n\n    color = row[start_index]\n    length = 0\n    i = start_index\n    while i < n_cols and row[i] == color:\n        length += 1\n        i += 1\n    return color, length\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the refined rule involving block expansion/preservation\n    and subsequent white block reduction, ensuring output length matches input length.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid (expected shape (1, N)).\n\n    Returns:\n        A 2D numpy array representing the transformed grid with the same shape.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Assume input is always 1xN based on examples\n    if input_grid.shape[0] != 1:\n        # Handle unexpected input shape if necessary, for now proceed assuming 1 row\n        pass\n\n    input_row = input_grid[0]\n    n_cols = input_grid.shape[1]\n    output_row_list = []\n    pending_white_reduction = 0\n    i = 0 # Current index in the input row\n\n    # Iterate through the input row block by block\n    while i < n_cols:\n        # Find the next block's color and length\n        block_color, block_length = find_block_length(input_row, i)\n\n        if block_color == 0: # Current block is white\n            # Calculate effective length after reduction\n            effective_length = max(0, block_length - pending_white_reduction)\n            # Append the reduced white block\n            output_row_list.extend([0] * effective_length)\n            # Reset the reduction needed for the *next* white block\n            pending_white_reduction = 0\n        else: # Current block is non-white\n            original_length = block_length # Store original length for logic\n            # Apply transformation based on original block length\n            if original_length == 1:\n                # Expand block of length 1 to length 3\n                output_row_list.extend([block_color] * 3)\n                # Set reduction for the next white block\n                pending_white_reduction = 2\n            elif original_length == 3:\n                # Keep block of length 3 as is\n                output_row_list.extend([block_color] * 3)\n                # Set reduction for the next white block\n                pending_white_reduction = 1\n            else:\n                # Handle unexpected non-white block lengths (e.g., copy as-is)\n                # Based on examples, this case shouldn't be hit.\n                output_row_list.extend([block_color] * original_length)\n                pending_white_reduction = 0 # No reduction for unexpected lengths\n\n        # Advance the input index past the processed block\n        i += block_length\n\n    # Adjust final length to match input length\n    current_length = len(output_row_list)\n    delta = n_cols - current_length\n\n    if delta > 0:\n        # Append white pixels if output is too short\n        output_row_list.extend([0] * delta)\n    elif delta < 0:\n        # Truncate if output is too long (shouldn't happen based on analysis)\n        output_row_list = output_row_list[:n_cols]\n\n    # Create the output grid with the same shape as the input\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    output_grid[0, :] = np.array(output_row_list, dtype=int)\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
