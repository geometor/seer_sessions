*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output data are presented as single rows (1-dimensional grids).
    *   The grids contain segments of 'white' pixels (value 0) acting as background or separators.
    *   Interspersed within the white pixels are contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
    *   In the examples, these non-white blocks have lengths of either 1 or 3 pixels.
    *   The transformation rule appears to depend on the length of these non-white blocks.
    *   Blocks of length 1 in the input are replaced by blocks of the same color but with length 3 in the output. For example, a single 'yellow' (4) becomes 'yellow yellow yellow' (4 4 4).
    *   Blocks of length 3 in the input remain unchanged in the output. For example, 'red red red' (2 2 2) remains 'red red red' (2 2 2).
    *   The 'white' pixels (0) are preserved in their positions relative to the transformations applied to the colored blocks. The overall length of the row may change due to the expansion of length-1 blocks.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_dimensionality: 1
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        properties:
          - color (non-white)
          - length
    actions:
      - identify_blocks: Find contiguous sequences of non-white pixels in the input row.
      - transform_blocks:
          condition: block length is 1
          action: replace block with a new block of the same color but length 3.
          condition: block length is 3
          action: keep the block unchanged.
      - preserve_background: Copy white pixels directly from input to output.
    relationships:
      - Blocks are separated by one or more white pixels.
      - The relative order of blocks and white separators is maintained.
      - The output length depends on the number of length-1 blocks transformed.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty list or sequence to store the output row.
    2.  Iterate through the input row pixel by pixel from left to right.
    3.  If the current pixel is 'white' (0), append a 'white' pixel to the output sequence and move to the next input pixel.
    4.  If the current pixel is non-white:
        a.  Identify the color of the pixel.
        b.  Determine the length of the contiguous block of this same color starting at the current position.
        c.  If the block length is 1, append a sequence of three pixels of the identified color to the output sequence.
        d.  If the block length is 3, append the original sequence of three pixels (same color, length 3) to the output sequence.
        e.  Advance the iteration position in the input row past the identified block.
    5.  Repeat steps 3-4 until the end of the input row is reached.
    6.  The final output sequence represents the transformed row.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was a 1D list, while ARC grids are fundamentally 2D NumPy arrays. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms that operations intended for single elements were performed on array slices. The core logic of identifying contiguous non-white blocks in a sequence and transforming them based on length (1 -> 3, 3 -> 3) appears correct based on the visual examples, but needs to be implemented correctly for a 2D NumPy array input, specifically operating along the single row present in these examples. The strategy is to reload the data as NumPy arrays, verify their shapes, and rewrite the logic to process the first row of the 2D array.

*   **Metrics:**
    Let's inspect the shapes of the input/output grids for the training examples.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input 2D grid (which has 1 row and N columns).
    2.  Extract the first (and only) row of the input grid as a 1D sequence.
    3.  Initialize an empty list or sequence to build the output row.
    4.  Initialize a pointer `i` to 0, representing the current column index in the input row.
    5.  While the `output_row` being built has fewer elements than the number of columns `N` in the input grid:
        a.  Get the pixel value `p` at index `i` in the input row.
        b.  If `p` is 'white' (0):
            i.  Append 'white' (0) to the `output_row`.
            ii. Increment `i` by 1.
        c.  If `p` is non-white:
            i.  Identify the color `c` of the block (`c = p`).
            ii. Determine the length `L` of the contiguous horizontal block of color `c` starting at index `i`.
            iii. If `L` is 1: Append `c`, `c`, `c` (three pixels of color `c`) to the `output_row`.
            iv. If `L` is 3: Append `c`, `c`, `c` (the original three pixels) to the `output_row`.
            v.  Increment `i` by `L` (to move past the processed block in the input row).
    6.  Ensure the `output_row` has exactly `N` elements (padding with white if necessary, although the examples suggest it naturally results in the correct length).
    7.  Create a new 2D grid with the same shape as the input grid.
    8.  Place the contents of the `output_row` into the first row of the new 2D grid.
    9.  Return the new 2D grid.
