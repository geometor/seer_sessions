## General Assessment

The initial code failed because it incorrectly assumed the transformation process would inherently preserve the length of the input row or that forcing the length at the end was sufficient. The analysis of the failed examples reveals a more complex interaction between the transformation of non-white blocks and the length of the subsequent white (separator) blocks. The core block transformations (length 1 -> length 3, length 3 -> length 3) seem correct, but the spacing (number of white pixels) changes.

The metrics gathered using code execution show a consistent pattern:
1.  Non-white blocks of length 1 are replaced by blocks of length 3.
2.  Non-white blocks of length 3 remain length 3.
3.  The block of white pixels immediately *following* a non-white block is shortened.
4.  The amount of shortening depends on the *original* length of the preceding non-white block:
    *   If the preceding non-white block had length 1 (and thus expanded by 2), the following white block's length is reduced by 2.
    *   If the preceding non-white block had length 3 (and thus didn't expand), the following white block's length is reduced by 1.
5.  The total length of the output row must equal the total length of the input row. This means the *final* block of white pixels in the row might need adjustment (padding or truncation) after all other transformations and reductions have been applied to ensure the lengths match. In the training examples, this always involved adding one white pixel back to the final segment.

The strategy is to implement this refined logic: iterate through the input, identify blocks (both non-white and white), apply transformations to non-white blocks, calculate the reduction for the *next* white block based on the *current* non-white block's original length, apply the reduction (ensuring length doesn't go below zero), and build the output list. Finally, adjust the length of the last appended white block to ensure the total output length matches the input length.

## Metrics

Based on the code execution analysis comparing input and expected output blocks:

**Example 1:**
*   Input Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(3), NW(1), W(5), NW(1), W(5), NW(1), W(12)`
*   Output Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(2), NW(3), W(3), NW(3), W(3), NW(3), W(11)`
*   Transformations:
    *   `NW(3)` -> `NW(3)` (No expansion) -> Following `W(3)` reduced by 1 -> `W(2)`
    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(5)` reduced by 2 -> `W(3)`
    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(5)` reduced by 2 -> `W(3)`
    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(12)` reduced by 2 -> `W(10)` -> Adjusted to `W(11)` to maintain total length 32.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(3), NW(1), W(3), NW(1), W(20)`
*   Output Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(2), NW(3), W(1), NW(3), W(19)`
*   Transformations:
    *   `NW(3)` -> `NW(3)` (No expansion) -> Following `W(3)` reduced by 1 -> `W(2)`
    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(3)` reduced by 2 -> `W(1)`
    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(20)` reduced by 2 -> `W(18)` -> Adjusted to `W(19)` to maintain total length 32.

**Example 3:**
*   Input Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(2), NW(1), W(4), NW(1), W(20)`
*   Output Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(1), NW(3), W(2), NW(3), W(19)`
*   Transformations:
    *   `NW(3)` -> `NW(3)` (No expansion) -> Following `W(2)` reduced by 1 -> `W(1)`
    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(4)` reduced by 2 -> `W(2)`
    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(20)` reduced by 2 -> `W(18)` -> Adjusted to `W(19)` to maintain total length 32.

## Facts


```yaml
grid_dimensionality: 1 # All examples are 1xN grids
grid_size_preservation: true # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (1xN)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color (white=0 or non-white=1-9)
      - length (number of contiguous pixels of the same color)
actions:
  - identify_blocks: Scan the input row left-to-right to identify contiguous blocks of pixels (both white and non-white).
  - transform_non_white_blocks:
      condition: block is non-white and length is 1
      action: replace with a block of the same color but length 3.
      condition: block is non-white and length is 3
      action: keep the block unchanged (replace with same color, length 3).
  - reduce_following_white_block:
      trigger: after processing a non-white block.
      action: Determine the reduction amount based on the *original* length of the non-white block just processed.
          - If original length was 1, reduction is 2.
          - If original length was 3, reduction is 1.
      target: the *next* block in the input sequence, *if* it is a white block.
      effect: reduce the length of this white block by the calculated reduction amount (minimum length is 0).
  - construct_output: Append the (potentially transformed) non-white blocks and the (potentially reduced) white blocks sequentially to form the output row structure.
  - adjust_final_length: If the constructed output row's length does not match the input row's length, adjust the length of the *last appended white block* (by padding or truncating, typically padding with white pixels) to ensure the final output length equals the input length.
relationships:
  - Blocks are sequential and maintain their relative order.
  - The transformation of a non-white block influences the length of the white block immediately following it.
  - The overall length constraint links the transformations across the entire row.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty list, `output_row`, to store the transformed pixels.
2.  Initialize a variable `pending_white_reduction` to 0.
3.  Iterate through the input row using an index `i`.
4.  At the current index `i`, determine the color `c` and find the length `L` of the contiguous block of this color starting at `i`.
5.  **If the block is white (color 0):**
    a.  Calculate the effective length `L_eff = max(0, L - pending_white_reduction)`.
    b.  Append `L_eff` white pixels (0) to the `output_row`.
    c.  Reset `pending_white_reduction = 0`.
6.  **If the block is non-white:**
    a.  Record the original length `L_original = L`.
    b.  **If `L_original == 1`:**
        i.  Append 3 pixels of color `c` to the `output_row`.
        ii. Set `pending_white_reduction = 2`.
    c.  **Else if `L_original == 3`:**
        i.  Append 3 pixels of color `c` to the `output_row`.
        ii. Set `pending_white_reduction = 1`.
    d.  **(Optional: Handle other non-white lengths if necessary, though not seen in examples. Default might be to copy block as-is and set reduction to 0).**
7.  Advance the index `i` by the length `L` of the block just processed.
8.  Repeat steps 4-7 until the entire input row is processed (i.e., `i` reaches the end of the input row).
9.  Calculate the difference `delta = input_row_length - len(output_row)`.
10. **If `delta > 0`:** Append `delta` white pixels (0) to the `output_row`.
11. **If `delta < 0`:** Truncate the `output_row` to the `input_row_length`. (Note: This case didn't occur in examples, padding was always needed).
12. The final `output_row` is the result. Convert it back to the required grid format (e.g., a 1xN numpy array).
