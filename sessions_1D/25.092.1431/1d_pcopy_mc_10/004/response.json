            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code failed because it incorrectly assumed the transformation process would inherently preserve the length of the input row or that forcing the length at the end was sufficient. The analysis of the failed examples reveals a more complex interaction between the transformation of non-white blocks and the length of the subsequent white (separator) blocks. The core block transformations (length 1 -> length 3, length 3 -> length 3) seem correct, but the spacing (number of white pixels) changes.\n\nThe metrics gathered using code execution show a consistent pattern:\n1.  Non-white blocks of length 1 are replaced by blocks of length 3.\n2.  Non-white blocks of length 3 remain length 3.\n3.  The block of white pixels immediately *following* a non-white block is shortened.\n4.  The amount of shortening depends on the *original* length of the preceding non-white block:\n    *   If the preceding non-white block had length 1 (and thus expanded by 2), the following white block's length is reduced by 2.\n    *   If the preceding non-white block had length 3 (and thus didn't expand), the following white block's length is reduced by 1.\n5.  The total length of the output row must equal the total length of the input row. This means the *final* block of white pixels in the row might need adjustment (padding or truncation) after all other transformations and reductions have been applied to ensure the lengths match. In the training examples, this always involved adding one white pixel back to the final segment.\n\nThe strategy is to implement this refined logic: iterate through the input, identify blocks (both non-white and white), apply transformations to non-white blocks, calculate the reduction for the *next* white block based on the *current* non-white block's original length, apply the reduction (ensuring length doesn't go below zero), and build the output list. Finally, adjust the length of the last appended white block to ensure the total output length matches the input length.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the code execution analysis comparing input and expected output blocks:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(3), NW(1), W(5), NW(1), W(5), NW(1), W(12)`\n*   Output Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(2), NW(3), W(3), NW(3), W(3), NW(3), W(11)`\n*   Transformations:\n    *   `NW(3)` -> `NW(3)` (No expansion) -> Following `W(3)` reduced by 1 -> `W(2)`\n    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(5)` reduced by 2 -> `W(3)`\n    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(5)` reduced by 2 -> `W(3)`\n    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(12)` reduced by 2 -> `W(10)` -> Adjusted to `W(11)` to maintain total length 32.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(3), NW(1), W(3), NW(1), W(20)`\n*   Output Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(2), NW(3), W(1), NW(3), W(19)`\n*   Transformations:\n    *   `NW(3)` -> `NW(3)` (No expansion) -> Following `W(3)` reduced by 1 -> `W(2)`\n    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(3)` reduced by 2 -> `W(1)`\n    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(20)` reduced by 2 -> `W(18)` -> Adjusted to `W(19)` to maintain total length 32.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(2), NW(1), W(4), NW(1), W(20)`\n*   Output Blocks: `W(1), NW(3), W(1), NW(3), W(2), NW(3), W(19)`\n*   Transformations:\n    *   `NW(3)` -> `NW(3)` (No expansion) -> Following `W(2)` reduced by 1 -> `W(1)`\n    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(4)` reduced by 2 -> `W(2)`\n    *   `NW(1)` -> `NW(3)` (Expansion +2) -> Following `W(20)` reduced by 2 -> `W(18)` -> Adjusted to `W(19)` to maintain total length 32.\n\n(W = white block, NW = non-white block, Number in parentheses is length)\n\n## Facts\n\n"
