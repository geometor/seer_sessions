For example, a single 'yellow' (4) becomes 'yellow yellow yellow' (4 4 4).\n    *   Blocks of length 3 in the input remain unchanged in the output. For example, 'red red red' (2 2 2) remains 'red red red' (2 2 2).\n    *   The 'white' pixels (0) are preserved in their positions relative to the transformations applied to the colored blocks. The overall length of the row may change due to the expansion of length-1 blocks.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
