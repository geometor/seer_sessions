*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output data are presented as single rows (1-dimensional grids).
    *   The grids contain segments of 'white' pixels (value 0) acting as background or separators.
    *   Interspersed within the white pixels are contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
    *   In the examples, these non-white blocks have lengths of either 1 or 3 pixels.
    *   The transformation rule appears to depend on the length of these non-white blocks.
    *   Blocks of length 1 in the input are replaced by blocks of the same color but with length 3 in the output. For example, a single 'yellow' (4) becomes 'yellow yellow yellow' (4 4 4).
    *   Blocks of length 3 in the input remain unchanged in the output. For example, 'red red red' (2 2 2) remains 'red red red' (2 2 2).
    *   The 'white' pixels (0) are preserved in their positions relative to the transformations applied to the colored blocks. The overall length of the row may change due to the expansion of length-1 blocks.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_dimensionality: 1
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        properties:
          - color (non-white)
          - length
    actions:
      - identify_blocks: Find contiguous sequences of non-white pixels in the input row.
      - transform_blocks:
          condition: block length is 1
          action: replace block with a new block of the same color but length 3.
          condition: block length is 3
          action: keep the block unchanged.
      - preserve_background: Copy white pixels directly from input to output.
    relationships:
      - Blocks are separated by one or more white pixels.
      - The relative order of blocks and white separators is maintained.
      - The output length depends on the number of length-1 blocks transformed.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty list or sequence to store the output row.
    2.  Iterate through the input row pixel by pixel from left to right.
    3.  If the current pixel is 'white' (0), append a 'white' pixel to the output sequence and move to the next input pixel.
    4.  If the current pixel is non-white:
        a.  Identify the color of the pixel.
        b.  Determine the length of the contiguous block of this same color starting at the current position.
        c.  If the block length is 1, append a sequence of three pixels of the identified color to the output sequence.
        d.  If the block length is 3, append the original sequence of three pixels (same color, length 3) to the output sequence.
        e.  Advance the iteration position in the input row past the identified block.
    5.  Repeat steps 3-4 until the end of the input row is reached.
    6.  The final output sequence represents the transformed row.
