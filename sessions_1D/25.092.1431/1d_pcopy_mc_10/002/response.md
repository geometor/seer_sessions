*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was a 1D list, while ARC grids are fundamentally 2D NumPy arrays. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms that operations intended for single elements were performed on array slices. The core logic of identifying contiguous non-white blocks in a sequence and transforming them based on length (1 -> 3, 3 -> 3) appears correct based on the visual examples, but needs to be implemented correctly for a 2D NumPy array input, specifically operating along the single row present in these examples. The strategy is to reload the data as NumPy arrays, verify their shapes, and rewrite the logic to process the first row of the 2D array.

*   **Metrics:**
    Let's inspect the shapes of the input/output grids for the training examples.
    
``` python
    import numpy as np

    # Data from the examples provided previously (represented as lists of lists for 2D)
    train_1_input_list = [[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    train_1_output_list = [[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    train_2_input_list = [[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    train_2_output_list = [[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    train_3_input_list = [[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    train_3_output_list = [[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

    # Convert to NumPy arrays
    train_1_input = np.array(train_1_input_list, dtype=int)
    train_1_output = np.array(train_1_output_list, dtype=int)
    train_2_input = np.array(train_2_input_list, dtype=int)
    train_2_output = np.array(train_2_output_list, dtype=int)
    train_3_input = np.array(train_3_input_list, dtype=int)
    train_3_output = np.array(train_3_output_list, dtype=int)

    print(f"Train 1 Input Shape: {train_1_input.shape}")
    print(f"Train 1 Output Shape: {train_1_output.shape}")
    print(f"Train 2 Input Shape: {train_2_input.shape}")
    print(f"Train 2 Output Shape: {train_2_output.shape}")
    print(f"Train 3 Input Shape: {train_3_input.shape}")
    print(f"Train 3 Output Shape: {train_3_output.shape}")

    # Verify the transformation logic visually matches the first row
    # Example 1: Input row [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, ...] -> Output row [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, ...]
    #   - Block 2 2 2 (len 3) -> 2 2 2 (unchanged)
    #   - Block 4 (len 1) -> 4 4 4 (expanded)
    #   - Block 2 (len 1) -> 2 2 2 (expanded) - Wait, this block is length 3 in the output... Ah, no, the *second* block of 2 is length 3 in the output: [..., 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...].
    #   - Block 4 (len 1) -> 4 4 4 (expanded)
    # This confirms the rule: Length 1 -> Length 3; Length 3 -> Length 3

    # Example 2: Input row [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, ...] -> Output row [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, ...]
    #   - Block 1 1 1 (len 3) -> 1 1 1 (unchanged)
    #   - Block 9 (len 1) -> 9 9 9 (expanded)
    #   - Block 5 (len 1) -> 5 5 5 (expanded)

    # Example 3: Input row [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, ...] -> Output row [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, ...]
    #   - Block 6 6 6 (len 3) -> 6 6 6 (unchanged)
    #   - Block 7 (len 1) -> 7 7 7 (expanded)
    #   - Block 5 (len 1) -> 5 5 5 (expanded)

```
*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_dimensionality: 2
    grid_shape: (1, N) # Specifically (1, 32) in examples
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
        in_row: 0 # Operates on the first (and only) row
        properties:
          - color (non-white)
          - length (number of columns spanned)
    actions:
      - extract_row: Get the first row of the input grid.
      - identify_blocks: Scan the row horizontally to find contiguous sequences of non-white pixels.
      - transform_blocks:
          condition: block length is 1
          action: replace block with a new block of the same color but length 3.
          condition: block length is 3
          action: keep the block unchanged (same color, length 3).
      - preserve_background: Copy white pixels directly from the input row to the corresponding position in the output row.
      - construct_output_row: Assemble the transformed blocks and preserved background pixels into a new sequence.
      - format_output_grid: Create a new 2D NumPy array of the same shape as the input, containing the constructed output row.
    relationships:
      - Blocks are separated horizontally by one or more white pixels within the row.
      - The relative horizontal order of blocks and white separators is maintained.
      - The output grid shape matches the input grid shape. # Important observation from metrics
    constraints:
        - Input and Output grids have the same dimensions. # This might be specific to these examples or a general rule for this task.
        - Only block lengths 1 and 3 appear in the non-white segments of the training inputs.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input 2D grid (which has 1 row and N columns).
    2.  Extract the first (and only) row of the input grid as a 1D sequence.
    3.  Initialize an empty list or sequence to build the output row.
    4.  Initialize a pointer `i` to 0, representing the current column index in the input row.
    5.  While the `output_row` being built has fewer elements than the number of columns `N` in the input grid:
        a.  Get the pixel value `p` at index `i` in the input row.
        b.  If `p` is 'white' (0):
            i.  Append 'white' (0) to the `output_row`.
            ii. Increment `i` by 1.
        c.  If `p` is non-white:
            i.  Identify the color `c` of the block (`c = p`).
            ii. Determine the length `L` of the contiguous horizontal block of color `c` starting at index `i`.
            iii. If `L` is 1: Append `c`, `c`, `c` (three pixels of color `c`) to the `output_row`.
            iv. If `L` is 3: Append `c`, `c`, `c` (the original three pixels) to the `output_row`.
            v.  Increment `i` by `L` (to move past the processed block in the input row).
    6.  Ensure the `output_row` has exactly `N` elements (padding with white if necessary, although the examples suggest it naturally results in the correct length).
    7.  Create a new 2D grid with the same shape as the input grid.
    8.  Place the contents of the `output_row` into the first row of the new 2D grid.
    9.  Return the new 2D grid.
