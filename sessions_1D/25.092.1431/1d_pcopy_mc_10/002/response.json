The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" confirms that operations intended for single elements were performed on array slices. The core logic of identifying contiguous non-white blocks in a sequence and transforming them based on length (1 -> 3, 3 -> 3) appears correct based on the visual examples, but needs to be implemented correctly for a 2D NumPy array input, specifically operating along the single row present in these examples. The strategy is to reload the data as NumPy arrays, verify their shapes, and rewrite the logic to process the first row of the 2D array.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Let's inspect the shapes of the input/output grids for the training examples.\n    "
