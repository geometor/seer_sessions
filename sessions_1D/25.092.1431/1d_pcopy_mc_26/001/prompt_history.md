Okay, I will analyze the provided training example to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output are both 1-dimensional arrays (or grids of height 1) of colored pixels. The core transformation seems to involve identifying specific patterns in the input and modifying pixels based on those patterns.

Specifically, the input contains isolated non-white pixels (e.g., `8` at index 7, `9` at index 13, `5` at index 17) that are immediately surrounded by white pixels (`0`). In the output, these surrounding white pixels are changed to match the color of the central isolated pixel, effectively expanding the isolated pixel into a block of three identical colored pixels. Sequences of non-white pixels (like `4 4 4`) or non-white pixels adjacent to other non-white pixels do not trigger this change. The transformation operates locally based on the immediate neighborhood of single, isolated non-white pixels.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9, representing white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
      - position: index within the 1D array
  - type: pattern
    identifier: isolated_pixel
    definition: A non-white pixel (color C != 0) located at index `i`, where the pixel at `i-1` is white (0) and the pixel at `i+1` is white (0). Requires `i > 0` and `i < length - 1`.
actions:
  - name: color_change
    target: pixels
    condition: A pixel is white (0) and is immediately adjacent (left or right) to an 'isolated_pixel' pattern.
    effect: Change the target pixel's color to match the color (C) of the adjacent 'isolated_pixel'.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if their indices differ by 1.
  - type: dependency
    description: The color change applied to a white pixel depends on the color of the adjacent isolated non-white pixel.
constraints:
  - The transformation only applies to white pixels directly adjacent to a single, isolated non-white pixel.
  - Sequences of non-white pixels or non-white pixels adjacent to other non-white pixels do not cause changes in their neighbors.
  - Pixels not involved in the pattern remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array.
2.  Iterate through each pixel in the input array from the second pixel (index 1) up to the second-to-last pixel (index length - 2). Let the current index be `i` and the color of the pixel at this index be `C`.
3.  Check if the following condition is met:
    *   The pixel at index `i` is not white (`C != 0`).
    *   The pixel at index `i-1` is white (color `0`).
    *   The pixel at index `i+1` is white (color `0`).
4.  If the condition is met (meaning we found an isolated non-white pixel `C` surrounded by white pixels):
    *   Change the color of the pixel at index `i-1` in the *output* array to `C`.
    *   Change the color of the pixel at index `i+1` in the *output* array to `C`.
5.  After iterating through all applicable pixels, the resulting output array is the final result.
