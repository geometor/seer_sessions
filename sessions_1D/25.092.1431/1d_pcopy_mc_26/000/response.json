The core transformation seems to involve identifying specific patterns in the input and modifying pixels based on those patterns.\n\nSpecifically, the input contains isolated non-white pixels (e.g., `8` at index 7, `9` at index 13, `5` at index 17) that are immediately surrounded by white pixels (`0`). In the output, these surrounding white pixels are changed to match the color of the central isolated pixel, effectively expanding the isolated pixel into a block of three identical colored pixels. Sequences of non-white pixels (like `4 4 4`) or non-white pixels adjacent to other non-white pixels do not trigger this change. The transformation operates locally based on the immediate neighborhood of single, isolated non-white pixels.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
