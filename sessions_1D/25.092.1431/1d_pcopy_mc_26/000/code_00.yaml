task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9, representing white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
      - position: index within the 1D array
  - type: pattern
    identifier: isolated_pixel
    definition: A non-white pixel (color C != 0) located at index `i`, where the pixel at `i-1` is white (0) and the pixel at `i+1` is white (0). Requires `i > 0` and `i < length - 1`.
actions:
  - name: color_change
    target: pixels
    condition: A pixel is white (0) and is immediately adjacent (left or right) to an 'isolated_pixel' pattern.
    effect: Change the target pixel's color to match the color (C) of the adjacent 'isolated_pixel'.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if their indices differ by 1.
  - type: dependency
    description: The color change applied to a white pixel depends on the color of the adjacent isolated non-white pixel.
constraints:
  - The transformation only applies to white pixels directly adjacent to a single, isolated non-white pixel.
  - Sequences of non-white pixels or non-white pixels adjacent to other non-white pixels do not cause changes in their neighbors.
  - Pixels not involved in the pattern remain unchanged.
