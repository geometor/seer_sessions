Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data are presented as 1D arrays of 33 integers. Assuming they represent 2D grids, common factors of 33 are 3x11 or 11x3. Observing the patterns across the examples suggests a 3x11 structure is more likely, as the changes appear localized within a single row.
2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0), gray (5), yellow (4), and maroon (9).
3.  **Objects:** In each example (assuming 3x11 grid), the relevant action takes place in the first row. This row contains two distinct non-white objects against a white background:
    *   A horizontal line segment composed of three identical non-white pixels.
    *   A single isolated non-white pixel.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the single pixel object. This single pixel expands into a horizontal line segment of three pixels, using the same color as the original single pixel. This new line is centered horizontally where the single pixel was. The original three-pixel line object remains unchanged in the output. The rest of the grid (rows 1 and 2, which are entirely white) also remains unchanged.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Grid_Dimensions:
  Input_Height: 3
  Input_Width: 11
  Output_Height: 3
  Output_Width: 11
Background_Color: white (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Horizontal_Line
    Properties:
      - Length: 3 pixels
      - Color: Any non-white color (e.g., gray, yellow)
      - Location: Row 0
    Action: Preserved (copied directly to output at the same location)
  - Type: Single_Pixel
    Properties:
      - Size: 1x1 pixel
      - Color: Any non-white color (e.g., gray, yellow, maroon)
      - Location: Row 0, separated from the line object by at least one white pixel.
    Action: Expanded
Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the single non-white pixel in Row 0. Note its color (C) and column index (col_idx).
  - Identify: Locate the 3-pixel horizontal line in Row 0.
  - Transformation:
      1. Copy the entire input grid to the output grid.
      2. In the output grid's Row 0, replace the pixel at (0, col_idx - 1), (0, col_idx), and (0, col_idx + 1) with color C.
      3. The original 3-pixel line remains unchanged because it is copied initially and not overwritten by the expansion of the single pixel (based on example data).
      4. Rows 1 and 2 remain unchanged (all white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the 3x11 input grid.
2.  Scan the first row (row index 0) of the input grid to find the column index (`col_idx`) of the pixel that is non-white and does not have identical non-white neighbors (i.e., find the single isolated non-white pixel). Record its color (`C`).
3.  Modify the first row of the output grid: Set the color of the pixels at column indices `col_idx - 1`, `col_idx`, and `col_idx + 1` to the color `C`.
4.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their initial copied state.
5.  Return the final output grid.
