            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data are presented as 1D arrays of 33 integers. Assuming they represent 2D grids, common factors of 33 are 3x11 or 11x3. Observing the patterns across the examples suggests a 3x11 structure is more likely, as the changes appear localized within a single row.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0), gray (5), yellow (4), and maroon (9).\n3.  **Objects:** In each example (assuming 3x11 grid), the relevant action takes place in the first row. This row contains two distinct non-white objects against a white background:\n    *   A horizontal line segment composed of three identical non-white pixels.\n    *   A single isolated non-white pixel.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the single pixel object. This single pixel expands into a horizontal line segment of three pixels, using the same color as the original single pixel. This new line is centered horizontally where the single pixel was. The original three-pixel line object remains unchanged in the output. The rest of the grid (rows 1 and 2, which are entirely white) also remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Scan the first row (row index 0) of the input grid to find the column index (`col_idx`) of the pixel that is non-white and does not have identical non-white neighbors (i.e., find the single isolated non-white pixel). Record its color (`C`).\n3.  Modify the first row of the output grid: Set the color of the pixels at column indices `col_idx - 1`, `col_idx`, and `col_idx + 1` to the color `C`.\n4.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their initial copied state.\n5.  Return the final output grid."
