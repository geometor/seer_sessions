Grid_Dimensions:
  Input_Height: 3
  Input_Width: 11
  Output_Height: 3
  Output_Width: 11
Background_Color: white (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Horizontal_Line
    Properties:
      - Length: 3 pixels
      - Color: Any non-white color (e.g., gray, yellow)
      - Location: Row 0
    Action: Preserved (copied directly to output at the same location)
  - Type: Single_Pixel
    Properties:
      - Size: 1x1 pixel
      - Color: Any non-white color (e.g., gray, yellow, maroon)
      - Location: Row 0, separated from the line object by at least one white pixel.
    Action: Expanded
Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the single non-white pixel in Row 0. Note its color (C) and column index (col_idx).
  - Identify: Locate the 3-pixel horizontal line in Row 0.
  - Transformation:
      1. Copy the entire input grid to the output grid.
      2. In the output grid's Row 0, replace the pixel at (0, col_idx - 1), (0, col_idx), and (0, col_idx + 1) with color C.
      3. The original 3-pixel line remains unchanged because it is copied initially and not overwritten by the expansion of the single pixel (based on example data).
      4. Rows 1 and 2 remain unchanged (all white).
