*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output are presented as single rows of numbers, likely representing 1D grids or single rows of 2D grids.
    *   The grids contain white pixels (0) acting as background/separators.
    *   Colored pixels (non-zero values) appear either as single isolated pixels or as contiguous horizontal blocks of the same color.
    *   In the output, single colored pixels from the input are transformed into horizontal blocks of three pixels of the same color.
    *   Existing horizontal blocks (size > 1) of colored pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.
    *   The transformation appears to happen in place or sequentially from left to right. When a single pixel expands, it seems to replace the two pixels immediately to its right.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_representation: 1D or processed row-by-row
      background_color: 0 (white)
    objects:
      - type: colored_block
        definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more identical non-zero pixels.
        properties:
          - color: The pixel value (1-9)
          - size: The number of pixels in the sequence (length)
          - position: Starting index in the row
    transformation:
      actions:
        - description: Identify all 'colored_block' objects in the input grid.
        - description: Process objects based on size.
          condition: object 'size' == 1
          operation: Replace the single pixel and the two pixels immediately to its right with a 'colored_block' of the original object's color and size 3.
          condition: object 'size' > 1
          operation: Keep the object unchanged in the output.
        - description: Copy all background pixels (0) that are not overwritten by the expansion of size-1 objects.
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: The transformation depends on the horizontal size of contiguous colored blocks and affects adjacent pixels to the right for size-1 blocks.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid identical in size to the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white/0).
    2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally from left to right, keeping track of the current position (`idx`).
    3.  At each position `idx`, check the pixel color.
    4.  If the pixel is white (0), copy it to the output grid at position `idx` and advance `idx` by 1, unless this position has already been filled by a previous expansion step.
    5.  If the pixel is colored (non-zero):
        a.  Determine the size (length) of the contiguous block of this color starting at `idx`.
        b.  If the block size is 1:
            i.  Write the block's color to the output grid at positions `idx`, `idx + 1`, and `idx + 2`.
            ii. Advance `idx` by 3.
        c.  If the block size is greater than 1:
            i.  Copy the entire block of pixels as-is from the input to the output grid starting at position `idx`.
            ii. Advance `idx` by the size of the block.
    6.  Repeat steps 3-5 until the end of the input grid is reached.
    7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
