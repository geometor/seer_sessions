Grid_Structure: Assumed 1D array or single row.
Background_Color: white (0)

Input_Objects:
  - type: Horizontal_Block
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - color: non-white (e.g., yellow, red, blue)
      - composition: identical adjacent pixels
  - type: Single_Pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., azure, orange, yellow)
      - context: adjacent left and right pixels are white (0)

Output_Objects:
  - type: Horizontal_Block
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - color: non-white
      - composition: identical adjacent pixels

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Left and right neighbors are key to identifying Single_Pixels.

Actions_on_Objects:
  - Identify: Differentiate between Horizontal_Blocks and Single_Pixels based on adjacency.
  - Copy: Horizontal_Blocks from input are copied to the output at the same location.
  - Expand: Single_Pixels are expanded into Horizontal_Blocks.
  - Position_Shift: The expansion of a Single_Pixel at input index `i` results in a Horizontal_Block starting at output index `i-1`.
  - Overwrite: Background pixels adjacent to a Single_Pixel are overwritten during expansion.
