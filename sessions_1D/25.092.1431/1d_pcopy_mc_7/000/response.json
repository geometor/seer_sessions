For this analysis, we'll treat them as single rows.\n2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color. Other colors present are yellow (4), azure (8), red (2), orange (7), and blue (1).\n3.  **Input Objects:** The inputs contain distinct non-white elements:\n    *   Horizontal blocks of three identical colors (e.g., `4 4 4`, `2 2 2`, `1 1 1`).\n    *   Single, isolated non-white pixels (e.g., `8`, `7`, `4`). An isolated pixel here means it has white (0) pixels immediately to its left and right.\n4.  **Output Objects:** The outputs also contain horizontal blocks of three identical colors.\n5.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Existing 1x3 horizontal blocks in the input seem to remain unchanged in the output in the same positions.\n    *   Single, isolated non-white pixels in the input are transformed into 1x3 horizontal blocks of the *same color* in the output.\n    *   Crucially, the position of the new 1x3 block generated from a single pixel appears shifted. If a single pixel of color `C` is at index `i` in the input, the output has a `C C C` block starting at index `i-1`. This implies the original single pixel becomes the *middle* pixel of the new 3-pixel block.\n    *   Background (white) pixels remain white unless they are replaced as part of the expansion of a single pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
