An isolated pixel is defined as a non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are both white (0).\n2. For each identified isolated pixel:\n    a. Determine its color.\n    b. Expand this pixel horizontally into a 1x3 block of the same color, centered at the original pixel's position. This means the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors in the output grid will take on the color of the isolated pixel.\n3.
