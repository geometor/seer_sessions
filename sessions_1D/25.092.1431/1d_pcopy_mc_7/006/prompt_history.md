Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as 1D arrays, but they likely represent rows (or potentially columns, though row seems more probable given the transformations) of a 2D grid. For this analysis, we'll treat them as single rows.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color. Other colors present are yellow (4), azure (8), red (2), orange (7), and blue (1).
3.  **Input Objects:** The inputs contain distinct non-white elements:
    *   Horizontal blocks of three identical colors (e.g., `4 4 4`, `2 2 2`, `1 1 1`).
    *   Single, isolated non-white pixels (e.g., `8`, `7`, `4`). An isolated pixel here means it has white (0) pixels immediately to its left and right.
4.  **Output Objects:** The outputs also contain horizontal blocks of three identical colors.
5.  **Transformation:**
    *   Existing 1x3 horizontal blocks in the input seem to remain unchanged in the output in the same positions.
    *   Single, isolated non-white pixels in the input are transformed into 1x3 horizontal blocks of the *same color* in the output.
    *   Crucially, the position of the new 1x3 block generated from a single pixel appears shifted. If a single pixel of color `C` is at index `i` in the input, the output has a `C C C` block starting at index `i-1`. This implies the original single pixel becomes the *middle* pixel of the new 3-pixel block.
    *   Background (white) pixels remain white unless they are replaced as part of the expansion of a single pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Structure: Assumed 1D array or single row.
Background_Color: white (0)

Input_Objects:
  - type: Horizontal_Block
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - color: non-white (e.g., yellow, red, blue)
      - composition: identical adjacent pixels
  - type: Single_Pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., azure, orange, yellow)
      - context: adjacent left and right pixels are white (0)

Output_Objects:
  - type: Horizontal_Block
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - color: non-white
      - composition: identical adjacent pixels

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Left and right neighbors are key to identifying Single_Pixels.

Actions_on_Objects:
  - Identify: Differentiate between Horizontal_Blocks and Single_Pixels based on adjacency.
  - Copy: Horizontal_Blocks from input are copied to the output at the same location.
  - Expand: Single_Pixels are expanded into Horizontal_Blocks.
  - Position_Shift: The expansion of a Single_Pixel at input index `i` results in a Horizontal_Block starting at output index `i-1`.
  - Overwrite: Background pixels adjacent to a Single_Pixel are overwritten during expansion.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from the second element to the second-to-last element (index `i` from 1 to length-2).
3.  For each element at index `i`:
    a.  Check if the element's color is non-white (not 0).
    b.  Check if the element to the left (at index `i-1`) is white (0).
    c.  Check if the element to the right (at index `i+1`) is white (0).
4.  If all three conditions (3a, 3b, 3c) are true, then the element at index `i` is an "isolated single pixel":
    a.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at index `i`.
    b.  Modify the *output* grid: Set the color of the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to `C`.
5.  After iterating through all applicable elements, the final state of the output grid is the result. Elements not identified as isolated single pixels (including those part of original 1x3 blocks and background pixels not overwritten) retain their values from the initial copy.
```python
"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Identify isolated non-white pixels in the input grid. An isolated pixel is defined as a non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are both white (0).
2. For each identified isolated pixel:
    a. Determine its color.
    b. Expand this pixel horizontally into a 1x3 block of the same color, centered at the original pixel's position. This means the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors in the output grid will take on the color of the isolated pixel.
3. Pixels that are not identified as isolated non-white pixels, or pixels that are not overwritten by the expansion process, retain their original color from the input grid.
