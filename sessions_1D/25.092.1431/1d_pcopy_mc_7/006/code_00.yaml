Grid_Structure: 1D array (row) of pixels.
Background_Color: white (0)

Input_Objects:
  - type: Horizontal_Block
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - color: non-white
      - composition: identical adjacent pixels
      - context: May be adjacent to white or other blocks.
  - type: Isolated_Single_Pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - context: Immediate left and right neighbors are white (0).
      - location: Cannot be at the very first (index 0) or very last index.
  - type: Background_Pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

Output_Objects:
  - type: Horizontal_Block
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - color: non-white
      - composition: identical adjacent pixels
  - type: Background_Pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Critical for identifying Isolated_Single_Pixels (pattern: `0, C, 0` where C != 0).

Actions_on_Objects:
  - Identify: Scan the input grid for Isolated_Single_Pixels. Check pixels at indices `i` from 1 to length-2.
  - Condition: The pixel at `i` must be non-white, and pixels at `i-1` and `i+1` must be white (0).
  - Preserve: Pixels not identified as Isolated_Single_Pixels and not overwritten by expansion retain their original color. This includes existing Horizontal_Blocks and Background_Pixels not adjacent to an Isolated_Single_Pixel.
  - Expand: For each identified Isolated_Single_Pixel at input index `i` with color `C`:
      - Modify the output grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
      - Set the color of these three output grid pixels to `C`.
  - Overwrite: The expansion overwrites the original Isolated_Single_Pixel and its adjacent white neighbors in the output grid.
