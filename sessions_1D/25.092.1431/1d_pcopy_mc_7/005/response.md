Transformation Rule:
1. Identify isolated non-white pixels in the input grid (1D list). An isolated pixel is defined as a non-white pixel (value != 0) whose immediate left neighbor (index i-1) and immediate right neighbor (index i+1) are both white (value == 0). This check is only possible for pixels from index 1 to length-2.
2. For each identified isolated pixel located at index `i` with color `C` in the input grid:
    a. Expand this pixel horizontally into a 1x3 block of color `C` in the output grid.
    b. This expansion modifies the output grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`, setting them all to color `C`.
3. Pixels in the input grid that are not identified as isolated non-white pixels (e.g., pixels part of existing 1x3 blocks, boundary pixels, or white pixels not adjacent to an isolated pixel) retain their original color in the output grid, unless they are overwritten by the expansion of an adjacent isolated pixel.
