An isolated pixel is defined as a non-white pixel (value != 0) whose immediate left neighbor (index i-1) and immediate right neighbor (index i+1) are both white (value == 0). This check is only possible for pixels from index 1 to length-2.\n2. For each identified isolated pixel located at index `i` with color `C` in the input grid:\n    a. Expand this pixel horizontally into a 1x3 block of color `C` in the output grid.\n    b. This expansion modifies the output grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`, setting them all to color `C`.\n3. Pixels in the input grid that are not identified as isolated non-white pixels (e.g., pixels part of existing 1x3 blocks, boundary pixels, or white pixels not adjacent to an isolated pixel) retain their original color in the output grid, unless they are overwritten by the expansion of an adjacent isolated pixel.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\n\ndef is_isolated_pixel(grid, index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a pixel at a given index in the grid is isolated.\n    An isolated pixel is non-white and has white neighbors on both sides.\n    Assumes index is valid (not 0 or len(grid)-1).\n\n    Args:\n        grid (list): The input grid (1D list of integers).\n        index (int): The index of the pixel to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the pixel is isolated, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if current pixel is non-white\n    if grid[index] == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if neighbors are white (0)\n    left_neighbor = grid[index - 1]\n    right_neighbor = grid[index + 1]\n    \n    return left_neighbor == 0 and right_neighbor == 0\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by expanding isolated non-white pixels into 1x3 blocks.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list): A 1D list representing a row of pixels (integers 0-9).\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The transformed 1D list representing the output row.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input grid\n    # This ensures elements not explicitly changed retain their original value.\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n    grid_length = len(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through the input grid, checking for isolated pixels.\n    # Loop runs from index 1 up to (but not including) the last index (length-1)\n    # because boundary pixels cannot be isolated by definition (lack two neighbors).\n    for i in range(1, grid_length - 1):\n        \n        # Check if the pixel at index 'i' in the *input* grid is isolated using the helper function.\n        # We check against the original input grid to avoid interference from changes\n        # already made to the output grid during this loop.\n        if is_isolated_pixel(input_grid, i):\n            # Get the color of the isolated pixel from the input grid\n            color_to_expand = input_grid[i]\n            \n            # Expand the pixel in the *output* grid: \n            # Update the pixel itself and its immediate neighbors to the expansion color.\n            # This overwrites the original pixel and its white neighbors in the output grid.\n            output_grid[i - 1] = color_to_expand\n            output_grid[i] = color_to_expand\n            output_grid[i + 1] = color_to_expand\n\n    # Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
