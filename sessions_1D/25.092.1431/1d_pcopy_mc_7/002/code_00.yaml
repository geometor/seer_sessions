Grid_Structure: 1D array (representing a row).
Background_Color: white (0)

Input_Objects:
  - type: Horizontal_Block
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - color: non-white
      - composition: identical adjacent pixels
      - context: Flanked by non-matching pixels or grid boundary.
  - type: Isolated_Single_Pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white
      - context: Immediately adjacent left and right pixels are white (0).
  - type: Background_Pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

Output_Objects:
  - type: Horizontal_Block
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - color: non-white
      - composition: identical adjacent pixels

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Left and right neighbors determine if a non-white pixel is isolated.

Actions_on_Objects:
  - Identify: Differentiate between Horizontal_Blocks, Isolated_Single_Pixels, and other pixels based on color and adjacency.
  - Copy: Horizontal_Blocks from input are copied to the output at the same location. Background pixels not involved in expansion are also copied.
  - Expand: Isolated_Single_Pixels are expanded into Horizontal_Blocks of the same color.
  - Position_Center: The expansion of an Isolated_Single_Pixel at input index `i` results in a Horizontal_Block centered at index `i` (occupying indices `i-1`, `i`, `i+1`) in the output.
  - Overwrite: Background pixels adjacent to an Isolated_Single_Pixel are overwritten with the pixel's color during expansion.
