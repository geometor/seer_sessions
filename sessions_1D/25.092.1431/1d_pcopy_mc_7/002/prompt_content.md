Transformation Rule:
1. Identify isolated non-white pixels in the input grid. An isolated pixel is defined as a non-white pixel whose immediate left and right neighbors are both white (0).
2. For each identified isolated pixel:
    a. Determine its color.
    b. Expand this pixel horizontally into a 1x3 block of the same color, centered at the original pixel's position. This means the pixel itself and its immediate left and right neighbors in the output grid will take on the color of the isolated pixel.
3. Pixels that are not identified as isolated non-white pixels, or pixels that are not overwritten by the expansion process, retain their original color from the input grid.
