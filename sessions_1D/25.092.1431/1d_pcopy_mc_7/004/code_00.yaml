Data_Structure: 1D array (list) of integers representing pixels.
Background_Color: white (0)

Input_Objects:
  - type: Horizontal_Block_1x3
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - composition: three identical adjacent non-white pixels
      - context: bounded by white pixels or grid edges, or different colored pixels.
  - type: Isolated_Single_Pixel
    properties:
      - length: 1
      - color: non-white
      - context: immediate left neighbor is white (0) AND immediate right neighbor is white (0).

Output_Objects:
  - type: Horizontal_Block_1x3
    properties:
      - length: 3
      - composition: three identical adjacent non-white pixels

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Immediate left and right neighbors determine if a non-white pixel is "isolated".
  - Persistence: Input Horizontal_Block_1x3 objects persist unchanged in the output at the same location.
  - Transformation: Input Isolated_Single_Pixel objects are transformed into Output Horizontal_Block_1x3 objects.

Actions_on_Objects:
  - Identify: Scan input for Horizontal_Block_1x3 and Isolated_Single_Pixel objects.
  - Copy_Unchanged: Copy background pixels (0) and Horizontal_Block_1x3 objects from input to output.
  - Expand_Pixel: For each identified Isolated_Single_Pixel at input index `i` with color `C`:
      - Set output pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to color `C`.
  - Positioning: The expansion centers the new 1x3 block on the original position of the Isolated_Single_Pixel.

Implicit_Rules:
  - Boundary_Handling: The identification of isolated pixels requires checking neighbors, so the process effectively applies only to pixels from index 1 to length-2. Pixels at index 0 or length-1 cannot be "isolated" by this definition.
  - Overwriting: The expansion of an isolated pixel overwrites the original white pixels at indices `i-1` and `i+1` in the output.
