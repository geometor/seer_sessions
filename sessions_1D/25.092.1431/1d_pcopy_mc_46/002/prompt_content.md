Transformation Rule:

Process a 1D input grid (row vector).
Identify contiguous blocks of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
If a non-white block consists of a single pixel, replace it in the output with a block of three pixels of the same color.
If a non-white block consists of three identical pixels, copy it as is to the output.
White pixels (zeroes) are generally copied, but the expansion of single pixels takes precedence and might overwrite adjacent white pixels in the output construction.

The transformation is implemented by iterating through the input row and dynamically building the output row.
- If a white pixel is encountered, it's appended to the output.
- If a non-white pixel is encountered:
    - Check if it's isolated (next pixel is white or it's the end of the row).
        - If isolated, append its color three times to the output and advance the input index by 1.
        - If not isolated (meaning the next pixel is the same color, implying a block of 3 based on examples), append its color three times to the output and advance the input index by 3.
