The validation results clearly show this approach leads to incorrect positioning of the transformed blocks. The number of pixels in the output matches the input, but the values are shifted. Specifically, the expansion of single pixels (`C` -> `CCC`) and the copying of existing blocks (`CCC` -> `CCC`) in the dynamic build (`output_row_list.extend(...)`) do not account for the fixed positions expected in the output. The white pixels (`0`) handled by `output_row_list.append(0)` seem to be inserted incorrectly relative to the expanded/copied blocks. The strategy should shift from dynamic building to modifying a copy of the input array or mapping input indices directly to output indices, ensuring that the expansion of a single pixel at index `i` correctly places the three pixels at output indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    "

Ah, I see the actual output string `actual_2` provided in the previous turn's `Transformed Output:` block was truncated or incorrectly copied. It's missing the last few elements compared to the input/expected.\n\nLet's fix the `actual_2` and `actual_3` strings based on the visual representation from the prompt, assuming the code *did* produce an output of the correct length (32) even if the values were wrong. The dynamic code might have produced a different length, but the validation report said \"Size Correct: True\". This implies the padding/truncating step in the code worked to enforce length 32. The provided `Transformed Output` strings in the prompt must have been cut off.\n\nAssuming the dynamic code produced *some* output of length 32, the core issue remains the *values* due to the flawed append logic. Let's re-evaluate the logic based on the initial part of the actual output strings that *were* provided and the general failure pattern.\n\nThe metric analysis for Example 1 clearly shows the \"shift\" caused by the dynamic append logic. An extra '0' was inserted at index 7, pushing the expansion of '2' (from input index 8) to start at index 9 instead of 8. Similarly, the expansion of '6' (from input index 12) was pushed further right.\n\nThis reinforces the conclusion that a \"modify-copy\" approach is needed.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
