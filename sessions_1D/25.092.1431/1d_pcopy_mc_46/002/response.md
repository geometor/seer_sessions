*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial code attempted a dynamic construction of the output row. The validation results clearly show this approach leads to incorrect positioning of the transformed blocks. The number of pixels in the output matches the input, but the values are shifted. Specifically, the expansion of single pixels (`C` -> `CCC`) and the copying of existing blocks (`CCC` -> `CCC`) in the dynamic build (`output_row_list.extend(...)`) do not account for the fixed positions expected in the output. The white pixels (`0`) handled by `output_row_list.append(0)` seem to be inserted incorrectly relative to the expanded/copied blocks. The strategy should shift from dynamic building to modifying a copy of the input array or mapping input indices directly to output indices, ensuring that the expansion of a single pixel at index `i` correctly places the three pixels at output indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`.

Hmm, the code execution failed on the second example. Let's check the input/output strings for Example 2. Ah, I see the actual output string `actual_2` provided in the previous turn's `Transformed Output:` block was truncated or incorrectly copied. It's missing the last few elements compared to the input/expected.

Let's fix the `actual_2` and `actual_3` strings based on the visual representation from the prompt, assuming the code *did* produce an output of the correct length (32) even if the values were wrong. The dynamic code might have produced a different length, but the validation report said "Size Correct: True". This implies the padding/truncating step in the code worked to enforce length 32. The provided `Transformed Output` strings in the prompt must have been cut off.

Assuming the dynamic code produced *some* output of length 32, the core issue remains the *values* due to the flawed append logic. Let's re-evaluate the logic based on the initial part of the actual output strings that *were* provided and the general failure pattern.

The metric analysis for Example 1 clearly shows the "shift" caused by the dynamic append logic. An extra '0' was inserted at index 7, pushing the expansion of '2' (from input index 8) to start at index 9 instead of 8. Similarly, the expansion of '6' (from input index 12) was pushed further right.

This reinforces the conclusion that a "modify-copy" approach is needed.

        description: Modify the output row by setting the color `C` at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`.
        conditions:
          - Pixel at `input_row[i]` is a single non-white pixel.
          - Indices `i`, `i+1`, `i+2` must be within the bounds of the row (0 to n-1).
        effect: `output_row[i] = C`, `output_row[i+1] = C`, `output_row[i+2] = C`. This overwrites whatever was previously at these positions in the copied output.
    goal: Transform the input row into an output row of the same size where every non-white pixel identified as 'single' in the input is expanded into a three-pixel block starting at the original pixel's position, overwriting the subsequent two positions. Existing three-pixel blocks and white pixels remain unchanged unless overwritten by an expansion.
    constraints:
      - Based on examples, non-white blocks in the input are either single pixels or blocks of three identical pixels.
      - Expansion only occurs if there is space (i.e., index `i+2` is within the grid bounds).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input row (a 1D array of integers). Let its length be `N`.
    2.  Create a new row, `output_row`, initially identical to the `input_row`.
    3.  Iterate through the `input_row` using an index `i` from 0 to `N-1`.
    4.  For each index `i`, check if the pixel `input_row[i]` represents a "single non-white pixel". A pixel at index `i` with color `C` (where `C != 0`) is considered "single" if:
        *   It is the first pixel (`i == 0`) and either `N == 1` or the next pixel `input_row[i+1]` is white (0).
        *   It is the last pixel (`i == N-1`) and the previous pixel `input_row[i-1]` is white (0).
        *   It is an intermediate pixel (`0 < i < N-1`) and both the previous pixel `input_row[i-1]` and the next pixel `input_row[i+1]` are white (0).
    5.  If `input_row[i]` is identified as a single non-white pixel with color `C`:
        a.  Check if there is enough space to write three pixels, meaning check if index `i+2` is less than `N`.
        b.  If there is enough space (`i + 2 < N`), modify the `output_row` by setting the values at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` all to color `C`.
    6.  After iterating through all indices `i` from 0 to `N-1`, the `output_row` contains the final transformed result. Return `output_row`.
