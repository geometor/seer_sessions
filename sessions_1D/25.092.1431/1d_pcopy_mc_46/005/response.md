"""
Transformation Rule:

The transformation operates on a 1D input grid (row vector).
It identifies a specific pattern in the input: a non-white pixel (color C, where C != 0) that is immediately preceded and succeeded by a white pixel (color 0). This pattern looks like [0, C, 0].
For every occurrence of this pattern found in the *original* input grid, centered at index `i`, the corresponding pixels in the output grid at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are all set to the color C.
Pixels in the output grid retain their original value from the input unless they are part of one of these [C, C, C] replacement sequences triggered by a [0, C, 0] pattern in the input.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
