Transformation Rule:

Process a 1D input grid (row vector).
Identify non-white pixels (color C != 0) that are "single", meaning they are not adjacent horizontally to any other non-white pixel in the input grid.
For each identified single pixel at index `i` with color C, if there is enough space (i.e., `i + 2` is a valid index within the grid bounds), replace the pixels at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` in an output grid with the color C.
Pixels that are part of multi-pixel blocks (like the 3-pixel blocks in the examples) or white pixels are initially copied to the output grid but may be overwritten by the expansion of a single pixel.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
