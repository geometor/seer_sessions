*   **Perception:** The task operates on a single row (1xN grid). The input contains sequences of white pixels (color 0) and isolated blocks of non-white pixels. Some non-white blocks consist of a single pixel, while others consist of three identical pixels. The transformation modifies the single-pixel blocks. Specifically, each single non-white pixel in the input is expanded into a sequence of three identical pixels of that same color in the output. Blocks that already consist of three pixels remain unchanged. White pixels remain unchanged unless they are replaced by the expansion of an adjacent single pixel.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty output row with the same dimensions as the input row, filled with white pixels (0).
    2.  Iterate through the input row from left to right.
    3.  If the current pixel is white (0), skip it unless it's part of an expansion from the previous step.
    4.  If the current pixel is non-white:
        a.  Check if it is part of a single-pixel block (i.e., the pixel to its left and right are either white or off the grid boundary).
        b.  If it is a single-pixel block of color C:
            i.  Place three pixels of color C into the output row, centered approximately at the original pixel's position (specifically, write C at the current position, the position before it, and the position after it). Adjust index handling for edge cases. *Correction based on examples*: The expansion seems to replace the single pixel and the two following pixels. Let's re-examine the examples.
            *   train\_1: `... 0 2 0 ...` becomes `... 0 2 2 2 ...` - Replaces the `2` and the two following `0`s.
            *   train\_1: `... 0 6 0 ...` becomes `... 0 6 6 6 ...` - Replaces the `6` and the two following `0`s.
            *   train\_2: `... 0 9 0 ...` becomes `... 0 9 9 9 ...`
            *   train\_2: `... 0 6 0 ...` becomes `... 0 6 6 6 ...`
            *   train\_2: `... 0 2 0 ...` becomes `... 0 2 2 2 ...`
            *   train\_3: `... 0 1 0 ...` becomes `... 0 1 1 1 ...`
            *   train\_3: `... 0 5 0 ...` becomes `... 0 5 5 5 ...`
            *   train\_3: `... 0 2 0 ...` becomes `... 0 2 2 2 ...`
            *Revised Step 4.b.i:* Place three pixels of color C into the output row, starting at the current pixel's position and extending two positions to the right.
            ii. Advance the iteration index by 3 to move past the newly written block.
        c.  If it is part of a block longer than one pixel (specifically, length 3 in the examples):
            i.  Copy the entire block (e.g., the three identical pixels) to the corresponding positions in the output row.
            ii. Advance the iteration index by the length of the block (e.g., 3).
        d. If the current pixel is white (0) and was not handled by an expansion, copy it to the output row and advance the iteration index by 1.

    **Revised Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial output row.
    2.  Iterate through the input row using an index `i` from 0 up to `length - 1`.
    3.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at index `i`.
    4.  If `C` is not white (0):
        a.  Check if this pixel is the start of a block of length 1. This means `input[i]` is non-white, and either `i == length - 1` or `input[i+1]` is white (0).
        b.  If it is a block of length 1:
            i.  Ensure there is space to write three pixels (i.e., `i + 2 < length`).
            ii. Set the pixels in the output row at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` to color `C`.
            iii. *It seems simpler to build the output row dynamically rather than modifying a copy.*

    **Revised Natural Language Program (Building Output Dynamically):**
    1.  Initialize an empty list `output_row`.
    2.  Initialize an index `i = 0`.
    3.  While `i` is less than the length of the input row:
        a.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `input_row[i]`.
        b.  If `C` is white (0):
            i.  Append `C` to `output_row`.
            ii. Increment `i` by 1.
        c.  If `C` is non-white:
            i.  Check if it's a single pixel block: (`i == length - 1` or `input_row[i+1] == 0`).
            ii. If it is a single pixel block:
                - Append `C`, `C`, `C` to `output_row`.
                - Increment `i` by 1 (to move past the single pixel processed).
            iii. If it's not a single pixel block (meaning `input_row[i+1]` is also `C`):
                - Assume blocks are always length 3 based on examples. Append `C`, `C`, `C` to `output_row`.
                - Increment `i` by 3 (to move past the block of three).
    4.  Return `output_row`.

    *Self-Correction:* The dynamic building approach might mess up spacing if the expansion overwrites existing non-zero pixels. Modifying a copy seems safer.

    **Final Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input row, let's call it `output_row`.
    2.  Iterate through the input row using an index `i` from 0 up to `length - 3`. (We need lookahead).
    3.  Consider the pixel `input_row[i]`.
    4.  If `input_row[i]` is non-white (let its color be `C`) AND `input_row[i+1]` is white (0) AND (`i == 0` OR `input_row[i-1]` is white (0)):
        a.  This identifies a single non-white pixel `C` at index `i`.
        b.  Modify `output_row`: set `output_row[i] = C`, `output_row[i+1] = C`, `output_row[i+2] = C`.
    5.  Return the modified `output_row`.

    *Self-Correction:* This doesn't handle edge cases (end of the row) well and might re-process pixels. Let's try a state-based scan.

    **Final Final Natural Language Program:**
    1. Create an output row initialized as a copy of the input row.
    2. Iterate through the indices `i` from 0 to `length - 1` of the input row.
    3. At each index `i`, check if the pixel `input_row[i]` represents a single-pixel object. A pixel at index `i` with color `C != 0` is a single-pixel object if:
        a. It's the first pixel (`i == 0`) AND the next pixel `input_row[i+1]` is white (0) (or `i` is the only pixel).
        b. It's the last pixel (`i == length - 1`) AND the previous pixel `input_row[i-1]` is white (0).
        c. It's an intermediate pixel (`0 < i < length - 1`) AND both the previous pixel `input_row[i-1]` and the next pixel `input_row[i+1]` are white (0).
    4. If `input_row[i]` is identified as a single-pixel object of color `C`:
        a. Check if there is enough space to expand (i.e., `i + 2 < length`).
        b. If there is space, modify the `output_row` by setting `output_row[i] = C`, `output_row[i+1] = C`, `output_row[i+2] = C`.
    5. After iterating through all possible starting indices `i`, return the `output_row`. Note: This approach requires careful handling to avoid conflicts if expansions overlap or modify pixels that would later be checked. A single pass that builds the output might be cleaner.

    **Let's try the dynamic build again, carefully:**
    1. Initialize an empty list `output_row`.
    2. Initialize an index `i = 0`.
    3. While `i` is less than the length of the input row:
        a. Let `current_pixel_color = input_row[i]`.
        b. If `current_pixel_color` is white (0):
            i. Append 0 to `output_row`.
            ii. Increment `i` by 1.
        c. If `current_pixel_color` is non-white:
            i. Check if it's a single pixel block: (`i == length - 1` or `input_row[i+1] == 0`).
            ii. If it is a single pixel block:
                - Append `current_pixel_color` three times to `output_row`.
                - Increment `i` by 1.
            iii. If it's not a single pixel block (which implies, based on examples, it's the start of a 3-pixel block):
                - Append `current_pixel_color` three times to `output_row`.
                - Increment `i` by 3 (to skip the entire block in the input).
    4. Ensure the `output_row` has the same length as the input row. If it's shorter, pad with white (0). If it's longer (which shouldn't happen with this logic if input constraints hold), truncate. Given the examples, the length seems preserved.
    5. Return `output_row`.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial code attempted a dynamic construction of the output row. The validation results clearly show this approach leads to incorrect positioning of the transformed blocks. The number of pixels in the output matches the input, but the values are shifted. Specifically, the expansion of single pixels (`C` -> `CCC`) and the copying of existing blocks (`CCC` -> `CCC`) in the dynamic build (`output_row_list.extend(...)`) do not account for the fixed positions expected in the output. The white pixels (`0`) handled by `output_row_list.append(0)` seem to be inserted incorrectly relative to the expanded/copied blocks. The strategy should shift from dynamic building to modifying a copy of the input array or mapping input indices directly to output indices, ensuring that the expansion of a single pixel at index `i` correctly places the three pixels at output indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`.

Hmm, the code execution failed on the second example. Let's check the input/output strings for Example 2. Ah, I see the actual output string `actual_2` provided in the previous turn's `Transformed Output:` block was truncated or incorrectly copied. It's missing the last few elements compared to the input/expected.

Let's fix the `actual_2` and `actual_3` strings based on the visual representation from the prompt, assuming the code *did* produce an output of the correct length (32) even if the values were wrong. The dynamic code might have produced a different length, but the validation report said "Size Correct: True". This implies the padding/truncating step in the code worked to enforce length 32. The provided `Transformed Output` strings in the prompt must have been cut off.

Assuming the dynamic code produced *some* output of length 32, the core issue remains the *values* due to the flawed append logic. Let's re-evaluate the logic based on the initial part of the actual output strings that *were* provided and the general failure pattern.

The metric analysis for Example 1 clearly shows the "shift" caused by the dynamic append logic. An extra '0' was inserted at index 7, pushing the expansion of '2' (from input index 8) to start at index 9 instead of 8. Similarly, the expansion of '6' (from input index 12) was pushed further right.

This reinforces the conclusion that a "modify-copy" approach is needed.

        description: Modify the output row by setting the color `C` at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`.
        conditions:
          - Pixel at `input_row[i]` is a single non-white pixel.
          - Indices `i`, `i+1`, `i+2` must be within the bounds of the row (0 to n-1).
        effect: `output_row[i] = C`, `output_row[i+1] = C`, `output_row[i+2] = C`. This overwrites whatever was previously at these positions in the copied output.
    goal: Transform the input row into an output row of the same size where every non-white pixel identified as 'single' in the input is expanded into a three-pixel block starting at the original pixel's position, overwriting the subsequent two positions. Existing three-pixel blocks and white pixels remain unchanged unless overwritten by an expansion.
    constraints:
      - Based on examples, non-white blocks in the input are either single pixels or blocks of three identical pixels.
      - Expansion only occurs if there is space (i.e., index `i+2` is within the grid bounds).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input row (a 1D array of integers). Let its length be `N`.
    2.  Create a new row, `output_row`, initially identical to the `input_row`.
    3.  Iterate through the `input_row` using an index `i` from 0 to `N-1`.
    4.  For each index `i`, check if the pixel `input_row[i]` represents a "single non-white pixel". A pixel at index `i` with color `C` (where `C != 0`) is considered "single" if:
        *   It is the first pixel (`i == 0`) and either `N == 1` or the next pixel `input_row[i+1]` is white (0).
        *   It is the last pixel (`i == N-1`) and the previous pixel `input_row[i-1]` is white (0).
        *   It is an intermediate pixel (`0 < i < N-1`) and both the previous pixel `input_row[i-1]` and the next pixel `input_row[i+1]` are white (0).
    5.  If `input_row[i]` is identified as a single non-white pixel with color `C`:
        a.  Check if there is enough space to write three pixels, meaning check if index `i+2` is less than `N`.
        b.  If there is enough space (`i + 2 < N`), modify the `output_row` by setting the values at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` all to color `C`.
    6.  After iterating through all indices `i` from 0 to `N-1`, the `output_row` contains the final transformed result. Return `output_row`.
