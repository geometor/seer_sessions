Some non-white blocks consist of a single pixel, while others consist of three identical pixels. The transformation modifies the single-pixel blocks. Specifically, each single non-white pixel in the input is expanded into a sequence of three identical pixels of that same color in the output. Blocks that already consist of three pixels remain unchanged. White pixels remain unchanged unless they are replaced by the expansion of an adjacent single pixel.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Iterate through the input row from left to right.\n    3.  If the current pixel is white (0), skip it unless it's part of an expansion from the previous step.\n    4.  If the current pixel is non-white:\n        a.  Check if it is part of a single-pixel block (i.e., the pixel to its left and right are either white or off the grid boundary).\n        b.  If it is a single-pixel block of color C:\n            i.  Place three pixels of color C into the output row, centered approximately at the original pixel's position (specifically, write C at the current position, the position before it, and the position after it). Adjust index handling for edge cases. *Correction based on examples*: The expansion seems to replace the single pixel and the two following pixels. Let's re-examine the examples.\n            *   train\\_1: `... 0 2 0 ...` becomes `... 0 2 2 2 ...` - Replaces the `2` and the two following `0`s.\n            *   train\\_1: `... 0 6 0 ...` becomes `... 0 6 6 6 ...` - Replaces the `6` and the two following `0`s.\n            *   train\\_2: `... 0 9 0 ...` becomes `... 0 9 9 9 ...`\n            *   train\\_2: `... 0 6 0 ...` becomes `... 0 6 6 6 ...`\n            *   train\\_2: `... 0 2 0 ...` becomes `... 0 2 2 2 ...`\n            *   train\\_3: `... 0 1 0 ...` becomes `... 0 1 1 1 ...`\n            *   train\\_3: `... 0 5 0 ...` becomes `... 0 5 5 5 ...`\n            *   train\\_3: `... 0 2 0 ...` becomes `... 0 2 2 2 ...`\n            *Revised Step 4.b.i:* Place three pixels of color C into the output row, starting at the current pixel's position and extending two positions to the right.\n            ii. Advance the iteration index by 3 to move past the newly written block.\n        c.  If it is part of a block longer than one pixel (specifically, length 3 in the examples):\n            i.  Copy the entire block (e.g., the three identical pixels) to the corresponding positions in the output row.\n            ii. Advance the iteration index by the length of the block (e.g., 3).\n        d. If the current pixel is white (0) and was not handled by an expansion, copy it to the output row and advance the iteration index by 1.\n\n    **Revised Natural Language Program:**\n    1.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial output row.\n    2.  Iterate through the input row using an index `i` from 0 up to `length - 1`.\n    3.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at index `i`.\n    4.  If `C` is not white (0):\n        a.  Check if this pixel is the start of a block of length 1. This means `input[i]` is non-white, and either `i == length - 1` or `input[i+1]` is white (0).\n        b.  If it is a block of length 1:\n            i.  Ensure there is space to write three pixels (i.e., `i + 2 < length`).\n            ii. Set the pixels in the output row at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` to color `C`.\n            iii. *It seems simpler to build the output row dynamically rather than modifying a copy.*\n\n    **Revised Natural Language Program (Building Output Dynamically):**\n    1.  Initialize an empty list `output_row`.\n    2.  Initialize an index `i = 0`.\n    3.  While `i` is less than the length of the input row:\n        a.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `input_row[i]`.\n        b.  If `C` is white (0):\n            i.  Append `C` to `output_row`.\n            ii. Increment `i` by 1.\n        c.  If `C` is non-white:\n            i.  Check if it's a single pixel block: (`i == length - 1` or `input_row[i+1] == 0`).\n            ii. If it is a single pixel block:\n                - Append `C`, `C`, `C` to `output_row`.\n                - Increment `i` by 1 (to move past the single pixel processed).\n            iii. If it's not a single pixel block (meaning `input_row[i+1]` is also `C`):\n                - Assume blocks are always length 3 based on examples. Append `C`, `C`, `C` to `output_row`.\n                - Increment `i` by 3 (to move past the block of three).\n    4.  Return `output_row`.\n\n    *Self-Correction:* The dynamic building approach might mess up spacing if the expansion overwrites existing non-zero pixels. Modifying a copy seems safer.\n\n    **Final Natural Language Program:**\n    1.  Create a copy of the input row, let's call it `output_row`.\n    2.  Iterate through the input row using an index `i` from 0 up to `length - 3`. (We need lookahead).\n    3.  Consider the pixel `input_row[i]`.\n    4.  If `input_row[i]` is non-white (let its color be `C`) AND `input_row[i+1]` is white (0) AND (`i == 0` OR `input_row[i-1]` is white (0)):\n        a.  This identifies a single non-white pixel `C` at index `i`.\n        b.  Modify `output_row`: set `output_row[i] = C`, `output_row[i+1] = C`, `output_row[i+2] = C`.\n    5.  Return the modified `output_row`.\n\n    *Self-Correction:* This doesn't handle edge cases (end of the row) well and might re-process pixels. Let's try a state-based scan.\n\n    **Final Final Natural Language Program:**\n    1. Create an output row initialized as a copy of the input row.\n    2. Iterate through the indices `i` from 0 to `length - 1` of the input row.\n    3. At each index `i`, check if the pixel `input_row[i]` represents a single-pixel object. A pixel at index `i` with color `C != 0` is a single-pixel object if:\n        a. It's the first pixel (`i == 0`) AND the next pixel `input_row[i+1]` is white (0) (or `i` is the only pixel).\n        b. It's the last pixel (`i == length - 1`) AND the previous pixel `input_row[i-1]` is white (0).\n        c. It's an intermediate pixel (`0 < i < length - 1`) AND both the previous pixel `input_row[i-1]` and the next pixel `input_row[i+1]` are white (0).\n    4. If `input_row[i]` is identified as a single-pixel object of color `C`:\n        a. Check if there is enough space to expand (i.e., `i + 2 < length`).\n        b. If there is space, modify the `output_row` by setting `output_row[i] = C`, `output_row[i+1] = C`, `output_row[i+2] = C`.\n    5. After iterating through all possible starting indices `i`, return the `output_row`. Note: This approach requires careful handling to avoid conflicts if expansions overlap or modify pixels that would later be checked. A single pass that builds the output might be cleaner.\n\n    **Let's try the dynamic build again, carefully:**\n    1. Initialize an empty list `output_row`.\n    2. Initialize an index `i = 0`.\n    3. While `i` is less than the length of the input row:\n        a. Let `current_pixel_color = input_row[i]`.\n        b. If `current_pixel_color` is white (0):\n            i. Append 0 to `output_row`.\n            ii. Increment `i` by 1.\n        c. If `current_pixel_color` is non-white:\n            i. Check if it's a single pixel block: (`i == length - 1` or `input_row[i+1] == 0`).\n            ii. If it is a single pixel block:\n                - Append `current_pixel_color` three times to `output_row`.\n                - Increment `i` by 1.\n            iii. If it's not a single pixel block (which implies, based on examples, it's the start of a 3-pixel block):\n                - Append `current_pixel_color` three times to `output_row`.\n                - Increment `i` by 3 (to skip the entire block in the input).\n    4. Ensure the `output_row` has the same length as the input row. If it's shorter, pad with white (0). If it's longer (which shouldn't happen with this logic if input constraints hold), truncate. Given the examples, the length seems preserved.\n    5. Return `output_row`."
