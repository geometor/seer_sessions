It identifies specific patterns of non-white pixels (colors) and modifies them based on their context. White pixels (0) seem to act as background or empty space. The core transformation involves expanding isolated, single, non-white pixels into horizontal blocks of three identical pixels, centered on the original position. Existing horizontal blocks of three identical non-white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
