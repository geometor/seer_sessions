"""
Identify single, non-white pixels that are horizontally isolated (meaning their left and right neighbors are white, or they are at the grid boundary).
Expand each identified isolated pixel into a horizontal block of three pixels of the same color, centered at the original pixel's position.
Pixels that are already part of a horizontal sequence of two or more identical non-white pixels are left unchanged. White pixels are left unchanged unless they are replaced during the expansion of an isolated pixel.
The transformation is applied independently to each row.
