```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D sequence of colors based on the following rules:
1. Identifies existing horizontal blocks of three identical, non-white pixels in the input sequence.
2. Identifies single non-white pixels in the input sequence that are surrounded by white (0) pixels on both sides.
3. Initializes an output sequence of the same length as the input, filled with white (0).
4. Copies the identified 3-pixel blocks from the input directly to the output sequence.
5. For each identified single pixel of color 'C' at input index 'i', writes the color 'C' to the output sequence at indices 'i-1', 'i', and 'i+1', effectively expanding the single pixel into a 3-pixel block shifted one position left relative to the original single pixel's position.
"""
