**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are presented as 1D arrays (sequences) of 32 integers representing colors. While they could potentially represent 2D grids (e.g., 4x8, 8x4), the transformation logic appears clearer when viewed as a 1D sequence.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) acting as a background/separator, and various other colors (azure-8, blue-1, maroon-9, orange-7, red-2, magenta-6) forming foreground elements.
3.  **Objects:** Two types of foreground objects exist in the inputs:
    *   **Single Pixels:** Isolated non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels on both sides (e.g., `... 0 C 0 ...`).
    *   **Blocks:** Contiguous horizontal sequences of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., `... 8 8 8 ...` or `... 1 1 1 ...`).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation targets the *single pixels*. Each single pixel of color `C` at position `i` in the input sequence is expanded into a block of three pixels `C C C` in the output sequence, centered one position to the *left* of the original pixel's position (i.e., covering positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`). The existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels remain unchanged in the output. White pixels are overwritten by the expansion but otherwise remain white.

transformation:
  action: expand_and_shift

  details:
    - Identify each single non-white pixel 'C' at index 'i'.
    - In the output, place a block of 'C C C' covering indices 'i-1', 'i', and 'i+1'.
    - This effectively expands the single pixel into a 3-pixel block and shifts its center one position left.
  constraints:
    - Assumes single pixels are not at index 0 or adjacent to other non-white pixels or blocks (based on examples).
    - Assumes expansions do not overlap (based on examples).
    - Existing 3-pixel blocks are copied directly without modification.
    - Background pixels (white) are copied unless overwritten by an expansion.
output_generation:
  method: create_new_sequence
  steps:
    - Initialize output sequence same size as input, filled with white (0).
    - Copy existing 3-pixel blocks from input to output.
    - Identify single pixels in the input.
    - For each single pixel 'C' at input index 'i', write 'C C C' to output indices 'i-1', 'i', 'i+1'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify existing horizontal blocks of three identical, non-white pixels. Copy these blocks directly to their corresponding positions in the output sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence again, from the second pixel (index 1) up to the second-to-last pixel (index length-2).
4.  At each position `i`, check if the pixel `input[i]` is non-white AND both its left neighbor `input[i-1]` and right neighbor `input[i+1]` are white (0).
5.  If these conditions are met, identify this pixel `input[i]` as a "single pixel" with color `C`.
6.  For each identified single pixel `C` at input index `i`, write the color `C` into the output sequence at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
7.  Return the completed output sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The analysis indicates that the core logic identified in the initial phase (preserving existing 3-pixel blocks, expanding isolated single pixels into 3-pixel blocks shifted left by one position relative to the single pixel's original location) is correct when applied to a *flattened*, 1D representation of the grid. The Python code provided implemented this 1D logic correctly.

The failure reported during testing (resulting in `[0]` output) strongly suggests an input/output format mismatch with the testing environment. The environment likely provides the input as a 2D grid (specifically, a NumPy array) and expects a 2D grid as output. The previous code, operating on 1D lists, would fail when receiving a 2D array.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

The solution is to adapt the existing, correct 1D transformation logic to work within a 2D grid context. This involves:
1.  Accepting a 2D NumPy array as input.
2.  Flattening the input array to a 1D sequence.
3.  Applying the established 1D transformation (preserve blocks, expand singles) to this sequence.
4.  Reshaping the resulting 1D sequence back to the original 2D dimensions of the input grid.
5.  Returning the final 2D NumPy array.

    - Reshape the 1D output sequence back to the original shape (H, W).
    - Return the 2D output grid.
  1D_transformation_rules:
    action: selective_copy_and_expand
    details:
      - Initialize a 1D output sequence of length N, filled with white (0).
      - **Pass 1: Copy Blocks:** Iterate through the flattened input sequence (index `i` from 0 to N-3). If a horizontal_block_1D is found starting at `i`, copy its three pixels to the output sequence at `i`, `i+1`, `i+2`, and advance `i` by 3. Otherwise, advance `i` by 1.
      - **Pass 2: Expand Singles:** Iterate through the flattened input sequence (index `j` from 1 to N-2). If a single_pixel_1D of color C is found at `j`, write C to the output sequence at indices `j-1`, `j`, and `j+1`. (This might overwrite background pixels or pixels adjacent to blocks, which is consistent with example outputs).
    priority: Block copying happens first, then single pixel expansion potentially overwrites neighbors.
output_generation:
  method: reshape_transformed_sequence
  steps:
    - Flatten input grid `I` of shape (H, W) to `I_flat`.
    - Create output sequence `O_flat` of same size, filled with 0.
    - Copy horizontal_block_1D from `I_flat` to `O_flat`.
    - Expand single_pixel_1D from `I_flat` into `O_flat`.
    - Reshape `O_flat` to shape (H, W).
    - Return the reshaped grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input 2D grid (represented as a NumPy array).
2.  Determine and store the dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of the input grid.
3.  Flatten the 2D grid into a 1D NumPy array, `input_flat`, of length `N = H * W` (using default row-major flattening).
4.  Create a new 1D NumPy array, `output_flat`, of length `N`, initialized with zeros (representing the white background).
5.  **First Pass (Copy Blocks):** Iterate through `input_flat` using an index `i`. Start `i` at 0. While `i <= N - 3`:
    *   Check if `input_flat[i]` is non-zero and equal to `input_flat[i+1]` and `input_flat[i+2]`.
    *   If yes (a block is found): Copy the values from `input_flat[i]`, `input_flat[i+1]`, `input_flat[i+2]` to `output_flat[i]`, `output_flat[i+1]`, `output_flat[i+2]`. Increment `i` by 3.
    *   If no: Increment `i` by 1.
6.  **Second Pass (Expand Singles):** Iterate through `input_flat` using an index `j` from 1 up to `N - 2`:
    *   Check if `input_flat[j]` is non-zero AND `input_flat[j-1]` is zero AND `input_flat[j+1]` is zero.
    *   If yes (a single pixel is found): Let the color be `C = input_flat[j]`. Assign the color `C` to `output_flat[j-1]`, `output_flat[j]`, and `output_flat[j+1]`.
7.  Reshape the `output_flat` array back into a 2D array with the original dimensions (`H`, `W`).
8.  Return the resulting 2D grid.
