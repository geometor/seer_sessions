"""
Transforms a 2D input grid by applying rules based on its flattened 1D representation.
Existing horizontal blocks of three identical, non-white pixels (in the flattened sequence) are preserved.
Single non-white pixels (in the flattened sequence) that are immediately surrounded by white (0) pixels are identified.
Each identified single pixel of color 'C' at flattened index 'i' is expanded into a three-pixel block 'C C C' in the output sequence, covering flattened indices 'i-1', 'i', and 'i+1'.
The transformation preserves blocks first, then performs the single pixel expansions.
The final output is reshaped to the original 2D grid dimensions.
