**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are presented as 1D arrays (sequences) of 32 integers representing colors. While they could potentially represent 2D grids (e.g., 4x8, 8x4), the transformation logic appears clearer when viewed as a 1D sequence.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) acting as a background/separator, and various other colors (azure-8, blue-1, maroon-9, orange-7, red-2, magenta-6) forming foreground elements.
3.  **Objects:** Two types of foreground objects exist in the inputs:
    *   **Single Pixels:** Isolated non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels on both sides (e.g., `... 0 C 0 ...`).
    *   **Blocks:** Contiguous horizontal sequences of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., `... 8 8 8 ...` or `... 1 1 1 ...`).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation targets the *single pixels*. Each single pixel of color `C` at position `i` in the input sequence is expanded into a block of three pixels `C C C` in the output sequence, centered one position to the *left* of the original pixel's position (i.e., covering positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`). The existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels remain unchanged in the output. White pixels are overwritten by the expansion but otherwise remain white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation # Could be grid, but 1D seems primary
components:
  - type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: separator, fill
  - type: object
    subtype: single_pixel
    properties:
      color: any non-white
      size: 1 pixel
      context: surrounded by white pixels horizontally (input[i-1]==0 and input[i+1]==0)
    actions:
      - targeted_for_transformation
  - type: object
    subtype: horizontal_block
    properties:
      color: any non-white
      size: 3 pixels (contiguous, identical color)
      context: horizontal sequence (input[i]==C, input[i+1]==C, input[i+2]==C)
    actions:
      - remains_unchanged
transformation:
  action: expand_and_shift
  target: single_pixel
  details:
    - Identify each single non-white pixel 'C' at index 'i'.
    - In the output, place a block of 'C C C' covering indices 'i-1', 'i', and 'i+1'.
    - This effectively expands the single pixel into a 3-pixel block and shifts its center one position left.
  constraints:
    - Assumes single pixels are not at index 0 or adjacent to other non-white pixels or blocks (based on examples).
    - Assumes expansions do not overlap (based on examples).
    - Existing 3-pixel blocks are copied directly without modification.
    - Background pixels (white) are copied unless overwritten by an expansion.
output_generation:
  method: create_new_sequence
  steps:
    - Initialize output sequence same size as input, filled with white (0).
    - Copy existing 3-pixel blocks from input to output.
    - Identify single pixels in the input.
    - For each single pixel 'C' at input index 'i', write 'C C C' to output indices 'i-1', 'i', 'i+1'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify existing horizontal blocks of three identical, non-white pixels. Copy these blocks directly to their corresponding positions in the output sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence again, from the second pixel (index 1) up to the second-to-last pixel (index length-2).
4.  At each position `i`, check if the pixel `input[i]` is non-white AND both its left neighbor `input[i-1]` and right neighbor `input[i+1]` are white (0).
5.  If these conditions are met, identify this pixel `input[i]` as a "single pixel" with color `C`.
6.  For each identified single pixel `C` at input index `i`, write the color `C` into the output sequence at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.
7.  Return the completed output sequence.
