task_type: sequence_transformation # Could be grid, but 1D seems primary
components:
  - type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: separator, fill
  - type: object
    subtype: single_pixel
    properties:
      color: any non-white
      size: 1 pixel
      context: surrounded by white pixels horizontally (input[i-1]==0 and input[i+1]==0)
    actions:
      - targeted_for_transformation
  - type: object
    subtype: horizontal_block
    properties:
      color: any non-white
      size: 3 pixels (contiguous, identical color)
      context: horizontal sequence (input[i]==C, input[i+1]==C, input[i+2]==C)
    actions:
      - remains_unchanged
transformation:
  action: expand_and_shift
  target: single_pixel
  details:
    - Identify each single non-white pixel 'C' at index 'i'.
    - In the output, place a block of 'C C C' covering indices 'i-1', 'i', and 'i+1'.
    - This effectively expands the single pixel into a 3-pixel block and shifts its center one position left.
  constraints:
    - Assumes single pixels are not at index 0 or adjacent to other non-white pixels or blocks (based on examples).
    - Assumes expansions do not overlap (based on examples).
    - Existing 3-pixel blocks are copied directly without modification.
    - Background pixels (white) are copied unless overwritten by an expansion.
output_generation:
  method: create_new_sequence
  steps:
    - Initialize output sequence same size as input, filled with white (0).
    - Copy existing 3-pixel blocks from input to output.
    - Identify single pixels in the input.
    - For each single pixel 'C' at input index 'i', write 'C C C' to output indices 'i-1', 'i', 'i+1'.
