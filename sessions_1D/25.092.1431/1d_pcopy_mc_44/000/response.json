While they could potentially represent 2D grids (e.g., 4x8, 8x4), the transformation logic appears clearer when viewed as a 1D sequence.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) acting as a background/separator, and various other colors (azure-8, blue-1, maroon-9, orange-7, red-2, magenta-6) forming foreground elements.\n3.  **Objects:** Two types of foreground objects exist in the inputs:\n    *   **Single Pixels:** Isolated non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels on both sides (e.g., `... 0 C 0 ...`).\n    *   **Blocks:** Contiguous horizontal sequences of three identical non-white pixels (e.g., `... 8 8 8 ...` or `... 1 1 1 ...`).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation targets the *single pixels*. Each single pixel of color `C` at position `i` in the input sequence is expanded into a block of three pixels `C C C` in the output sequence, centered one position to the *left* of the original pixel's position (i.e., covering positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`). The existing blocks of three identical non-white pixels remain unchanged in the output. White pixels are overwritten by the expansion but otherwise remain white.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
