            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe analysis indicates that the core logic identified in the initial phase (preserving existing 3-pixel blocks, expanding isolated single pixels into 3-pixel blocks shifted left by one position relative to the single pixel's original location) is correct when applied to a *flattened*, 1D representation of the grid. The Python code provided implemented this 1D logic correctly.\n\nThe failure reported during testing (resulting in `[0]` output) strongly suggests an input/output format mismatch with the testing environment. The environment likely provides the input as a 2D grid (specifically, a NumPy array) and expects a 2D grid as output. The previous code, operating on 1D lists, would fail when receiving a 2D array.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\nThe solution is to adapt the existing, correct 1D transformation logic to work within a 2D grid context. This involves:\n1.  Accepting a 2D NumPy array as input.\n2.  Flattening the input array to a 1D sequence.\n3.  Applying the established 1D transformation (preserve blocks, expand singles) to this sequence.\n4.  Reshaping the resulting 1D sequence back to the original 2D dimensions of the input grid.\n5.  Returning the final 2D NumPy array.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
