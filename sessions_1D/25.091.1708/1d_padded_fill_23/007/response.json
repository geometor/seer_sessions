Process each row of the input grid independently.\n3. For the current row:\n    a. Find all non-white pixels (value != 0). Record their colors and column indices.\n    b. Count the number of non-white pixels found (`count`).\n    c. If `count` is 0, proceed to the next row.\n    d. Determine the set of unique non-white colors present in the row.\n    e. Find the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (`c_left`) and the rightmost non-white pixel (`c_right`).\n    f. Check Fill Condition 1: If `count` is exactly 1:\n        i. Get the color `C` of the single non-white pixel.\n        ii. In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels from column `c_left` (the position of the single pixel) to the last column (inclusive) to color `C`.\n    g. Check Fill Condition 2: If `count` is greater than 1 AND there is only one unique non-white color `C` in the row:\n        i. In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels from column `c_left` to column `c_right` (inclusive) to color `C`.\n    h. Otherwise (i.e., `count` > 1 and multiple different non-white colors exist), make no changes to this row in the output grid.\n4.
