Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids where each cell has a color value (0-9). The examples provided (after parsing the string inputs) are all 6x6 grids.
2.  **Colors:** The examples use white (0) as the background color. Example 1 uses azure (8), Example 2 uses red (2), and Example 3 uses yellow (4).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes occur horizontally within each row independently. Rows consisting entirely of white pixels remain unchanged (e.g., row 1, 3, 5 in examples 2 and 3).
4.  **Filling Action:** The core transformation seems to be filling segments of rows with a specific non-white color. The extent and condition of this filling depend on the existing non-white pixels in the row.
5.  **Pattern Recognition:**
    *   In Example 1, a single azure pixel in a row causes the rest of the row to its right to become azure.
    *   In Examples 2 and 3, two pixels of the same color (red or yellow) in a row cause the white pixels *between* them to adopt that color. Combining this observation with the first leads to the idea that the filling occurs between the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of a specific color *if* all non-white pixels in that row share that same color.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation # or perhaps pattern_completion / filling

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - background_color: white (0)

row_processing:
  - independence: Transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - condition: Modification depends on the non-white pixels within the row.

object_focus:
  - type: non-white pixels within a row
  - properties:
      - color
      - column_index
  - relationships:
      - count_per_row: The number of non-white pixels in a row matters.
      - color_uniformity: Whether all non-white pixels in a row share the same color matters.
      - position: The indices of the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels are important.

actions:
  - fill_segment:
      - target: Pixels within a specific horizontal segment of a row.
      - color: Determined by the existing non-white pixels in the row.
      - trigger_conditions:
          - case_1: Exactly one non-white pixel exists in the row.
             - segment: From the non-white pixel's column to the right grid edge.
          - case_2: Two or more non-white pixels exist, *and* they all share the same color.
             - segment: Between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixel columns (inclusive).
      - default: If conditions are not met (e.g., zero non-white pixels, or multiple non-white pixels of different colors), the row remains unchanged.

color_rules:
  - The fill color is always the color of the non-white pixel(s) that triggered the fill action.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
3.  For the current row, identify all non-white pixels, recording their colors and column indices.
4.  Count the number of non-white pixels found in the row.
5.  Determine the set of unique non-white colors present in the row.
6.  **Condition 1:** If the count of non-white pixels is exactly 1:
    *   Let the color be `C` and the column index be `c`.
    *   In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels from column `c` to the last column (inclusive) to color `C`.
7.  **Condition 2:** If the count of non-white pixels is greater than 1 AND there is only one unique non-white color (`C`) in the row:
    *   Find the minimum column index (`c_left`) among the non-white pixels.
    *   Find the maximum column index (`c_right`) among the non-white pixels.
    *   In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels from column `c_left` to `c_right` (inclusive) to color `C`.
8.  **Otherwise:** If neither Condition 1 nor Condition 2 is met (i.e., the row contains zero non-white pixels, or it contains multiple non-white pixels but they have different colors), make no changes to this row in the output grid (it remains as copied from the input).
9.  After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output.
```python
"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules applied row by row:
1. Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
2. Identify all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the current row.
3. If exactly one non-white pixel exists in the row:
    - Let its color be C and its column index be c.
    - Fill the row in the output grid from column c to the end (right edge) with color C.
4. If two or more non-white pixels exist in the row AND they all have the same color C:
    - Find the leftmost column index (c_left) and the rightmost column index (c_right) of these non-white pixels.
    - Fill the row in the output grid from column c_left to c_right (inclusive) with color C.
5. Otherwise (zero non-white pixels, or multiple non-white pixels of different colors):
    - The row in the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid.

**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: row-by-row processing and filling based on existing non-white pixels. However, the code iteration introduced an error by adding a condition based on the row index (even/odd) for the single-pixel case, which was not supported by the examples. The evaluation results presented were confusing, likely showing outputs from the flawed code version or having formatting issues. Re-evaluating the *first* proposed logic against all examples shows it correctly handles cases with one non-white pixel (fill right) and cases with multiple *same-colored* non-white pixels (fill between). The strategy is to revert to this initial, simpler logic.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: pattern_completion # Specifically, horizontal line filling

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - background_color: white (0)

row_processing:
  - independence: Transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - condition: Modification depends only on the non-white pixels within that specific row.

object_focus: # Applied per row
  - type: non-white pixels
  - properties:
      - color
      - column_index
  - derived_properties:
      - count: Number of non-white pixels in the row.
      - unique_colors: Set of distinct non-white colors in the row.
      - c_left: Minimum column index of non-white pixels (if any).
      - c_right: Maximum column index of non-white pixels (if any).

actions:
  - fill_segment:
      - target: Pixels within a specific horizontal segment of a row in the output grid.
      - source: Corresponding row in the input grid.
      - trigger_conditions:
          - case_1: `count` == 1.
             - color: The single non-white color `C`.
             - segment: From column `c_left` to the last column (inclusive).
             - action: Fill segment with color `C`.
          - case_2: `count` > 1 AND only one `unique_color` `C`.
             - color: The single unique non-white color `C`.
             - segment: From column `c_left` to column `c_right` (inclusive).
             - action: Fill segment with color `C`.
      - default: If neither `case_1` nor `case_2` applies (row is all white, or has multiple different non-white colors), the output row is identical to the input row.

color_rules:
  - The fill color is always determined by the non-white pixel(s) present in the input row.
  - No new colors are introduced.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Process each row of the input grid independently.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Find all non-white pixels (value != 0). Record their colors and column indices.
    b.  Count the number of non-white pixels found (`count`).
    c.  If `count` is 0, proceed to the next row.
    d.  Determine the set of unique non-white colors present in the row.
    e.  Find the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (`c_left`) and the rightmost non-white pixel (`c_right`).
    f.  **Check Fill Condition 1:** If `count` is exactly 1:
        i.  Get the color `C` of the single non-white pixel.
        ii. In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, change the color of all pixels from column `c_left` (the position of the single pixel) to the last column (inclusive) to color `C`.
    g.  **Check Fill Condition 2:** If `count` is greater than 1 AND there is only one unique non-white color `C` in the row:
        i.  In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, change the color of all pixels from column `c_left` to column `c_right` (inclusive) to color `C`.
    h.  **Otherwise:** (i.e., `count` > 1 and multiple different non-white colors exist), make no changes to this row in the output grid (it remains as copied from the input).
4.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
