Transforms the input grid based on the following rules applied row by row:
1. Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2. Process each row of the input grid independently.
3. For the current row:
    a. Identify all non-white pixels (value != 0) and their column indices.
    b. Count the total number of non-white pixels (`count`).
    c. Determine the set of unique non-white colors present.
    d. If `count` is greater than 0:
        i. Find the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (`c_left`).
        ii. Find the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (`c_right`).
    e. Check the conditions for modification:
        i. If `count` is exactly 1:
            - Get the single non-white color `C`.
            - In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, set all pixels from column `c_left` to the last column (inclusive) to color `C`.
        ii. If `count` is greater than 1 AND there is only *one* unique non-white color `C`:
            - In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, set all pixels from column `c_left` to column `c_right` (inclusive) to color `C`.
        iii. Otherwise (if `count` is 0, or if `count` > 1 but there are multiple unique non-white colors):
            - Make no changes to this row in the output grid.
4. After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
