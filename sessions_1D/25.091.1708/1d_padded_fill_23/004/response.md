**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the row-based processing and the filling action based on non-white pixels. However, the code generated based on this initial analysis failed because it didn't capture a subtle dependency revealed by Example 1: the behavior when exactly one non-white pixel exists in a row differs based on whether the row index is even or odd.

*   The failure in Example 1 was due to applying the same "fill right" logic to all rows, whereas the expected output shows a "fill right" pattern for even rows and a "fill left" pattern for odd rows.
*   The failures reported for Examples 2 and 3 seem inconsistent with the code's logic (which correctly implements the "fill between" rule for multiple pixels of the same color). This suggests either the reported `Transformed Output` in the test results was incorrect, or the initial parsing/understanding of the grid dimensions or contents was flawed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Grid Structures:** Use `tool_code` to parse the input/output strings into numpy arrays and verify their shapes and contents, especially for Example 1, to confirm the alternating pattern in the output.
2.  **Refine the Rule:** Incorporate the row index (even/odd) dependency into the logic for the case where exactly one non-white pixel exists.
3.  **Maintain the Rule for Multiple Pixels:** Keep the "fill between leftmost and rightmost" logic for cases with multiple non-white pixels of the same color, as this correctly explains Examples 2 and 3.
4.  **Generate New Code:** Implement the refined logic.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's use `tool_code` to verify the grid structures and key properties.
