            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the row-based processing and the filling action based on non-white pixels. However, the code generated based on this initial analysis failed because it didn't capture a subtle dependency revealed by Example 1: the behavior when exactly one non-white pixel exists in a row differs based on whether the row index is even or odd.\n\n*   The failure in Example 1 was due to applying the same \"fill right\" logic to all rows, whereas the expected output shows a \"fill right\" pattern for even rows and a \"fill left\" pattern for odd rows.\n*   The failures reported for Examples 2 and 3 seem inconsistent with the code's logic (which correctly implements the \"fill between\" rule for multiple pixels of the same color). This suggests either the reported `Transformed Output` in the test results was incorrect, or the initial parsing/understanding of the grid dimensions or contents was flawed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Grid Structures:** Use `tool_code` to parse the input/output strings into numpy arrays and verify their shapes and contents, especially for Example 1, to confirm the alternating pattern in the output.\n2.  **Refine the Rule:** Incorporate the row index (even/odd) dependency into the logic for the case where exactly one non-white pixel exists.\n3.  **Maintain the Rule for Multiple Pixels:** Keep the \"fill between leftmost and rightmost\" logic for cases with multiple non-white pixels of the same color, as this correctly explains Examples 2 and 3.\n4.  **Generate New Code:** Implement the refined logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to verify the grid structures and key properties.\n\n"
