task_type: pattern_completion # Filling segments within rows based on existing pixels

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True # Output grid has the same shape as input grid
  - background_color: white (0)

row_processing:
  - independence: Transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - condition: Modification depends on the non-white pixels within the row.

object_focus:
  - type: Non-white pixels within a single row.
  - properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (1-9).
      - column_index: The horizontal position within the row.
  - derived_properties_per_row:
      - count: Number of non-white pixels.
      - unique_colors: Set of distinct non-white colors present.
      - leftmost_index: Column index of the first non-white pixel.
      - rightmost_index: Column index of the last non-white pixel.

actions:
  - fill_segment:
      - target: A horizontal segment of pixels within a row in the output grid.
      - color: Determined by the unique non-white color present in the input row.
      - trigger_conditions: # Rules apply only if exactly one unique non-white color C exists in the input row.
          - case_1 (single_pixel):
              - condition: The count of non-white pixels is exactly 1.
              - parameters:
                  - color: C (the single non-white color)
                  - start_col: leftmost_index (which equals rightmost_index)
                  - end_col: last column index of the grid (inclusive)
              - action: Fill the output row from start_col to end_col with color C.
          - case_2 (multiple_pixels_same_color):
              - condition: The count of non-white pixels is greater than 1.
              - parameters:
                  - color: C (the single non-white color)
                  - start_col: leftmost_index
                  - end_col: rightmost_index (inclusive)
              - action: Fill the output row from start_col to end_col with color C.
      - default: If the input row contains zero non-white pixels, or contains non-white pixels of multiple different colors, the corresponding row in the output grid remains identical to the input row.
