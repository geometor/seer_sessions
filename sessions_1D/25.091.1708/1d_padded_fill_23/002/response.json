            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the execution results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code attempted to implement rules based on the number and color of non-white pixels in each row. However, the execution results show significant discrepancies (`Pixels Off` > 0) for all three training examples. The `Transformed Output` often contains more colored pixels than the `Expected Output`, particularly extending fills incorrectly towards the right or filling rows that should have remained unchanged (e.g., all-zero rows).\n\nThe most likely scenario is that the conditions triggering the fills or the ranges being filled were not specified correctly in the initial logic/code. The strategy is to re-examine the relationship between input and expected output for each example, paying close attention to:\n1.  The number of non-white pixels per row.\n2.  Whether all non-white pixels in a row share the same color.\n3.  The column indices of the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels.\n4.  How these factors determine the exact segment to be filled (or if no fill should occur).\n\nBased on re-analysis (detailed in thought process), a two-part rule appears to cover all examples: one rule for rows with exactly one non-white pixel, and another for rows with multiple non-white pixels of the same color. The previously generated code's output did not match this revised logic, suggesting either a subtle code bug or an issue with the reported execution results. We will proceed based on the revised logic derived from the input/expected output pairs.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's confirm properties of the input/output pairs using code execution. We'll examine row 0 of example 1, row 0 of example 2, and row 0 of example 3 as representative cases.\n\n"
