Okay, let's analyze the execution results and refine our understanding.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code attempted to implement rules based on the number and color of non-white pixels in each row. However, the execution results show significant discrepancies (`Pixels Off` > 0) for all three training examples. The `Transformed Output` often contains more colored pixels than the `Expected Output`, particularly extending fills incorrectly towards the right or filling rows that should have remained unchanged (e.g., all-zero rows).

The most likely scenario is that the conditions triggering the fills or the ranges being filled were not specified correctly in the initial logic/code. The strategy is to re-examine the relationship between input and expected output for each example, paying close attention to:
1.  The number of non-white pixels per row.
2.  Whether all non-white pixels in a row share the same color.
3.  The column indices of the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels.
4.  How these factors determine the exact segment to be filled (or if no fill should occur).

Based on re-analysis (detailed in thought process), a two-part rule appears to cover all examples: one rule for rows with exactly one non-white pixel, and another for rows with multiple non-white pixels of the same color. The previously generated code's output did not match this revised logic, suggesting either a subtle code bug or an issue with the reported execution results. We will proceed based on the revised logic derived from the input/expected output pairs.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's confirm properties of the input/output pairs using code execution. We'll examine row 0 of example 1, row 0 of example 2, and row 0 of example 3 as representative cases.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Process each row of the input grid independently from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify all non-white pixels and their column indices.
    b.  Count the total number of non-white pixels (`count`).
    c.  Determine the set of unique non-white colors present.
    d.  If `count` is greater than 0:
        i.  Find the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (`c_left`).
        ii. Find the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (`c_right`).
    e.  Check the conditions for modification:
        i.  **Condition A:** If `count` is exactly 1:
            - Get the single non-white color `C`.
            - In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, set all pixels from column `c_left` to the last column (inclusive) to color `C`.
        ii. **Condition B:** If `count` is greater than 1 AND there is only *one* unique non-white color `C`:
            - In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, set all pixels from column `c_left` to column `c_right` (inclusive) to color `C`.
        iii. **Otherwise** (if `count` is 0, or if `count` > 1 but there are multiple unique non-white colors):
            - Make no changes to this row in the output grid (it remains as copied from the input).
4.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
