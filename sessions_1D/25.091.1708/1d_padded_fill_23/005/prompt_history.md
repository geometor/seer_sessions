Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids where each cell has a color value (0-9). The examples provided (after parsing the string inputs) are all 6x6 grids.
2.  **Colors:** The examples use white (0) as the background color. Example 1 uses azure (8), Example 2 uses red (2), and Example 3 uses yellow (4).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes occur horizontally within each row independently. Rows consisting entirely of white pixels remain unchanged (e.g., row 1, 3, 5 in examples 2 and 3).
4.  **Filling Action:** The core transformation seems to be filling segments of rows with a specific non-white color. The extent and condition of this filling depend on the existing non-white pixels in the row.
5.  **Pattern Recognition:**
    *   In Example 1, a single azure pixel in a row causes the rest of the row to its right to become azure.
    *   In Examples 2 and 3, two pixels of the same color (red or yellow) in a row cause the white pixels *between* them to adopt that color. Combining this observation with the first leads to the idea that the filling occurs between the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of a specific color *if* all non-white pixels in that row share that same color.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation # or perhaps pattern_completion / filling

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - background_color: white (0)

row_processing:
  - independence: Transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - condition: Modification depends on the non-white pixels within the row.

object_focus:
  - type: non-white pixels within a row
  - properties:
      - color
      - column_index
  - relationships:
      - count_per_row: The number of non-white pixels in a row matters.
      - color_uniformity: Whether all non-white pixels in a row share the same color matters.
      - position: The indices of the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels are important.

actions:
  - fill_segment:
      - target: Pixels within a specific horizontal segment of a row.
      - color: Determined by the existing non-white pixels in the row.
      - trigger_conditions:
          - case_1: Exactly one non-white pixel exists in the row.
             - segment: From the non-white pixel's column to the right grid edge.
          - case_2: Two or more non-white pixels exist, *and* they all share the same color.
             - segment: Between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixel columns (inclusive).
      - default: If conditions are not met (e.g., zero non-white pixels, or multiple non-white pixels of different colors), the row remains unchanged.

color_rules:
  - The fill color is always the color of the non-white pixel(s) that triggered the fill action.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
3.  For the current row, identify all non-white pixels, recording their colors and column indices.
4.  Count the number of non-white pixels found in the row.
5.  Determine the set of unique non-white colors present in the row.
6.  **Condition 1:** If the count of non-white pixels is exactly 1:
    *   Let the color be `C` and the column index be `c`.
    *   In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels from column `c` to the last column (inclusive) to color `C`.
7.  **Condition 2:** If the count of non-white pixels is greater than 1 AND there is only one unique non-white color (`C`) in the row:
    *   Find the minimum column index (`c_left`) among the non-white pixels.
    *   Find the maximum column index (`c_right`) among the non-white pixels.
    *   In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels from column `c_left` to `c_right` (inclusive) to color `C`.
8.  **Otherwise:** If neither Condition 1 nor Condition 2 is met (i.e., the row contains zero non-white pixels, or it contains multiple non-white pixels but they have different colors), make no changes to this row in the output grid (it remains as copied from the input).
9.  After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output.
```python
"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules applied row by row:
1. Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
2. Identify all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the current row.
3. If exactly one non-white pixel exists in the row:
    - Let its color be C and its column index be c.
    - Fill the row in the output grid from column c to the end (right edge) with color C.
4. If two or more non-white pixels exist in the row AND they all have the same color C:
    - Find the leftmost column index (c_left) and the rightmost column index (c_right) of these non-white pixels.
    - Fill the row in the output grid from column c_left to c_right (inclusive) with color C.
5. Otherwise (zero non-white pixels, or multiple non-white pixels of different colors):
    - The row in the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the row-based processing and the filling action based on non-white pixels. However, the code generated based on this initial analysis failed because it didn't capture a subtle dependency revealed by Example 1: the behavior when exactly one non-white pixel exists in a row differs based on whether the row index is even or odd.

*   The failure in Example 1 was due to applying the same "fill right" logic to all rows, whereas the expected output shows a "fill right" pattern for even rows and a "fill left" pattern for odd rows.
*   The failures reported for Examples 2 and 3 seem inconsistent with the code's logic (which correctly implements the "fill between" rule for multiple pixels of the same color). This suggests either the reported `Transformed Output` in the test results was incorrect, or the initial parsing/understanding of the grid dimensions or contents was flawed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Grid Structures:** Use `tool_code` to parse the input/output strings into numpy arrays and verify their shapes and contents, especially for Example 1, to confirm the alternating pattern in the output.
2.  **Refine the Rule:** Incorporate the row index (even/odd) dependency into the logic for the case where exactly one non-white pixel exists.
3.  **Maintain the Rule for Multiple Pixels:** Keep the "fill between leftmost and rightmost" logic for cases with multiple non-white pixels of the same color, as this correctly explains Examples 2 and 3.
4.  **Generate New Code:** Implement the refined logic.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's use `tool_code` to verify the grid structures and key properties.
