Process each row of the input grid independently, noting the row index (r).\n3. For the current row:\n    a. Identify all non-white pixels (value != 0) and their column indices.\n    b. Count the total number of non-white pixels (`count`).\n    c. Determine the set of unique non-white colors present.\n    d. If `count` is greater than 0:\n        i. Find the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (`c_left`).\n        ii. Find the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (`c_right`).\n    e. Check the conditions for modification:\n        i. If `count` is exactly 1:\n            - Get the single non-white color `C` and its column index `c`.\n            - If the row index `r` is even (0-based):\n                - In the output grid row, set pixels from column `c` to the last column (inclusive) to color `C`.\n            - If the row index `r` is odd:\n                - In the output grid row, set pixels from the first column (0) to column `c` (inclusive) to color `C`.\n        ii. If `count` is greater than 1 AND there is only *one* unique non-white color `C`:\n            - In the output grid row, set pixels from column `c_left` to column `c_right` (inclusive) to color `C`.\n        iii.
