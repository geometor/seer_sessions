Transforms the input grid based on the following rules applied row by row:
1. Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2. Process each row of the input grid independently, noting the row index (r).
3. For the current row:
    a. Identify all non-white pixels (value != 0) and their column indices.
    b. Count the total number of non-white pixels (`count`).
    c. Determine the set of unique non-white colors present.
    d. If `count` is greater than 0:
        i. Find the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (`c_left`).
        ii. Find the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (`c_right`).
    e. Check the conditions for modification:
        i. If `count` is exactly 1:
            - Get the single non-white color `C` and its column index `c`.
            - If the row index `r` is even (0-based):
                - In the output grid row, set pixels from column `c` to the last column (inclusive) to color `C`.
            - If the row index `r` is odd:
                - In the output grid row, set pixels from the first column (0) to column `c` (inclusive) to color `C`.
        ii. If `count` is greater than 1 AND there is only *one* unique non-white color `C`:
            - In the output grid row, set pixels from column `c_left` to column `c_right` (inclusive) to color `C`.
        iii. Otherwise (if `count` is 0, or if `count` > 1 with multiple unique colors):
            - Make no changes to this row in the output grid.
4. After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
