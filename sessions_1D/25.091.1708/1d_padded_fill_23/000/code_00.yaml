task_type: object_transformation # or perhaps pattern_completion / filling

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - background_color: white (0)

row_processing:
  - independence: Transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - condition: Modification depends on the non-white pixels within the row.

object_focus:
  - type: non-white pixels within a row
  - properties:
      - color
      - column_index
  - relationships:
      - count_per_row: The number of non-white pixels in a row matters.
      - color_uniformity: Whether all non-white pixels in a row share the same color matters.
      - position: The indices of the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels are important.

actions:
  - fill_segment:
      - target: Pixels within a specific horizontal segment of a row.
      - color: Determined by the existing non-white pixels in the row.
      - trigger_conditions:
          - case_1: Exactly one non-white pixel exists in the row.
             - segment: From the non-white pixel's column to the right grid edge.
          - case_2: Two or more non-white pixels exist, *and* they all share the same color.
             - segment: Between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixel columns (inclusive).
      - default: If conditions are not met (e.g., zero non-white pixels, or multiple non-white pixels of different colors), the row remains unchanged.

color_rules:
  - The fill color is always the color of the non-white pixel(s) that triggered the fill action.
