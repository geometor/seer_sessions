            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids where each cell has a color value (0-9). The examples provided (after parsing the string inputs) are all 6x6 grids.\n2.  **Colors:** The examples use white (0) as the background color. Example 1 uses azure (8), Example 2 uses red (2), and Example 3 uses yellow (4).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes occur horizontally within each row independently. Rows consisting entirely of white pixels remain unchanged (e.g., row 1, 3, 5 in examples 2 and 3).\n4.  **Filling Action:** The core transformation seems to be filling segments of rows with a specific non-white color. The extent and condition of this filling depend on the existing non-white pixels in the row.\n5.  **Pattern Recognition:**\n    *   In Example 1, a single azure pixel in a row causes the rest of the row to its right to become azure.\n    *   In Examples 2 and 3, two pixels of the same color (red or yellow) in a row cause the white pixels *between* them to adopt that color. Combining this observation with the first leads to the idea that the filling occurs between the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of a specific color *if* all non-white pixels in that row share that same color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
