task_type: pattern_completion # Specifically, horizontal line filling

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - background_color: white (0)

row_processing:
  - independence: Transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - condition: Modification depends only on the non-white pixels within that specific row.

object_focus: # Applied per row
  - type: non-white pixels
  - properties:
      - color
      - column_index
  - derived_properties:
      - count: Number of non-white pixels in the row.
      - unique_colors: Set of distinct non-white colors in the row.
      - c_left: Minimum column index of non-white pixels (if any).
      - c_right: Maximum column index of non-white pixels (if any).

actions:
  - fill_segment:
      - target: Pixels within a specific horizontal segment of a row in the output grid.
      - source: Corresponding row in the input grid.
      - trigger_conditions:
          - case_1: `count` == 1.
             - color: The single non-white color `C`.
             - segment: From column `c_left` to the last column (inclusive).
             - action: Fill segment with color `C`.
          - case_2: `count` > 1 AND only one `unique_color` `C`.
             - color: The single unique non-white color `C`.
             - segment: From column `c_left` to column `c_right` (inclusive).
             - action: Fill segment with color `C`.
      - default: If neither `case_1` nor `case_2` applies (row is all white, or has multiple different non-white colors), the output row is identical to the input row.

color_rules:
  - The fill color is always determined by the non-white pixel(s) present in the input row.
  - No new colors are introduced.
