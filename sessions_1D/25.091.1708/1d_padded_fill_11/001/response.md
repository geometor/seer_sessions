"""
Processes the input grid row by row. 
For each row, it identifies if there are exactly two pixels of the same non-white color. 
If such a pair exists, it fills the horizontal segment between these two pixels (exclusive of the endpoints) with that same color in the output grid. 
If a row does not contain exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., zero, one, more than two of the same color, or pairs of different colors), the row is copied to the output grid without modification.
The background color is assumed to be white (0).
