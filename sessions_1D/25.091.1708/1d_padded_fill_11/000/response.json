            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves modifying rows in a grid based on the presence and arrangement of non-white pixels within those rows. Specifically, it identifies rows containing exactly two pixels of the same non-white color. The transformation then fills the horizontal space between these two pixels with the same color. Rows that do not meet this specific condition (e.g., have zero, one, or more than two pixels of the same non-white color, or pairs of different colors) remain unchanged. The background color is consistently white (0) in the examples, and this is the color that gets replaced during the filling process. The grid dimensions stay the same.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
