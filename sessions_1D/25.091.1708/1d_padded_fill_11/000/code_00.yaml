task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True
    - background_color: white (0)
  transformation_type: row_based_filling
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9) or white (0)
      - position: (row_index, column_index)
  - type: row
    properties:
      - content: sequence of pixels
      - identified_features: pairs of identical non-white pixels
relationships:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    description: Pixels located within the same row.
  - type: betweenness
    description: Pixels located horizontally between two specific pixels in the same row.
actions:
  - name: identify_pairs
    inputs: row
    outputs: list of pairs, where each pair consists of [color, index1, index2] for rows with exactly two identical non-white pixels.
    condition: A row must contain exactly two pixels of the same non-white color.
  - name: fill_between
    inputs: row, identified_pair [color, index1, index2]
    outputs: modified_row
    description: Change the color of pixels from index1 + 1 to index2 - 1 (exclusive) to the identified color.
    condition: Operates only on rows where a valid pair was identified.
    target_pixels: white (0) pixels between the pair.
  - name: copy_row
    inputs: row
    outputs: identical_row
    condition: Row does not meet the criteria for identify_pairs.
transformation_flow:
  - step: Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  - step: For each row, apply the identify_pairs action.
  - step: If a pair is identified, apply the fill_between action to that row using the pair's information.
  - step: If no pair is identified, apply the copy_row action.
  - step: Collect the resulting rows (modified or copied) to form the output grid.
