"""
Processes the input grid row by row. For each row, it checks if there is 
exactly one non-white color that appears exactly twice. If this condition is met, 
it identifies the color (C) and the column indices (col1, col2) of the pair. 
It then fills the segment of the row strictly between col1 and col2 
(columns col1 + 1 to col2 - 1) with color C in the output grid. 
Rows that do not meet this condition remain unchanged in the output grid.
