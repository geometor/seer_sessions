            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code failed because the implementation of the \"fill\" action was incorrect. The natural language description and the code specified filling *between* the two identified pixels (exclusive), whereas the examples clearly show the fill operation should include the start and end pixels themselves.\n\nThe core logic identified (processing row by row, finding exactly two non-white pixels of the same color) appears correct based on all examples. The strategy is to correct the implementation of the fill action to be inclusive of the endpoints.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe `tool_code` execution confirms the conditions for transformation:\n-   **Trigger:** A row must contain exactly two non-white pixels (`count == 2`).\n-   **Color Match:** The two non-white pixels must have the same color (`same_color_pair == True`).\n-   **Action:** If triggered, fill the row from the minimum column index to the maximum column index (inclusive) of the two pixels with their color.\n-   **No Action:** Rows with 0, 1, or more than 2 non-white pixels, or rows with 2 non-white pixels of different colors, remain unchanged.\n\nAll failed examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) had rows matching the trigger conditions, but the code failed to apply the fill correctly. The `Pixels Off` count in the results corresponds exactly to the number of pixels that *should* have been filled (including the endpoints) but weren't.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
