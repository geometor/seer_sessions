**Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code failed because the implementation of the "fill" action was incorrect. The natural language description and the code specified filling *between* the two identified pixels (exclusive), whereas the examples clearly show the fill operation should include the start and end pixels themselves.

The core logic identified (processing row by row, finding exactly two non-white pixels of the same color) appears correct based on all examples. The strategy is to correct the implementation of the fill action to be inclusive of the endpoints.

**Metrics:**

The `tool_code` execution confirms the conditions for transformation:
-   **Trigger:** A row must contain exactly two non-white pixels (`count == 2`).
-   **Color Match:** The two non-white pixels must have the same color (`same_color_pair == True`).
-   **Action:** If triggered, fill the row from the minimum column index to the maximum column index (inclusive) of the two pixels with their color.
-   **No Action:** Rows with 0, 1, or more than 2 non-white pixels, or rows with 2 non-white pixels of different colors, remain unchanged.

All failed examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) had rows matching the trigger conditions, but the code failed to apply the fill correctly. The `Pixels Off` count in the results corresponds exactly to the number of pixels that *should* have been filled (including the endpoints) but weren't.

**Facts:**

observations:

    relationship: Each row's transformation is independent of other rows.

    description: The transformation applies only if a row contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.

  - action: fill_inclusive

  - rule: no_change
    condition: transformation_trigger not met for the row.
    action: The row remains unchanged in the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid using its index `r`.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Find the column indices and colors of all non-white pixels in that row.
    b.  Count the number of non-white pixels found.
    c.  Check if the count is exactly 2.
    d.  If the count is 2, check if the colors of the two non-white pixels are the same.
    e.  If both conditions (count is 2 AND colors are the same) are true:
        i.  Identify the color of the pair (`fill_color`).
        ii. Identify the column indices of the two pixels (`col1`, `col2`).
        iii. Determine the minimum (`col_start`) and maximum (`col_end`) of these two indices.
        iv. In the corresponding row `r` of the *output* grid, change the color of all pixels from column `col_start` to `col_end` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
    f.  If the conditions in step (e) are not met, make no changes to the corresponding row in the output grid (it retains the values copied from the input).
4.  Return the completed output grid.
