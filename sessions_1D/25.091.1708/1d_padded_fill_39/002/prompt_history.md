Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

The input grids contain sparse, non-white pixels on a white background. The output grids show horizontal lines connecting pairs of these non-white pixels.

Looking at the examples:

1.  In each example, the transformation operates row by row independently.
2.  Within a row, the key seems to be the presence of exactly *two* non-white pixels.
3.  If a row contains exactly two non-white pixels, and they are of the *same* color, the white pixels located horizontally *between* these two pixels are changed to that same color.
4.  If a row does not meet these criteria (e.g., zero non-white pixels, one non-white pixel, more than two non-white pixels, or two non-white pixels of different colors), the row remains unchanged in the output.
5.  The specific color (azure, yellow, gray) doesn't change the logic, only the color used for filling.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation # Filling space between objects
focus: row_based_processing

observations:
  - object: row
    description: The grid is processed one row at a time.
    relationship: Each row's transformation is independent of other rows.

  - object: non_white_pixel
    property: color
    property: position (row_index, column_index)
    description: Pixels with colors other than white (0).

  - condition: row_analysis
    description: Analyze each row to find non_white_pixels.
    property: count_non_white
    property: colors_of_non_white
    property: column_indices_of_non_white

  - rule: transformation_trigger
    condition: count_non_white == 2
    condition: colors_of_non_white are identical
    description: The transformation applies only if a row contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.

  - action: fill_between
    object: white_pixels
    location: In the identified row, horizontally between the two non-white pixels.
    property_change: color changes from white (0) to the color of the pair of non_white_pixels.
    trigger: transformation_trigger met for the row.

  - rule: no_change
    condition: transformation_trigger not met for the row.
    action: The row remains unchanged in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify all non-white pixels and record their column indices and colors.
    b.  Count the number of non-white pixels found in this row.
    c.  Check if the count is exactly 2.
    d.  If the count is 2, check if the colors of the two non-white pixels are the same.
    e.  If both conditions (count is 2 AND colors are the same) are true:
        i.  Determine the color of the pair of pixels.
        ii. Determine the column indices of the two pixels (let the smaller index be `col_start` and the larger index be `col_end`).
        iii. Copy the original row to the corresponding row in the output grid.
        iv. In the output grid's row, change the color of all pixels from column `col_start + 1` to `col_end - 1` (inclusive) to the color determined in step (e)i.
    f.  If either condition (count is not 2 OR colors are different) is false, copy the original row directly to the corresponding row in the output grid without modification.
4.  Return the completed output grid.

Transforms the input grid by processing each row independently.
If a row contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color,
it fills the horizontal space between them (exclusive of the endpoints) with that color.
Otherwise, the row remains unchanged.
