task_type: object_transformation # Filling space horizontally between specific pixel pairs
focus: row_based_processing

observations:
  - object: row
    description: The grid is processed one row at a time.
    relationship: Each row's transformation is independent of other rows.

  - object: non_white_pixel
    property: color
    property: position (row_index, column_index)
    description: Pixels with colors other than white (0).

  - condition: row_analysis
    description: Analyze each row to find non_white_pixels.
    property: count_non_white
    property: colors_of_non_white
    property: column_indices_of_non_white

  - rule: transformation_trigger
    condition: count_non_white == 2
    condition: colors_of_non_white are identical
    description: The transformation applies only if a row contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.

  - action: fill_inclusive
    object: pixels_in_range
    location: In the identified row, horizontally from the first non-white pixel to the second non-white pixel (inclusive).
    property_change: color changes to the color of the pair of non_white_pixels.
    trigger: transformation_trigger met for the row.

  - rule: no_change
    condition: transformation_trigger not met for the row.
    action: The row remains unchanged in the output.
