```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms the input grid by processing each row independently.
If a row contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color,
it fills the horizontal span between and including these two pixels with their color.
Otherwise, the row remains unchanged.

def transform(input_grid):

    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.

    Returns:
