Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

The input grids contain sparse, non-white pixels on a white background. The output grids show horizontal lines connecting pairs of these non-white pixels.

Looking at the examples:

1.  In each example, the transformation operates row by row independently.
2.  Within a row, the key seems to be the presence of exactly *two* non-white pixels.
3.  If a row contains exactly two non-white pixels, and they are of the *same* color, the white pixels located horizontally *between* these two pixels are changed to that same color.
4.  If a row does not meet these criteria (e.g., zero non-white pixels, one non-white pixel, more than two non-white pixels, or two non-white pixels of different colors), the row remains unchanged in the output.
5.  The specific color (azure, yellow, gray) doesn't change the logic, only the color used for filling.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation # Filling space between objects
focus: row_based_processing

observations:
  - object: row
    description: The grid is processed one row at a time.
    relationship: Each row's transformation is independent of other rows.

  - object: non_white_pixel
    property: color
    property: position (row_index, column_index)
    description: Pixels with colors other than white (0).

  - condition: row_analysis
    description: Analyze each row to find non_white_pixels.
    property: count_non_white
    property: colors_of_non_white
    property: column_indices_of_non_white

  - rule: transformation_trigger
    condition: count_non_white == 2
    condition: colors_of_non_white are identical
    description: The transformation applies only if a row contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.

  - action: fill_between
    object: white_pixels
    location: In the identified row, horizontally between the two non-white pixels.
    property_change: color changes from white (0) to the color of the pair of non_white_pixels.
    trigger: transformation_trigger met for the row.

  - rule: no_change
    condition: transformation_trigger not met for the row.
    action: The row remains unchanged in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify all non-white pixels and record their column indices and colors.
    b.  Count the number of non-white pixels found in this row.
    c.  Check if the count is exactly 2.
    d.  If the count is 2, check if the colors of the two non-white pixels are the same.
    e.  If both conditions (count is 2 AND colors are the same) are true:
        i.  Determine the color of the pair of pixels.
        ii. Determine the column indices of the two pixels (let the smaller index be `col_start` and the larger index be `col_end`).
        iii. Copy the original row to the corresponding row in the output grid.
        iv. In the output grid's row, change the color of all pixels from column `col_start + 1` to `col_end - 1` (inclusive) to the color determined in step (e)i.
    f.  If either condition (count is not 2 OR colors are different) is false, copy the original row directly to the corresponding row in the output grid without modification.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
