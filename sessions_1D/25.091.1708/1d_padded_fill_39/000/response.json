The output grids show horizontal lines connecting pairs of these non-white pixels.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n1.  In each example, the transformation operates row by row independently.\n2.  Within a row, the key seems to be the presence of exactly *two* non-white pixels.\n3.  If a row contains exactly two non-white pixels, and they are of the *same* color, the white pixels located horizontally *between* these two pixels are changed to that same color.\n4.  If a row does not meet these criteria (e.g., zero non-white pixels, one non-white pixel, more than two non-white pixels, or two non-white pixels of different colors), the row remains unchanged in the output.\n5.  The specific color (azure, yellow, gray) doesn't change the logic, only the color used for filling.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
