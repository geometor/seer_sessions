**General Assessment**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: finding pairs of identical non-white pixels within a row and filling the horizontal segment between them with the same color. However, the provided code failed because it assumed the input was already a 2D NumPy array, while the raw task data presents the input as a flat string of space-separated integers. The code did not perform the necessary parsing and reshaping of this string into a 2D grid structure.

The failure of the code on all examples, resulting in the output being identical to the input, confirms that the transformation logic (the filling step) was never triggered. This is consistent with the code not finding the expected pairs in the (unparsed) input.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to:
1.  Pre-process the input string: Determine the correct dimensions (height, width) of the grid and reshape the flat list of numbers into a 2D array. The dimensions might need to be inferred if not explicitly given (e.g., by trying factors of the total number of pixels or assuming common shapes). In this case, visual inspection and counting suggest specific rectangular shapes (3x21, 3x20, 3x21).
2.  Apply the previously defined transformation logic to the correctly parsed 2D grid.
