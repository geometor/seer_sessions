**Perception**

The input grids consist primarily of white pixels (0), with a few scattered non-white pixels. In each example, the non-white pixels appear in pairs within specific rows. Each pair within a row consists of two pixels of the *same* non-white color (orange (7) in train_1, green (3) in train_2, gray (5) in train_3).

The corresponding output grids show that the space *between* these pairs of same-colored pixels in each row has been filled with that same color, effectively drawing a horizontal line segment connecting the original pair. The transformation operates independently on each row. Rows that do not contain exactly two pixels of the same non-white color remain unchanged (although this case isn't explicitly shown, it's implied by the structure).

**Facts**

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row, identify all non-white pixels and their column indices.
4.  Check if there are exactly two non-white pixels in this row *and* if they both have the same color.
5.  If the condition in step 4 is met:
    a.  Determine the color of these two pixels (let's call it `fill_color`).
    b.  Determine the column indices of these two pixels (let's call them `col1` and `col2`).
    c.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) and the maximum column index (`max_col`) from `col1` and `col2`.
    d.  In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, change the color of all pixels from column `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
6.  If the condition in step 4 is not met, the row in the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid (it was already copied in step 1).
7.  After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output.

**General Assessment**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: finding pairs of identical non-white pixels within a row and filling the horizontal segment between them with the same color. However, the provided code failed because it assumed the input was already a 2D NumPy array, while the raw task data presents the input as a flat string of space-separated integers. The code did not perform the necessary parsing and reshaping of this string into a 2D grid structure.

The failure of the code on all examples, resulting in the output being identical to the input, confirms that the transformation logic (the filling step) was never triggered. This is consistent with the code not finding the expected pairs in the (unparsed) input.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to:
1.  Pre-process the input string: Determine the correct dimensions (height, width) of the grid and reshape the flat list of numbers into a 2D array. The dimensions might need to be inferred if not explicitly given (e.g., by trying factors of the total number of pixels or assuming common shapes). In this case, visual inspection and counting suggest specific rectangular shapes (3x21, 3x20, 3x21).
2.  Apply the previously defined transformation logic to the correctly parsed 2D grid.

**Metrics**
