Transformation rule:
1. Parse the input string of space-separated integers into a 2D grid. Assume a height of 3 based on visual inspection of the examples, and calculate the width accordingly.
2. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
4. For the current row, find all non-white pixels (value != 0).
5. If there are exactly two non-white pixels in the row and they have the same color value:
   a. Identify the color value.
   b. Identify the column indices of the two pixels.
   c. Determine the minimum and maximum of these column indices.
   d. In the corresponding row of the output grid, set all pixels from the minimum column index to the maximum column index (inclusive) to the identified color value.
6. If the condition in step 5 is not met for a row, that row in the output grid remains unchanged.
7. Return the modified output grid.
