elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x21, 3x14 tested)
      - structure: Contains rows with potential pairs of colored pixels.
  - type: object
    description: Endpoint pixels for horizontal lines.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (3, 5, 7 in examples)
      - quantity_per_row: exactly two (in rows that are transformed)
      - color_match: The two non-white pixels in a transformed row must have the same color.
      - arrangement: Located within the same row.
  - type: action
    description: Filling the horizontal segment between endpoint pairs.
    input: a row containing exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.
    output: modifies the row by changing pixels between the endpoints (inclusive) to their color.
    scope: operates independently on each row.
    condition: Only applies if a row meets the criteria (exactly 2 non-white pixels, same color).
  - type: result
    description: Output grid where endpoint pairs are connected by horizontal lines.
    properties:
      - background: remains white (0) where no lines are drawn.
      - contains: horizontal line segments of non-white colors.
      - segment_color: matches the color of the endpoint pair it connects.
      - segment_location: spans the columns between (and including) the original endpoint pair within their row.
      - unchanged_rows: Rows not meeting the endpoint pair criteria remain identical to the input.
