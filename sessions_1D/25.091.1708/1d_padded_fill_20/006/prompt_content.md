Transformation rule:
Iterate through each row of the input grid. If a row contains exactly two non-white pixels (value != 0), and both pixels have the same color value, then fill the horizontal segment between these two pixels (inclusive) with that color in the corresponding row of the output grid. Otherwise, the row remains unchanged. The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.

def transform(input_grid):

    Applies the transformation rule to connect pairs of same-colored pixels within each row.

    Args:
        input_grid (np.ndarray): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.
