Transformation rule:
Iterate through each row of the input grid. If a row contains exactly two non-white pixels, and both pixels have the same color, then fill the segment between these two pixels (inclusive) with that color in the corresponding row of the output grid. Otherwise, the row remains unchanged. The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.
