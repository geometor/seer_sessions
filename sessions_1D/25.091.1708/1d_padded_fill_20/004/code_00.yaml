elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - shape: All training examples are 3x21.
      - content: Primarily white pixels, with some non-white pixels.
  - type: object
    description: Paired non-white pixels acting as endpoints.
    properties:
      - color: Non-white (e.g., orange(7), green(3), gray(5)).
      - role: Define the start and end of a segment to be filled.
  - type: condition
    description: Requirement for action to occur within a row.
    properties:
      - count: Exactly two non-white pixels must exist in the row.
      - color_match: The two non-white pixels must have the identical color value.
  - type: action
    description: Filling the horizontal segment between endpoint pairs.
    input: A row meeting the condition (two identical non-white pixels).
    output: The segment of the row between the columns of the input pixels (inclusive) is filled with their color.
    scope: Operates independently on each row. Rows not meeting the condition remain unchanged.
  - type: result
    description: Output grid where pairs are connected by horizontal lines.
    properties:
      - structure: Horizontal line segments replace the white space between original pairs.
      - segment_color: Matches the color of the endpoint pair it connects.
      - segment_location: Spans columns from the minimum to the maximum index of the original pair within their row.
