In each example, the non-white pixels appear in pairs within specific rows. Each pair within a row consists of two pixels of the *same* non-white color (orange (7) in train_1, green (3) in train_2, gray (5) in train_3).\n\nThe corresponding output grids show that the space *between* these pairs of same-colored pixels in each row has been filled with that same color, effectively drawing a horizontal line segment connecting the original pair. The transformation operates independently on each row. Rows that do not contain exactly two pixels of the same non-white color remain unchanged (although this case isn't explicitly shown, it's implied by the structure).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the column indices of these two pixels (let's call them `col1` and `col2`).\n    c.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) and the maximum column index (`max_col`) from `col1` and `col2`.\n    d.  In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, change the color of all pixels from column `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.\n6.
