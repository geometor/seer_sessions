            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels.\n2.  **Colors:** The examples use white (0) as the background color and a single foreground color per example: red (2) in train_1, yellow (4) in train_2, and green (3) in train_3.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** In each input grid, there are one or more pixels of a specific foreground color scattered on a white background. These foreground pixels often appear one per row, but sometimes multiple foreground pixels can exist in the same row (as seen in train_3).\n4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output grids, the original foreground pixels are still present. Additionally, for each row that contained at least one foreground pixel in the input, all pixels from the *leftmost* position of such a foreground pixel to the right edge of the grid are filled with that same foreground color.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to operate row by row. It identifies the first occurrence (leftmost column) of a non-white pixel in each row. If found, it \"paints\" the rest of that row to the right, starting from that position, with the color of that first non-white pixel. Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
