task_description: Fill rows to the right starting from the leftmost non-background pixel.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row_index, column_index)
  - type: row
    properties:
      pixels: list of pixels
      contains_non_background_pixel: boolean
      leftmost_non_background_pixel:
        exists: boolean
        position: column_index
        color: integer (0-9)
actions:
  - name: find_leftmost_non_background_pixel
    inputs: row
    outputs:
      - found: boolean
      - column_index: integer
      - color: integer
    description: Iterate through a row from left to right to find the first pixel whose color is not the background color (0).
  - name: fill_row_rightward
    inputs:
      - row
      - start_column_index: integer
      - fill_color: integer
      - grid_width: integer
    outputs: modified_row
    description: Change the color of all pixels in the row from the start_column_index to the last column (grid_width - 1) to the fill_color.
relationships:
  - type: row_modification
    condition: A row contains at least one non-background pixel.
    action: The row is modified in the output.
    details: The modification starts at the column index of the leftmost non-background pixel and uses its color to fill all subsequent pixels in that row to the right edge.
  - type: row_preservation
    condition: A row contains only background pixels (color 0).
    action: The row remains unchanged in the output.
