task_description: Fill rows with alternating direction based on row index.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  background_color: 0 # white
  size: Variable, but consistent between input/output (e.g., 6x9 in examples).
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row_index, column_index)
  - type: row
    properties:
      pixels: list of pixels
      row_index: integer
      is_even_indexed: boolean # Derived from row_index
      contains_non_background_pixel: boolean
      leftmost_non_background_pixel:
        exists: boolean
        position: column_index
        color: integer (0-9)
actions:
  - name: find_leftmost_non_background_pixel
    inputs: row
    outputs:
      - found: boolean
      - column_index: integer
      - color: integer
    description: Iterate through a row from left to right to find the first pixel whose color is not the background color (0).
  - name: fill_row_segment
    inputs:
      - row
      - start_column_index: integer
      - end_column_index: integer # Inclusive
      - fill_color: integer
    outputs: modified_row
    description: Change the color of pixels in the row from start_column_index up to and including end_column_index to the fill_color.
relationships:
  - type: row_modification_even
    condition: A row has an even index (0, 2, ...) AND contains at least one non-background pixel.
    action: The row is modified in the output.
    details: Find the leftmost non-background pixel (at `start_col` with `fill_color`). Fill the row from `start_col` to the last column (`grid_width - 1`) using `fill_color`.
  - type: row_modification_odd
    condition: A row has an odd index (1, 3, ...) AND contains at least one non-background pixel.
    action: The row is modified in the output.
    details: Find the leftmost non-background pixel (at `end_col` with `fill_color`). Fill the row from the first column (0) up to and including `end_col` using `fill_color`.
  - type: row_preservation
    condition: A row contains only background pixels (color 0).
    action: The row remains unchanged in the output.
