task_description: Fill rows with alternating direction based on row index parity, triggered by the leftmost non-background pixel.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  background_color: 0 # white
  size_preservation: true # Input and output dimensions are identical.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row_index, column_index)
  - type: row
    properties:
      pixels: list of pixels
      row_index: integer (0-based)
      parity: enum (even, odd)
      contains_non_background_pixel: boolean
      leftmost_non_background_pixel:
        exists: boolean
        position: column_index
        color: integer (0-9)
actions:
  - name: find_leftmost_non_background_pixel
    inputs: row
    outputs:
      - found: boolean
      - column_index: integer
      - color: integer
    description: Iterate through a row from left to right (column 0 upwards) to find the first pixel whose color is not the background color (0).
  - name: fill_row_segment
    inputs:
      - row
      - start_column_index: integer
      - end_column_index: integer # Inclusive
      - fill_color: integer
    outputs: modified_row
    description: Change the color of pixels in the row within the specified column range [start_column_index, end_column_index] to the fill_color.
relationships:
  - type: conditional_row_modification
    condition: A row contains at least one non-background pixel.
    action: The row is modified in the output based on its index parity.
    details:
      - if_parity: even
        trigger: leftmost_non_background_pixel (at column `C`, color `F`)
        modification: fill_row_segment from column `C` to grid_width-1 with color `F`.
      - if_parity: odd
        trigger: leftmost_non_background_pixel (at column `C`, color `F`)
        modification: fill_row_segment from column 0 to column `C` (inclusive) with color `F`.
  - type: row_preservation
    condition: A row contains only background pixels (color 0).
    action: The row remains unchanged in the output.
