            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis, that all rows containing a non-background pixel are filled rightward from the leftmost occurrence, was incorrect. The transformed output differed significantly from the expected output, particularly in rows that should have remained partially filled or filled in the opposite direction. The code execution results clearly show that the original transformation rule was too simplistic.\n\nThe key difference lies in the *direction* of the fill operation, which appears to depend on the row's index (parity). Even-indexed rows seem to follow the original hypothesis (fill right), while odd-indexed rows follow a different rule (fill left).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Row Parity:** Re-examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the row index (0-based).\n2.  **Identify Leftmost Pixel:** For each row, confirm the position and color of the leftmost non-background pixel.\n3.  **Compare Fill Direction:** Compare the fill operation in the expected output for even rows versus odd rows.\n4.  **Formulate Parity-Based Rule:** Develop a new hypothesis incorporating row index parity. Even rows (0, 2, ...) are filled rightward from the leftmost non-background pixel. Odd rows (1, 3, ...) are filled leftward *up to and including* the column of the leftmost non-background pixel.\n5.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Mentally trace or use code execution (as demonstrated in the thought block) to verify this new rule against all training examples.\n6.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the corrected understanding.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe `code_output` provided in the thought process confirms the following:\n*   All input and output grids maintain the same dimensions.\n*   The background color remains white (0).\n*   The transformation rule simulated using the row parity hypothesis (even fill right, odd fill left, based on the *leftmost* non-background pixel) correctly reproduces the expected output for all rows in all three training examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
