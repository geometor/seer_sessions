Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
2.  **Colors:** The examples use white (0) as the background color and a single foreground color per example: red (2) in train_1, yellow (4) in train_2, and green (3) in train_3.
3.  **Input Pattern:** In each input grid, there are one or more pixels of a specific foreground color scattered on a white background. These foreground pixels often appear one per row, but sometimes multiple foreground pixels can exist in the same row (as seen in train_3).
4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output grids, the original foreground pixels are still present. Additionally, for each row that contained at least one foreground pixel in the input, all pixels from the *leftmost* position of such a foreground pixel to the right edge of the grid are filled with that same foreground color.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to operate row by row. It identifies the first occurrence (leftmost column) of a non-white pixel in each row. If found, it "paints" the rest of that row to the right, starting from that position, with the color of that first non-white pixel. Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill rows to the right starting from the leftmost non-background pixel.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:

      position: (row_index, column_index)
  - type: row

      pixels: list of pixels
      contains_non_background_pixel: boolean
      leftmost_non_background_pixel:
        exists: boolean
        position: column_index
        color: integer (0-9)
actions:
  - name: find_leftmost_non_background_pixel
    inputs: row
    outputs:
      - found: boolean
      - column_index: integer
      - color: integer
    description: Iterate through a row from left to right to find the first pixel whose color is not the background color (0).
  - name: fill_row_rightward
    inputs:
      - row
      - start_column_index: integer
      - fill_color: integer
      - grid_width: integer
    outputs: modified_row
    description: Change the color of all pixels in the row from the start_column_index to the last column (grid_width - 1) to the fill_color.
relationships:
  - type: row_modification
    condition: A row contains at least one non-background pixel.
    action: The row is modified in the output.
    details: The modification starts at the column index of the leftmost non-background pixel and uses its color to fill all subsequent pixels in that row to the right edge.
  - type: row_preservation
    condition: A row contains only background pixels (color 0).
    action: The row remains unchanged in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row, scan its pixels from left to right (column index 0 to the last column).
4.  Keep track of whether a non-white pixel has been found in the current row and, if so, its column index and color. Stop scanning the row as soon as the first non-white pixel is encountered.
5.  If a non-white pixel was found in the current row at `start_column` with `fill_color`:
    *   Iterate through the columns of the corresponding row in the *output* grid, starting from `start_column` up to the last column index (grid width - 1).
    *   Set the color of each pixel in this range (`[start_column, grid_width)`) to `fill_color`.
6.  If no non-white pixel was found in the current row (i.e., the row consists entirely of white pixels), make no changes to the corresponding row in the output grid.
7.  After processing all rows, the modified output grid is the result.
