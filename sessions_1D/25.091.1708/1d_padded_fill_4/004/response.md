**General Assessment:**

The initial transformation rule, "fill right from the leftmost non-background pixel," was too simplistic. The comparison between the expected outputs and the transformed outputs from the previous code clearly shows a pattern dependent on the row index. Specifically, the direction of the fill (leftward or rightward) alternates based on whether the row index is even or odd. The strategy will be to incorporate this row index parity into the transformation logic.

**Metrics:**

*   All examples use a grid size of 6 rows x 9 columns.
*   Each input grid uses white (0) as the background and contains scattered pixels of a single foreground color (red=2, yellow=4, green=3).
*   The transformation preserves the grid dimensions.
*   The transformation uses the color of the *leftmost* non-background pixel in a given input row as the fill color for that row in the output.
*   The crucial observation missed previously is the dependency on the row index:
    *   **Even rows (0, 2, 4):** The fill operation starts at the column of the leftmost non-background pixel and extends to the right edge (column 8).
    *   **Odd rows (1, 3, 5):** The fill operation starts at the left edge (column 0) and extends up to and including the column of the leftmost non-background pixel.
    *   Rows containing only the background color (0) remain unchanged.
*   The `code_output` from the metric gathering step confirms this alternating fill pattern for Example 1.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Get the width of the grid.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, along with its index (`row_index`), from top to bottom (index 0 to height-1).
4.  For the current row, scan its pixels from left to right to find the column index (`leftmost_col`) and color (`fill_color`) of the first non-white (non-zero) pixel.
5.  If no non-white pixel is found in the current row, proceed to the next row without modifying the output grid's corresponding row.
6.  If a non-white pixel is found:
    *   Check if the `row_index` is even (e.g., 0, 2, 4...).
        *   If even, iterate through the columns of the corresponding row in the *output* grid from `leftmost_col` to the last column index (grid width - 1). Set the color of each pixel in this range to `fill_color`.
    *   Check if the `row_index` is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5...).
        *   If odd, iterate through the columns of the corresponding row in the *output* grid from the first column index (0) up to and including `leftmost_col`. Set the color of each pixel in this range to `fill_color`.
7.  After processing all rows, the modified output grid is the result.
