            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial transformation rule, \"fill right from the leftmost non-background pixel,\" was too simplistic. The comparison between the expected outputs and the transformed outputs from the previous code clearly shows a pattern dependent on the row index. Specifically, the direction of the fill (leftward or rightward) alternates based on whether the row index is even or odd. The strategy will be to incorporate this row index parity into the transformation logic.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   All examples use a grid size of 6 rows x 9 columns.\n*   Each input grid uses white (0) as the background and contains scattered pixels of a single foreground color (red=2, yellow=4, green=3).\n*   The transformation preserves the grid dimensions.\n*   The transformation uses the color of the *leftmost* non-background pixel in a given input row as the fill color for that row in the output.\n*   The crucial observation missed previously is the dependency on the row index:\n    *   **Even rows (0, 2, 4):** The fill operation starts at the column of the leftmost non-background pixel and extends to the right edge (column 8).\n    *   **Odd rows (1, 3, 5):** The fill operation starts at the left edge (column 0) and extends up to and including the column of the leftmost non-background pixel.\n    *   Rows containing only the background color (0) remain unchanged.\n*   The `code_output` from the metric gathering step confirms this alternating fill pattern for Example 1.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
