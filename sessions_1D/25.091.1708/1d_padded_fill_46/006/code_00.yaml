task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_size_constancy: True # Input and output grids have the same dimensions (assumed 6x14).
  background_color: 0 # white

row_processing:
  dependency: Independent # Each row is processed based only on its own content.
  condition: Identify rows containing exactly two non-white pixels where both pixels have the same color value (C).
  action_if_condition_met:
    - Identify the column indices (c1, c2) of the two matching non-white pixels.
    - Determine the start column index: start_col = min(c1, c2).
    - Determine the end column index: end_col = max(c1, c2).
    - Fill all pixels in the current row from start_col to end_col (inclusive) with color C.
  action_if_condition_not_met: Copy the row from the input to the output without change.

objects:
  - type: Pixel_Pair
    description: Two pixels within the same row that meet the processing condition.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (value C > 0)
      - count_per_row: Exactly 2
      - color_consistency: Both pixels must have the same color C.
      - arrangement: Located within the same row, separated by zero or more white (0) pixels.
  - type: Horizontal_Line_Segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white color along a single row in the output.
    origin: Created by filling the space between a Pixel_Pair (inclusive of the pair pixels).

transformation:
  type: Conditional Row Fill
  input: Input grid
  output: Output grid (same dimensions)
  steps:
    - Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    - Analyze the row for the presence of a Pixel_Pair.
    - If a Pixel_Pair is found, generate a Horizontal_Line_Segment in the corresponding row of the output grid by filling between the pair's columns with their color.
    - Otherwise, copy the input row directly to the output grid row.
