            "text": "Okay, the provided code seems logically correct based on the initial observation (fill between two identical non-white pixels in a row). However, the execution results show that the transformation did not happen at all, with the output being identical to the input for all examples.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\n1.  **Code Logic vs. Execution:** The core logic implemented in the Python function appears to correctly capture the transformation rule described (find rows with exactly two identical non-white pixels, fill between them). The failure reported in the execution results suggests a potential discrepancy between the code's logic and how it was executed or how its results were interpreted. This could stem from issues in parsing the input strings into the expected 2D grid format within the testing environment, or perhaps a subtle interaction with the NumPy copy/modification mechanism in that specific context.\n2.  **Input/Output Format:** The task inputs/outputs were provided as single strings of space-separated integers. The Python code expects a list of lists or a NumPy array. It's crucial that the input strings were correctly parsed into a 2D structure (likely 6x14 based on analysis below) before being passed to the `transform` function during testing. If parsing failed or was incorrect, the function might have received malformed input, leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect comparison.\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   Assume the intended transformation rule (filling between pairs) remains correct.\n    *   Verify the grid dimensions and the specific locations/colors involved using tool code, parsing the input strings explicitly.\n    *   Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be crystal clear, leaving no ambiguity about the row-wise processing, the condition (exactly two identical non-white pixels), and the action (fill between inclusive).\n    *   The Python code itself seems robust *if* the input is correctly formatted. The focus should be on ensuring the understanding of the rule is precise and can be reliably translated into code, assuming a correct execution environment.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
