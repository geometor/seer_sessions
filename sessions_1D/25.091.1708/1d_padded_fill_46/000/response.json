In the input examples, certain rows contain exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by white pixels. The transformation fills the white space *between* these two non-white pixels with the same color, effectively creating a horizontal line segment connecting the two original pixels. Rows that do not contain exactly two non-white pixels of the same color remain unchanged in the output. The size of the grid remains constant.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
