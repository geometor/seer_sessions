## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code execution failed on all training examples, producing outputs identical to the inputs. The failure analysis revealed that the number of pixels differing between the expected output and the actual (failed) output precisely matched the number of pixels that should have been filled according to the observed transformation rule. This strongly indicates that the conceptual understanding of the transformation rule (identifying rows with exactly two identical non-white pixels and filling the horizontal span between them) was correct, but the Python implementation failed to execute this logic. The root cause is likely an implementation detail (e.g., data handling, loop condition, array modification) rather than a flaw in the perceived pattern.

The strategy moving forward is to reiterate the transformation rule with increased clarity, ensuring the YAML facts and natural language program are precise and unambiguous. The coder phase must then focus on correctly implementing this rule, paying close attention to data types, array indexing, and the conditions for triggering the fill operation.

## Metrics

The analysis of the training examples confirms the following:

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_size_constancy: True # Input and output grids share the same dimensions.
  background_color: 0 # Represents white pixels.

row_processing:
  granularity: Row-by-row # Each row is evaluated and potentially modified independently.
  condition_for_modification:
    description: A row is modified if and only if it contains exactly two non-white pixels, and those two pixels share the same color value.
    properties:
      - non_white_pixel_count: Must equal 2.
      - non_white_pixel_colors: Must be identical (e.g., both are color C, where C != 0).
  action_if_condition_met:
    type: Horizontal Line Fill
    description: Fill the segment of the row between the two identified non-white pixels (inclusive) with their color (C).
    details:
      - Identify the column indices `col1` and `col2` of the two non-white pixels.
      - Determine the start column `min(col1, col2)` and end column `max(col1, col2)`.
      - Change the color of all pixels in the current row from the start column to the end column (inclusive) to color C.
  action_if_condition_not_met:
    type: No Change
    description: The row in the output grid remains identical to the corresponding row in the input grid.

identified_objects:
  - type: Pixel Pair (Input Trigger)
    description: Two pixels within the same row that are non-white (color C != 0) and have the same color C. They are separated by one or more white (0) pixels.
    role: Identifies rows eligible for transformation.
  - type: Horizontal Segment (Output Feature)
    description: A contiguous horizontal line of pixels of a single non-white color (C) within a row.
    origin: Created by the 'Horizontal Line Fill' action applied to a 'Pixel Pair'. Includes the original pair and the filled white pixels between them.

assumptions:
 - The input grid is provided as a 2D structure (e.g., list of lists).
 - Pixel values are integers corresponding to colors.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as an identical copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Iterate through each row of the `input_grid`, keeping track of the current row index `r`.
3.  For each `row`:
    a.  Scan the `row` to find all non-white pixels. Record their color and column index.
    b.  Store these findings (e.g., in a list of {'color': C, 'col': col_idx} dictionaries).
4.  After scanning the `row`, check the findings:
    a.  Verify if exactly two non-white pixels were found.
    b.  If yes, verify if the colors of these two pixels are the same.
5.  If *both* conditions in step 4 are true (exactly two non-white pixels found, and they have the same color `C`):
    a.  Retrieve the column indices `col1` and `col2` of these two pixels.
    b.  Calculate the starting column `start_col = min(col1, col2)`.
    c.  Calculate the ending column `end_col = max(col1, col2)`.
    d.  Iterate through all column indices `c` from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive).
    e.  For each `c`, set the pixel at `output_grid[r][c]` to the color `C`.
6.  If the conditions in step 4 are *not* met, make no changes to the corresponding row in the `output_grid` (it retains the values copied from the `input_grid`).
7.  After processing all rows, return the completed `output_grid`.
