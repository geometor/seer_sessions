            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code execution failed on all training examples, producing outputs identical to the inputs. The failure analysis revealed that the number of pixels differing between the expected output and the actual (failed) output precisely matched the number of pixels that should have been filled according to the observed transformation rule. This strongly indicates that the conceptual understanding of the transformation rule (identifying rows with exactly two identical non-white pixels and filling the horizontal span between them) was correct, but the Python implementation failed to execute this logic. The root cause is likely an implementation detail (e.g., data handling, loop condition, array modification) rather than a flaw in the perceived pattern.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to reiterate the transformation rule with increased clarity, ensuring the YAML facts and natural language program are precise and unambiguous. The coder phase must then focus on correctly implementing this rule, paying close attention to data types, array indexing, and the conditions for triggering the fill operation.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe analysis of the training examples confirms the following:\n\n| Metric                     | Example 1         | Example 2         | Example 3         | Notes                                                              |\n| :------------------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Dimensions                 | 3x26              | 3x26              | 3x26              | Consistent grid size.                                              |\n| Input Unique Colors        | [0, 8]            | [0, 2]            | [0, 8]            | White (0) background and one non-white color per example.          |\n| Input Non-White Pixels     | 6 (2 per row)     | 6 (2 per row)     | 6 (2 per row)     | All rows fit the pattern.                                          |\n| Output Unique Colors       | [0, 8]            | [0, 2]            | [0, 8]            | No new colors introduced.                                          |\n| Output Non-White Pixels    | 33                | 15                | 12                | Count increases due to filling.                                    |\n| Pixels Filled (Per Row)    | 9                 | 3                 | 2                 | `max_col - min_col + 1 - 2`                                        |\n| Total Pixels Filled        | 27                | 9                 | 6                 | Matches the \"Pixels Off\" count from the failed code execution.     |\n| Rows Meeting Condition     | 3                 | 3                 | 3                 | All input rows triggered the transformation rule.                |\n| **Previous Code Success**  | **False**         | **False**         | **False**         | Previous implementation failed.                                    |\n| **Previous Code Pixels Off** | **27**            | **9**             | **6**             | Matches the expected number of pixels that should have been filled. |\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
