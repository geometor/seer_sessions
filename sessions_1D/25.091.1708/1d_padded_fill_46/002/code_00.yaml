task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_size_constancy: True # Input and output grids share the same dimensions.
  background_color: 0 # Represents white pixels.

row_processing:
  granularity: Row-by-row # Each row is evaluated and potentially modified independently.
  condition_for_modification:
    description: A row is modified if and only if it contains exactly two non-white pixels, and those two pixels share the same color value.
    properties:
      - non_white_pixel_count: Must equal 2.
      - non_white_pixel_colors: Must be identical (e.g., both are color C, where C != 0).
  action_if_condition_met:
    type: Horizontal Line Fill
    description: Fill the segment of the row between the two identified non-white pixels (inclusive) with their color (C).
    details:
      - Identify the column indices `col1` and `col2` of the two non-white pixels.
      - Determine the start column `min(col1, col2)` and end column `max(col1, col2)`.
      - Change the color of all pixels in the current row from the start column to the end column (inclusive) to color C.
  action_if_condition_not_met:
    type: No Change
    description: The row in the output grid remains identical to the corresponding row in the input grid.

identified_objects:
  - type: Pixel Pair (Input Trigger)
    description: Two pixels within the same row that are non-white (color C != 0) and have the same color C. They are separated by one or more white (0) pixels.
    role: Identifies rows eligible for transformation.
  - type: Horizontal Segment (Output Feature)
    description: A contiguous horizontal line of pixels of a single non-white color (C) within a row.
    origin: Created by the 'Horizontal Line Fill' action applied to a 'Pixel Pair'. Includes the original pair and the filled white pixels between them.

assumptions:
 - The input grid is provided as a 2D structure (e.g., list of lists).
 - Pixel values are integers corresponding to colors.
