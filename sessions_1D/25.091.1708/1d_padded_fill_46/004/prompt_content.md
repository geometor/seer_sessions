```python
import numpy as np

"""
Processes each row of the input grid independently. If a row contains exactly two 
non-white pixels and those two pixels share the same color, it fills the 
horizontal segment of the row between these two pixels (inclusive) with their color. 
Otherwise, the row remains unchanged.
"""

    Applies the row-based filling transformation.
