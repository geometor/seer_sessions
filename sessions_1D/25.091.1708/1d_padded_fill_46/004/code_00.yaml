task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_size_constancy: True # Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  background_color: 0 # white

row_processing:
  dependency: Independent # Each row is processed based only on its own content.
  condition: Row must contain exactly two non-white pixels, AND these two pixels must have the same color value.
  action_if_condition_met: Fill the horizontal segment between the two non-white pixels (inclusive of the endpoints) with their shared color.
  action_if_condition_not_met: Copy the row unchanged.

objects:
  - type: Pixel_Pair
    description: Two pixels within the same row identified by the transformation rule.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., azure(8) or red(2))
      - color_consistency: Both pixels in the pair must have the same color.
      - count_per_row: Exactly 2 non-white pixels must exist in the entire row for the rule to apply.
      - arrangement: Located in the same row, potentially separated by white pixels.
  - type: Horizontal_Line_Segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white color along a single row, created by the transformation.
    origin: Formed by filling between (and including) a qualifying Pixel_Pair.

transformation:
  type: Horizontal_Fill
  target: White pixels located horizontally between a qualifying Pixel_Pair, as well as the locations of the Pixel_Pair itself.
  color_source: The color of the qualifying Pixel_Pair.
  outcome: Converts a specific Pixel_Pair configuration into a solid Horizontal_Line_Segment.
