*   **Perception:** The task involves processing each row of the input grid independently. In the input examples, certain rows contain exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by white pixels. The transformation fills the white space *between* these two non-white pixels with the same color, effectively creating a horizontal line segment connecting the two original pixels. Rows that do not contain exactly two non-white pixels of the same color remain unchanged in the output. The size of the grid remains constant.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_dimensionality: 2D
      grid_size_constancy: True # Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
      background_color: 0 # white

    row_processing:
      dependency: Independent # Each row is processed based only on its own content.
      condition: Row must contain exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.
      action_if_condition_met: Fill the horizontal segment between the two non-white pixels (inclusive) with their color.
      action_if_condition_not_met: Copy the row unchanged.

    objects:
      - type: Pixel_Pair
        properties:
          - color: non-white (consistent within the pair, e.g., azure(8) or red(2))
          - count_per_row: Exactly 2
          - arrangement: Horizontal alignment within the same row
          - separation: Separated by one or more white (0) pixels.
      - type: Horizontal_Line_Segment
        description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white color along a single row.

    transformation:
      type: Fill
      target: White pixels located horizontally between a Pixel_Pair.
      color_source: The color of the Pixel_Pair.
      outcome: Converts a Pixel_Pair separated by white space into a solid Horizontal_Line_Segment.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    3.  For the current row, find the indices and colors of all non-white pixels.
    4.  Check if there are exactly two non-white pixels in this row and if they have the same color (`C`).
    5.  If the condition in step 4 is met:
        a.  Let the column indices of these two pixels be `c1` and `c2`. Assume `c1 < c2`.
        b.  For every column index `c` from `c1` to `c2` (inclusive), set the pixel at the current row and column `c` in the output grid to color `C`.
    6.  If the condition in step 4 is not met, the row in the output grid remains unchanged (as it was copied in step 1).
    7.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code execution failed on all training examples, producing outputs identical to the inputs. The failure analysis revealed that the number of pixels differing between the expected output and the actual (failed) output precisely matched the number of pixels that should have been filled according to the observed transformation rule. This strongly indicates that the conceptual understanding of the transformation rule (identifying rows with exactly two identical non-white pixels and filling the horizontal span between them) was correct, but the Python implementation failed to execute this logic. The root cause is likely an implementation detail (e.g., data handling, loop condition, array modification) rather than a flaw in the perceived pattern.

The strategy moving forward is to reiterate the transformation rule with increased clarity, ensuring the YAML facts and natural language program are precise and unambiguous. The coder phase must then focus on correctly implementing this rule, paying close attention to data types, array indexing, and the conditions for triggering the fill operation.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as an identical copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Iterate through each row of the `input_grid`, keeping track of the current row index `r`.
3.  For each `row`:
    a.  Scan the `row` to find all non-white pixels. Record their color and column index.
    b.  Store these findings (e.g., in a list of {'color': C, 'col': col_idx} dictionaries).
4.  After scanning the `row`, check the findings:
    a.  Verify if exactly two non-white pixels were found.
    b.  If yes, verify if the colors of these two pixels are the same.
5.  If *both* conditions in step 4 are true (exactly two non-white pixels found, and they have the same color `C`):
    a.  Retrieve the column indices `col1` and `col2` of these two pixels.
    b.  Calculate the starting column `start_col = min(col1, col2)`.
    c.  Calculate the ending column `end_col = max(col1, col2)`.
    d.  Iterate through all column indices `c` from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive).
    e.  For each `c`, set the pixel at `output_grid[r][c]` to the color `C`.
6.  If the conditions in step 4 are *not* met, make no changes to the corresponding row in the `output_grid` (it retains the values copied from the `input_grid`).
7.  After processing all rows, return the completed `output_grid`.
