Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a white background (color 0). Each grid contains several rows where exactly two pixels of the same non-white color appear. The non-white colors observed are gray (5), blue (1), and orange (7) in the respective examples.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions and the same white background as the inputs. The key difference is that the horizontal segment *between* the two non-white pixels in each relevant row is filled with the same non-white color. The original non-white pixels also remain in their positions.
3.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation identifies rows containing pairs of non-white pixels. For each such row, it locates the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels. It then fills the horizontal line segment connecting these two pixels (inclusive) with their color. Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged. The transformation operates independently on each row.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context: The task involves filling the horizontal gap between pairs of identical colored pixels found within rows of the input grid.
elements:
  background:
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
    role: Fills most of the grid initially. Remains unchanged unless overwritten by the fill operation.
  objects:
    - type: Boundary Pixels
      description: Pairs of non-white pixels located within the same row.
      properties:
        color: Varies per example (gray, blue, orange), but consistent within a pair and its row.
        count_per_row: Exactly two in the examples.
      role: Define the start and end points for the fill operation within a row.
  actions:
    - type: Identify Rows
      description: Find rows containing non-white pixels.
    - type: Find Boundaries
      description: In identified rows, locate the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels.
      input: A row containing non-white pixels.
      output: min_col_index, max_col_index, pixel_color
    - type: Fill Segment
      description: Change the color of pixels in a row between the identified boundaries (inclusive) to the boundary pixel color.
      input: row_index, min_col_index, max_col_index, pixel_color
      output: Modified row for the output grid.
relationships:
  spatial: The core operation relies on the horizontal positioning (column index) of the boundary pixels within a row.
  color_consistency: The fill color used is determined by the color of the boundary pixels in that row.
grid_properties:
  size_invariance: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  row_independence: The transformation logic is applied independently to each row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index.
3.  For each row:
    a.  Find all column indices where the pixel is not white (0).
    b.  If no non-white pixels are found in the row, copy the row from the input grid to the corresponding row in the output grid and continue to the next row.
    c.  If non-white pixels are found:
        i.  Determine the color (`C`) of the non-white pixels in this row (based on the examples, all non-white pixels in a relevant row share the same color).
        ii. Identify the minimum column index (`min_col`) among the non-white pixels.
        iii. Identify the maximum column index (`max_col`) among the non-white pixels.
        iv. In the corresponding row of the output grid, set the color of all pixels from column `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to color `C`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
