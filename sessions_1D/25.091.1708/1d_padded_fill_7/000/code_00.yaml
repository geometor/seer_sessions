task_context: The task involves filling the horizontal gap between pairs of identical colored pixels found within rows of the input grid.
elements:
  background:
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
    role: Fills most of the grid initially. Remains unchanged unless overwritten by the fill operation.
  objects:
    - type: Boundary Pixels
      description: Pairs of non-white pixels located within the same row.
      properties:
        color: Varies per example (gray, blue, orange), but consistent within a pair and its row.
        count_per_row: Exactly two in the examples.
      role: Define the start and end points for the fill operation within a row.
  actions:
    - type: Identify Rows
      description: Find rows containing non-white pixels.
    - type: Find Boundaries
      description: In identified rows, locate the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels.
      input: A row containing non-white pixels.
      output: min_col_index, max_col_index, pixel_color
    - type: Fill Segment
      description: Change the color of pixels in a row between the identified boundaries (inclusive) to the boundary pixel color.
      input: row_index, min_col_index, max_col_index, pixel_color
      output: Modified row for the output grid.
relationships:
  spatial: The core operation relies on the horizontal positioning (column index) of the boundary pixels within a row.
  color_consistency: The fill color used is determined by the color of the boundary pixels in that row.
grid_properties:
  size_invariance: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  row_independence: The transformation logic is applied independently to each row.
