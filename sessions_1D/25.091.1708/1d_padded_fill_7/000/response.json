Each grid contains several rows where exactly two pixels of the same non-white color appear. The non-white colors observed are gray (5), blue (1), and orange (7) in the respective examples.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions and the same white background as the inputs. The key difference is that the horizontal segment *between* the two non-white pixels in each relevant row is filled with the same non-white color. The original non-white pixels also remain in their positions.\n3.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation identifies rows containing pairs of non-white pixels. For each such row, it locates the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels. It then fills the horizontal line segment connecting these two pixels (inclusive) with their color. Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged. The transformation operates independently on each row.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
