task_type: pattern_completion
scope: row-wise
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: All examples are 3x11, but the rule should generalize.
  - colors_used: white (0), green (3), gray (5). The transformation color depends on the input row.
objects:
  - type: row
    properties:
      - pixels: A sequence of pixel colors (integers 0-9).
      - has_non_white_pixels: Boolean, true if any pixel color > 0 exists.
  - type: non_white_pixel_group (within a row)
    properties:
      - indices: List of column indices where pixel color > 0.
      - min_col: The minimum column index in the group.
      - max_col: The maximum column index in the group.
      - color: The color of the non-white pixels (Assumption: only one non-white color per relevant row, determined by the pixel at min_col).
actions:
  - name: process_row
    input: input_row (list of pixel colors)
    output: output_row (list of pixel colors)
    steps:
      - find non_white_indices in input_row.
      - if non_white_indices is not empty:
        - determine min_col from indices.
        - determine max_col from indices.
        - determine fill_color from input_row[min_col].
        - create output_row by copying input_row.
        - modify output_row by setting pixels from min_col to max_col (inclusive) to fill_color.
      - else (non_white_indices is empty):
        - create output_row by copying input_row (no change).
relationships:
  - type: horizontal_span
    defined_by: The leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels in a row.
transformation:
  - for each row in the input grid:
    - find all column indices `idx` where `input_grid[row, idx] != 0`.
    - if such indices exist:
      - find `min_col = min(indices)`.
      - find `max_col = max(indices)`.
      - get `fill_color = input_grid[row, min_col]`.
      - for the output grid's row, set `output_grid[row, col] = fill_color` for all `col` from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive).
      - copy `input_grid[row, col]` to `output_grid[row, col]` for `col < min_col` and `col > max_col`.
    - else (no non-white pixels in the row):
      - copy the entire input row to the output row.
