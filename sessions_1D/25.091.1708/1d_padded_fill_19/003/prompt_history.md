*   **Perception:** The task operates on each row of the grid independently. In each row containing non-white pixels, the transformation identifies the horizontal extent spanned by these non-white pixels. It then fills this entire horizontal span (from the leftmost non-white pixel to the rightmost non-white pixel) with the color of the original non-white pixels. Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged. The examples show cases where two non-white pixels of the same color exist in a row, separated by white pixels. The output fills the gap between them with that same color.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    2.  For the current row, find the column indices of all non-white pixels.
    3.  If any non-white pixels are found:
        a.  Identify the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (`col_start`).
        b.  Identify the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (`col_end`).
        c.  Get the color (`C`) of the non-white pixel(s) in that row. (Assumption based on examples: all non-white pixels in a processed row have the same color; use this color).
        d.  In the corresponding output row, change the color of all pixels from column `col_start` to `col_end` (inclusive) to color `C`.
    4.  If no non-white pixels are found in the current row, copy the row unchanged to the output grid.
    5.  Assemble the processed rows into the final output grid.

**General Assessment**

The previous code failed because it misinterpreted the input format. The input strings represent flattened 2D grids, but the code treated them as single 1D arrays (rows). Consequently, it found the minimum and maximum non-white indices across the *entire* flattened grid and filled that span, instead of operating independently on each row of the intended 2D structure.

The underlying logic described in the previous natural language program (operating row-by-row, finding the span of non-white pixels within each row, and filling that span with the non-white color) appears correct based on comparing the 2D input/output pairs.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correctly parse the flattened input strings into 2D grids (determining the dimensions).
2.  Apply the previously described row-wise transformation logic to the correctly structured 2D grids.
3.  Update the facts and natural language program to be precise about the 2D structure.

**Metrics and Data Parsing**

Let's parse the input/output strings into 2D grids to confirm dimensions and structure. Assuming the visual layout suggests a 3-row structure for the 33-element strings (3x11).


*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np
import json

def parse_grid_string(grid_string, rows):
    pixels = [int(p) for p in grid_string.split()]
    if len(pixels) % rows != 0:
        # Try to infer columns if rows don't divide evenly, or raise error
        # For now, assume rows is correct and calculate cols
        raise ValueError(f"Number of pixels {len(pixels)} is not divisible by specified rows {rows}")
    cols = len(pixels) // rows
    grid = np.array(pixels).reshape((rows, cols))
    return grid.tolist()

```
The parsing confirms the grids are 3x11. The previous code's failure is definitively linked to not handling the 2D structure.

grid_properties:

    description: The segment within a row defined by the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels.
transformation:
  - for each row in the input grid (indexed `r` from 0 to height-1):
    - find all column indices (`cols`) in row `r` where the pixel color is not white (0).
    - if `cols` is not empty:
      - determine the minimum column index (`min_col`) from `cols`.
      - determine the maximum column index (`max_col`) from `cols`.
      - determine the fill color (`C`) by taking the color of any non-white pixel in that row (e.g., the pixel at `input_grid[r][min_col]`). All non-white pixels in a row seem to share the same color in the examples.
      - in the corresponding output grid row `r`, set the color of all pixels from column `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to `C`.
    - else (if `cols` is empty, meaning the row is all white):
      - copy the input row `r` directly to the output grid row `r`.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify the column indices of all pixels that are *not* white (color 0).
    b.  Check if any non-white pixels were found in this row.
    c.  If non-white pixels *were* found:
        i.  Find the smallest (leftmost) column index among them (`col_start`).
        ii. Find the largest (rightmost) column index among them (`col_end`).
        iii. Determine the color (`fill_color`) to use for filling. This color is the color of the non-white pixels found in this row (based on examples, there's only one non-white color per affected row; use the color at `input_grid[row_index][col_start]`).
        iv. In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, set all pixels from column `col_start` to `col_end` (inclusive) to the `fill_color`.
    d.  If *no* non-white pixels were found in the current row (the row is entirely white):
        i.  Copy the row from the input grid directly to the corresponding row in the output grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
