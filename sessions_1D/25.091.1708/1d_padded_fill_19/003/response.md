```python
"""
Iterate through each row of the input grid (which is a 2D list of integers).
For each row, find the horizontal span between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels (pixels with value > 0).
If non-white pixels exist in the row, fill the entire span in the output grid's corresponding row (from the leftmost to the rightmost non-white pixel's column, inclusive) with the color of those non-white pixels. Assume all non-white pixels within a single row share the same color, based on the examples.
If a row contains only white pixels (value 0), copy it unchanged to the output grid.
