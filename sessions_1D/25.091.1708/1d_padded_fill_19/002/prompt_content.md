Iterate through each row of the input grid.
For each row, find the horizontal span between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels.
If non-white pixels exist in the row, fill the entire span (from the leftmost to the rightmost non-white pixel, inclusive) with the color of those non-white pixels.
If a row contains only white pixels, leave it unchanged.
