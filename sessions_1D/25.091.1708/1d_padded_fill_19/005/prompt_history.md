*   **Perception:** The task operates on each row of the grid independently. In each row containing non-white pixels, the transformation identifies the horizontal extent spanned by these non-white pixels. It then fills this entire horizontal span (from the leftmost non-white pixel to the rightmost non-white pixel) with the color of the original non-white pixels. Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged. The examples show cases where two non-white pixels of the same color exist in a row, separated by white pixels. The output fills the gap between them with that same color.

## General Assessment

The previous execution failed because the code implemented a transformation based on the *global* minimum and maximum column indices of non-white pixels across the entire grid, rather than processing each row independently. The results show that the code filled a single horizontal band spanning these global limits in every row containing any non-white pixel, which does not match the expected outputs for any example.

The analysis strongly suggests the input/output examples, though presented as flattened strings, represent 2D grids (likely 3x11 based on length 33). Re-interpreting the examples as 3x11 grids reveals a consistent row-wise transformation rule.

## Strategy

The core strategy is to correctly implement the row-wise transformation identified:
1.  Treat the input as a 2D grid.
2.  Iterate through each row independently.
3.  For rows containing non-white pixels, identify the leftmost (`min_col`) and rightmost (`max_col`) non-white pixels *within that specific row*.
4.  Fill the segment between `min_col` and `max_col` (inclusive) in the corresponding output row using the color of the non-white pixels found in that input row.
5.  Leave rows containing only white pixels unchanged.

## Metrics

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid by making an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Go through each row of the input grid, one by one, using its row index `r`.
3.  For the current row (`input_row`):
    a.  Identify all the columns in this row that contain a non-white pixel (a color other than 0). Collect the column indices of these pixels.
    b.  Check if any non-white pixels were found in this row.
    c.  If one or more non-white pixels were found:
        i.  Find the smallest column index among them; this is the `start_column`.
        ii. Find the largest column index among them; this is the `end_column`.
        iii. Determine the color of these non-white pixels (they will all be the same color in this row); this is the `fill_color`.
        iv. In the output grid's row `r`, change the color of all pixels from `start_column` to `end_column` (including both ends) to the `fill_color`.
    d.  If no non-white pixels were found in the `input_row`, make no changes to the corresponding row in the output grid (it remains as copied initially).
4.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.
