            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous execution failed because the code implemented a transformation based on the *global* minimum and maximum column indices of non-white pixels across the entire grid, rather than processing each row independently. The results show that the code filled a single horizontal band spanning these global limits in every row containing any non-white pixel, which does not match the expected outputs for any example.\n\nThe analysis strongly suggests the input/output examples, though presented as flattened strings, represent 2D grids (likely 3x11 based on length 33). Re-interpreting the examples as 3x11 grids reveals a consistent row-wise transformation rule.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe core strategy is to correctly implement the row-wise transformation identified:\n1.  Treat the input as a 2D grid.\n2.  Iterate through each row independently.\n3.  For rows containing non-white pixels, identify the leftmost (`min_col`) and rightmost (`max_col`) non-white pixels *within that specific row*.\n4.  Fill the segment between `min_col` and `max_col` (inclusive) in the corresponding output row using the color of the non-white pixels found in that input row.\n5.  Leave rows containing only white pixels unchanged.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the 3x11 grid interpretation confirmed via `tool_code`:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Expected Output Shape | Previous Code Match | Previous Code Pixels Off | Row-wise Hypothesis Matches Expected | Notes                                                                                                     |\n| :------ | :---------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (3, 11)     | (3, 11)               | False                 | 16                         | Yes                                  | Input rows [0,2] have color 3 at cols [0, 2].
