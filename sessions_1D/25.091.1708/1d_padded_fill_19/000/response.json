In each row containing non-white pixels, the transformation identifies the horizontal extent spanned by these non-white pixels. It then fills this entire horizontal span (from the leftmost non-white pixel to the rightmost non-white pixel) with the color of the original non-white pixels. Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged. The examples show cases where two non-white pixels of the same color exist in a row, separated by white pixels. The output fills the gap between them with that same color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
