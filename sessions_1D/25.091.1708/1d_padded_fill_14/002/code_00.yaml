task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - background_color: white (0)
  - input_structure: single_row (e.g., 1x60 in examples)
row_processing: # Applies to the single input row
  - independent_segments: True # Multiple segments handled independently
input_row_pattern:
  - object: non_white_pixel_pairs
    properties:
      - color: non-white (consistent within a pair, and across all pairs within an example)
      - count_per_pair: 2
      - count_of_pairs: multiple (e.g., 3 pairs in each example)
      - arrangement: Pairs are horizontally separated by sequences of white pixels.
      - pair_grouping: Non-white pixels are grouped into pairs based on their order of appearance along the row (1st with 2nd, 3rd with 4th, etc.).
  - object: intervening_pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: between the two pixels within a pair, and between adjacent pairs.
output_row_pattern:
  - action: fill_segment_for_each_pair
    parameters:
      - segment_definition: horizontal span from the first pixel to the second pixel of an input pair (inclusive).
      - color: the non-white color of the corresponding input pair.
    target: creates multiple, distinct colored segments within the output row.
  - object: other_pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
relationships:
  - Each colored segment in the output row maps directly to one non-white pixel pair from the input row.
  - The start and end columns of an output segment correspond exactly to the column indices of the two pixels in the input pair.
  - The color of an output segment is determined by the color of its corresponding input pair.
