*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming 2D grids. Each input grid consists of several rows, and each row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by white pixels. The remaining pixels in the grid are white. The transformation operates row by row. For each row, the segment horizontally connecting the two non-white pixels (inclusive) is filled with that same non-white color in the output grid. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed because it misinterpreted the structure of the input examples and the core transformation rule. The examples were presented in a way that suggested multiple rows, but the raw data indicated each example was a single, long row (1x60). The code incorrectly identified only the very first and very last non-white pixels in the entire row and filled the space between them. The correct transformation, revealed by comparing the transformed output with the expected output and confirmed by metric analysis, involves identifying multiple, distinct *pairs* of non-white pixels within the single row and filling the horizontal segment *between the pixels of each pair independently*.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

The resolution involves correcting the understanding of the input structure and adjusting the algorithm:
1.  Recognize that the input is a single row.
2.  Identify *all* non-white pixels in the row.
3.  Group the indices of these non-white pixels into consecutive pairs (0th with 1st, 2nd with 3rd, etc.).
4.  For each identified pair, fill the segment between its start and end indices (inclusive) in the output grid with the pair's color.

**Metrics:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initializing all pixels to white (0).
2.  Identify the single row of the input grid.
3.  Find the column indices of all pixels in this row that are not white (non-zero). Store these indices in a list, maintaining their left-to-right order.
4.  Check if the number of non-white indices found is even. If not, the pattern is unexpected (based on examples), but proceed by pairing consecutive indices as much as possible.
5.  Iterate through the list of non-white indices, taking them two at a time to form pairs: the first index pairs with the second, the third with the fourth, and so on.
6.  For each pair of indices (`col1`, `col2`):
    a.  Get the non-white color (`fill_color`) from the input grid at either `(row_index, col1)` or `(row_index, col2)` (they should be the same).
    b.  In the corresponding row of the output grid, set all pixels from column `col1` to column `col2` (inclusive) to the `fill_color`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
