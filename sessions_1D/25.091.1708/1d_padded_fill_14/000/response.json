Each input grid consists of several rows, and each row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by white pixels. The remaining pixels in the grid are white. The transformation operates row by row. For each row, the segment horizontally connecting the two non-white pixels (inclusive) is filled with that same non-white color in the output grid. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
