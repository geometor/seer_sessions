"""
Fill the horizontal gap between pairs of identical colored pixels in each row.

Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, identify all non-white pixels. 
If exactly two non-white pixels are found in a row, and they both have the same color, 
then fill the segment of that row between these two pixels (inclusive) with their color. 
Otherwise, leave the row unchanged.
