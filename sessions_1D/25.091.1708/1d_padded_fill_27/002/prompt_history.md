Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input grids consist primarily of white pixels (0). Each grid contains several horizontal rows where two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., blue (1) or orange (7)) appear, separated by a number of white pixels. The output grids show that the white pixels located horizontally *between* these two non-white pixels in each relevant row have been changed to match the color of the pair. Rows that do not contain exactly two non-white pixels of the same color remain unchanged. The transformation appears to operate independently on each row.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Fill the horizontal gap between pairs of identical colored pixels in each row."

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - potentially_sparse_content: True

object_types:
  - type: boundary_pixel
    description: "Non-white pixels that mark the start and end of a segment to be filled."
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0). Examples show blue (1) and orange (7).
      - count_per_row_trigger: Exactly 2 pixels of the same color must be present in a row for the transformation to apply to that row.

actions:
  - action: find_boundaries
    description: "For each row, identify the column indices of all non-white pixels."
    inputs:
      - row_data
    outputs:
      - list_of_non_white_pixel_indices_and_colors

  - action: check_conditions
    description: "Verify if a row meets the criteria for filling: exactly two non-white pixels, and both pixels having the same color."
    inputs:
      - list_of_non_white_pixel_indices_and_colors
    outputs:
      - boolean_condition_met
      - fill_color (if condition met)
      - start_column_index (if condition met)
      - end_column_index (if condition met)

  - action: fill_segment
    description: "Change the color of pixels in a specified row between a start and end column index (inclusive) to a specified fill color."
    inputs:
      - row_data
      - start_column_index
      - end_column_index
      - fill_color
    outputs:
      - modified_row_data

relationships:
  - type: row_independence
    description: "The transformation logic is applied independently to each row of the grid."
  - type: boundary_to_fill
    description: "The color of the two boundary pixels determines the color used to fill the segment between them."
  - type: spatial_containment
    description: "The filling occurs only in the cells horizontally located between the two boundary pixels within the same row."

constraints:
  - The transformation only occurs if a row contains *exactly two* non-white pixels.
  - The two non-white pixels in the row must be of the *same color*.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row, find all non-white pixels and record their column indices and colors.
4.  Check if exactly two non-white pixels were found in the row.
5.  If exactly two were found, check if they have the same color.
6.  If both conditions (exactly two pixels, same color) are met:
    a.  Determine the color of these two pixels.
    b.  Find the minimum and maximum column indices of these two pixels.
    c.  In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels from the minimum column index to the maximum column index (inclusive) to the determined color.
7.  If the conditions in steps 4 or 5 are not met, make no changes to the corresponding row in the output grid.
8.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
