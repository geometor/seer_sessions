Each grid contains several horizontal rows where two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., blue (1) or orange (7)) appear, separated by a number of white pixels. The output grids show that the white pixels located horizontally *between* these two non-white pixels in each relevant row have been changed to match the color of the pair. Rows that do not contain exactly two non-white pixels of the same color remain unchanged. The transformation appears to operate independently on each row.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
