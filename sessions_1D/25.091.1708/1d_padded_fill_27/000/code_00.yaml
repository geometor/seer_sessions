task_description: "Fill the horizontal gap between pairs of identical colored pixels in each row."

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - potentially_sparse_content: True

object_types:
  - type: boundary_pixel
    description: "Non-white pixels that mark the start and end of a segment to be filled."
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0). Examples show blue (1) and orange (7).
      - count_per_row_trigger: Exactly 2 pixels of the same color must be present in a row for the transformation to apply to that row.

actions:
  - action: find_boundaries
    description: "For each row, identify the column indices of all non-white pixels."
    inputs:
      - row_data
    outputs:
      - list_of_non_white_pixel_indices_and_colors

  - action: check_conditions
    description: "Verify if a row meets the criteria for filling: exactly two non-white pixels, and both pixels having the same color."
    inputs:
      - list_of_non_white_pixel_indices_and_colors
    outputs:
      - boolean_condition_met
      - fill_color (if condition met)
      - start_column_index (if condition met)
      - end_column_index (if condition met)

  - action: fill_segment
    description: "Change the color of pixels in a specified row between a start and end column index (inclusive) to a specified fill color."
    inputs:
      - row_data
      - start_column_index
      - end_column_index
      - fill_color
    outputs:
      - modified_row_data

relationships:
  - type: row_independence
    description: "The transformation logic is applied independently to each row of the grid."
  - type: boundary_to_fill
    description: "The color of the two boundary pixels determines the color used to fill the segment between them."
  - type: spatial_containment
    description: "The filling occurs only in the cells horizontally located between the two boundary pixels within the same row."

constraints:
  - The transformation only occurs if a row contains *exactly two* non-white pixels.
  - The two non-white pixels in the row must be of the *same color*.
