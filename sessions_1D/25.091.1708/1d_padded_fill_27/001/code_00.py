Fill the horizontal gap between pairs of identical colored pixels in each row.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3. For the current row, find all non-white pixels and record their column indices and colors.
4. Check if exactly two non-white pixels were found in the row.
5. If exactly two were found, check if they have the same color.
6. If both conditions (exactly two pixels, same color) are met:
   a. Determine the color of these two pixels.
   b. Find the minimum and maximum column indices of these two pixels.
   c. In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels 
      from the minimum column index to the maximum column index (inclusive) to the determined color.
7. If the conditions in steps 4 or 5 are not met, make no changes to the corresponding row in the output grid.
8. After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
