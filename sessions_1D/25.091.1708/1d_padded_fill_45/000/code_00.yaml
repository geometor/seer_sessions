task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - role: grid
    attributes:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - element_type: pixels
  - role: objects
    description: Contiguous or non-contiguous sets of non-white pixels within the grid. In these examples, they appear as single pixels per row.
    attributes:
      - color: varies (gray, azure, green)
      - location: specific row and column indices
  - role: transformation
    description: Modifies the grid based on the location of non-white pixels.
    attributes:
      - scope: row-based
      - action: color_filling
      - direction: rightward
      - condition: applies only to white pixels to the right of a non-white pixel within the same row.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The core logic relies on the relative position of pixels within each row (left-to-right).
  - type: conditional_coloring
    description: The coloring action depends on the presence and color of a non-white pixel earlier in the same row.

observations:
  - Each row in the input appears to have at most one non-white pixel.
  - The transformation preserves the original non-white pixels.
  - Rows that are entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output.
  - The color used for filling is determined by the color of the non-white pixel found in that specific row.
