            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use grids (2D arrays). The size varies between examples (6x6 in the first, 7x7 in the others).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The inputs use a background color of white (0) and one other distinct color per example (gray-5, azure-8, green-3).\n3.  **Input Pattern:** In each input grid, each row contains at most one non-white pixel. These non-white pixels often form a line or pattern (diagonal lines in examples 1 and 3, broken diagonal/segments in example 2).\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids retain the original non-white pixels. Additionally, in each row that contains a non-white pixel, the white pixels *to the right* of that non-white pixel are changed to match the color of the non-white pixel in that row.\n5.  **Row Independence:** The transformation seems to be applied independently to each row. Rows containing only white pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index.\n3.  For the current row:\n    a.  Initialize variables `found_non_white_pixel = false`, `non_white_color = null`, and `non_white_col_index = -1`.\n    b.  Iterate through the columns of the current row from left to right (column index `c`).\n    c.  If the pixel at the current `(row_index, c)` is not white (value > 0) and `found_non_white_pixel` is still `false`:\n        i.  Set `found_non_white_pixel = true`.\n        ii. Store the color of this pixel in `non_white_color`.\n        iii. Store the column index `c` in `non_white_col_index`.\n        iv. Break the inner column loop for this row (since we only care about the first non-white pixel from the left). *Correction*: Continue the inner loop but don't update the color/index. Or simply break the inner loop. Let's re-check. In ex1 row 5: `5 0 0 0 0 0` -> `5 5 5 5 5 5`. It fills from the *first* non-white pixel. So, yes, find the first one.\n    d.  If `found_non_white_pixel` is `true` after checking all columns in the row:\n        i.  Iterate through the columns of the *output grid's* current row, starting from the column *after* `non_white_col_index` (`c = non_white_col_index + 1`) to the end of the row.\n        ii. If the pixel in the *output grid* at `(row_index, c)` is currently white (0), change its color to `non_white_color`.\n4.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid."
