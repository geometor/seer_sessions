"""
Transformation Rule: Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, find the first non-white pixel (value > 0) when scanning from left to right. If such a pixel is found, change the color of all pixels in that same row, located to the right of this first non-white pixel, to match the color of the first non-white pixel. The filling extends to the rightmost edge of the grid. Rows containing only white pixels (value 0) remain unchanged.

    Applies a row-based transformation where the color of the first non-white pixel
