Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use grids (2D arrays). The size varies between examples (6x6 in the first, 7x7 in the others).
2.  **Color Palette:** The inputs use a background color of white (0) and one other distinct color per example (gray-5, azure-8, green-3).
3.  **Input Pattern:** In each input grid, each row contains at most one non-white pixel. These non-white pixels often form a line or pattern (diagonal lines in examples 1 and 3, broken diagonal/segments in example 2).
4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids retain the original non-white pixels. Additionally, in each row that contains a non-white pixel, the white pixels *to the right* of that non-white pixel are changed to match the color of the non-white pixel in that row.
5.  **Row Independence:** The transformation seems to be applied independently to each row. Rows containing only white pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - role: grid
    attributes:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - element_type: pixels
  - role: objects
    description: Contiguous or non-contiguous sets of non-white pixels within the grid. In these examples, they appear as single pixels per row.
    attributes:
      - color: varies (gray, azure, green)
      - location: specific row and column indices
  - role: transformation
    description: Modifies the grid based on the location of non-white pixels.
    attributes:
      - scope: row-based
      - action: color_filling
      - direction: rightward
      - condition: applies only to white pixels to the right of a non-white pixel within the same row.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The core logic relies on the relative position of pixels within each row (left-to-right).
  - type: conditional_coloring
    description: The coloring action depends on the presence and color of a non-white pixel earlier in the same row.

observations:
  - Each row in the input appears to have at most one non-white pixel.
  - The transformation preserves the original non-white pixels.
  - Rows that are entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output.
  - The color used for filling is determined by the color of the non-white pixel found in that specific row.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Initialize variables `found_non_white_pixel = false`, `non_white_color = null`, and `non_white_col_index = -1`.
    b.  Iterate through the columns of the current row from left to right (column index `c`).
    c.  If the pixel at the current `(row_index, c)` is not white (value > 0) and `found_non_white_pixel` is still `false`:
        i.  Set `found_non_white_pixel = true`.
        ii. Store the color of this pixel in `non_white_color`.
        iii. Store the column index `c` in `non_white_col_index`.
        iv. Break the inner column loop for this row (since we only care about the first non-white pixel from the left). *Correction*: Continue the inner loop but don't update the color/index. Or simply break the inner loop. Let's re-check. In ex1 row 5: `5 0 0 0 0 0` -> `5 5 5 5 5 5`. It fills from the *first* non-white pixel. So, yes, find the first one.
    d.  If `found_non_white_pixel` is `true` after checking all columns in the row:
        i.  Iterate through the columns of the *output grid's* current row, starting from the column *after* `non_white_col_index` (`c = non_white_col_index + 1`) to the end of the row.
        ii. If the pixel in the *output grid* at `(row_index, c)` is currently white (0), change its color to `non_white_color`.
4.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transformation Rule:

Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, find the first non-white pixel (value > 0) from the left. If such a pixel is found, change all white pixels (value 0) to the right of this pixel in the same row to the color of that first non-white pixel. If a row contains only white pixels, it remains unchanged.
