task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - role: grid
    attributes:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - element_type: pixels
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 6x11, 7x7)
  - role: objects
    description: Individual non-white pixels scattered within the grid. Each row contains at most one such pixel in the input.
    attributes:
      - color: varies (gray, azure, green) but consistent within a single example.
      - location: defined by row and column index.
      - property: 'first_non_white_in_row' identifies the target pixel for the transformation rule within its row.
  - role: transformation
    description: Modifies the grid by extending the color of the first non-white pixel rightwards within its row.
    attributes:
      - scope: row-based
      - action: color_filling
      - direction: rightward (from the first non-white pixel)
      - extent: fills all columns from the column *after* the first non-white pixel to the last column of the grid.
      - condition: applies only to rows containing at least one non-white pixel.
      - overwrites: fills all cells to the right, regardless of their original color.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The transformation depends on the left-to-right position of the *first* non-white pixel in each row.
  - type: color_propagation
    description: The color of the first non-white pixel in a row determines the color used for filling to its right.

observations:
  - Each input row contains zero or one non-white pixel.
  - The transformation preserves the original position and color of the *first* non-white pixel found in each row.
  - Rows that are entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output.
  - The fill operation extends to the rightmost column boundary of the grid.
  - The test results indicate a potential mismatch between this observed visual rule and the underlying test data/evaluation criteria, possibly due to issues with the flattened string representation in the prompt.
