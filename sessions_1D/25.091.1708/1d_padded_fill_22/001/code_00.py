"""
Identify pairs of identical non-white pixels within the same row and fill the 
horizontal space between them with that color.

1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2. Examine each row of the input grid individually.
3. For the current row, find the locations (column indices) of all non-white 
   pixels. Store these locations along with their colors.
4. Group these non-white pixels by their color.
5. For each color group within the row:
   a. If the group contains exactly two pixel locations (columns col1 and col2).
   b. Determine the start column (min(col1, col2)) and end column (max(col1, col2)).
   c. Identify the color (fill_color) of this pair.
   d. In the output grid, for the current row, fill the pixels from column 
      start_col + 1 up to (but not including) end_col with fill_color.
6. After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
