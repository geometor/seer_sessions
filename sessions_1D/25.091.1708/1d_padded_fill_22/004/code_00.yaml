task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between pairs of same-colored pixels within each row.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: Yes, input and output grids have identical dimensions (3x21 in examples).
  - background_color: 0 (white) is the predominant color and is not involved in pairing or filling.
  - colors_preserved: No new colors are introduced. The fill color matches the pair color.

objects:
  - type: Pixel Pair
    definition: Exactly two pixels of the same non-white color located within the same row.
    properties:
      - color: Must be non-white (value 1-9).
      - count_per_row_per_color: Must be exactly 2 for the transformation to apply for that color in that row.
      - row_constraint: Both pixels must be in the same row index.
      - separation: Must be separated by at least one pixel (otherwise, the gap to fill is empty). The separating pixels in the input are white (0).

actions:
  - name: Identify Pairs
    description: For each row, group the column indices of non-white pixels by their color. Filter these groups to keep only those containing exactly two column indices.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: List of pairs, where each pair is represented by (row_index, color, col1, col2).
  
  - name: Fill Gap
    description: For each identified pair (row_index, color, col1, col2), modify the output grid by setting the color of pixels in the specified row, at column indices strictly between col1 and col2, to the pair's color.
    inputs: output_grid (initialized as copy of input), list_of_pairs
    outputs: modified_output_grid

relationships:
  - type: Horizontal Alignment
    description: The pair identification and filling action operate strictly horizontally within each row.
  - type: Color Matching
    description: The color used to fill the gap is determined by, and identical to, the color of the identified pixel pair.

transformation_flow:
  - step: 1. Create an exact copy of the input grid; this will be the output grid.
  - step: 2. Process each row of the grid independently.
  - step: 3. For the current row, find all non-white pixels and record their color and column index.
  - step: 4. Group these recorded pixels by color.
  - step: 5. Examine each color group for the current row. If a group contains exactly two column indices (col_A, col_B):
      a. Identify the color (`fill_color`) of this pair.
      b. Determine the leftmost column index (`left_col = min(col_A, col_B)`) and the rightmost column index (`right_col = max(col_A, col_B)`).
      c. Iterate through the columns `c` from `left_col + 1` up to (but not including) `right_col`.
      d. For each column `c` in this range, set the pixel in the output grid at the current row and column `c` to `fill_color`.
  - step: 6. After iterating through all rows and all color pairs within them, return the modified output grid.

uncertainties:
  - Behavior if more than one pair of the *same* color exists in a single row (e.g., `3 0 3 0 0 3 0 3`) is not defined by the examples. The current logic assumes this doesn't happen or requires exactly two occurrences total for filling.
  - Behavior if multiple pairs of *different* colors exist in a row (e.g., `4 0 4 0 0 2 0 2`) is handled correctly by the logic (each pair is processed independently).
