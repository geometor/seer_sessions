"""
Transforms an input grid by identifying pairs of same-colored non-white pixels 
within each row and filling the horizontal space strictly between them with 
that color.

1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3. For each row, find all non-white pixels and store their column indices, 
   grouped by color.
4. For each color group within the row:
   a. If exactly two pixels of that color exist in the row, identify their 
      column indices.
   b. Determine the minimum and maximum column index of the pair.
   c. Fill the pixels in the output grid, in the same row, between the minimum 
      column index (exclusive) and the maximum column index (exclusive), with 
      the pair's color.
5. Return the modified output grid.
