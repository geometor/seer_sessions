task_description: Identify pairs of identical non-white pixels within the same row and fill the horizontal space between them with that color.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - dimensions_preserved: Yes, input and output grids have the same height and width.

objects:
  - type: pixel_pair
    properties:
      - color: non-white (value > 0)
      - same_color: The two pixels in the pair must have the identical non-white color.
      - location: Both pixels must reside in the same row.
      - separation: Separated horizontally by one or more white pixels.

actions:
  - name: find_pixel_pairs
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of identified pixel pairs (row, col1, col2, color)
    description: Iterate through each row, find all non-white pixels. Group them by color within the row. Identify groups containing exactly two pixels.

  - name: fill_horizontal_gap
    inputs:
      - grid: input_grid (or a copy)
      - row: row index of the pair
      - col1: column index of the first pixel in the pair
      - col2: column index of the second pixel in the pair
      - color: color of the pixel pair
    outputs: modified_grid
    description: For a given identified pair, change the color of the pixels in the specified row, between columns col1 (exclusive) and col2 (exclusive), to the specified color.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Pixel pairs are contained within rows.
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixel pairs are horizontally aligned within a row. The action fills the horizontal space *between* them.

transformation_flow:
  - step: 1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 2. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  - step: 3. Within each row, identify all pairs of pixels that have the same non-white color.
  - step: 4. For each identified pair (at columns col1 and col2, with color c), fill the cells in the output grid at the same row, from column min(col1, col2) + 1 to max(col1, col2) - 1, with color c.
  - step: 5. Return the final modified output grid.
