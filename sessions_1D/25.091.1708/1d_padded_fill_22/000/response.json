Different rows can have different colors (e.g., yellow in example 1, green in examples 2 and 3).\n4.  **Pair Identification:** The core operation seems to be identifying pairs of identical non-white pixels located on the same horizontal line.\n5.  **Filling Action:** A horizontal line segment is drawn connecting these identified pairs, using their color. The original pair pixels remain.\n\n**Facts YAML**\n\n"
