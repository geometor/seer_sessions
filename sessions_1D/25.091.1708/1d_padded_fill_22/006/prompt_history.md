Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain mostly white pixels (0) and pairs of non-white pixels arranged horizontally within the same row.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that the horizontal space *between* the pairs of non-white pixels in each row has been filled with the same color as the pair.
3.  **Color Consistency:** The color used for filling is always the same as the color of the paired pixels in that row. Different rows can have different colors (e.g., yellow in example 1, green in examples 2 and 3).
4.  **Pair Identification:** The core operation seems to be identifying pairs of identical non-white pixels located on the same horizontal line.
5.  **Filling Action:** A horizontal line segment is drawn connecting these identified pairs, using their color. The original pair pixels remain.

**Facts YAML**


```yaml
task_description: Identify pairs of identical non-white pixels within the same row and fill the horizontal space between them with that color.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - dimensions_preserved: Yes, input and output grids have the same height and width.

objects:
  - type: pixel_pair
    properties:
      - color: non-white (value > 0)
      - same_color: The two pixels in the pair must have the identical non-white color.
      - location: Both pixels must reside in the same row.
      - separation: Separated horizontally by one or more white pixels.

actions:
  - name: find_pixel_pairs
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of identified pixel pairs (row, col1, col2, color)
    description: Iterate through each row, find all non-white pixels. Group them by color within the row. Identify groups containing exactly two pixels.

  - name: fill_horizontal_gap
    inputs:
      - grid: input_grid (or a copy)
      - row: row index of the pair
      - col1: column index of the first pixel in the pair
      - col2: column index of the second pixel in the pair
      - color: color of the pixel pair
    outputs: modified_grid
    description: For a given identified pair, change the color of the pixels in the specified row, between columns col1 (exclusive) and col2 (exclusive), to the specified color.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Pixel pairs are contained within rows.
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixel pairs are horizontally aligned within a row. The action fills the horizontal space *between* them.

transformation_flow:
  - step: 1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 2. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  - step: 3. Within each row, identify all pairs of pixels that have the same non-white color.
  - step: 4. For each identified pair (at columns col1 and col2, with color c), fill the cells in the output grid at the same row, from column min(col1, col2) + 1 to max(col1, col2) - 1, with color c.
  - step: 5. Return the final modified output grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Examine each row of the input grid individually.
3.  For the current row, find the locations (column indices) of all non-white pixels. Store these locations along with their colors.
4.  Group these non-white pixels by their color.
5.  For each color group within the row:
    a.  If the group contains exactly two pixel locations (let's call their columns `col1` and `col2`), then proceed.
    b.  Determine the minimum column index (`start_col = min(col1, col2)`) and the maximum column index (`end_col = max(col1, col2)`).
    c.  Identify the color (`fill_color`) of this pair.
    d.  In the output grid, for the current row, change the color of all pixels from column `start_col + 1` up to (but not including) column `end_col` to `fill_color`.
6.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
