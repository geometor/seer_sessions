task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: constant (input and output have same dimensions)
  - structure: 2D grid (all examples are 3x27)
  - processing_unit: row-independent (each row is transformed separately)
objects:
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
  - type: foreground_pixel
    color: non-white (varies per example: azure/8, gray/5)
    distribution: sparse, multiple occurrences within a row
    row_constraint: assumes only one non-white color per row
relationships:
  - spatial: horizontal extent of foreground pixels within a single row
  - positional: finds the first (leftmost) and last (rightmost) column index of the foreground color within each row
actions:
  - iterate_rows: Process each row of the input grid individually.
  - identify_row_foreground_color: For the current row, find the single non-white color present. If none, skip to the next row.
  - find_row_boundaries: Locate the minimum and maximum column index containing the foreground color in the current row.
  - fill_row_segment: In the output grid's corresponding row, change the color of all pixels between the minimum and maximum column indices (inclusive) to the identified foreground color.
  - preserve_background_rows: Rows containing only background pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.
  - preserve_outer_background_pixels: Pixels outside the identified [min_col, max_col] range within a row retain their original background color.
