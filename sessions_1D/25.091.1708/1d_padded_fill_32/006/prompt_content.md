```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms the input grid by processing each row independently. 
For each row:
1. Identifies the non-background color (any color other than white/0).
2. Finds the leftmost (minimum column index) and rightmost (maximum column index) occurrences of this non-background color within that row.
3. If a non-background color exists in the row, it fills the segment between the leftmost and rightmost occurrences (inclusive) in the output grid's corresponding row with that non-background color.
4. Rows containing only the background color (white/0) remain unchanged.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
