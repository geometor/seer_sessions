*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids are single rows of pixels.
    *   Each input grid contains a background color (white, 0) and multiple instances of a single non-white foreground color (e.g., azure/8 in train\_1 and train\_3, gray/5 in train\_2).
    *   The output grid is generated by identifying the first and last occurrences of the foreground color in the input row.
    *   All pixels between the first and last foreground pixel (inclusive) in the output row are set to that foreground color.
    *   Pixels outside this range (before the first foreground pixel and after the last foreground pixel) remain the background color (white).
    *   The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    grid_properties:
      - single_row: true
      - constant_dimensions: true # Output dimensions match input dimensions
    objects:
      - type: background_pixel
        color: white (0)
      - type: foreground_pixel
        color: non-white (varies per example, e.g., azure/8, gray/5)
        distribution: sparse, multiple occurrences
    relationships:
      - spatial: identifies the horizontal extent of foreground pixels
      - positional: finds the first and last occurrence of the foreground color
    actions:
      - identify_foreground_color: Find the single non-white color present in the input row.
      - find_boundaries: Locate the minimum and maximum column index containing the foreground color.
      - fill_range: Change the color of all pixels between the minimum and maximum indices (inclusive) to the foreground color in the output row.
      - preserve_background: Pixels outside the identified range retain the background color (white).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid (in this case, there is only one row).
    3.  Identify the non-white foreground color present in the current row. If no non-white color exists, the output row remains unchanged (all white).
    4.  Find the column index of the leftmost occurrence (first instance) of this foreground color in the row.
    5.  Find the column index of the rightmost occurrence (last instance) of this foreground color in the row.
    6.  For the corresponding row in the output grid, change the color of all pixels from the leftmost index to the rightmost index (inclusive) to the identified foreground color.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous attempt incorrectly interpreted the input string as a single, long row. The provided results clearly show that the transformation should operate on a multi-row grid structure, applying the fill logic independently to each row. The code's failure stemmed from applying the fill logic across the entire flattened array instead of row by row after reshaping the input into its correct 2D structure. The core logic of finding the first and last non-background pixel *within each row* and filling between them seems correct based on comparing the parsed input and expected output, but it needs to be applied after correctly reshaping the input.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Let's parse the inputs/outputs correctly and gather metrics. Assuming a 3x27 grid shape based on the length (81) and visual structure of the outputs.

*   **Revised Assessment:**
    The initial data provided in the prompt seems malformed or was pasted incorrectly. The string lengths for examples 1 and 2 (when interpreted as space-separated integers) are 82 and 83 respectively, which cannot be reshaped into a 3x27 grid (which requires 81 elements). Example 3 has 81 elements and parses correctly.

    Assuming the *intended* structure is a multi-row grid (likely 3x27 for Example 3, and potentially similar for others if the data was correct) and the transformation logic observed in Example 3 holds:
    1.  The input is misinterpreted if treated as a single row. It must be reshaped into its 2D grid form.
    2.  The transformation acts *independently* on each row.
    3.  For each row, identify the non-background color (e.g., azure/8, gray/5).
    4.  Find the leftmost (minimum column index) and rightmost (maximum column index) occurrences of this color *within that specific row*.
    5.  Fill all cells in the output row between these minimum and maximum column indices (inclusive) with the identified non-background color.
    6.  Cells outside this range, and rows containing only the background color, remain unchanged (background color).

*   **Facts (Based on Example 3 and assuming similar structure for others):**
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    grid_properties:
      - multi_row: true # Assumed based on structure & length=81 for Ex3
      - constant_dimensions: true # Output dimensions match input dimensions
      - potential_shape: [3, 27] # Based on Ex3 data parsing
    objects:
      - type: background_pixel
        color: white (0)
      - type: foreground_pixel
        color: non-white (varies per example, e.g., azure/8, gray/5)
        distribution: sparse, multiple occurrences per row/grid
        constraint: appears to be only one non-white color per grid example
    relationships:
      - spatial: identifies the horizontal extent of foreground pixels within each row
      - positional: finds the first (min column) and last (max column) occurrence of the foreground color *per row*
    actions:
      - parse_input: Reshape the flat input into a 2D grid (e.g., 3x27).
      - iterate_rows: Process each row of the grid independently.
      - identify_row_foreground_color: Find the single non-white color present in the current row. (Handles rows with no foreground color).
      - find_row_boundaries: Locate the minimum and maximum column index containing the foreground color *in that row*.
      - fill_row_range: In the output grid's corresponding row, change the color of all pixels between the minimum and maximum indices (inclusive) to the identified foreground color.
      - preserve_background: Pixels outside the identified range in each row, and entire rows initially containing only background, retain the background color (white).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input data into a 2D grid (determine the correct dimensions, e.g., 3x27 based on Example 3).
    2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initially identical to the input grid.
    3.  For each row in the input grid:
        a.  Find all column indices where the pixel color is not the background color (white, 0).
        b.  If any non-background pixels exist in the row:
            i.  Determine the color of these foreground pixels (based on the examples, there seems to be only one foreground color per row/grid).
            ii. Determine the minimum column index (`min_col`) among these foreground pixels.
            iii. Determine the maximum column index (`max_col`) among these foreground pixels.
            iv. In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, set the color of all pixels from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to the identified foreground color.
        c.  If no non-background pixels exist in the row, the corresponding row in the output grid remains unchanged (all background).
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
