The discrepancies between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` in the test results likely stem from an issue in how the flattened input string was parsed into a 2D grid *before* being passed to the `transform` function during testing, rather than a flaw in the `transform` function's logic itself. The transformed output suggests the code might have operated on a flattened or incorrectly shaped array.\n    *   Assuming the `transform` function will receive correctly shaped 2D list/array inputs, its current logic appears sound.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    *   Refine the understanding and documentation (YAML facts, natural language program) to explicitly state that the input is a multi-row grid and the transformation applies row by row.\n    *   Gather metrics based on the correctly parsed 2D structure of the examples.\n    *   Maintain the core logic of the Python function, as it aligns with the row-by-row transformation observed in the examples when parsed correctly.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    "
