*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids are single rows of pixels.
    *   Each input grid contains a background color (white, 0) and multiple instances of a single non-white foreground color (e.g., azure/8 in train\_1 and train\_3, gray/5 in train\_2).
    *   The output grid is generated by identifying the first and last occurrences of the foreground color in the input row.
    *   All pixels between the first and last foreground pixel (inclusive) in the output row are set to that foreground color.
    *   Pixels outside this range (before the first foreground pixel and after the last foreground pixel) remain the background color (white).
    *   The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    grid_properties:
      - single_row: true
      - constant_dimensions: true # Output dimensions match input dimensions
    objects:
      - type: background_pixel
        color: white (0)
      - type: foreground_pixel
        color: non-white (varies per example, e.g., azure/8, gray/5)
        distribution: sparse, multiple occurrences
    relationships:
      - spatial: identifies the horizontal extent of foreground pixels
      - positional: finds the first and last occurrence of the foreground color
    actions:
      - identify_foreground_color: Find the single non-white color present in the input row.
      - find_boundaries: Locate the minimum and maximum column index containing the foreground color.
      - fill_range: Change the color of all pixels between the minimum and maximum indices (inclusive) to the foreground color in the output row.
      - preserve_background: Pixels outside the identified range retain the background color (white).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid (in this case, there is only one row).
    3.  Identify the non-white foreground color present in the current row. If no non-white color exists, the output row remains unchanged (all white).
    4.  Find the column index of the leftmost occurrence (first instance) of this foreground color in the row.
    5.  Find the column index of the rightmost occurrence (last instance) of this foreground color in the row.
    6.  For the corresponding row in the output grid, change the color of all pixels from the leftmost index to the rightmost index (inclusive) to the identified foreground color.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
For each row in the input grid:
1. Identify the single non-white foreground color present in the row.
2. Find the column index of the leftmost occurrence (first instance) of this foreground color.
3. Find the column index of the rightmost occurrence (last instance) of this foreground color.
4. If a foreground color exists in the row, change the color of all pixels in the output grid's corresponding row, from the leftmost index to the rightmost index (inclusive), to the identified foreground color.
5. If no foreground color exists (the row is all white), the output row remains unchanged (all white).
Pixels outside the identified range (before the first foreground pixel and after the last foreground pixel) retain their original color (white background).
The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
