*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: filling the horizontal span between the first and last non-background pixels.
    *   However, it incorrectly assumed the input was always a single row based on the first example's *flattened representation*.
    *   The test results clearly show that the inputs are multi-row grids, and the transformation must be applied independently to each row.
    *   The provided Python code *does* implement row-by-row processing. The discrepancies between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` in the test results likely stem from an issue in how the flattened input string was parsed into a 2D grid *before* being passed to the `transform` function during testing, rather than a flaw in the `transform` function's logic itself. The transformed output suggests the code might have operated on a flattened or incorrectly shaped array.
    *   Assuming the `transform` function will receive correctly shaped 2D list/array inputs, its current logic appears sound.

*   **Strategy:**
    *   Refine the understanding and documentation (YAML facts, natural language program) to explicitly state that the input is a multi-row grid and the transformation applies row by row.
    *   Gather metrics based on the correctly parsed 2D structure of the examples.
    *   Maintain the core logic of the Python function, as it aligns with the row-by-row transformation observed in the examples when parsed correctly.

*   **Metrics:**
