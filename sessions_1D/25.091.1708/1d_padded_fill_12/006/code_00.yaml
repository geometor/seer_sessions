Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same for input and output.
    - BackgroundColor: White (0).
GlobalProperties:
  - Name: NonWhiteColor
    Value: The single color value (> 0) present in the input grid.
  - Name: MinNonWhiteColumn
    Value: The minimum column index among all non-white pixels in the entire input grid.
  - Name: MaxNonWhiteColumn
    Value: The maximum column index among all non-white pixels in the entire input grid.
Objects:
  - Type: NonWhitePixel
    Properties:
      - Color: The grid's NonWhiteColor.
      - Location: Specific row and column index in the input.
    Identification: Any pixel with color > 0 in the input.
  - Type: HorizontalFillSegment
    Properties:
      - Color: The grid's NonWhiteColor.
      - Location: Spans horizontally within a single row in the output grid.
      - StartColumn: Global MinNonWhiteColumn.
      - EndColumn: Global MaxNonWhiteColumn.
Relationship:
  - A HorizontalFillSegment is created in the output grid for a specific row *if and only if* that row contained at least one NonWhitePixel in the input grid.
Action:
  - Name: FillGlobalHorizontalSpanForRow
  - Input: The entire input grid.
  - Output: The entire output grid.
  - Process:
      1. Determine the NonWhiteColor from the input grid.
      2. Find the MinNonWhiteColumn and MaxNonWhiteColumn across all non-white pixels in the input grid.
      3. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
      4. Iterate through each row of the input grid (index `r`).
      5. Check if row `r` contains any pixel with the NonWhiteColor.
      6. If it does, modify the corresponding row `r` in the output grid by setting all pixels from MinNonWhiteColumn to MaxNonWhiteColumn (inclusive) to the NonWhiteColor.
      7. If row `r` does not contain any NonWhiteColor pixel, the corresponding row in the output grid remains unchanged (as copied from the input).
