Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same for input and output in each example pair.
    - BackgroundColor: White (0).
Objects:
  - Type: NonWhitePixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Varies (1, 7, 5 in examples), but consistent within a single input grid.
      - Location: Specific row and column indices.
    Identification: Any pixel with color > 0.
  - Type: HorizontalSegment
    Properties:
      - Color: Same as the NonWhitePixels in its row.
      - Location: Spans horizontally within a single row in the output grid.
Relationship:
  - NonWhitePixels define the bounds (start and end column) of the HorizontalSegment within a row.
Action:
  - Name: FillHorizontalSpan
  - Input: A row from the input grid.
  - Output: A potentially modified row for the output grid.
  - Condition: The row must contain at least two NonWhitePixels.
  - Process:
      1. Identify all NonWhitePixels in the row.
      2. Determine their color (assumed unique non-white color per row/grid).
      3. Find the minimum column index (leftmost_col) of these pixels.
      4. Find the maximum column index (rightmost_col) of these pixels.
      5. Fill all pixels from leftmost_col to rightmost_col (inclusive) with the identified color.
  - NoActionCondition: If a row contains zero or one NonWhitePixel, it is copied directly to the output without modification.
