**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core concept: filling a horizontal span between non-white pixels in rows containing at least two such pixels. However, the implementation in the provided `code_00.py` incorrectly filled the *entire* row instead of just the segment between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels. The "Pixels Off" count and the visual comparison between expected and transformed outputs clearly show this error across all examples. The strategy is to correct the description of the filling action and ensure the implementation targets only the specific columns between the identified boundaries.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the key parameters for each training example.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same for input and output in each example pair. Variable across examples.
    - BackgroundColor: White (0).
Objects:
  - Type: NonWhitePixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Varies (1=Blue, 7=Orange, 5=Gray in examples), but consistent within a single input grid's relevant rows.
      - Location: Specific row and column indices. Can be multiple per row.
    Identification: Any pixel with color > 0.
  - Type: HorizontalSegment
    Properties:
      - Color: Same as the NonWhitePixels in its row.
      - Location: Spans horizontally between the leftmost and rightmost NonWhitePixels (inclusive) within a single row in the output grid. Only exists in rows that had >= 2 NonWhitePixels in the input.
Relationship:
  - Two or more NonWhitePixels in an input row define the bounds (start and end column) and the fill color of the HorizontalSegment in the corresponding output row.
Action:
  - Name: FillHorizontalSpanBetweenEndpoints
  - Input: A row from the input grid.
  - Output: A potentially modified row for the output grid.
  - Condition: The input row must contain at least two NonWhitePixels (color > 0).
  - Process:
      1. Identify all NonWhitePixels in the input row and their column indices.
      2. Determine their color (take the color of the first NonWhitePixel found).
      3. Find the minimum column index (`leftmost_col`) among these pixels.
      4. Find the maximum column index (`rightmost_col`) among these pixels.
      5. Create the output row by copying the input row.
      6. Modify the copied row: Fill all pixels from column `leftmost_col` to `rightmost_col` (inclusive) with the identified color.
  - NoActionCondition: If an input row contains zero or one NonWhitePixel, it is copied directly to the corresponding output row without modification.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying the input grid's contents.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid using its row index (`r`).
3.  For each row `r`:
    a.  Find all pixels with a color value greater than 0 (non-white pixels). Record their column indices.
    b.  Count the number of non-white pixels found in this row.
    c.  If the count is less than 2 (i.e., 0 or 1), proceed to the next row (the output row remains unchanged from the initial copy).
    d.  If the count is 2 or more:
        i.  Determine the color to use for filling. This color is the color of any of the non-white pixels found in this row (e.g., the color of the first one found).
        ii. Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) among the recorded non-white pixel indices for this row.
        iii. Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) among the recorded non-white pixel indices for this row.
        iv. In the output grid's row `r`, change the color of all pixels from column `min_col` to column `max_col` (inclusive) to the fill color determined in step 3(d)i.
4.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.
