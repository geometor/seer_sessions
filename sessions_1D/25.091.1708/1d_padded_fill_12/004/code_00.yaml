Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same for input and output in each example pair. Variable across examples.
    - BackgroundColor: White (0).
Objects:
  - Type: NonWhitePixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Varies (1=Blue, 7=Orange, 5=Gray in examples), but consistent within a single input grid's relevant rows.
      - Location: Specific row and column indices. Can be multiple per row.
    Identification: Any pixel with color > 0.
  - Type: HorizontalSegment
    Properties:
      - Color: Same as the NonWhitePixels in its row.
      - Location: Spans horizontally between the leftmost and rightmost NonWhitePixels (inclusive) within a single row in the output grid. Only exists in rows that had >= 2 NonWhitePixels in the input.
Relationship:
  - Two or more NonWhitePixels in an input row define the bounds (start and end column) and the fill color of the HorizontalSegment in the corresponding output row.
Action:
  - Name: FillHorizontalSpanBetweenEndpoints
  - Input: A row from the input grid.
  - Output: A potentially modified row for the output grid.
  - Condition: The input row must contain at least two NonWhitePixels (color > 0).
  - Process:
      1. Identify all NonWhitePixels in the input row and their column indices.
      2. Determine their color (take the color of the first NonWhitePixel found).
      3. Find the minimum column index (`leftmost_col`) among these pixels.
      4. Find the maximum column index (`rightmost_col`) among these pixels.
      5. Create the output row by copying the input row.
      6. Modify the copied row: Fill all pixels from column `leftmost_col` to `rightmost_col` (inclusive) with the identified color.
  - NoActionCondition: If an input row contains zero or one NonWhitePixel, it is copied directly to the corresponding output row without modification.
