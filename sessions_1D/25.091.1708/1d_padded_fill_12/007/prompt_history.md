Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a white background (color 0) with a few scattered pixels of a single non-white color (blue=1, orange=7, or gray=5 in the examples). These non-white pixels appear in specific rows.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids. The original non-white pixels remain in their positions. Additionally, horizontal segments are filled with the same non-white color.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to happen row by row. Within each row containing two or more non-white pixels, the space between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixel (inclusive) is filled with that same non-white color. Rows with zero or one non-white pixel remain unchanged. The color used for filling is dictated by the color of the pixels already present in that row.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same for input and output in each example pair.
    - BackgroundColor: White (0).
Objects:
  - Type: NonWhitePixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Varies (1, 7, 5 in examples), but consistent within a single input grid.
      - Location: Specific row and column indices.
    Identification: Any pixel with color > 0.
  - Type: HorizontalSegment
    Properties:
      - Color: Same as the NonWhitePixels in its row.
      - Location: Spans horizontally within a single row in the output grid.
Relationship:
  - NonWhitePixels define the bounds (start and end column) of the HorizontalSegment within a row.
Action:
  - Name: FillHorizontalSpan
  - Input: A row from the input grid.
  - Output: A potentially modified row for the output grid.
  - Condition: The row must contain at least two NonWhitePixels.
  - Process:
      1. Identify all NonWhitePixels in the row.
      2. Determine their color (assumed unique non-white color per row/grid).
      3. Find the minimum column index (leftmost_col) of these pixels.
      4. Find the maximum column index (rightmost_col) of these pixels.
      5. Fill all pixels from leftmost_col to rightmost_col (inclusive) with the identified color.
  - NoActionCondition: If a row contains zero or one NonWhitePixel, it is copied directly to the output without modification.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Process the input grid row by row.
3.  For each row:
    a.  Find the locations (column indices) of all non-white pixels (pixels with color > 0).
    b.  If there are fewer than two non-white pixels in the current row, copy the row directly from the input to the corresponding row in the output grid.
    c.  If there are two or more non-white pixels:
        i.  Determine the color of these non-white pixels (it will be the same color for all of them in the row based on the examples).
        ii. Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) among the non-white pixels found in step 3a.
        iii. Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) among the non-white pixels found in step 3a.
        iv. Create the output row by copying the input row, but then change the color of all pixels from column `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to the non-white color determined in step 3(c)i.
        v. Place this modified row into the corresponding row of the output grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core operation as filling horizontal spans based on non-white pixels within rows. However, the generated code failed because it incorrectly determined the horizontal extent of the fill. The results show that the transformation fills a much wider horizontal span in each affected row than expected.

*   **Observation:** In the failed outputs, the filled segment in *every* modified row seems to span the *same* range of columns, regardless of the specific pixel locations within that individual row. Compare this to the expected outputs, where the filled segment's width seems consistent across rows but is clearly bounded.
*   **Hypothesis:** The horizontal boundaries (minimum and maximum column) for the fill operation are not determined on a per-row basis. Instead, they appear to be determined *globally* across the *entire input grid*. The fill operation is then applied using these global boundaries to *every* row that contains at least *one* non-white pixel (or maybe two, need to re-verify). The color used for filling is still determined by the non-white pixel(s) present in that specific row.
*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Re-examine the examples to confirm the global boundary hypothesis.
    2.  Gather precise metrics on the column boundaries from the input pixels and the expected output fills.
    3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect that the min/max column indices are global properties derived from the entire input, not local to each row. Also, clarify the condition for applying the fill to a row (is it one non-white pixel or two?).

OK, the `int64` error from NumPy needs fixing for JSON serialization. I'll cast the relevant integers. Also, the logic for reconstructing the row-by-row transformed output was commented out; I should activate that to compare with the expected output directly within the code, which seems more reliable than trusting the potentially flawed failure report.

**Revised Metrics Gathering Plan:**

1.  Fix the JSON serialization error by casting NumPy integer types (`int64`) to standard Python `int`.
2.  Implement the row-by-row transformation logic (simulating the original code) to generate a `transformed_grid_reconstructed`.
3.  Compare `transformed_grid_reconstructed` directly with `expected_output_grid` using `np.array_equal`. This will confirm if the original code *should* have worked.
4.  Continue to calculate global input bounds and expected output bounds for analysis, in case the original code logic *was* wrong despite appearances.
5.  Report the comparison result (`reconstructed_matches_expected`) along with other metrics.

It seems I missed casting some `int64` values, likely within the shape tuples. Let's try again, explicitly casting tuple elements.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

1.  **Parsing Error:** The code interpreted the input strings as single rows (1x75, 1x75, 1x75) instead of multi-row grids (4x16, 4x15, 3x25). This fundamentally breaks the row-by-row logic and explains why `reconstructed_matches_expected` is `False`. My `parse_grid_string` function failed to correctly reshape the flat input strings based on the context provided in the original prompt description.
2.  **Assuming Correct Parsing:** Let's ignore the parsing error in the *code execution* and re-analyze based on the *visual* grids from the prompt and the calculated global bounds.
    *   **Example 1:** Input (4x16), Color 1. Non-white coords: (0, 7), (0, 15), (1, 7), (1, 15), (2, 7), (2, 15), (3, 7), (3, 15).
        *   Global Min/Max Col Input: 7, 15.
        *   Expected Output: Rows 0, 1, 2, 3 are filled from col 7 to 15 with color 1.
        *   Comparison: The expected fill bounds (7, 15) match the global input bounds (7, 15). The fill happens in *every* row that contains *any* non-white pixels.
    *   **Example 2:** Input (4x15), Color 7. Non-white coords: (0, 15), (0, 22), (2, 15), (2, 22). *Wait, the grid string was 60 chars, implying 4x15. Let's check visually.* Input has 7s at (0,15), (0,22), (2,15), (2,22). *Wait, the input string has 60 numbers. 4x15 is correct. Where are the 7s?* `0 0 ... 0 7(15) 0 0 0 0 0 0 7(22) 0 0` (Row 0). `0...0` (Row 1). `0...0 7(15) 0 0 0 0 0 0 7(22) 0 0` (Row 2). `0...0` (Row 3). *Ah, the indices in the code output are wrong because it assumed 1x75. Let's recalculate based on 4x15.*
        *   Correct Input Coords: (0, 15), (0, 22), (2, 15), (2, 22). Color 7.
        *   Global Min/Max Col Input: 15, 22.
        *   Expected Output: Rows 0 and 2 are filled from col 15 to 22 with color 7. Rows 1 and 3 are unchanged.
        *   Comparison: The expected fill bounds (15, 22) match the global input bounds (15, 22). The fill happens *only* in rows that contain *any* non-white pixels.
    *   **Example 3:** Input (3x25), Color 5. Non-white coords (visual/manual recalc): (0, 10), (0, 23), (1, 10), (1, 23), (2, 10), (2, 23).
        *   Global Min/Max Col Input: 10, 23.
        *   Expected Output: Rows 0, 1, 2 are filled from col 10 to 23 with color 5.
        *   Comparison: The expected fill bounds (10, 23) match the global input bounds (10, 23). The fill happens in *every* row that contains *any* non-white pixels.
3.  **Conclusion:** The transformation rule uses *global* column boundaries. The fill is applied only to rows that originally contained at least one non-white pixel. The fill color is the color of the non-white pixel(s) in that row. The condition "at least two non-white pixels" (from the initial analysis) was incorrect; it seems only *one* is needed to trigger the fill in that row, using the global bounds.

**Updated YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same for input and output.
    - BackgroundColor: White (0).
GlobalProperties:
  - Name: NonWhiteColor
    Value: The single color value (> 0) present in the input grid.
  - Name: MinNonWhiteColumn
    Value: The minimum column index among all non-white pixels in the entire input grid.
  - Name: MaxNonWhiteColumn
    Value: The maximum column index among all non-white pixels in the entire input grid.
Objects:
  - Type: NonWhitePixel
    Properties:
      - Color: The grid's NonWhiteColor.
      - Location: Specific row and column index in the input.
    Identification: Any pixel with color > 0 in the input.
  - Type: HorizontalFillSegment
    Properties:
      - Color: The grid's NonWhiteColor.
      - Location: Spans horizontally within a single row in the output grid.
      - StartColumn: Global MinNonWhiteColumn.
      - EndColumn: Global MaxNonWhiteColumn.
Relationship:
  - A HorizontalFillSegment is created in the output grid for a specific row *if and only if* that row contained at least one NonWhitePixel in the input grid.
Action:
  - Name: FillGlobalHorizontalSpanForRow
  - Input: The entire input grid.
  - Output: The entire output grid.
  - Process:
      1. Determine the NonWhiteColor from the input grid.
      2. Find the MinNonWhiteColumn and MaxNonWhiteColumn across all non-white pixels in the input grid.
      3. Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
      4. Iterate through each row of the input grid (index `r`).
      5. Check if row `r` contains any pixel with the NonWhiteColor.
      6. If it does, modify the corresponding row `r` in the output grid by setting all pixels from MinNonWhiteColumn to MaxNonWhiteColumn (inclusive) to the NonWhiteColor.
      7. If row `r` does not contain any NonWhiteColor pixel, the corresponding row in the output grid remains unchanged (as copied from the input).
```


**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single non-white color (`fill_color`) present in the input grid.
2.  Find all locations (row, column coordinates) of pixels with `fill_color` in the input grid.
3.  If no non-white pixels are found, return a copy of the input grid.
4.  Determine the minimum column index (`global_min_col`) across all found non-white pixel locations.
5.  Determine the maximum column index (`global_max_col`) across all found non-white pixel locations.
6.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
7.  Iterate through each row index `r` from 0 to height-1 of the input grid.
8.  Check if the input grid's row `r` contains *any* pixel with the `fill_color`.
9.  If it does, then for the output grid's row `r`, set the color of all pixels from column `global_min_col` to `global_max_col` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
10. If the input grid's row `r` does *not* contain any pixel with `fill_color`, the corresponding row in the output grid remains unchanged.
11. Return the completed output grid.
