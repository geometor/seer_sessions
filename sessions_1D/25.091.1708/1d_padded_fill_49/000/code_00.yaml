task_type: fill_between_pairs
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 30] # All examples are 1x30
  output: [1, 30] # Output dimensions match input
color_palette:
  - background: 0 # white
  - foreground: variable (5, 3, 7 in examples)
objects:
  - type: pixel_pair
    properties:
      - color: non-white (constant within a pair)
      - locations: two distinct column indices in the same row
    identification: For a given non-white color C in a row, find all pixels of color C. Sort their column indices. If the count is even, group them sequentially into pairs (1st & 2nd, 3rd & 4th, etc.).
actions:
  - type: horizontal_fill
    parameters:
      - color: color of the pixel_pair
      - start_column: index of the first pixel in the pair
      - end_column: index of the second pixel in the pair
    effect: Modifies the output grid by setting all pixels in the row between start_column and end_column (inclusive) to the specified color.
relationship:
  - Pixel pairs are defined by having the same non-white color within the same row and being paired based on their sequential order after sorting by column index.
  - The fill action connects the two pixels of a pair horizontally.
rules:
  - The transformation operates row by row.
  - Only applies to non-white colors where an even number of pixels exist in a row.
  - Background pixels (white) are only changed if they fall within the fill span of a pixel pair.
