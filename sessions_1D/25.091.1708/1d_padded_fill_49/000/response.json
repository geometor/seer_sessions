            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples consist of a single row (1x30 grid).\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses white (0) as the background and one other distinct color for foreground elements: gray (5) in example 1, green (3) in example 2, and orange (7) in example 3.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** In each input row, there are exactly six pixels of the non-white color. These pixels appear to be grouped into three pairs. For instance, in example 1, the gray pixels are at indices (1, 4), (11, 14), and (21, 24).\n4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output, the space *between* the indices of each pair identified in the input is filled with the same non-white color. The original non-white pixels are also retained. Essentially, a horizontal line segment is drawn connecting each pair of same-colored pixels.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies pairs of pixels of the same non-white color within the row and fills the horizontal span between them (inclusive) with that color. This happens independently for each pair. The pairing seems to be based on the sequence of appearance; the 1st and 2nd occurrences form a pair, the 3rd and 4th form a pair, and so on.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
