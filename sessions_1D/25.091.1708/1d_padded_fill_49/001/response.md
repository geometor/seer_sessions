```python
"""
Processes a 1D grid (represented as a 1xN 2D array) row by row.
For each row:
  Identifies unique non-white colors present.
  For each unique non-white color C:
    Finds all column indices where color C appears.
    Sorts these indices.
    If the number of occurrences is even and greater than zero:
      Pairs the indices sequentially (1st with 2nd, 3rd with 4th, etc.).
      For each pair (start_col, end_col):
        Fills the segment of the row in the output grid from start_col to end_col (inclusive) with color C.
The background color (white, 0) is overwritten if it falls within a fill segment.
Returns the modified grid.
