However, the code failed, likely due to incorrect handling of the input format (assuming list vs. NumPy array) leading to the `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. Furthermore, the initial logic for selecting which marker pairs contribute to the output and the precise rules for filling the output sequence needed refinement.\n\nThe error likely occurred in the input type checking/flattening logic. The strategy is to:\n1.  Assume the input can be a list, list of lists, or NumPy array and robustly flatten it into a 1D sequence.\n2.  Re-analyze the relationship between marker pairs (and their distances) and the resulting output segments across all examples.\n3.  Identify the correct criteria for selecting pairs and the precise fill rules for the first vs. subsequent selected pairs.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's gather metrics for each example to confirm the pattern. We'll treat the input as a 1D sequence.\n"
