            "text": "*   **Perception:** The input is presented as a flat list of numbers representing pixel colors, but the transformation logic appears to treat it as a 1D sequence rather than a 2D grid. The input sequence contains multiple instances of a single non-white color (the \"marker\" color, which is magenta `6` in the example) separated by white (`0`) pixels. The output is also a 1D sequence, one element shorter than the input. The output consists of blocks of the marker color, replacing sequences of white pixels from the input. The placement and extent of these blocks depend on the positions of the marker pixels in the input and the distances between them. Specifically, blocks are created between pairs of marker pixels that are separated by a \"large\" distance (13 in the example), while pairs separated by a \"small\" distance (9 in the example) are ignored. The way segments are filled seems slightly different for the first pair compared to subsequent pairs.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
