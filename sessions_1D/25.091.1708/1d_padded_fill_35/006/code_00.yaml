Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: white (0)
  - Foreground_Colors: [orange (7), blue (1)] # Variable, determined by input
  - Transformation_Scope: Row-wise independent processing
  - Dimensions: Input and Output grids have identical height (H) and width (W). Examples shown use H=3, W=30.

Objects:
  - Marker_Pixel:
      - Definition: The first non-white pixel encountered when scanning an input row from left (column 0) to right (column W-1).
      - Properties:
          - Color (C)
          - Column_Index (I)
      - Existence: A row may or may not contain a Marker_Pixel.
  - Input_Row:
      - Property: Row_Index (R), ranging from 0 to H-1.
      - Property: Parity (Even or Odd, based on Row_Index R).
  - Output_Row:
      - Corresponds one-to-one with an Input_Row based on Row_Index.
      - Initial_State: All white (0).
      - Final_State: Determined by Marker_Pixel and Input_Row Parity.

Actions/Rules:
  - Find_Marker: For each input row R, find its Marker_Pixel (C, I).
  - Determine_Parity: Check if row index R is even (R % 2 == 0) or odd (R % 2 != 0).
  - Apply_Fill_Rule:
      - If no Marker_Pixel exists for row R: The corresponding output row remains all white.
      - If Marker_Pixel (C, I) exists for row R:
          - If R is Even: Fill the output row with color C from column I to column W-1 (inclusive).
          - If R is Odd: Fill the output row with color C from column 0 to column I (inclusive).
