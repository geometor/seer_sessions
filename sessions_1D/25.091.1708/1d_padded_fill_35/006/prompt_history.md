Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both are grids represented as flattened strings of integers (colors). The primary colors involved are white (0), orange (7), and blue (1).
2.  **Structure:** The transformation appears to operate independently on each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding row in the output grid.
3.  **Key Feature:** The presence and position of the *first* non-white pixel in each input row seem crucial.
4.  **Transformation:** The non-white pixel in the input row determines the color and extent of filling in the corresponding output row. White pixels (0) act as a background.
5.  **Special Case:** There seems to be a special condition related to whether the first non-white pixel appears in the very last column of the grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: white (0)
  - Foreground_Colors: [orange (7), blue (1)] # Based on examples
  - Transformation_Scope: Row-wise independent processing

Objects:
  - Marker_Pixel:
      - Definition: The first non-white pixel encountered when scanning a row from left to right.
      - Properties:
          - Color (C)
          - Column_Index (I)
          - Is_In_Last_Column (Boolean)

Actions:
  - Identify_Marker: For each row, find the Marker_Pixel (if any).
  - Fill_Row: Modify the corresponding output row based on the Marker_Pixel's properties.

Relationships/Rules:
  - Rule 1: If an input row contains no Marker_Pixel (is all white), the output row remains all white.
  - Rule 2: If a Marker_Pixel with color C and index I is found, and it is *not* in the last column, the output row is filled with white up to column I-1, and with color C from column I to the end of the row.
  - Rule 3: If a Marker_Pixel with color C and index I is found, and it *is* in the last column, the *entire* output row is filled with color C.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid. The last column index will be W-1.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions (H x W), initially filled with the background color (white/0).
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from row index 0 to H-1.
4.  For the current input row:
    a.  Initialize `marker_found` to false, `marker_color` to null, and `marker_index` to -1.
    b.  Iterate through the columns of the current input row, from column index 0 to W-1.
    c.  If the current pixel is not white (value > 0) and `marker_found` is false:
        i.  Set `marker_found` to true.
        ii. Store the pixel's color as `marker_color`.
        iii. Store the current column index as `marker_index`.
        iv. Stop searching this row (break the inner loop).
5.  If `marker_found` is true for the current row:
    a.  Check if `marker_index` is equal to the last column index (W-1).
    b.  If `marker_index` equals W-1 (it's in the last column):
        i.  Fill the *entire* corresponding output row with `marker_color`.
    c.  Else (if `marker_index` is *not* W-1):
        i.  Fill the corresponding output row from column `marker_index` to W-1 (inclusive) with `marker_color`. (Pixels before `marker_index` remain white as initialized).
6.  If `marker_found` is false (the input row was all white), the corresponding output row remains all white (no action needed as it was initialized to white).
7.  After processing all rows, the output grid is complete. Convert it back to the required flattened string format if necessary.
