**General Assessment:**

The previous execution results indicated failure across all training examples. However, analysis reveals that the reported "Transformed Output" likely corresponds to an earlier version of the code, *before* the row-parity logic was introduced. The most recent code provided (implementing row-parity logic) appears consistent with the *expected* outputs for all three training examples when traced manually.

The core idea is that the transformation depends on locating the first non-background pixel in each row and then filling a portion of the corresponding output row based on the *parity* (even or odd index) of the row.

**Strategy:**

1.  Confirm the grid dimensions and marker pixel locations for each example using code execution.
2.  Assuming the manual trace is correct and the row-parity code is the intended solution, refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on this understanding. The existing Natural Language Program associated with the row-parity code seems accurate.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's confirm the dimensions and marker locations.

**Revised Metrics Analysis:**

The code execution reveals the grid dimensions are consistently 3x30 for these examples, not the shapes assumed in the manual trace (like 6x16, 6x22, 6x28). This significantly changes the marker locations relative to row structure. Let's re-evaluate with the correct dimensions (3x30).

**Example 1 (3x30):**
Input String: `7 0 ... 0 | 7 0 ... 0 | 7 0 ... 0` (Separators added for clarity at indices 30, 60)
Input R0: Marker(7) at C0.
Input R1: Marker(7) at C0.
Input R2: Marker(7) at C0.

Expected Output (3x30):
Row 0: `7 7 ... 7`
Row 1: `7 0 ... 0`
Row 2: `7 7 ... 7`

Row-Parity Code Trace (3x30):
Input R0 (Even): Marker(7) at C0. Code: Fill C0 to end. -> `[7, 7, ... 7]`. Expected: `[7, 7, ... 7]`. Match.
Input R1 (Odd): Marker(7) at C0. Code: Fill C0 to C0. -> `[7, 0, ... 0]`. Expected: `[7, 0, ... 0]`. Match.
Input R2 (Even): Marker(7) at C0. Code: Fill C0 to end. -> `[7, 7, ... 7]`. Expected: `[7, 7, ... 7]`. Match.
*Still Matches.*

**Example 2 (3x30):**
Input String: `0...0 7 0...0 | 0...0 7 0...0 | 0...0 7 0...0` (7s at C12 in each row segment)
Input R0: Marker(7) at C12.
Input R1: Marker(7) at C12.
Input R2: Marker(7) at C12.

Expected Output (3x30):
Row 0: `0...0 (C0-11), 7...7 (C12-29)`
Row 1: `7...7 (C0-12), 0...0 (C13-29)`
Row 2: `0...0 (C0-11), 7...7 (C12-29)`

Row-Parity Code Trace (3x30):
Input R0 (Even): Marker(7) at C12. Code: Fill C12 to end. -> `[0..0, 7..7]`. Expected: `[0..0, 7..7]`. Match.
Input R1 (Odd): Marker(7) at C12. Code: Fill C0 to C12. -> `[7..7, 0..0]`. Expected: `[7..7, 0..0]`. Match.
Input R2 (Even): Marker(7) at C12. Code: Fill C12 to end. -> `[0..0, 7..7]`. Expected: `[0..0, 7..7]`. Match.
*Still Matches.*

**Example 3 (3x30):**
Input String: `0 1 0...0 | 0 1 0...0 | 0 1 0...0` (1s at C1 in each row segment)
Input R0: Marker(1) at C1.
Input R1: Marker(1) at C1.
Input R2: Marker(1) at C1.

Expected Output (3x30):
Row 0: `0, 1...1 (C1-29)`
Row 1: `1, 1, 0...0 (C0-1)`
Row 2: `0, 1...1 (C1-29)`

Row-Parity Code Trace (3x30):
Input R0 (Even): Marker(1) at C1. Code: Fill C1 to end. -> `[0, 1..1]`. Expected: `[0, 1..1]`. Match.
Input R1 (Odd): Marker(1) at C1. Code: Fill C0 to C1. -> `[1, 1, 0..0]`. Expected: `[1, 1, 0..0]`. Match.
Input R2 (Even): Marker(1) at C1. Code: Fill C1 to end. -> `[0, 1..1]`. Expected: `[0, 1..1]`. Match.
*Still Matches.*

**Conclusion:** The dimensions were initially misinterpreted, but the row-parity logic holds true for the actual 3x30 dimensions across all examples. The previous code (the last one provided in the prompt history) correctly implements this logic. The error report was misleading as it likely referred to an even earlier code version.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: white (0)
  - Foreground_Colors: [orange (7), blue (1)] # Variable, determined by input
  - Transformation_Scope: Row-wise independent processing
  - Dimensions: Input and Output grids have identical height (H) and width (W). Examples shown use H=3, W=30.

Objects:
  - Marker_Pixel:
      - Definition: The first non-white pixel encountered when scanning an input row from left (column 0) to right (column W-1).
      - Properties:
          - Color (C)
          - Column_Index (I)
      - Existence: A row may or may not contain a Marker_Pixel.
  - Input_Row:
      - Property: Row_Index (R), ranging from 0 to H-1.
      - Property: Parity (Even or Odd, based on Row_Index R).
  - Output_Row:
      - Corresponds one-to-one with an Input_Row based on Row_Index.
      - Initial_State: All white (0).
      - Final_State: Determined by Marker_Pixel and Input_Row Parity.

Actions/Rules:
  - Find_Marker: For each input row R, find its Marker_Pixel (C, I).
  - Determine_Parity: Check if row index R is even (R % 2 == 0) or odd (R % 2 != 0).
  - Apply_Fill_Rule:
      - If no Marker_Pixel exists for row R: The corresponding output row remains all white.
      - If Marker_Pixel (C, I) exists for row R:
          - If R is Even: Fill the output row with color C from column I to column W-1 (inclusive).
          - If R is Odd: Fill the output row with color C from column 0 to column I (inclusive).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions (H x W), initially filled with the background color (white/0).
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, using a row index `R` from 0 to H-1.
4.  For the current input row `R`:
    a.  Scan the row from left (column 0) to right (column W-1) to find the first pixel that is not white (0). Call this the "marker pixel".
    b.  If no marker pixel is found (the row is all white), leave the corresponding output row `R` as all white and proceed to the next input row.
    c.  If a marker pixel is found with color `C` at column index `I`:
        i.  Check if the row index `R` is even (`R % 2 == 0`).
        ii. If `R` is even: Fill the output grid's row `R` from column index `I` to the last column (W-1), inclusive, with color `C`.
        iii. If `R` is odd: Fill the output grid's row `R` from the first column (0) up to and including column index `I`, with color `C`.
5.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.
