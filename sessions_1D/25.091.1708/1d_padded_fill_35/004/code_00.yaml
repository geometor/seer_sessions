Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: white (0)
  - Dimensions: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions (Height H, Width W). Confirmed 9x10 for all examples.
  - Transformation_Scope: Row-wise processing, dependent on row index.

Objects:
  - Marker_Pixel:
      - Definition: The first non-white pixel encountered when scanning a row from left to right.
      - Properties:
          - Color (C)
          - Column_Index (I)
      - Existence: A row may or may not contain a Marker_Pixel.
  - Input_Row:
      - Properties:
          - Row_Index (R)
          - Parity: Even or Odd (derived from R)
          - Content: Sequence of pixel colors.
          - Contains_Marker: Boolean
          - Marker_Info: (Color C, Index I) if Contains_Marker is True.
  - Output_Row:
      - Derived_From: Input_Row at the same Row_Index R.
      - Content: Sequence of pixel colors determined by rules.

Actions:
  - Identify_Marker: For each Input_Row R, find the Marker_Pixel (if any), noting its Color C and Index I.
  - Determine_Parity: For each Input_Row R, determine if R is even or odd.
  - Fill_Output_Row: Based on Marker existence, C, I, and R's parity, fill the corresponding Output_Row.

Relationships/Rules:
  - Rule 1 (No Marker): If Input_Row R contains no Marker_Pixel, the corresponding Output_Row R is filled entirely with white (0).
  - Rule 2 (Even Row with Marker): If Input_Row R has Row_Index R that is EVEN, and contains a Marker_Pixel with Color C at Index I, the corresponding Output_Row R is filled with white (0) from column 0 to I-1, and with Color C from column I to W-1 (inclusive).
  - Rule 3 (Odd Row with Marker): If Input_Row R has Row_Index R that is ODD, and contains a Marker_Pixel with Color C at Index I, the corresponding Output_Row R is filled with Color C from column 0 to I (inclusive), and with white (0) from column I+1 to W-1.
