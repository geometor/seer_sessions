Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: white (0)
  - Foreground_Colors: [orange (7), blue (1)] # Based on examples
  - Transformation_Scope: Row-wise independent processing

Objects:
  - Marker_Pixel:
      - Definition: The first non-white pixel encountered when scanning a row from left to right.
      - Properties:
          - Color (C)
          - Column_Index (I)
          - Is_In_Last_Column (Boolean)

Actions:
  - Identify_Marker: For each row, find the Marker_Pixel (if any).
  - Fill_Row: Modify the corresponding output row based on the Marker_Pixel's properties.

Relationships/Rules:
  - Rule 1: If an input row contains no Marker_Pixel (is all white), the output row remains all white.
  - Rule 2: If a Marker_Pixel with color C and index I is found, and it is *not* in the last column, the output row is filled with white up to column I-1, and with color C from column I to the end of the row.
  - Rule 3: If a Marker_Pixel with color C and index I is found, and it *is* in the last column, the *entire* output row is filled with color C.
