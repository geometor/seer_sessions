The primary colors involved are white (0), orange (7), and blue (1).\n2.  **Structure:** The transformation appears to operate independently on each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding row in the output grid.\n3.  **Key Feature:** The presence and position of the *first* non-white pixel in each input row seem crucial.\n4.  **Transformation:** The non-white pixel in the input row determines the color and extent of filling in the corresponding output row. White pixels (0) act as a background.\n5.  **Special Case:** There seems to be a special condition related to whether the first non-white pixel appears in the very last column of the grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create an output grid of the same dimensions (H x W), initially filled with the background color (white/0).\n3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from row index 0 to H-1.\n4.  For the current input row:\n    a.  Initialize `marker_found` to false, `marker_color` to null, and `marker_index` to -1.\n    b.  Iterate through the columns of the current input row, from column index 0 to W-1.\n    c.  If the current pixel is not white (value > 0) and `marker_found` is false:\n        i.  Set `marker_found` to true.\n        ii. Store the pixel's color as `marker_color`.\n        iii. Store the current column index as `marker_index`.\n        iv. Stop searching this row (break the inner loop).\n5.  If `marker_found` is true for the current row:\n    a.  Check if `marker_index` is equal to the last column index (W-1).\n    b.  If `marker_index` equals W-1 (it's in the last column):\n        i.  Fill the *entire* corresponding output row with `marker_color`.\n    c.  Else (if `marker_index` is *not* W-1):\n        i.  Fill the corresponding output row from column `marker_index` to W-1 (inclusive) with `marker_color`. (Pixels before `marker_index` remain white as initialized).\n6.  If `marker_found` is false (the input row was all white), the corresponding output row remains all white (no action needed as it was initialized to white).\n7.  After processing all rows, the output grid is complete. Convert it back to the required flattened string format if necessary."
