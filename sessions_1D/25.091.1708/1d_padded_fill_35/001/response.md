Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  Identify the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initialized entirely with white (0).
3.  Process the input grid row by row.
4.  For each row in the input grid:
    a.  Scan the row from left to right (column 0 to W-1) to find the first non-white pixel (the "marker pixel").
    b.  If no marker pixel is found (the row is all white), the corresponding output row remains all white.
    c.  If a marker pixel is found at column index `I` with color `C`:
        i.  Check if the marker pixel is in the very last column (i.e., if `I == W-1`).
        ii. If the marker pixel *is* in the last column (`I == W-1`), fill the *entire* corresponding output row with the marker color `C`.
        iii. If the marker pixel is *not* in the last column (`I < W-1`), fill the corresponding output row from column index `I` to the end (column W-1) with the marker color `C`. The pixels before index `I` in the output row remain white.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
