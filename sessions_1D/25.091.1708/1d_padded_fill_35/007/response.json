Create an output grid of the same dimensions (H x W), initially filled with the background color (white/0).\n3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, using a row index `R` from 0 to H-1.\n4.  For the current input row `R`:\n    a.  Scan the row from left (column 0) to right (column W-1) to find the first pixel that is not white (0). Call this the \"marker pixel\".\n    b.  If no marker pixel is found (the row is all white), leave the corresponding output row `R` as all white and proceed to the next input row.\n    c.  If a marker pixel is found with color `C` at column index `I`:\n        i.  Check if the row index `R` is even (`R % 2 == 0`).\n        ii. If `R` is even: Fill the output grid's row `R` from column index `I` to the last column (W-1), inclusive, with color `C`.\n        iii. If `R` is odd: Fill the output grid's row `R` from the first column (0) up to and including column index `I`, with color `C`.\n5.
