Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both are grids represented as flattened strings of integers (colors). The primary colors involved are white (0), orange (7), and blue (1).
2.  **Structure:** The transformation appears to operate independently on each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding row in the output grid.
3.  **Key Feature:** The presence and position of the *first* non-white pixel in each input row seem crucial.
4.  **Transformation:** The non-white pixel in the input row determines the color and extent of filling in the corresponding output row. White pixels (0) act as a background.
5.  **Special Case:** There seems to be a special condition related to whether the first non-white pixel appears in the very last column of the grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: white (0)
  - Foreground_Colors: [orange (7), blue (1)] # Based on examples
  - Transformation_Scope: Row-wise independent processing

Objects:
  - Marker_Pixel:
      - Definition: The first non-white pixel encountered when scanning a row from left to right.
      - Properties:
          - Color (C)
          - Column_Index (I)
          - Is_In_Last_Column (Boolean)

Actions:
  - Identify_Marker: For each row, find the Marker_Pixel (if any).
  - Fill_Row: Modify the corresponding output row based on the Marker_Pixel's properties.

Relationships/Rules:
  - Rule 1: If an input row contains no Marker_Pixel (is all white), the output row remains all white.
  - Rule 2: If a Marker_Pixel with color C and index I is found, and it is *not* in the last column, the output row is filled with white up to column I-1, and with color C from column I to the end of the row.
  - Rule 3: If a Marker_Pixel with color C and index I is found, and it *is* in the last column, the *entire* output row is filled with color C.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid. The last column index will be W-1.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions (H x W), initially filled with the background color (white/0).
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from row index 0 to H-1.
4.  For the current input row:
    a.  Initialize `marker_found` to false, `marker_color` to null, and `marker_index` to -1.
    b.  Iterate through the columns of the current input row, from column index 0 to W-1.
    c.  If the current pixel is not white (value > 0) and `marker_found` is false:
        i.  Set `marker_found` to true.
        ii. Store the pixel's color as `marker_color`.
        iii. Store the current column index as `marker_index`.
        iv. Stop searching this row (break the inner loop).
5.  If `marker_found` is true for the current row:
    a.  Check if `marker_index` is equal to the last column index (W-1).
    b.  If `marker_index` equals W-1 (it's in the last column):
        i.  Fill the *entire* corresponding output row with `marker_color`.
    c.  Else (if `marker_index` is *not* W-1):
        i.  Fill the corresponding output row from column `marker_index` to W-1 (inclusive) with `marker_color`. (Pixels before `marker_index` remain white as initialized).
6.  If `marker_found` is false (the input row was all white), the corresponding output row remains all white (no action needed as it was initialized to white).
7.  After processing all rows, the output grid is complete. Convert it back to the required flattened string format if necessary.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation mechanism: finding the first non-white pixel in each row and using its color and position to fill the corresponding output row. However, the execution results reveal a misunderstanding of the edge case where the marker pixel appears in the *last* column.

The previous code implemented a rule stating that if the marker pixel is in the last column, the *entire* output row should be filled with the marker's color. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` for all three examples clearly shows this is incorrect. In the expected outputs, when the marker is in the last column, *only* that last pixel is colored in the output row (Example 1, rows 4-6; Example 2, rows 2, 4, 6; Example 3, rows 2, 4, 6).

The strategy is to revise the transformation rule to remove the special handling for the last column. The rule should consistently be: find the first non-white pixel at index `I` with color `C`, and fill the output row with color `C` from index `I` to the end of the row.

It seems my guess for the grid widths was incorrect based on the flattened string length. Let's recalculate the dimensions.
Example 1: Length 90. Factors of 90: (1,90), (2,45), (3,30), (5,18), (6,15), (9,10). Looking at the pattern (7 followed by zeros, then 7 in the last column), a width of 18 or 15 seems plausible. Let's try W=18, H=5.
Example 2: Length 90. Factors as above. Pattern `0...0 7 0...0 7`. Width 18 (H=5) or 15 (H=6)? Let's try W=18, H=5.
Example 3: Length 90. Factors as above. Pattern `0 1 0...0 1`. Width 18 (H=5) or 15 (H=6)? Let's try W=18, H=5.

Let's rerun the analysis with W=18, H=5 for all examples.

# --- Conclusion from Re-evaluation ---
# 1. Grid dimensions vary between examples.
# 2. The rule IS different for the last column.
# 3. Original Rule 2: If marker not in last column, fill from marker index to end. (Correct)
# 4. Original Rule 3: If marker IS in last column, fill *only* the marker pixel position. (This is the correction needed).

# The initial code's implementation of Rule 3 was incorrect (it filled the whole row).

# Let's re-run the analysis with the *correct* dimensions and the *expected* outputs based on the actual task data. We need the *actual* transformed output from the previously supplied code for comparison. I'll simulate the previous code's output based on its logic (Rule 2: Fill right, Rule 3: Fill *entire* row).
