            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core row-based transformation: finding the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels in a row and filling the space between them with that color. However, the code incorrectly assumed the output grid would have the same dimensions as the input grid. The results show that the transformed outputs are wider than the expected outputs, indicating the output grid dimensions are derived differently. Specifically, the width of the output grid seems determined by the rightmost extent of *any* colored pixel in the input, while the height remains the same. The previous code initialized the output as a copy of the input, leading to incorrect dimensions and misplaced fills in rows where the original input was wider than the actual required output width.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Determine the correct output grid dimensions. The height will be the same as the input height. The width will be determined by the maximum column index containing a non-white pixel across *all* rows in the input grid, plus one (to account for 0-based indexing).\n    2.  Create the output grid with these calculated dimensions, initialized to white (0).\n    3.  Apply the previously identified row-filling logic (find min/max non-white column index per row, fill between them in the output) to this correctly sized output grid.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n    Let's measure the dimensions and maximum non-white column index for each example.\n"

            "text": "*   **Revised Metrics Analysis:**\n    The metrics calculation revealed an error in my previous visual assessment and hypothesis. The tool output shows:\n    *   Example 1: Input shape (1, 93), Output shape (1, 93), Max input col: 85, Calculated width: 86\n    *   Example 2: Input shape (1, 93), Output shape (1, 93), Max input col: 88, Calculated width: 89\n    *   Example 3: Input shape (1, 93), Output shape (1, 93), Max input col: 90, Calculated width: 91\n\n    It seems the input and output grids *do* have the same dimensions in the provided examples. My visual interpretation of the string outputs was misleading. The calculated required widths (based on the max non-white column index) are *less* than the actual output grid width (e.g., 86 vs 93 for example 1).\n\n    Let's re-examine the `Transformed Output` vs `Expected Output` from the test results, paying close attention to the *end* of the lines.\n\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Input max col: 85 (value 2)\n        *   Expected Output: Line of 2s stops at column 23 (index 23).\n        *   Transformed Output: Line of 2s continues to column 92 (index 92).\n\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Input max col: 88 (value 6)\n        *   Expected Output: Line of 6s stops at column 26 (index 26).\n        *   Transformed Output: Line of 6s continues to column 92 (index 92).\n\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Input max col: 90 (value 1)\n        *   Expected Output: Line of 1s stops at column 28 (index 28).\n        *   Transformed Output: Line of 1s continues to column 92 (index 92).\n\n    **Corrected Hypothesis:**\n    The output grid *does* have the same dimensions as the input grid. The error is in determining the *end column* for the horizontal line. It's not simply the maximum column index of *any* non-white pixel in that row within the input. There must be another rule.\n\n    Looking closer at the inputs and outputs:\n    *   Example 1: Input has 2s at columns 4, 23, 35, 52, 61, 85. Output line goes from col 4 to col 23.\n    *   Example 2: Input has 6s at columns 2, 26, 33, 54, 63, 88. Output line goes from col 2 to col 26.\n    *   Example 3: Input has 1s at columns 12, 28, 43, 59, 74, 90. Output line goes from col 12 to col 28.\n\n    **Revised Pattern:** The line starts at the minimum column index of a non-white pixel in the row (correct). The line *ends* at the column index of the *second* non-white pixel found when scanning from left to right in that row. If there is only one non-white pixel, no line is drawn (or perhaps just the single pixel remains - need to consider edge cases, though none are present in the training data).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
