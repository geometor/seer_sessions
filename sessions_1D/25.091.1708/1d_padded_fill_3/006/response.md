*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The initial hypothesis was partially correct: the transformation involves drawing horizontal lines in rows containing non-white pixels.
    *   However, the failure analysis reveals that the rule determining the *endpoint* of the line was incorrect. The previous code assumed the line spanned the full extent from the leftmost to the rightmost non-white pixel in the row.
    *   The comparison between expected and transformed outputs shows the lines in the expected outputs are shorter, specifically stopping at the column index of the *second* non-white pixel encountered from the left in that row.
    *   Rows with fewer than two non-white pixels appear unchanged in the output compared to the input.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Refine the perception of the rule: The horizontal line starts at the first non-white pixel and ends at the *second* non-white pixel in the row.
    2.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect this more precise rule.
    3.  The core logic remains row-based processing, but the calculation of the line's end column needs adjustment.

*   **Metrics:**

Let's verify the new hypothesis by examining the indices of non-white pixels in each relevant row across the examples.

*   **General Assessment & Strategy:**
    The previous code failed because it incorrectly determined the endpoint of the horizontal lines drawn in the output. It assumed the line should span from the leftmost to the rightmost non-white pixel in a row. Analysis of the input/output pairs and the code execution results revealed that the line should only extend from the *first* non-white pixel to the *second* non-white pixel (from the left) in any given row. Rows with fewer than two non-white pixels remain unchanged. The strategy is to update the transformation rule to reflect this "first-to-second pixel" boundary condition.

*   **Metrics Analysis (from `code_output`):**
    *   The code execution confirms the grid dimensions are 3x31 for all examples.
    *   For every row containing two or more non-white pixels across all three examples:
        *   The identified color matches the input pixels.
        *   The hypothesized start column (index of the 1st non-white pixel) and end column (index of the 2nd non-white pixel) correctly predict the segment that is filled in the output grid.
        *   The check `output_segment_matches_hypothesis` is `True` for all relevant rows, indicating the output segment `[start_col, end_col]` is indeed filled with the correct color.
        *   The check `outside_segment_unchanged` is `True` for all relevant rows, indicating that pixels before `start_col` and after `end_col` in the output row are identical to the input row.
    *   Rows with 0 or 1 non-white pixels were correctly identified as needing no line drawing, and the check `outside_segment_unchanged` (which checks for full row equality in these cases) is `True`.
    *   This strongly supports the hypothesis that the rule involves drawing a line between the first two non-white pixels found in a row.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0) or as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom (let the current row index be `r`).
    3.  For the current input row `r`:
        a.  Find the column indices of all non-white pixels. Let these indices be `indices`.
        b.  Count the number of non-white pixels found (`count = len(indices)`).
        c.  **If `count` is less than 2:** Copy the entire input row `r` to the output grid's row `r`.
        d.  **If `count` is 2 or more:**
            i.  Identify the color of the non-white pixels (e.g., using the color of the pixel at `indices[0]`).
            ii. Determine the starting column index: `start_col = indices[0]` (the first index found).
            iii. Determine the ending column index: `end_col = indices[1]` (the second index found).
            iv. In the output grid's row `r`, set the color of all pixels from column `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) to the identified non-white color. Pixels in row `r` outside this range (`< start_col` or `> end_col`) should retain their original values from the input grid. (Copying the input row first simplifies ensuring pixels outside the segment are correct).
    4.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.
