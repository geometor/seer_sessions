The previous code assumed the line spanned the full extent from the leftmost to the rightmost non-white pixel in the row.\n    *   The comparison between expected and transformed outputs shows the lines in the expected outputs are shorter, specifically stopping at the column index of the *second* non-white pixel encountered from the left in that row.\n    *   Rows with fewer than two non-white pixels appear unchanged in the output compared to the input.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Refine the perception of the rule: The horizontal line starts at the first non-white pixel and ends at the *second* non-white pixel in the row.\n    2.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect this more precise rule.\n    3.  The core logic remains row-based processing, but the calculation of the line's end column needs adjustment.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n\nLet's verify the new hypothesis by examining the indices of non-white pixels in each relevant row across the examples.\n"

It assumed the line should span from the leftmost to the rightmost non-white pixel in a row. Analysis of the input/output pairs and the code execution results revealed that the line should only extend from the *first* non-white pixel to the *second* non-white pixel (from the left) in any given row. Rows with fewer than two non-white pixels remain unchanged. The strategy is to update the transformation rule to reflect this \"first-to-second pixel\" boundary condition.\n\n*   **Metrics Analysis (from `code_output`):**\n    *   The code execution confirms the grid dimensions are 3x31 for all examples.\n    *   For every row containing two or more non-white pixels across all three examples:\n        *   The identified color matches the input pixels.\n        *   The hypothesized start column (index of the 1st non-white pixel) and end column (index of the 2nd non-white pixel) correctly predict the segment that is filled in the output grid.\n        *   The check `output_segment_matches_hypothesis` is `True` for all relevant rows, indicating the output segment `[start_col, end_col]` is indeed filled with the correct color.\n        *   The check `outside_segment_unchanged` is `True` for all relevant rows, indicating that pixels before `start_col` and after `end_col` in the output row are identical to the input row.\n    *   Rows with 0 or 1 non-white pixels were correctly identified as needing no line drawing, and the check `outside_segment_unchanged` (which checks for full row equality in these cases) is `True`.\n    *   This strongly supports the hypothesis that the rule involves drawing a line between the first two non-white pixels found in a row.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
