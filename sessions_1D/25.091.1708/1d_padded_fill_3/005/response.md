```python
"""
Transforms an input grid by processing each row independently.
For each row in the input grid:
1. Find all non-white pixels (value > 0).
2. If non-white pixels exist:
   a. Identify their color (assuming only one non-white color per row based on examples).
   b. Find the minimum column index (leftmost) of these non-white pixels.
   c. Find the maximum column index (rightmost) of these non-white pixels.
   d. In the corresponding row of the output grid, draw a horizontal line of that color, filling all pixels from the minimum column index to the maximum column index (inclusive).
3. If a row contains only white pixels (value = 0), the corresponding row in the output grid remains all white.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
