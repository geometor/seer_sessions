*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain a white background (0) and scattered pixels of a single non-white color (red, magenta, or blue in the examples).
    *   The output grids retain the same dimensions and the same white background.
    *   The key transformation happens within rows that contain non-white pixels in the input.
    *   In these rows, a horizontal line of the *same* non-white color is drawn in the output.
    *   This line spans horizontally from the column of the leftmost non-white pixel to the column of the rightmost non-white pixel within that specific row.
    *   All pixels between these start and end columns (inclusive) in that row are filled with the non-white color.
    *   Rows that are entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output.
    *   The transformation appears to be row-independent.

    actions:
      - name: identify_row_extents
        inputs: row, colored_pixels
        outputs: min_col_index, max_col_index, color
        description: For each row containing colored_pixels, find the minimum and maximum column index of those pixels and identify their color.
      - name: draw_horizontal_line
        inputs: row_index, min_col_index, max_col_index, color
        outputs: modified_row
        description: In the output grid's corresponding row, fill pixels from min_col_index to max_col_index (inclusive) with the identified color.
      - name: copy_row
        inputs: row
        outputs: identical_row
        description: If a row contains no colored_pixels, copy it unchanged to the output.
    relationships:
      - type: containment
        description: Colored pixels are contained within specific rows.
      - type: boundary
        description: The leftmost and rightmost colored pixels in a row define the horizontal boundaries for the line drawn in the output.
      - type: color_preservation
        description: The color of the pixels in the input determines the color of the line drawn in the output for that row.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0).
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the current row index.
    3.  For the current row:
        a.  Find all non-white pixels and record their column indices and color.
        b.  If no non-white pixels are found in the row, proceed to the next row (the corresponding output row remains white).
        c.  If non-white pixels are found:
            i.  Determine the color of these pixels (assume only one non-white color per row based on examples).
            ii. Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) among the non-white pixels.
            iii. Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) among the non-white pixels.
            iv. In the output grid, for the current row index, set the color of all pixels from column `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to the identified non-white color.
    4.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.
