Find the column indices of all non-white pixels (value > 0).\n2. If there are two or more non-white pixels in the row:\n   a. Identify the color of the first non-white pixel found.\n   b. Find the column index of the first (leftmost) non-white pixel.\n   c. Find the column index of the second non-white pixel from the left.\n   d.
