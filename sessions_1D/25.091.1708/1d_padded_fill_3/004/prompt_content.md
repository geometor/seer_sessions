```python
"""
Transforms an input grid by processing each row independently.
For each row in the input grid:
1. Find the column indices of all non-white pixels (value > 0).
2. If there are two or more non-white pixels in the row:
   a. Identify the color of the first non-white pixel found.
   b. Find the column index of the first (leftmost) non-white pixel.
   c. Find the column index of the second non-white pixel from the left.
   d. In the corresponding row of the output grid, draw a horizontal line segment 
      using the identified color, starting from the first non-white pixel's column 
      and ending at the second non-white pixel's column (inclusive).
3. If a row contains fewer than two non-white pixels, the corresponding row in 
   the output grid is identical to the input row.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
