task_type: sequence_transformation
elements:
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      color: white (0), non-white (1-9)
  - type: pattern
    identified_in: input
    description: Two pixels of the same non-white color (C) separated by one or more white (0) pixels.
    notation: C 0...0 C
    constraints: All pixels between the two C pixels must be white (0).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Positional relationship between pixels in the 1D sequence.
  - type: identity
    description: Matching the color of the two non-white pixels in the pattern.
actions:
  - name: find_pattern
    input: input sequence
    output: indices (i, j) of the start and end pixels (C) of the identified pattern.
  - name: fill_gap
    input: input sequence, indices (i, j), color (C)
    output: modified sequence
    description: Replace all pixels in the sequence from index i to j (inclusive) with the color C.
transformation:
  - description: Iterate through the input sequence to find all occurrences of the pattern "C 0...0 C".
  - description: For each found pattern, apply the "fill_gap" action to create the output sequence.
  - description: Pixels not part of a "fill_gap" action remain unchanged from the input.
