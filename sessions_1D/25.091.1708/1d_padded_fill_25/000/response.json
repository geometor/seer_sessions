The core transformation seems to involve identifying specific patterns of non-white colors separated by white (0) colors. In each example, there are pairs of identical non-white pixels (`C`). These pairs are separated by one or more white pixels (`0`). The output shows that the white pixels *between* the identified pair of non-white pixels are filled with the same non-white color (`C`). The original non-white pixels remain in place. All other pixels (white pixels not between such pairs, and non-white pixels not part of such a pair) remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
