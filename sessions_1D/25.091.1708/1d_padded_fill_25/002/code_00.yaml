task_type: grid_transformation
input_output_shape: Input and output grids have the same dimensions. Examples show 1x24 grids.
elements:
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      color: white (0), non-white (1-9, specific colors seen: orange(7), magenta(6))
      position: defined by row and column index.
  - type: pattern
    identified_in: input grid, horizontally within each row.
    description: Two pixels of the same non-white color (C) located in the same row, separated horizontally by one or more white (0) pixels only.
    notation: C 0...0 C (within a single row)
    constraints:
      - The two C pixels must be in the same row.
      - All pixels horizontally between the two C pixels must be white (0).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Positional relationship (row, column) between pixels. Adjacency is horizontal.
  - type: identity
    description: Matching the color of the two non-white pixels in the pattern.
actions:
  - name: find_horizontal_pattern
    input: input grid
    output: list of tuples (row, col_start, col_end, color_C) for each identified pattern.
  - name: fill_horizontal_segment
    input: grid, row, col_start, col_end, color_C
    output: modified grid
    description: Replace all pixels in the specified row from col_start to col_end (inclusive) with color_C.
transformation:
  - description: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - description: Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  - description: Within each row, iterate through the columns to find the first occurrence of a non-white pixel (color `C` at column `i`).
  - description: Starting from the column after the first non-white pixel (`i+1`), search horizontally within the same row for the next pixel that has the same color `C`. Let its column index be `j`.
  - description: If such a pixel is found at column `j`, check if all pixels in the same row between column `i+1` and `j-1` (inclusive) are white (0).
  - description: If the colors match and the intermediate pixels are all white, apply the "fill_horizontal_segment" action to the output grid for the current row, from column `i` to column `j` (inclusive), using color `C`.
  - description: Importantly, after finding and filling a pattern ending at column `j`, the search for the *next* pattern in that row should resume from column `j+1` to avoid overlapping interpretations or incorrect fills if patterns are adjacent.
  - description: Pixels not part of a "fill_horizontal_segment" action remain unchanged from the input.
  - description: Return the final modified output grid.
