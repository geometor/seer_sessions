```python
import copy

"""
Identifies pairs of identical non-white pixels (C) in the input sequence that are separated only by white pixels (0). 
For each such identified pair (at indices i and j), it fills the segment from i to j (inclusive) in the output sequence with the color C. 
Pixels not part of such a filled segment remain unchanged from the input.

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input sequence based on finding pairs of identical non-white pixels
    separated by white pixels.

        input_grid (list): A 1D list representing the input sequence of colors (0-9).

    Returns:
