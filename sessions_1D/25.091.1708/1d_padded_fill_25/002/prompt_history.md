Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception:**

The input and output are presented as 1D sequences of numbers (colors). The core transformation seems to involve identifying specific patterns of non-white colors separated by white (0) colors. In each example, there are pairs of identical non-white pixels (`C`). These pairs are separated by one or more white pixels (`0`). The output shows that the white pixels *between* the identified pair of non-white pixels are filled with the same non-white color (`C`). The original non-white pixels remain in place. All other pixels (white pixels not between such pairs, and non-white pixels not part of such a pair) remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
elements:
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      color: white (0), non-white (1-9)
  - type: pattern
    identified_in: input
    description: Two pixels of the same non-white color (C) separated by one or more white (0) pixels.
    notation: C 0...0 C
    constraints: All pixels between the two C pixels must be white (0).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Positional relationship between pixels in the 1D sequence.
  - type: identity
    description: Matching the color of the two non-white pixels in the pattern.
actions:
  - name: find_pattern
    input: input sequence
    output: indices (i, j) of the start and end pixels (C) of the identified pattern.
  - name: fill_gap
    input: input sequence, indices (i, j), color (C)
    output: modified sequence
    description: Replace all pixels in the sequence from index i to j (inclusive) with the color C.
transformation:
  - description: Iterate through the input sequence to find all occurrences of the pattern "C 0...0 C".
  - description: For each found pattern, apply the "fill_gap" action to create the output sequence.
  - description: Pixels not part of a "fill_gap" action remain unchanged from the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first occurrence of a non-white pixel (color `C` at index `i`).
3.  Starting from the position after the first non-white pixel (`i+1`), search for the next pixel that is *not* white (0). Let its index be `j`.
4.  Check if the pixel at index `j` has the same color `C` as the pixel at index `i`.
5.  If the colors match, then fill all pixels in the output sequence from index `i` to index `j` (inclusive) with the color `C`.
6.  Continue the search for the next pattern starting from index `j+1`.
7.  Repeat steps 2-6 until the entire input sequence has been processed.
8.  Return the modified output sequence.
```python
import copy

"""
Identifies pairs of identical non-white pixels (C) in the input sequence that are separated only by white pixels (0). 
For each such identified pair (at indices i and j), it fills the segment from i to j (inclusive) in the output sequence with the color C. 
Pixels not part of such a filled segment remain unchanged from the input.
