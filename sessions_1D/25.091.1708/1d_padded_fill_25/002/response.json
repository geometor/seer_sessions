            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue stems from misinterpreting the input data format. While presented linearly, ARC task inputs are 2D grids. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" confirms that the `transform` function received a 2D structure (likely a NumPy array or list of lists) instead of the assumed 1D list. Comparisons and indexing failed because they were applied incorrectly to this structure.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-interpret the input/output examples as 2D grids (likely 1 row x N columns based on the linear presentation).\n2.  Verify the grid dimensions and structure using code execution.\n3.  Adapt the pattern detection and filling logic to operate correctly on a 2D grid, specifically looking for the pattern *horizontally within each row*.\n\n**Metrics and Verification:**\n\nLet's verify the structure of the inputs. We assume they are single-row grids.\n"
