            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels. The dimensions seem consistent between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) acting as the background, and either magenta (6) or green (3) as the foreground or \"active\" color. Only one active color appears per example.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** The input grids contain sparse arrangements of the active color pixels. In each example, these active pixels seem to form pairs aligned horizontally within specific rows. In all given examples, each row with active pixels contains exactly two such pixels.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids show horizontal lines of the active color. These lines span the space between the pairs of active pixels found in the corresponding input rows. Rows without active pixels in the input remain unchanged (all white) in the output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying pairs of active pixels within the same row in the input and filling the horizontal segment between them (inclusive) with the same active color in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
