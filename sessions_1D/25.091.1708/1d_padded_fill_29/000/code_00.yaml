task_description: Fill the horizontal space between pairs of same-colored non-background pixels in each row.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - dimensions_preserved: Yes, input and output grids have the same height and width.

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be background (0) or an 'active' color (e.g., 3, 6).
  - type: horizontal_pair
    description: Two pixels of the same active color located in the same row of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the two pixels.
      - row_index: The row where the pair exists.
      - left_column_index: The column index of the leftmost pixel in the pair.
      - right_column_index: The column index of the rightmost pixel in the pair.
  - type: horizontal_segment
    description: A continuous horizontal line of pixels in the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the segment, matching the color of the input horizontal_pair.
      - row_index: The row where the segment exists.
      - start_column_index: The leftmost column index of the segment (matches left_column_index of the pair).
      - end_column_index: The rightmost column index of the segment (matches right_column_index of the pair).

actions:
  - name: identify_pairs
    description: Scan each row of the input grid to find pairs of pixels with the same active color.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_horizontal_pairs
  - name: fill_segment
    description: For each identified horizontal_pair, fill the corresponding row segment in the output grid with the pair's color.
    inputs:
      - horizontal_pair
      - output_grid (initially a copy of the input or an empty grid of the same size)
    outputs:
      - modified_output_grid

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    description: Each horizontal_pair in a specific row of the input grid maps directly to a horizontal_segment in the same row of the output grid. The segment spans horizontally between the pair's column indices.
  - type: condition
    description: Filling only occurs in rows containing exactly two pixels of the same active color. Other rows remain unchanged from the input (preserving background pixels).

assumptions:
  - Only one active color exists per grid.
  - Rows relevant for the transformation contain exactly two active pixels. Rows with zero, one, or more than two active pixels (or active pixels of different colors) are copied unchanged.
