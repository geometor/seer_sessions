Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels. The dimensions seem consistent between input and output for each example.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) acting as the background, and either magenta (6) or green (3) as the foreground or "active" color. Only one active color appears per example.
3.  **Input Pattern:** The input grids contain sparse arrangements of the active color pixels. In each example, these active pixels seem to form pairs aligned horizontally within specific rows. In all given examples, each row with active pixels contains exactly two such pixels.
4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids show horizontal lines of the active color. These lines span the space between the pairs of active pixels found in the corresponding input rows. Rows without active pixels in the input remain unchanged (all white) in the output.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying pairs of active pixels within the same row in the input and filling the horizontal segment between them (inclusive) with the same active color in the output.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the horizontal space between pairs of same-colored non-background pixels in each row.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - dimensions_preserved: Yes, input and output grids have the same height and width.

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be background (0) or an 'active' color (e.g., 3, 6).
  - type: horizontal_pair
    description: Two pixels of the same active color located in the same row of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the two pixels.
      - row_index: The row where the pair exists.
      - left_column_index: The column index of the leftmost pixel in the pair.
      - right_column_index: The column index of the rightmost pixel in the pair.
  - type: horizontal_segment
    description: A continuous horizontal line of pixels in the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the segment, matching the color of the input horizontal_pair.
      - row_index: The row where the segment exists.
      - start_column_index: The leftmost column index of the segment (matches left_column_index of the pair).
      - end_column_index: The rightmost column index of the segment (matches right_column_index of the pair).

actions:
  - name: identify_pairs
    description: Scan each row of the input grid to find pairs of pixels with the same active color.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_horizontal_pairs
  - name: fill_segment
    description: For each identified horizontal_pair, fill the corresponding row segment in the output grid with the pair's color.
    inputs:
      - horizontal_pair
      - output_grid (initially a copy of the input or an empty grid of the same size)
    outputs:
      - modified_output_grid

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    description: Each horizontal_pair in a specific row of the input grid maps directly to a horizontal_segment in the same row of the output grid. The segment spans horizontally between the pair's column indices.
  - type: condition
    description: Filling only occurs in rows containing exactly two pixels of the same active color. Other rows remain unchanged from the input (preserving background pixels).

assumptions:
  - Only one active color exists per grid.
  - Rows relevant for the transformation contain exactly two active pixels. Rows with zero, one, or more than two active pixels (or active pixels of different colors) are copied unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Find all non-background (non-white) pixels and record their colors and column indices.
    b.  Group these pixels by color.
    c.  Check if any color group contains exactly two pixels.
    d.  If a color group with exactly two pixels exists:
        i.  Identify the color of this pair.
        ii. Determine the column index of the leftmost pixel (`min_col`) and the rightmost pixel (`max_col`) of this pair.
        iii. In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, change the color of all pixels from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to the identified pair color.
4.  After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Identify pairs of pixels of the same non-background color within each row of the input grid. 
For each such pair found in a row, fill the horizontal segment between the pair's column indices (inclusive) with that color in the corresponding row of the output grid. 
Rows without exactly two pixels of the same non-background color remain unchanged.
