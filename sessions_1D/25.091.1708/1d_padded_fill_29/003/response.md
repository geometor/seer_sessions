"""
Fill segments in a 1D array between sequential pairs of pixels of the same non-background color.
The input is treated as a 1D array. Find all non-background pixels and group their indices by color. 
For each color group containing an even number of pixels, sort the indices. Then, iterate through the sorted indices taking pairs (1st & 2nd, 3rd & 4th, etc.). For each pair (start_index, end_index), fill the segment from start_index to end_index (inclusive) in the output array with that color. Background pixels (0) and pixels belonging to color groups with an odd number of members remain unchanged unless overwritten by a fill operation.
