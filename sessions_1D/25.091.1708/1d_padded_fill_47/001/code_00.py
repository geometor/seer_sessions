def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by filling the white pixels between pairs of 
    identical non-white pixels in each row.

    1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    3. For the current row, start searching from the beginning (leftmost column).
    4. Find the index (`start_col`) of the first pixel that is not white (color 0). 
       If no non-white pixel is found, proceed to the next row.
    5. Record the color (`pair_color`) of the pixel at `start_col`.
    6. Continue searching from the position immediately after `start_col` (`start_col + 1`).
    7. Find the index (`end_col`) of the *next* pixel in the same row that has 
       the *same* color (`pair_color`).
    8. If no such pixel is found, stop processing this row and move to the next row.
    9. If a matching pixel is found at `end_col`, this constitutes a pair (`start_col`, `end_col`).
    10. Iterate through all column indices (`fill_col`) strictly between `start_col` 
        and `end_col` (i.e., `start_col < fill_col < end_col`).
    11. For each `fill_col`, change the color of the pixel in the output grid at the 
        current row and `fill_col` to `pair_color`.
    12. Resume the search for the next pair in the current row, starting from the 
        position immediately after `end_col` (`end_col + 1`). Go back to step 4, 
        but begin the search from this new starting position.
    13. Repeat steps 4-12 until the end of the row is reached.
    14. After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
