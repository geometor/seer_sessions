**Perception:**

The input and output grids are always single rows (1xN dimension). The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (green (3) or azure (8)). The input grid contains pairs of the non-white color separated by one or more white pixels. The transformation involves filling the white pixels located horizontally *between* each pair of non-white pixels with that same non-white color. The positions of the original non-white pixels remain unchanged. The process appears to operate independently on each row (though all examples are single rows) and identifies pairs sequentially within the row.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D (effectively 1D as all examples are single rows)
  colors_present:
    - white (0) - background
    - green (3) or azure (8) - foreground objects
  input_features:
    - Rows contain pairs of identical non-white pixels.
    - These pairs are separated by one or more white pixels.
  output_features:
    - Same dimensions as input.
    - Original non-white pixels are preserved.
    - White pixels between the identified pairs are filled with the color of the pair.

transformation_logic:
  - scope: row-wise
  - identification: Sequentially find the first non-white pixel, then find the next pixel of the *same* color in that row to form a pair.
  - action: For each identified pair, change the color of all white pixels located strictly between the start and end indices of the pair to the color of the pair.
  - iteration: After processing a pair, continue the search for the next pair starting from the position immediately after the second pixel of the just-processed pair.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row, start searching from the beginning (leftmost column).
4.  Find the index (`start_col`) of the first pixel that is not white (color 0). If no non-white pixel is found, proceed to the next row.
5.  Record the color (`pair_color`) of the pixel at `start_col`.
6.  Continue searching from the position immediately after `start_col` (`start_col + 1`).
7.  Find the index (`end_col`) of the *next* pixel in the same row that has the *same* color (`pair_color`).
8.  If no such pixel is found, stop processing this row and move to the next row.
9.  If a matching pixel is found at `end_col`, this constitutes a pair (`start_col`, `end_col`).
10. Iterate through all column indices (`fill_col`) strictly between `start_col` and `end_col` (i.e., `start_col < fill_col < end_col`).
11. For each `fill_col`, change the color of the pixel in the output grid at the current row and `fill_col` to `pair_color`.
12. Resume the search for the next pair in the current row, starting from the position immediately after `end_col` (`end_col + 1`). Go back to step 4, but begin the search from this new starting position.
13. Repeat steps 4-12 until the end of the row is reached.
14. After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
