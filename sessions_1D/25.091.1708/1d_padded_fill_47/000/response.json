The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (green (3) or azure (8)). The input grid contains pairs of the non-white color separated by one or more white pixels. The transformation involves filling the white pixels located horizontally *between* each pair of non-white pixels with that same non-white color. The positions of the original non-white pixels remain unchanged. The process appears to operate independently on each row (though all examples are single rows) and identifies pairs sequentially within the row.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
