task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D (effectively 1D as all examples are single rows)
  colors_present:
    - white (0) - background
    - green (3) or azure (8) - foreground objects
  input_features:
    - Rows contain pairs of identical non-white pixels.
    - These pairs are separated by one or more white pixels.
  output_features:
    - Same dimensions as input.
    - Original non-white pixels are preserved.
    - White pixels between the identified pairs are filled with the color of the pair.

  - element: white_pixel
    properties:
      - color: 0
      - position: (row, column)
    condition:
      - located_horizontally_between_a_pixel_pair
    action:
      - change_color_to_pair_color

transformation_logic:
  - scope: row-wise
  - identification: Sequentially find the first non-white pixel, then find the next pixel of the *same* color in that row to form a pair.
  - action: For each identified pair, change the color of all white pixels located strictly between the start and end indices of the pair to the color of the pair.
  - iteration: After processing a pair, continue the search for the next pair starting from the position immediately after the second pixel of the just-processed pair.
