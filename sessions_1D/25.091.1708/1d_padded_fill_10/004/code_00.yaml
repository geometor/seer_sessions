task_description: Fill the horizontal segment between the first and last non-white pixel in each row.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width (verified for all examples: (1, 75)).
  - background_color: White (0) is the predominant background color.
objects:
  - object: Fill Pixel
    description: The non-white pixels present in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Varies across examples (green(3), orange(7), red(2)), but is consistent within a single example. Let this be `fill_color`.
      - role: Determines the fill color and marks the boundaries for the fill operation in its row.
  - object: Row Segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal section within a single row.
    properties:
      - color: Either white (0) or the `fill_color`.
      - location: Defined by a start column index (`start_c`) and an end column index (`end_c`) within a specific row (`r`).
      - relationship_to_input: In the output grid, if the corresponding input row `r` contains the `fill_color`, the segment from the minimum column index (`start_c`) to the maximum column index (`end_c`) of the `fill_color` in the input row is filled with `fill_color`. Otherwise, the segment (entire row) is white.
actions:
  - action: Identify Fill Color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - action: Scan Rows
    description: Process the input grid row by row.
  - action: Find Boundaries
    description: For each row containing the `fill_color`, locate the column indices of the first (leftmost, `start_c`) and last (rightmost, `end_c`) occurrences of the `fill_color`.
  - action: Fill Segment
    description: In the output grid, for each row where boundaries were found, color all cells in the segment from `start_c` to `end_c` (inclusive) with the `fill_color`.
relationships:
  - relationship: Row Correspondence
    description: Each row in the output grid corresponds directly to the row at the same index in the input grid.
  - relationship: Boundary-Fill Dependency
    description: The presence and the minimum/maximum column positions of the `fill_color` in an input row determine the segment to be filled in the corresponding output row.
    properties:
      - If the `fill_color` does not exist in an input row, the output row remains entirely white.
      - The filled segment in the output row starts at the minimum column index and ends at the maximum column index of the `fill_color` found in the input row.
