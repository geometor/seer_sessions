**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input grids are sparsely populated with a single non-white color against a white background. The non-white pixels appear scattered, often forming a rough diagonal pattern. The output grids maintain the same dimensions as the inputs. The transformation involves filling rows with the non-white color. Specifically, for each row, the filling starts from the column where the first non-white pixel occurs in the input row and extends all the way to the right edge of the grid. If a row in the input contains only white pixels, the corresponding row in the output remains entirely white. The color used for filling is the same as the non-white color found in the input grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill rows to the right starting from the first non-white pixel.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
  - background_color: White (0) is the predominant background color.
objects:
  - object: Trigger Pixel
    description: The leftmost non-white pixel in each row of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Varies across examples (green, orange, red), but is consistent within a single example.
      - role: Determines the fill color and the starting column for the fill operation in its row.
  - object: Fill Area
    description: The region in the output grid that gets filled with the non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the Trigger Pixel color for that example.
      - location: Starts at the column of the Trigger Pixel and extends to the rightmost column within the same row.
actions:
  - action: Identify Fill Color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - action: Scan Rows
    description: Process the input grid row by row.
  - action: Find Trigger
    description: For each row, locate the column index of the first (leftmost) non-white pixel.
  - action: Fill Right
    description: In the output grid, for each row containing a trigger pixel, color all cells from the trigger pixel's column to the right edge of the grid with the identified fill color.
relationships:
  - relationship: Row Correspondence
    description: Each row in the output grid corresponds directly to the row at the same index in the input grid.
  - relationship: Trigger-Fill Dependency
    description: The presence and column position of a Trigger Pixel in an input row determine if and where the Fill Area starts in the corresponding output row.
    properties:
      - If no Trigger Pixel exists in an input row, the output row remains white.
      - The Fill Area always uses the color of the Trigger Pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid. Let this be the `fill_color`.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom (row index `r`).
4.  For the current row `r`, scan from left to right (column index `c`) to find the first column `start_c` where the pixel color matches the `fill_color`.
5.  If such a `start_c` is found for row `r`:
    a.  Iterate through the columns of the output grid for row `r`, starting from `start_c` up to the last column.
    b.  Set the color of each pixel in this range (`output_grid[r][c]` where `c >= start_c`) to the `fill_color`.
6.  If no pixel matching the `fill_color` is found in the input row `r`, the corresponding output row `r` remains unchanged (all white).
7.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the row-wise nature of the transformation and the role of the non-white color. However, it misinterpreted the extent of the fill operation. The code based on the first hypothesis ("fill right from the first non-white pixel") produced outputs where the fill extended to the rightmost edge of the grid, whereas the expected outputs show the fill confined to the horizontal segment *between* the first and last occurrence of the non-white color within each specific row.

The strategy is to refine the understanding of the fill boundaries. Instead of filling from the first occurrence to the end of the row, the transformation should identify the minimum and maximum column index of the non-white color in each input row and fill only the segment between these two indices (inclusive) in the corresponding output row.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the horizontal segment between the first and last non-white pixel in each row.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width (verified for all examples: (1, 75)).
  - background_color: White (0) is the predominant background color.
objects:
  - object: Fill Pixel
    description: The non-white pixels present in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Varies across examples (green(3), orange(7), red(2)), but is consistent within a single example. Let this be `fill_color`.
      - role: Determines the fill color and marks the boundaries for the fill operation in its row.
  - object: Row Segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal section within a single row.
    properties:
      - color: Either white (0) or the `fill_color`.
      - location: Defined by a start column index (`start_c`) and an end column index (`end_c`) within a specific row (`r`).
      - relationship_to_input: In the output grid, if the corresponding input row `r` contains the `fill_color`, the segment from the minimum column index (`start_c`) to the maximum column index (`end_c`) of the `fill_color` in the input row is filled with `fill_color`. Otherwise, the segment (entire row) is white.
actions:
  - action: Identify Fill Color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - action: Scan Rows
    description: Process the input grid row by row.
  - action: Find Boundaries
    description: For each row containing the `fill_color`, locate the column indices of the first (leftmost, `start_c`) and last (rightmost, `end_c`) occurrences of the `fill_color`.
  - action: Fill Segment
    description: In the output grid, for each row where boundaries were found, color all cells in the segment from `start_c` to `end_c` (inclusive) with the `fill_color`.
relationships:
  - relationship: Row Correspondence
    description: Each row in the output grid corresponds directly to the row at the same index in the input grid.
  - relationship: Boundary-Fill Dependency
    description: The presence and the minimum/maximum column positions of the `fill_color` in an input row determine the segment to be filled in the corresponding output row.
    properties:
      - If the `fill_color` does not exist in an input row, the output row remains entirely white.
      - The filled segment in the output row starts at the minimum column index and ends at the maximum column index of the `fill_color` found in the input row.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find the first pixel that is not white (0). If no such pixel exists, return the all-white output grid. Let the color of this first non-white pixel be `fill_color`.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, using its index `r` (from 0 to height-1).
4.  For the current input row `r`:
    a.  Find all column indices `c` where the pixel `input_grid[r][c]` equals the `fill_color`.
    b.  If one or more such indices exist:
        i.  Determine the minimum column index (`start_c`) among them.
        ii. Determine the maximum column index (`end_c`) among them.
        iii. In the output grid's row `r`, set the color of all pixels from column `start_c` to column `end_c` (inclusive) to the `fill_color`.
    c.  If no pixel in the input row `r` matches the `fill_color`, the corresponding output row `r` remains unchanged (all white).
5.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.
