"""
Fill the horizontal segment between the first and last non-white pixel in each row of the input grid.

1. Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
2. Scan the input grid to find the first pixel that is not white (0). If no such pixel exists, return the all-white output grid. Let the color of this first non-white pixel be `fill_color`.
3. Iterate through each row of the input grid, using its index `r` (from 0 to height-1).
4. For the current input row `r`:
    a. Find all column indices `c` where the pixel `input_grid[r][c]` equals the `fill_color`.
    b. If such indices exist:
        i. Find the minimum index (`start_c`) and the maximum index (`end_c`).
        ii. In the output grid's row `r`, set the color of all pixels from column `start_c` to column `end_c` (inclusive) to the `fill_color`.
    c. If no such indices exist, the output row `r` remains white.
5. After iterating through all rows, return the completed output grid.
