The non-white pixels appear scattered, often forming a rough diagonal pattern. The output grids maintain the same dimensions as the inputs. The transformation involves filling rows with the non-white color. Specifically, for each row, the filling starts from the column where the first non-white pixel occurs in the input row and extends all the way to the right edge of the grid. If a row in the input contains only white pixels, the corresponding row in the output remains entirely white. The color used for filling is the same as the non-white color found in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
