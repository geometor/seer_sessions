task_description: Fill rows to the right starting from the first non-white pixel.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
  - background_color: White (0) is the predominant background color.
objects:
  - object: Trigger Pixel
    description: The leftmost non-white pixel in each row of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Varies across examples (green, orange, red), but is consistent within a single example.
      - role: Determines the fill color and the starting column for the fill operation in its row.
  - object: Fill Area
    description: The region in the output grid that gets filled with the non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the Trigger Pixel color for that example.
      - location: Starts at the column of the Trigger Pixel and extends to the rightmost column within the same row.
actions:
  - action: Identify Fill Color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - action: Scan Rows
    description: Process the input grid row by row.
  - action: Find Trigger
    description: For each row, locate the column index of the first (leftmost) non-white pixel.
  - action: Fill Right
    description: In the output grid, for each row containing a trigger pixel, color all cells from the trigger pixel's column to the right edge of the grid with the identified fill color.
relationships:
  - relationship: Row Correspondence
    description: Each row in the output grid corresponds directly to the row at the same index in the input grid.
  - relationship: Trigger-Fill Dependency
    description: The presence and column position of a Trigger Pixel in an input row determine if and where the Fill Area starts in the corresponding output row.
    properties:
      - If no Trigger Pixel exists in an input row, the output row remains white.
      - The Fill Area always uses the color of the Trigger Pixel.
