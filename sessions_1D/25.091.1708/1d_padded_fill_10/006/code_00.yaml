task_description: Fill the horizontal segment between the first and last non-white pixel in each row of the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width. All examples are 1x75.
  - background_color: White (0) is the predominant background color.
  - foreground_color: A single non-white color exists in each input grid (Green=3, Orange=7, Red=2 in the examples). This color is used for filling.
objects:
  - object: Boundary Pixels
    description: The leftmost and rightmost pixels in a row that match the grid's foreground color.
    properties:
      - color: Matches the single non-white color of the input grid.
      - role: Define the start and end columns for the fill operation within their row.
  - object: Fill Segment
    description: The horizontal region in the output grid that gets filled with the non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the Boundary Pixels' color for that grid.
      - location: Extends horizontally within a single row, starting at the column of the leftmost Boundary Pixel and ending at the column of the rightmost Boundary Pixel (inclusive).
actions:
  - action: Identify Fill Color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - action: Scan Rows
    description: Process the input grid row by row.
  - action: Find Boundaries
    description: For each row containing the fill color, locate the minimum and maximum column indices of pixels matching the fill color.
  - action: Fill Segment
    description: In the output grid, for each row where boundaries were found, color all cells from the minimum column index to the maximum column index (inclusive) with the identified fill color.
relationships:
  - relationship: Row Correspondence
    description: Each row in the output grid corresponds directly to the row at the same index in the input grid.
  - relationship: Boundary-Fill Dependency
    description: The presence and column positions of Boundary Pixels in an input row determine if and where the Fill Segment appears in the corresponding output row.
    properties:
      - If no Boundary Pixels (i.e., no fill color pixels) exist in an input row, the output row remains white.
      - The Fill Segment always uses the color identified from the input grid.
      - The Fill Segment spans horizontally from the first to the last occurrence of the fill color in the input row.
