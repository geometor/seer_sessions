task_description: Fill the horizontal segment between the first and last non-white pixel in each row of the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
  - background_color: White (0) is the predominant background color.
  - content: Input grids contain sparsely distributed pixels of a single non-white color. This color is consistent within a single input grid but varies between examples.
objects:
  - object: Boundary Pixels
    description: The non-white pixels within each row of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: A single non-white color (e.g., green, orange, red) specific to the input grid.
      - role: 
        - Determine the single `fill_color` for the entire transformation.
        - Mark the start and end columns for the fill operation within their respective rows. The leftmost non-white pixel defines the start column, and the rightmost defines the end column.
      - location: Can appear one or more times within a row. If only one appears, it defines both the start and end column.
  - object: Fill Segment
    description: The horizontal segment in the output grid that gets filled with the `fill_color`.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the `fill_color` identified from the input grid's Boundary Pixels.
      - location: Within a specific row `r` of the output grid, it spans horizontally from the column of the leftmost Boundary Pixel (`start_c`) to the column of the rightmost Boundary Pixel (`end_c`) found in the corresponding input row `r`. The fill includes both `start_c` and `end_c`.
      - existence: A Fill Segment only exists in rows where at least one Boundary Pixel was present in the corresponding input row.
actions:
  - action: Identify Fill Color
    description: Scan the input grid to find the single non-white color used. If none found, the task results in an all-white grid.
  - action: Scan Rows
    description: Process the input grid row by row (index `r`).
  - action: Find Fill Boundaries
    description: For each input row `r`, find all column indices where the `fill_color` appears. If found, identify the minimum index (`start_c`) and the maximum index (`end_c`).
  - action: Apply Fill Segment
    description: Create the output grid. For each row `r` where `start_c` and `end_c` were determined, set the pixels in the output grid at `output[r][c]` to the `fill_color` for all `c` from `start_c` to `end_c` (inclusive). Rows where no `fill_color` was found remain white.
relationships:
  - relationship: Row Correspondence
    description: Each row `r` in the output grid is derived solely from row `r` in the input grid.
  - relationship: Boundary-Fill Mapping
    description: The horizontal extent (start and end columns) of the Fill Segment in an output row is directly determined by the minimum and maximum column indices of the Boundary Pixels in the corresponding input row.
    properties:
      - Input rows without Boundary Pixels result in output rows that are entirely white.
      - The color of the Fill Segment is identical to the color of the Boundary Pixels.
