            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the task involves filling parts of rows based on the presence of a non-white pixel. It successfully found the single non-white color (`fill_color`) present in each input grid and correctly identified the starting column (`start_c`) for the fill operation in each row (the leftmost occurrence of `fill_color`).\n\nThe critical error was in determining the *end* of the fill operation. The code filled from `start_c` all the way to the right edge of the grid. However, the provided examples demonstrate that the fill should terminate at the column index of the *rightmost* occurrence of the `fill_color` within that specific input row.\n\nThe strategy for correction is to modify the row processing logic. Instead of just finding the first occurrence, the logic must find both the first (`start_c`) and the last (`end_c`) column indices of the `fill_color` in the input row. The fill operation in the output row should then cover the range from `start_c` to `end_c`, inclusive.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n"
