Analysis_Metrics:
  - Example: train_1
    Input_Shape: [6, 30] # Inferred from failed output length
    Output_Shape: [6, 30]
    Fill_Color: 3 # Green
    Row_Analysis_Input: # (row_index, [list_of_fill_color_indices])
      - [0, [8, 18]]
      - [1, []]
      - [2, [13, 23]]
      - [3, []]
      - [4, [18, 28]]
      - [5, []]
    Expected_Output_Fill_Ranges: # (row_index, start_col, end_col) inclusive
      - [0, 8, 18]
      - [2, 13, 23]
      - [4, 18, 28]
    Previous_Code_Error: Filled to the end of the row (col 29) instead of stopping at the last index. E.g., Row 0 filled 8-29 instead of 8-18.

  - Example: train_2
    Input_Shape: [6, 30] # Inferred
    Output_Shape: [6, 30]
    Fill_Color: 7 # Orange
    Row_Analysis_Input:
      - [0, [0, 17]]
      - [1, []]
      - [2, [8, 25]]
      - [3, []]
      - [4, [17, 27]]
      - [5, []]
    Expected_Output_Fill_Ranges:
      - [0, 0, 17]
      - [2, 8, 25]
      - [4, 17, 27]
    Previous_Code_Error: Filled to the end of the row (col 29) instead of stopping at the last index. E.g., Row 0 filled 0-29 instead of 0-17.

  - Example: train_3
    Input_Shape: [6, 30] # Inferred
    Output_Shape: [6, 30]
    Fill_Color: 2 # Red
    Row_Analysis_Input:
      - [0, [4, 16]]
      - [1, []]
      - [2, [10, 22]]
      - [3, []]
      - [4, [16, 28]]
      - [5, []]
    Expected_Output_Fill_Ranges:
      - [0, 4, 16]
      - [2, 10, 22]
      - [4, 16, 28]
    Previous_Code_Error: Filled to the end of the row (col 29) instead of stopping at the last index. E.g., Row 0 filled 4-29 instead of 4-16.

Commonalities:
  - All examples use a single non-white color against a white background.
  - The transformation preserves grid dimensions.
  - Rows without the non-white color in the input remain white in the output.
  - The fill operation uses the identified non-white color.
  - The fill operation in the output spans horizontally between the first and last occurrences of the non-white color found in the corresponding input row.
