**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input grids are sparsely populated with a single non-white color against a white background. The non-white pixels appear scattered, often forming a rough diagonal pattern. The output grids maintain the same dimensions as the inputs. The transformation involves filling rows with the non-white color. Specifically, for each row, the filling starts from the column where the first non-white pixel occurs in the input row and extends all the way to the right edge of the grid. If a row in the input contains only white pixels, the corresponding row in the output remains entirely white. The color used for filling is the same as the non-white color found in the input grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill rows to the right starting from the first non-white pixel.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
  - background_color: White (0) is the predominant background color.
objects:
  - object: Trigger Pixel
    description: The leftmost non-white pixel in each row of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Varies across examples (green, orange, red), but is consistent within a single example.
      - role: Determines the fill color and the starting column for the fill operation in its row.
  - object: Fill Area
    description: The region in the output grid that gets filled with the non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the Trigger Pixel color for that example.
      - location: Starts at the column of the Trigger Pixel and extends to the rightmost column within the same row.

  - action: Fill Right

  - relationship: Trigger-Fill Dependency
    description: The presence and column position of a Trigger Pixel in an input row determine if and where the Fill Area starts in the corresponding output row.
    properties:
      - If no Trigger Pixel exists in an input row, the output row remains white.
      - The Fill Area always uses the color of the Trigger Pixel.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid. Let this be the `fill_color`.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom (row index `r`).
4.  For the current row `r`, scan from left to right (column index `c`) to find the first column `start_c` where the pixel color matches the `fill_color`.
5.  If such a `start_c` is found for row `r`:
    a.  Iterate through the columns of the output grid for row `r`, starting from `start_c` up to the last column.
    b.  Set the color of each pixel in this range (`output_grid[r][c]` where `c >= start_c`) to the `fill_color`.
6.  If no pixel matching the `fill_color` is found in the input row `r`, the corresponding output row `r` remains unchanged (all white).
7.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the task involves filling parts of rows based on the presence of a non-white pixel. It successfully found the single non-white color (`fill_color`) present in each input grid and correctly identified the starting column (`start_c`) for the fill operation in each row (the leftmost occurrence of `fill_color`).

The critical error was in determining the *end* of the fill operation. The code filled from `start_c` all the way to the right edge of the grid. However, the provided examples demonstrate that the fill should terminate at the column index of the *rightmost* occurrence of the `fill_color` within that specific input row.

The strategy for correction is to modify the row processing logic. Instead of just finding the first occurrence, the logic must find both the first (`start_c`) and the last (`end_c`) column indices of the `fill_color` in the input row. The fill operation in the output row should then cover the range from `start_c` to `end_c`, inclusive.

Commonalities:
  - All examples use a single non-white color against a white background.
  - The transformation preserves grid dimensions.
  - Rows without the non-white color in the input remain white in the output.
  - The fill operation uses the identified non-white color.
  - The fill operation in the output spans horizontally between the first and last occurrences of the non-white color found in the corresponding input row.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the horizontal segment between the first and last non-white pixel in each row of the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
  - background_color: White (0) is the predominant background color.
  - content: Input grids contain sparsely distributed pixels of a single non-white color. This color is consistent within a single input grid but varies between examples.
objects:
  - object: Boundary Pixels
    description: The non-white pixels within each row of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: A single non-white color (e.g., green, orange, red) specific to the input grid.
      - role: 
        - Determine the single `fill_color` for the entire transformation.
        - Mark the start and end columns for the fill operation within their respective rows. The leftmost non-white pixel defines the start column, and the rightmost defines the end column.
      - location: Can appear one or more times within a row. If only one appears, it defines both the start and end column.
  - object: Fill Segment
    description: The horizontal segment in the output grid that gets filled with the `fill_color`.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the `fill_color` identified from the input grid's Boundary Pixels.
      - location: Within a specific row `r` of the output grid, it spans horizontally from the column of the leftmost Boundary Pixel (`start_c`) to the column of the rightmost Boundary Pixel (`end_c`) found in the corresponding input row `r`. The fill includes both `start_c` and `end_c`.
      - existence: A Fill Segment only exists in rows where at least one Boundary Pixel was present in the corresponding input row.
actions:
  - action: Identify Fill Color
    description: Scan the input grid to find the single non-white color used. If none found, the task results in an all-white grid.
  - action: Scan Rows
    description: Process the input grid row by row (index `r`).

    description: For each input row `r`, find all column indices where the `fill_color` appears. If found, identify the minimum index (`start_c`) and the maximum index (`end_c`).
  - action: Apply Fill Segment
    description: Create the output grid. For each row `r` where `start_c` and `end_c` were determined, set the pixels in the output grid at `output[r][c]` to the `fill_color` for all `c` from `start_c` to `end_c` (inclusive). Rows where no `fill_color` was found remain white.
relationships:
  - relationship: Row Correspondence
    description: Each row `r` in the output grid is derived solely from row `r` in the input grid.
  - relationship: Boundary-Fill Mapping
    description: The horizontal extent (start and end columns) of the Fill Segment in an output row is directly determined by the minimum and maximum column indices of the Boundary Pixels in the corresponding input row.
    properties:
      - Input rows without Boundary Pixels result in output rows that are entirely white.
      - The color of the Fill Segment is identical to the color of the Boundary Pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find the first pixel that is not white (0). If no such pixel exists, return the all-white output grid. Let the color of this first non-white pixel be `fill_color`.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, using its index `r` (from 0 to height-1).
4.  For the current input row `r`:
    a.  Create a list of column indices `c` where the pixel `input_grid[r][c]` equals the `fill_color`.
    b.  Check if this list of indices is empty.
    c.  If the list is *not* empty:
        i.  Find the minimum value in the list; let this be `start_c`.
        ii. Find the maximum value in the list; let this be `end_c`.
        iii. In the output grid's row `r`, set the color of all pixels from column `start_c` to column `end_c` (inclusive) to the `fill_color`.
    d.  If the list *is* empty, do nothing for this row (it remains white in the output grid).
5.  After iterating through all rows, return the completed output grid.
