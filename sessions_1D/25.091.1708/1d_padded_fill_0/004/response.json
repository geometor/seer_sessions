            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code implementation failed because it incorrectly applied a rule of filling segments *between consecutive* occurrences of the non-white color (`C`) for all examples. The actual transformation appears to be conditional:\n\n1.  **Condition:** Check if the specific pattern `C 0 C` (the non-white color, followed by 'white', followed by the same non-white color) exists anywhere in the input row.\n2.  **Rule 1 (If `C 0 C` exists):** Fill *only* the 'white' pixel within each `C 0 C` pattern with color `C`. (As seen in Example 3).\n3.  **Rule 2 (If `C 0 C` does *not* exist):** Find the index of the very first (`min_idx`) and very last (`max_idx`) occurrence of color `C` in the entire row. Fill *all* pixels from `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive) with color `C`. (As seen in Examples 1 and 2).\n\nThe previous code only implemented a variation of Rule 2 (filling between *consecutive* pairs, not the overall min/max span) and completely ignored the conditional check and Rule 1.\n\nThe strategy is to correctly implement this conditional logic: first, check for the `C 0 C` pattern. If found, apply Rule 1. If not found, apply Rule 2.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's verify the conditions and expected actions for each example.\n\n"
