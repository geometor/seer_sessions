Task: Conditionally fill gaps between pixels of the same color in a row.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N).
  - Pixels: Mostly 'white' (0).
  - Objects: Instances of a single non-'white' color (C).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N), same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: 'white' (0) and the non-'white' color C from the input.
  - Transformation: Some 'white' pixels from the input are changed to color C in the output based on a conditional rule.

Conditional_Rule:
  - Condition_Check: Determine if the pattern 'C 0 C' (the non-white color, followed by 'white', followed by the non-white color) exists anywhere in the input row.
  - If_True:
    - Action: Identify all indices `i` where the input pattern is `input[i-1]=C`, `input[i]=0`, `input[i+1]=C`.
    - Action: For each identified index `i`, set the output pixel at that index `i` to color `C`.
    - Scope: Only the 'white' pixels that are part of a 'C 0 C' pattern are changed.
  - If_False:
    - Action: Find the index of the first (leftmost) occurrence of C (`min_idx`).
    - Action: Find the index of the last (rightmost) occurrence of C (`max_idx`).
    - Action: Fill all pixels in the output row from index `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive) with color `C`.
    - Scope: All pixels within the span defined by the first and last `C` are changed to `C`.

Preconditions_Assumptions:
  - Input is always a single row.
  - There is exactly one unique non-'white' color `C` in the input row.
  - If Rule 2 applies, there are at least two occurrences of `C` to define a span (although a single `C` would technically result in a span of length 1). If Rule 1 applies, there is at least one `C 0 C` pattern.
  - If no non-'white' color exists, or multiple exist, no transformation occurs.
