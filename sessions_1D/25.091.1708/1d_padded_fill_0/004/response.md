**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code implementation failed because it incorrectly applied a rule of filling segments *between consecutive* occurrences of the non-white color (`C`) for all examples. The actual transformation appears to be conditional:

1.  **Condition:** Check if the specific pattern `C 0 C` (the non-white color, followed by 'white', followed by the same non-white color) exists anywhere in the input row.
2.  **Rule 1 (If `C 0 C` exists):** Fill *only* the 'white' pixel within each `C 0 C` pattern with color `C`. (As seen in Example 3).
3.  **Rule 2 (If `C 0 C` does *not* exist):** Find the index of the very first (`min_idx`) and very last (`max_idx`) occurrence of color `C` in the entire row. Fill *all* pixels from `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive) with color `C`. (As seen in Examples 1 and 2).

The previous code only implemented a variation of Rule 2 (filling between *consecutive* pairs, not the overall min/max span) and completely ignored the conditional check and Rule 1.

The strategy is to correctly implement this conditional logic: first, check for the `C 0 C` pattern. If found, apply Rule 1. If not found, apply Rule 2.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the conditions and expected actions for each example.

        for i in range(1, width - 1):
            if row[i-1] == color_c and row[i] == 0 and row[i+1] == color_c:
                has_c0c = True
                c0c_locations.append(i) # index of the '0' to be filled
                
    analysis['has_c0c_pattern'] = has_c0c
    analysis['c0c_fill_indices'] = c0c_locations

Example 1 Analysis:
{'color_c': 7, 'indices': [3, 11, 19, 27, 35, 43], 'min_idx': 3, 'max_idx': 43, 'has_c0c_pattern': False, 'c0c_fill_indices': []}

Example 2 Analysis:
{'color_c': 4, 'indices': [4, 14, 20, 30, 36, 46], 'min_idx': 4, 'max_idx': 46, 'has_c0c_pattern': False, 'c0c_fill_indices': []}

Example 3 Analysis:
{'color_c': 5, 'indices': [5, 7, 21, 23, 37, 39], 'min_idx': 5, 'max_idx': 39, 'has_c0c_pattern': True, 'c0c_fill_indices': [6, 22, 38]}


```
**Analysis Results:**

*   **Example 1:** Non-white color `C` is 7. Pattern `7 0 7` is **False**. Min index is 3, Max index is 43. **Rule 2 applies**. Fill range [3, 43] with 7.
*   **Example 2:** Non-white color `C` is 4. Pattern `4 0 4` is **False**. Min index is 4, Max index is 46. **Rule 2 applies**. Fill range [4, 46] with 4.
*   **Example 3:** Non-white color `C` is 5. Pattern `5 0 5` is **True**. The '0's to be filled are at indices 6, 22, 38. **Rule 1 applies**. Fill only these specific indices with 5.

These results confirm the conditional logic and the specific actions required for each rule.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Conditionally fill gaps between pixels of the same color in a row.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N).
  - Pixels: Mostly 'white' (0).
  - Objects: Instances of a single non-'white' color (C).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N), same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: 'white' (0) and the non-'white' color C from the input.
  - Transformation: Some 'white' pixels from the input are changed to color C in the output based on a conditional rule.

Conditional_Rule:
  - Condition_Check: Determine if the pattern 'C 0 C' (the non-white color, followed by 'white', followed by the non-white color) exists anywhere in the input row.
  - If_True:
    - Action: Identify all indices `i` where the input pattern is `input[i-1]=C`, `input[i]=0`, `input[i+1]=C`.
    - Action: For each identified index `i`, set the output pixel at that index `i` to color `C`.
    - Scope: Only the 'white' pixels that are part of a 'C 0 C' pattern are changed.
  - If_False:
    - Action: Find the index of the first (leftmost) occurrence of C (`min_idx`).
    - Action: Find the index of the last (rightmost) occurrence of C (`max_idx`).
    - Action: Fill all pixels in the output row from index `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive) with color `C`.
    - Scope: All pixels within the span defined by the first and last `C` are changed to `C`.

Preconditions_Assumptions:
  - Input is always a single row.
  - There is exactly one unique non-'white' color `C` in the input row.
  - If Rule 2 applies, there are at least two occurrences of `C` to define a span (although a single `C` would technically result in a span of length 1). If Rule 1 applies, there is at least one `C 0 C` pattern.
  - If no non-'white' color exists, or multiple exist, no transformation occurs.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid row to serve as the initial output row.
2.  Identify the unique non-'white' color (`C`) present in the input row.
3.  If no unique non-'white' color `C` is found (i.e., the row is all 'white' or contains multiple different non-'white' colors), return the original unchanged input grid.
4.  Scan the input row to determine if the pattern `C 0 C` (color `C`, followed by 'white' (0), followed by color `C`) exists at any position.
5.  **If the `C 0 C` pattern is found:**
    *   Iterate through the input row from the second pixel up to the second-to-last pixel (index `i` from 1 to length-2).
    *   For each position `i`, check if `input[i-1] == C`, `input[i] == 0`, and `input[i+1] == C`.
    *   If the condition is true, set the pixel at index `i` in the *output* row to color `C`.
6.  **If the `C 0 C` pattern is NOT found:**
    *   Find all indices where color `C` appears in the input row.
    *   If color `C` was found (i.e., there's at least one instance):
        *   Determine the minimum index (`min_idx`) among these occurrences.
        *   Determine the maximum index (`max_idx`) among these occurrences.
        *   Iterate through all indices `j` from `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive).
        *   Set the pixel at index `j` in the *output* row to color `C`.
    *   (If color C was somehow not found, despite passing step 3, the output row remains the initial copy).
7.  Return the modified output grid (as a list containing the single output row).
