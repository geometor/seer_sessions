**General Assessment**

The previous code failed on all three training examples. The transformed output was identical to the input in each case, indicating the transformation logic was either not triggered or flawed.

Initial analysis suggested a conditional rule: fill gaps in `C 0 C` patterns if they exist, otherwise fill the entire span between the first and last `C`. However, reviewing the expected outputs alongside the inputs reveals this is incorrect.

Examples 1 and 2 require filling spans between *consecutive* occurrences of the non-white color `C`, not the entire span from the absolute first `C` to the absolute last `C`.
Example 3, which *does* contain `C 0 C` patterns, is also solved correctly by filling the spans between consecutive occurrences of `C`. Specifically, the pairs `(C_index1, C_index2)` where `C_index2 = C_index1 + 2` result in filling the single gap, matching the `C 0 C` observation. Other pairs with larger gaps (e.g., `(7, 21)` in Example 3) correctly leave the intermediate white pixels unchanged because the fill operation only affects the range `[start_index, end_index]`.

Therefore, the strategy is to abandon the conditional `C 0 C` check and implement a single, unified rule: find all locations of the non-white color `C`, and for every adjacent pair of locations `(index1, index2)`, fill the output grid from `index1` to `index2` (inclusive) with color `C`.

**Metrics**

The following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Non-white color (C): 7 (orange)
    *   Indices of C: `[3, 11, 19, 27, 35, 43]`
    *   Consecutive index pairs (spans to fill): `(3, 11), (11, 19), (19, 27), (27, 35), (35, 43)`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Non-white color (C): 4 (yellow)
    *   Indices of C: `[4, 14, 20, 30, 36, 46]`
    *   Consecutive index pairs (spans to fill): `(4, 14), (14, 20), (20, 30), (30, 36), (36, 46)`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Non-white color (C): 5 (gray)
    *   Indices of C: `[5, 7, 21, 23, 37, 39]`
    *   Consecutive index pairs (spans to fill): `(5, 7), (7, 21), (21, 23), (23, 37), (37, 39)`

Applying the "fill span between consecutive pairs" rule correctly generates the expected output for all three examples.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Fill segments between anchor points in a row.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N).
  - Pixels: Primarily 'white' (0).
  - Objects: Multiple instances (at least two) of a single non-'white' color (C), acting as anchor points.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N), same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: 'white' (0) and the non-'white' color C from the input.
  - Transformation: 'white' pixels located between consecutive anchor points (C) in the input are changed to color C in the output.

Relationships:
  - The non-'white' color C in the output is the same as the non-'white' color C in the input.
  - The original positions of the anchor points (color C) are preserved and included in the filled segments.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identify the single non-'white' color (C).
  - Find all column indices where color C appears in the input row. Let these indices be `idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_k`.
  - Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row.
  - Iterate through the consecutive pairs of indices `(idx_i, idx_{i+1})` for `i` from 1 to `k-1`.
  - For each pair `(idx_i, idx_{i+1})`, fill all pixels in the output row from column `idx_i` to column `idx_{i+1}` (inclusive) with color C.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid row to serve as the initial output row.
2.  Identify the unique non-'white' color (`C`) present in the input row. (Assume there is exactly one such color and at least two instances of it). If these conditions aren't met, return the original row.
3.  Find all column indices where color `C` occurs in the input row. Store these indices in a sorted list.
4.  Iterate through the list of indices, considering pairs of consecutive indices `(index_A, index_B)`. The first pair starts with the first and second index, the next pair with the second and third, and so on, until the pair formed by the second-to-last and last index.
5.  For each pair `(index_A, index_B)`:
    *   Modify the output row by setting all pixels from column `index_A` to column `index_B` (inclusive) to the color `C`.
6.  Return the modified output row.
