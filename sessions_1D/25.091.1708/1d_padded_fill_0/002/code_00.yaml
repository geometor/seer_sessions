Task: Fill segments between anchor points in a row.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N).
  - Pixels: Primarily 'white' (0).
  - Objects: Multiple instances (at least two) of a single non-'white' color (C), acting as anchor points.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N), same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: 'white' (0) and the non-'white' color C from the input.
  - Transformation: 'white' pixels located between consecutive anchor points (C) in the input are changed to color C in the output.

Relationships:
  - The non-'white' color C in the output is the same as the non-'white' color C in the input.
  - The original positions of the anchor points (color C) are preserved and included in the filled segments.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identify the single non-'white' color (C).
  - Find all column indices where color C appears in the input row. Let these indices be `idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_k`.
  - Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row.
  - Iterate through the consecutive pairs of indices `(idx_i, idx_{i+1})` for `i` from 1 to `k-1`.
  - For each pair `(idx_i, idx_{i+1})`, fill all pixels in the output row from column `idx_i` to column `idx_{i+1}` (inclusive) with color C.
