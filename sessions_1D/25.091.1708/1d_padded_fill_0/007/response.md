"""
Transforms a single-row grid by identifying a unique non-white color 'C', finding
all its occurrences, pairing the indices sequentially (1st with 2nd, 3rd with 4th, etc.),
and filling the segment between each pair (inclusive) with color 'C'. If there is no
single unique non-white color, or fewer than two occurrences are found, the original
grid is returned.
