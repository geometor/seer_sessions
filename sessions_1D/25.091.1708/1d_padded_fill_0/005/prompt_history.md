Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of a single input row and a single output row of the same length. The rows primarily contain the 'white' color (0), interspersed with pixels of another single color ('orange' (7) in example 1, 'yellow' (4) in example 2, 'gray' (5) in example 3).
2.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves changing some 'white' pixels (0) to the non-white color present in the input. The original non-white pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color.
3.  **Pattern Recognition (Examples 1 & 2):** In the first two examples, the non-white pixels are relatively sparse. The transformation identifies the first and the last occurrence of the non-white color in the row. Then, all pixels *between* these first and last occurrences (inclusive) are filled with that same non-white color.
4.  **Pattern Recognition (Example 3):** The third example shows a different pattern. The non-white color ('gray', 5) appears in pairs separated by a single 'white' pixel (the pattern `5 0 5`). The transformation specifically targets these `C 0 C` patterns (where C is the non-white color) and changes the middle 'white' pixel to the color `C`, resulting in a `C C C` sequence. Other 'white' pixels are left unchanged.
5.  **Conditional Logic:** There appears to be a conditional rule. If the specific `C 0 C` pattern exists, that rule (filling the single gap) takes precedence. If that pattern *doesn't* exist, the rule defaults to finding the minimum and maximum index of the non-white color `C` and filling the entire span between them with `C`.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Fill gaps between pixels of the same color in a row.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N).
  - Pixels: Mostly 'white' (0).
  - Objects: Instances of a single non-'white' color (C).
  - Object_Distribution:
    - Scenario A (Examples 1, 2): Multiple instances of C, separated by one or more 'white' pixels. No 'C 0 C' pattern.
    - Scenario B (Example 3): Multiple instances of C, including pairs separated by exactly one 'white' pixel ('C 0 C' pattern).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N), same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: 'white' (0) and the non-'white' color C from the input.
  - Transformation: Some 'white' pixels from the input are changed to color C in the output.

Relationships:
  - The non-'white' color C in the output is the same as the non-'white' color C in the input.
  - The positions of the original non-'white' pixels C are preserved.
  - The transformation depends on the spatial arrangement of the non-'white' pixels C in the input.

Transformation_Rule_Conditional:
  - Condition: Check if the pattern 'C 0 C' exists anywhere in the input row, where C is the non-'white' color.
  - If True (Scenario B):
    - Action: For every occurrence of 'C 0 C', replace the middle '0' with 'C'.
  - If False (Scenario A):
    - Action: Find the index of the first occurrence of C (min_idx).
    - Action: Find the index of the last occurrence of C (max_idx).
    - Action: Fill all pixels in the range [min_idx, max_idx] (inclusive) with color C.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the single non-'white' color (let's call it `C`) present in the input row. If no non-'white' color exists, return the copied input grid.
3.  Scan the input row to determine if the specific pattern `C 0 C` (the non-'white' color, followed by 'white', followed by the non-'white' color) exists.
4.  **If the `C 0 C` pattern is found:**
    *   Iterate through the row indices `i` from 1 up to length-2.
    *   If the input pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` match `C`, `0`, and `C` respectively, then change the pixel at index `i` in the *output* grid to color `C`.
5.  **If the `C 0 C` pattern is NOT found:**
    *   Find the index of the first occurrence of color `C` in the input row (let `min_idx` be this index).
    *   Find the index of the last occurrence of color `C` in the input row (let `max_idx` be this index).
    *   Iterate through all indices `j` from `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive).
    *   For each index `j`, set the pixel at index `j` in the *output* grid to color `C`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code implementation failed because it incorrectly applied a rule of filling segments *between consecutive* occurrences of the non-white color (`C`) for all examples. The actual transformation appears to be conditional:

1.  **Condition:** Check if the specific pattern `C 0 C` (the non-white color, followed by 'white', followed by the same non-white color) exists anywhere in the input row.
2.  **Rule 1 (If `C 0 C` exists):** Fill *only* the 'white' pixel within each `C 0 C` pattern with color `C`. (As seen in Example 3).
3.  **Rule 2 (If `C 0 C` does *not* exist):** Find the index of the very first (`min_idx`) and very last (`max_idx`) occurrence of color `C` in the entire row. Fill *all* pixels from `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive) with color `C`. (As seen in Examples 1 and 2).

The previous code only implemented a variation of Rule 2 (filling between *consecutive* pairs, not the overall min/max span) and completely ignored the conditional check and Rule 1.

The strategy is to correctly implement this conditional logic: first, check for the `C 0 C` pattern. If found, apply Rule 1. If not found, apply Rule 2.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the conditions and expected actions for each example.

Example 1 Analysis:
{'color_c': 7, 'indices': [3, 11, 19, 27, 35, 43], 'min_idx': 3, 'max_idx': 43, 'has_c0c_pattern': False, 'c0c_fill_indices': []}

Example 2 Analysis:
{'color_c': 4, 'indices': [4, 14, 20, 30, 36, 46], 'min_idx': 4, 'max_idx': 46, 'has_c0c_pattern': False, 'c0c_fill_indices': []}

Example 3 Analysis:
{'color_c': 5, 'indices': [5, 7, 21, 23, 37, 39], 'min_idx': 5, 'max_idx': 39, 'has_c0c_pattern': True, 'c0c_fill_indices': [6, 22, 38]}

**Analysis Results:**

*   **Example 1:** Non-white color `C` is 7. Pattern `7 0 7` is **False**. Min index is 3, Max index is 43. **Rule 2 applies**. Fill range [3, 43] with 7.
*   **Example 2:** Non-white color `C` is 4. Pattern `4 0 4` is **False**. Min index is 4, Max index is 46. **Rule 2 applies**. Fill range [4, 46] with 4.
*   **Example 3:** Non-white color `C` is 5. Pattern `5 0 5` is **True**. The '0's to be filled are at indices 6, 22, 38. **Rule 1 applies**. Fill only these specific indices with 5.

These results confirm the conditional logic and the specific actions required for each rule.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Conditionally fill gaps between pixels of the same color in a row.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N).
  - Pixels: Mostly 'white' (0).
  - Objects: Instances of a single non-'white' color (C).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N), same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: 'white' (0) and the non-'white' color C from the input.
  - Transformation: Some 'white' pixels from the input are changed to color C in the output based on a conditional rule.

Conditional_Rule:
  - Condition_Check: Determine if the pattern 'C 0 C' (the non-white color, followed by 'white', followed by the non-white color) exists anywhere in the input row.
  - If_True:
    - Action: Identify all indices `i` where the input pattern is `input[i-1]=C`, `input[i]=0`, `input[i+1]=C`.
    - Action: For each identified index `i`, set the output pixel at that index `i` to color `C`.
    - Scope: Only the 'white' pixels that are part of a 'C 0 C' pattern are changed.
  - If_False:
    - Action: Find the index of the first (leftmost) occurrence of C (`min_idx`).
    - Action: Find the index of the last (rightmost) occurrence of C (`max_idx`).
    - Action: Fill all pixels in the output row from index `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive) with color `C`.
    - Scope: All pixels within the span defined by the first and last `C` are changed to `C`.

Preconditions_Assumptions:
  - Input is always a single row.
  - There is exactly one unique non-'white' color `C` in the input row.
  - If Rule 2 applies, there are at least two occurrences of `C` to define a span (although a single `C` would technically result in a span of length 1). If Rule 1 applies, there is at least one `C 0 C` pattern.
  - If no non-'white' color exists, or multiple exist, no transformation occurs.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid row to serve as the initial output row.
2.  Identify the unique non-'white' color (`C`) present in the input row.
3.  If no unique non-'white' color `C` is found (i.e., the row is all 'white' or contains multiple different non-'white' colors), return the original unchanged input grid.
4.  Scan the input row to determine if the pattern `C 0 C` (color `C`, followed by 'white' (0), followed by color `C`) exists at any position.
5.  **If the `C 0 C` pattern is found:**
    *   Iterate through the input row from the second pixel up to the second-to-last pixel (index `i` from 1 to length-2).
    *   For each position `i`, check if `input[i-1] == C`, `input[i] == 0`, and `input[i+1] == C`.
    *   If the condition is true, set the pixel at index `i` in the *output* row to color `C`.
6.  **If the `C 0 C` pattern is NOT found:**
    *   Find all indices where color `C` appears in the input row.
    *   If color `C` was found (i.e., there's at least one instance):
        *   Determine the minimum index (`min_idx`) among these occurrences.
        *   Determine the maximum index (`max_idx`) among these occurrences.
        *   Iterate through all indices `j` from `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive).
        *   Set the pixel at index `j` in the *output* row to color `C`.
    *   (If color C was somehow not found, despite passing step 3, the output row remains the initial copy).
7.  Return the modified output grid (as a list containing the single output row).
