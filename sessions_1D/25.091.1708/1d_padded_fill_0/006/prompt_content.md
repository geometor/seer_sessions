Transforms a single-row grid based on the arrangement of a non-white color 'C'.
If the pattern 'C 0 C' (non-white, white, non-white) exists anywhere in the row,
it fills the middle 'white' (0) pixel with 'C' for all such occurrences.
If the 'C 0 C' pattern does not exist, it finds the first (leftmost) and
last (rightmost) occurrence of 'C' and fills the entire span of pixels
between them (inclusive) with 'C'.
