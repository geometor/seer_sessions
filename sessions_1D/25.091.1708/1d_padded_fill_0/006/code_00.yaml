Task: Fill segments between paired occurrences of a color in a row.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N).
  - Pixels: Mostly 'white' (0).
  - Objects: Multiple instances of a single non-'white' color (C).
  - Object_Indices: A list of column indices where color C appears.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N), same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: 'white' (0) and the non-'white' color C from the input.
  - Transformation: Some 'white' pixels from the input are changed to color C in the output. The original C pixels remain.

Relationships:
  - The non-'white' color C in the output is the same as in the input.
  - The transformation depends on the positions (indices) of the C pixels.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identify: Find the unique non-'white' color C and all its indices in the input row.
  - Condition: Must have at least two occurrences of C.
  - Pairing: Group the indices sequentially into pairs: (1st_index, 2nd_index), (3rd_index, 4th_index), ..., (N-1th_index, Nth_index). If there is an odd number of indices, the last index is not part of any pair.
  - Action: For each pair (start_idx, end_idx):
    - Fill: Change all pixels in the output row from column `start_idx` to column `end_idx` (inclusive) to color C.
  - No_Change_Conditions:
    - If fewer than two instances of C are found.
    - If no non-'white' color is found.
    - If more than one unique non-'white' color is found.
    - Pixels outside the identified paired segments remain unchanged from the input.

Examples_Summary:
  - Example 1: C=7, Indices=[3, 11, 19, 27, 35, 43]. Pairs: (3, 11), (19, 27), (35, 43). Fills segments [3-11], [19-27], [35-43].
  - Example 2: C=4, Indices=[4, 14, 20, 30, 36, 46]. Pairs: (4, 14), (20, 30), (36, 46). Fills segments [4-14], [20-30], [36-46].
  - Example 3: C=5, Indices=[5, 7, 21, 23, 37, 39]. Pairs: (5, 7), (21, 23), (37, 39). Fills segments [5-7], [21-23], [37-39].
