Task: Fill gaps between pixels of the same color in a row.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N).
  - Pixels: Mostly 'white' (0).
  - Objects: Instances of a single non-'white' color (C).
  - Object_Distribution:
    - Scenario A (Examples 1, 2): Multiple instances of C, separated by one or more 'white' pixels. No 'C 0 C' pattern.
    - Scenario B (Example 3): Multiple instances of C, including pairs separated by exactly one 'white' pixel ('C 0 C' pattern).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N), same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: 'white' (0) and the non-'white' color C from the input.
  - Transformation: Some 'white' pixels from the input are changed to color C in the output.

Relationships:
  - The non-'white' color C in the output is the same as the non-'white' color C in the input.
  - The positions of the original non-'white' pixels C are preserved.
  - The transformation depends on the spatial arrangement of the non-'white' pixels C in the input.

Transformation_Rule_Conditional:
  - Condition: Check if the pattern 'C 0 C' exists anywhere in the input row, where C is the non-'white' color.
  - If True (Scenario B):
    - Action: For every occurrence of 'C 0 C', replace the middle '0' with 'C'.
  - If False (Scenario A):
    - Action: Find the index of the first occurrence of C (min_idx).
    - Action: Find the index of the last occurrence of C (max_idx).
    - Action: Fill all pixels in the range [min_idx, max_idx] (inclusive) with color C.
