            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of a single input row and a single output row of the same length. The rows primarily contain the 'white' color (0), interspersed with pixels of another single color ('orange' (7) in example 1, 'yellow' (4) in example 2, 'gray' (5) in example 3).\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves changing some 'white' pixels (0) to the non-white color present in the input. The original non-white pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition (Examples 1 & 2):** In the first two examples, the non-white pixels are relatively sparse. The transformation identifies the first and the last occurrence of the non-white color in the row. Then, all pixels *between* these first and last occurrences (inclusive) are filled with that same non-white color.\n4.  **Pattern Recognition (Example 3):** The third example shows a different pattern. The non-white color ('gray', 5) appears in pairs separated by a single 'white' pixel (the pattern `5 0 5`). The transformation specifically targets these `C 0 C` patterns (where C is the non-white color) and changes the middle 'white' pixel to the color `C`, resulting in a `C C C` sequence. Other 'white' pixels are left unchanged.\n5.  **Conditional Logic:** There appears to be a conditional rule. If the specific `C 0 C` pattern exists, that rule (filling the single gap) takes precedence. If that pattern *doesn't* exist, the rule defaults to finding the minimum and maximum index of the non-white color `C` and filling the entire span between them with `C`.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
