Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of a single input row and a single output row of the same length. The rows primarily contain the 'white' color (0), interspersed with pixels of another single color ('orange' (7) in example 1, 'yellow' (4) in example 2, 'gray' (5) in example 3).
2.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves changing some 'white' pixels (0) to the non-white color present in the input. The original non-white pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color.
3.  **Pattern Recognition (Examples 1 & 2):** In the first two examples, the non-white pixels are relatively sparse. The transformation identifies the first and the last occurrence of the non-white color in the row. Then, all pixels *between* these first and last occurrences (inclusive) are filled with that same non-white color.
4.  **Pattern Recognition (Example 3):** The third example shows a different pattern. The non-white color ('gray', 5) appears in pairs separated by a single 'white' pixel (the pattern `5 0 5`). The transformation specifically targets these `C 0 C` patterns (where C is the non-white color) and changes the middle 'white' pixel to the color `C`, resulting in a `C C C` sequence. Other 'white' pixels are left unchanged.
5.  **Conditional Logic:** There appears to be a conditional rule. If the specific `C 0 C` pattern exists, that rule (filling the single gap) takes precedence. If that pattern *doesn't* exist, the rule defaults to finding the minimum and maximum index of the non-white color `C` and filling the entire span between them with `C`.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Fill gaps between pixels of the same color in a row.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N).
  - Pixels: Mostly 'white' (0).
  - Objects: Instances of a single non-'white' color (C).
  - Object_Distribution:
    - Scenario A (Examples 1, 2): Multiple instances of C, separated by one or more 'white' pixels. No 'C 0 C' pattern.
    - Scenario B (Example 3): Multiple instances of C, including pairs separated by exactly one 'white' pixel ('C 0 C' pattern).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Single row (1 x N), same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels: 'white' (0) and the non-'white' color C from the input.
  - Transformation: Some 'white' pixels from the input are changed to color C in the output.

Relationships:
  - The non-'white' color C in the output is the same as the non-'white' color C in the input.
  - The positions of the original non-'white' pixels C are preserved.
  - The transformation depends on the spatial arrangement of the non-'white' pixels C in the input.

Transformation_Rule_Conditional:
  - Condition: Check if the pattern 'C 0 C' exists anywhere in the input row, where C is the non-'white' color.
  - If True (Scenario B):
    - Action: For every occurrence of 'C 0 C', replace the middle '0' with 'C'.
  - If False (Scenario A):
    - Action: Find the index of the first occurrence of C (min_idx).
    - Action: Find the index of the last occurrence of C (max_idx).
    - Action: Fill all pixels in the range [min_idx, max_idx] (inclusive) with color C.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the single non-'white' color (let's call it `C`) present in the input row. If no non-'white' color exists, return the copied input grid.
3.  Scan the input row to determine if the specific pattern `C 0 C` (the non-'white' color, followed by 'white', followed by the non-'white' color) exists.
4.  **If the `C 0 C` pattern is found:**
    *   Iterate through the row indices `i` from 1 up to length-2.
    *   If the input pixels at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` match `C`, `0`, and `C` respectively, then change the pixel at index `i` in the *output* grid to color `C`.
5.  **If the `C 0 C` pattern is NOT found:**
    *   Find the index of the first occurrence of color `C` in the input row (let `min_idx` be this index).
    *   Find the index of the last occurrence of color `C` in the input row (let `max_idx` be this index).
    *   Iterate through all indices `j` from `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive).
    *   For each index `j`, set the pixel at index `j` in the *output* grid to color `C`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
