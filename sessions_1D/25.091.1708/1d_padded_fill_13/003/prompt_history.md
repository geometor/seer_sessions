**Perception**

The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example. The transformation operates row by row. In the input grids, some rows contain exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (orange or azure in the examples), while the rest of the row is white. Other rows are entirely white. In the output grids, for the rows that contained two non-white pixels in the input, the segment between these two pixels (inclusive) is filled with the same non-white color. Rows that were entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output. The transformation essentially draws a horizontal line segment connecting the pair of colored pixels found on each relevant row.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Output_Relationship:
  - Grid_Dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - Color_Palette: Output grid uses only colors present in the input grid.
  - Transformation_Scope: Operates independently on each row.

Row_Processing:
  - Condition: Identify rows containing exactly two pixels of the same non-white color.
  - Identification:
      - Find the color (C) of these two pixels.
      - Find the column indices (col1, col2) of these two pixels (where col1 < col2).
  - Action:
      - In the output grid's corresponding row, change the color of all pixels from column col1 to col2 (inclusive) to color C.
  - Default_Case: Rows not meeting the condition (e.g., all white, fewer/more than two non-white pixels, or two non-white pixels of different colors) are copied unchanged to the output. (Based on examples, only all-white rows and rows with exactly two same-colored non-white pixels are shown).

Objects:
  - Background: White pixels (color 0).
  - Markers: Non-white pixels (e.g., orange (7), azure (8)). Act as endpoints for filling.
  - Segments: Horizontal lines of non-white pixels created in the output.

Properties:
  - Marker_Color: The specific non-white color (7 or 8).
  - Marker_Position: Row and column index.
  - Row_State: Characterized by the count and color(s) of non-white pixels within it.

Relationships:
  - Pairing: Two non-white pixels on the same row with the same color form a pair.
  - Span: The horizontal distance between the paired pixels defines the segment to be filled.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row, find all non-white pixels and record their colors and column indices.
4.  Check if there are exactly two non-white pixels in the row and if they both have the same color.
5.  If the condition in step 4 is met:
    a.  Identify the color (let's call it `fill_color`).
    b.  Identify the column indices of the two pixels (let's call them `start_col` and `end_col`, ensuring `start_col` is the smaller index).
    c.  In the corresponding row of the output grid, set the color of all pixels from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
6.  If the condition in step 4 is not met, the corresponding row in the output grid remains unchanged (as it was copied from the input initially).
7.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment**

The previous execution failed because the transformation function produced output identical to the input for all examples, indicating the core transformation logic (filling between marker pixels) was not applied. The reported results (`Pixels Off: 15`, `Pixels Off: 45`, `Pixels Off: 15`) match the number of pixels that *should have been* changed in each example, respectively. This strongly suggests the transformation logic described in the initial natural language program and implemented in the Python code is fundamentally correct, but failed to execute properly during testing.

The most likely cause is an issue with how the input data (provided as flat lists in the prompt) was parsed and passed to the `transform` function during the test execution. The function expects a 2D grid (list of lists or NumPy array), and if it received a 1D list, the row-based processing would fail.

**Strategy**

1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the task operates on 2D grids. The flat lists provided must be reshaped correctly before being passed to the transformation function.
2.  **Verify Dimensions:** Determine the correct dimensions (height x width) for each example grid.
3.  **Refine Description:** Update the Facts and Natural Language program to explicitly state the 2D grid nature and confirm the row-wise filling logic based on the correctly structured examples. The core logic identified previously appears sound.

      - Identify the color (C) and the column indices (col1, col2, where col1 < col2) of the two matching non-white pixels in the input row.
      - In the corresponding output row, set the color of all pixels from column col1 to col2 (inclusive) to C.
  - Default_Action: If a row does not meet the Trigger_Condition (e.g., it's all white, has zero, one, or more than two non-white pixels, or two non-white pixels of different colors), it is copied unchanged from the input to the output.

Objects:
  - Background: White pixels (0).
  - Markers: Pairs of identical non-white pixels (e.g., 7 or 8) within the same row in the input grid. They act as delimiters.
  - Segments: Horizontal contiguous blocks of non-white pixels created in the output grid by filling between Markers.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input as a 2D grid of color values.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initially identical to the input grid.
3.  Process the grid row by row:
    a.  For each row, examine its pixels to find non-white pixels (color value > 0).
    b.  Count the number of non-white pixels found in the row.
    c.  If the count is exactly 2:
        i.  Get the colors and column indices of these two pixels.
        ii. Check if their colors are identical.
        iii. If the colors are identical:
            1.  Determine the fill color (the color of the two marker pixels).
            2.  Determine the start column index (the minimum of the two column indices).
            3.  Determine the end column index (the maximum of the two column indices).
            4.  In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, change the color of all pixels from the start column index to the end column index (inclusive) to the fill color.
    d.  If the count of non-white pixels is not exactly 2, or if the two non-white pixels have different colors, make no changes to this row in the output grid (it remains as copied from the input).
4.  Return the completed output grid.
