Data_Structure:
  - Type: 2D Grid
  - Cells: Contain integer color codes (0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Examples_Dimensions:
      - Example 1: 3x24
      - Example 2: 3x20
      - Example 3: 3x24

Input_Grid_Properties:
  - Rows can be entirely white.
  - Rows can contain exactly two non-white pixels.
      - These two pixels always have the same color in the examples (Orange=7 or Azure=8).
      - Their column positions define the endpoints of a potential segment.

Output_Grid_Properties:
  - Dimensions match the input grid.
  - Colors used are identical to those in the input grid.

Transformation:
  - Scope: Applied independently to each row of the grid.
  - Trigger_Condition: A row contains exactly two non-white pixels, and these two pixels share the same color.
  - Action:
      - Identify the color (C) and the column indices (col1, col2, where col1 < col2) of the two matching non-white pixels in the input row.
      - In the corresponding output row, set the color of all pixels from column col1 to col2 (inclusive) to C.
  - Default_Action: If a row does not meet the Trigger_Condition (e.g., it's all white, has zero, one, or more than two non-white pixels, or two non-white pixels of different colors), it is copied unchanged from the input to the output.

Objects:
  - Background: White pixels (0).
  - Markers: Pairs of identical non-white pixels (e.g., 7 or 8) within the same row in the input grid. They act as delimiters.
  - Segments: Horizontal contiguous blocks of non-white pixels created in the output grid by filling between Markers.
