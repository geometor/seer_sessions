    """
    Processes a grid row by row. If a row contains exactly two pixels of the same 
    non-white color, it fills the segment between these two pixels (inclusive) 
    with that color. Otherwise, the row remains unchanged.

    1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    3. For the current row, find all non-white pixels and record their colors and column indices.
    4. Check if there are exactly two non-white pixels in the row and if they both have the same color.
    5. If the condition is met:
        a. Identify the fill color.
        b. Identify the start and end column indices of the two pixels.
        c. In the corresponding row of the output grid, set the color of all pixels 
           from the start column to the end column (inclusive) to the fill color.
    6. If the condition is not met, the corresponding row in the output grid remains unchanged.
    7. Return the modified output grid.
