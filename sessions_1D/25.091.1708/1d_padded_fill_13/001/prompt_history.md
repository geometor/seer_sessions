**Perception**

The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example. The transformation operates row by row. In the input grids, some rows contain exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (orange or azure in the examples), while the rest of the row is white. Other rows are entirely white. In the output grids, for the rows that contained two non-white pixels in the input, the segment between these two pixels (inclusive) is filled with the same non-white color. Rows that were entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output. The transformation essentially draws a horizontal line segment connecting the pair of colored pixels found on each relevant row.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Output_Relationship:
  - Grid_Dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - Color_Palette: Output grid uses only colors present in the input grid.
  - Transformation_Scope: Operates independently on each row.

Row_Processing:
  - Condition: Identify rows containing exactly two pixels of the same non-white color.
  - Identification:
      - Find the color (C) of these two pixels.
      - Find the column indices (col1, col2) of these two pixels (where col1 < col2).
  - Action:
      - In the output grid's corresponding row, change the color of all pixels from column col1 to col2 (inclusive) to color C.
  - Default_Case: Rows not meeting the condition (e.g., all white, fewer/more than two non-white pixels, or two non-white pixels of different colors) are copied unchanged to the output. (Based on examples, only all-white rows and rows with exactly two same-colored non-white pixels are shown).

Objects:
  - Background: White pixels (color 0).
  - Markers: Non-white pixels (e.g., orange (7), azure (8)). Act as endpoints for filling.
  - Segments: Horizontal lines of non-white pixels created in the output.

Properties:
  - Marker_Color: The specific non-white color (7 or 8).
  - Marker_Position: Row and column index.
  - Row_State: Characterized by the count and color(s) of non-white pixels within it.

Relationships:
  - Pairing: Two non-white pixels on the same row with the same color form a pair.
  - Span: The horizontal distance between the paired pixels defines the segment to be filled.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row, find all non-white pixels and record their colors and column indices.
4.  Check if there are exactly two non-white pixels in the row and if they both have the same color.
5.  If the condition in step 4 is met:
    a.  Identify the color (let's call it `fill_color`).
    b.  Identify the column indices of the two pixels (let's call them `start_col` and `end_col`, ensuring `start_col` is the smaller index).
    c.  In the corresponding row of the output grid, set the color of all pixels from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
6.  If the condition in step 4 is not met, the corresponding row in the output grid remains unchanged (as it was copied from the input initially).
7.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
