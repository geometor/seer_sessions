Grid_Properties:
  - Input_Output_Dimensions: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - Examples_Dimensions: All training examples appear to be 1x72 grids (single row).
  - Background_Color: White (0) is the background color.
  - Foreground_Colors: Non-white colors (Orange: 7, Azure: 8 in examples) act as markers.

Row_Processing_Rule:
  - Scope: The transformation is applied independently to each row (although examples only show single-row grids).
  - Condition: Identify rows containing pairs of non-white pixels where both pixels in a pair have the *same* color. The examples specifically show rows with exactly 3 such pairs (6 non-white pixels total). It's likely the rule applies generally to any row with one or more such pairs.
  - Identification_Per_Pair:
      - Find the color (C) of the paired pixels.
      - Find the column indices (col1, col2) of the paired pixels (where col1 < col2).
  - Action_Per_Pair:
      - In the output grid's corresponding row, change the color of all pixels from column col1 to col2 (inclusive) to color C.
  - Overlap_Handling: (Not explicitly shown, but implied) If segments overlap, the color of the segment defined by the outermost pair might dominate, or the order of operations might matter. Given the examples, segments are non-overlapping.
  - Default_Case: Rows (or parts of rows outside identified segments) not meeting the pairing condition are copied unchanged from the input to the output.

Objects:
  - Markers: Individual non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Marker_Pairs: Two non-white pixels in the same row, with the same color, identified as endpoints for filling. Based on examples, these pairs seem to be formed by grouping consecutive markers of the same color. E.g., C1, C2, C3, C4 of same color -> Pair(C1,C2), Pair(C3,C4).
  - Segments: Horizontal contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the output grid, created by filling between marker pairs.
