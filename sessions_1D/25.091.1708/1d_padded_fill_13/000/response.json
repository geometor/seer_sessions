In the input grids, some rows contain exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (orange or azure in the examples), while the rest of the row is white. Other rows are entirely white. In the output grids, for the rows that contained two non-white pixels in the input, the segment between these two pixels (inclusive) is filled with the same non-white color. Rows that were entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output. The transformation essentially draws a horizontal line segment connecting the pair of colored pixels found on each relevant row.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
