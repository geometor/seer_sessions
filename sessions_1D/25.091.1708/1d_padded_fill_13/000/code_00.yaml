Input_Output_Relationship:
  - Grid_Dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - Color_Palette: Output grid uses only colors present in the input grid.
  - Transformation_Scope: Operates independently on each row.

Row_Processing:
  - Condition: Identify rows containing exactly two pixels of the same non-white color.
  - Identification:
      - Find the color (C) of these two pixels.
      - Find the column indices (col1, col2) of these two pixels (where col1 < col2).
  - Action:
      - In the output grid's corresponding row, change the color of all pixels from column col1 to col2 (inclusive) to color C.
  - Default_Case: Rows not meeting the condition (e.g., all white, fewer/more than two non-white pixels, or two non-white pixels of different colors) are copied unchanged to the output. (Based on examples, only all-white rows and rows with exactly two same-colored non-white pixels are shown).

Objects:
  - Background: White pixels (color 0).
  - Markers: Non-white pixels (e.g., orange (7), azure (8)). Act as endpoints for filling.
  - Segments: Horizontal lines of non-white pixels created in the output.

Properties:
  - Marker_Color: The specific non-white color (7 or 8).
  - Marker_Position: Row and column index.
  - Row_State: Characterized by the count and color(s) of non-white pixels within it.

Relationships:
  - Pairing: Two non-white pixels on the same row with the same color form a pair.
  - Span: The horizontal distance between the paired pixels defines the segment to be filled.
