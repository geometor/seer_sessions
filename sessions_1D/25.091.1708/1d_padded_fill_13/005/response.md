"""
Transforms an input grid by processing it row by row. 
For each row, it identifies pairs of non-white pixels of the same color. 
It assumes these pairs are formed by taking consecutive non-white pixels of the same color 
after sorting their column indices. For each identified pair, it fills the horizontal 
segment between the pair's column indices (inclusive) with their color in the output grid. 
Pixels not part of such a filled segment retain their original color from the input grid.
