Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n2. Iterate through each row of the input grid using its row index.\n3. For the current row:\n    a. Find all non-white pixels (color > 0) and record their color and column index.\n    b. Check Condition 1: Proceed only if exactly two non-white pixels are found.\n    c. Check Condition 2: Proceed only if the colors of these two pixels are identical.\n    d. Execute Fill: If both conditions are met:\n        i. Get the fill_color (the color of the pair).\n        ii. Get the start_col (minimum column index) and end_col (maximum column index).\n        iii. In the output grid, modify the current row by setting all pixels from start_col to end_col (inclusive) to fill_color.\n4.
