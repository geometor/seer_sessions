Assume the input is provided as a 2D grid (e.g., a list of lists).\n2. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.\n3. Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the current row index.\n4. For the current row:\n    a. Identify all non-white pixels (pixels with color > 0). Record their color and column index.\n    b. Check if exactly two non-white pixels were found in this row.\n    c. If exactly two were found, check if they have the same color.\n    d. If both conditions (exactly two pixels, same color) are met:\n        i. Determine the `fill_color` (the color of the pair).\n        ii. Determine the `start_column` (the smaller column index of the pair).\n        iii. Determine the `end_column` (the larger column index of the pair).\n        iv. In the output grid, modify the current row: set the color of all pixels \n           from `start_column` up to and including `end_column` to the `fill_color`.\n5.
