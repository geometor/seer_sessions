task_description: Fill the horizontal segment between a specific pair of identical non-white pixels within each row.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels (3 rows x 13 columns in the examples).
    properties: [rows, columns, pixels]
  - element: pixel
    description: An individual cell in the grid with an integer color value (0-9).
    properties: [row_index, column_index, color_value]
  - element: background_pixel
    description: Pixels with color_value 0 (white).
  - element: marker_pixel
    description: Pixels with color_value > 0 (non-white).
  - element: row_segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels within a single row.

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_pair
    description: A specific condition met by a row where it contains exactly two marker_pixels, and both marker_pixels share the same color_value.
    involved_elements: [marker_pixel, marker_pixel, row]

actions:
  - action: identify_rows_to_fill
    description: Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, count the number of marker_pixels and identify their colors and column indices. Select rows that satisfy the 'horizontal_pair' relationship.
    condition: A row must contain exactly two marker_pixels, and their color_values must be identical.
  - action: determine_fill_parameters
    description: For each selected row, identify the color of the marker_pixels (fill_color) and their column indices (col1, col2). Determine the minimum column index (start_col) and the maximum column index (end_col).
    inputs: [selected_row, marker_pixel_1, marker_pixel_2]
    outputs: [fill_color, start_col, end_col]
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. In the copied grid, for each selected row, modify the row_segment from start_col to end_col (inclusive) by setting the color_value of all pixels within that segment to the fill_color.
    inputs: [copied_grid, row_index, start_col, end_col, fill_color]
    output: modified_grid

properties:
  - property: row_independence
    description: The identification and filling process is applied independently to each row. Rows not meeting the 'horizontal_pair' condition remain unchanged in the output grid.
  - property: fill_inclusivity
    description: The fill action includes the columns of the original marker_pixels themselves.
