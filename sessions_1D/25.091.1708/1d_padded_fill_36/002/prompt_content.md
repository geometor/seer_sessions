```python
"""
Fill the horizontal gap between pairs of same-colored pixels in each row.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. For each row in the input grid:
    a. Find all non-white pixels in the current row, noting their colors and column indices.
    b. Check if there are exactly two non-white pixels found in this row.
    c. Check if these two non-white pixels have the same color.
    d. If both conditions (exactly two pixels, same color) are true:
        i. Identify the color of these two pixels (`fill_color`).
        ii. Identify the column index of the leftmost pixel (`col_start`).
        iii. Identify the column index of the rightmost pixel (`col_end`).
        iv. In the output grid, for the current row, set the color of all pixels 
           from `col_start` to `col_end` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
3. Return the completed output grid.
