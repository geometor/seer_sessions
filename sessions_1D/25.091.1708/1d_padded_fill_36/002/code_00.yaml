task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between pairs of same-colored pixels in each row of a 2D grid.

input_format: Assumed to be a 2D grid (list of lists of integers). All examples use a 3x13 grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9). Dimensions are preserved.
  - element: pixel
    description: An individual cell in the grid with a color value.
  - element: background_pixel
    description: Pixels with the value 0 (white). Generally static unless overwritten by a fill operation.
  - element: marker_pixel
    description: Non-white pixels (values 1-9).
  - element: marker_pair
    description: >
      Exactly two marker pixels of the same non-white color located within the same row
      in the input grid. They define the boundaries for the fill operation.

relationships:
  - type: location
    description: Marker pairs exist within a single row.
  - type: color_identity
    description: The two pixels forming a marker pair must have the same color value.
  - type: boundary
    description: >
      The marker pair defines the start and end columns (inclusive) for the
      fill operation in their row. The leftmost pixel's column is the start,
      and the rightmost pixel's column is the end.

actions:
  - action: identify_marker_pairs_per_row
    description: >
      Iterate through each row of the input grid. In each row, find all
      non-white pixels and their column indices. Check if there are exactly
      two such pixels and if they share the same color.
  - action: determine_fill_parameters
    description: >
      If a marker pair is identified in a row, determine:
      - fill_color: The color of the marker pair pixels.
      - start_column: The minimum column index of the pair.
      - end_column: The maximum column index of the pair.
  - action: fill_horizontal_segment
    description: >
      In the corresponding row of the output grid (initially a copy of the input),
      change the color of all pixels from start_column to end_column (inclusive)
      to the fill_color.
  - action: copy_unmodified_rows
    description: >
      Rows that do not contain a marker pair remain unchanged from the input grid
      in the output grid.

properties:
  - property: grid_dimensions
    description: Height and width of the grid remain unchanged. (3x13 in examples)
  - property: row_independence
    description: The transformation rule is applied independently to each row.
  - property: fill_color_source
    description: The color used for filling is determined by the marker pair in that row.
