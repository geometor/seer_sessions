task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between pairs of same-colored pixels in each row of a grid. The input is provided as a flattened string and needs reshaping.

input_format:
  type: flattened_string
  description: A single string of space-separated integers representing the grid pixels row by row.
  properties:
    total_pixels: 39 (consistent across examples)
    inferred_width: 13
    inferred_height: 3

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array (3x13) of pixels representing colors (0-9), derived from the flattened input string.
  - element: pixel
    description: An individual cell in the grid with a color value.
  - element: background_pixel
    description: Pixels with the value 0 (white), generally static except when overwritten by fill.
  - element: marker_pixel
    description: Non-white pixels (values 1-9) that indicate points of interest.
  - element: marker_pair
    description: Exactly two marker pixels of the same color located within the same row in the input grid. They define the boundaries for the fill operation.

relationships:
  - type: location
    description: Marker pairs exist within a single row.
  - type: color_identity
    description: The two pixels forming a marker pair must have the same non-zero color value.
  - type: boundary
    description: The marker pair defines the inclusive start and end columns for the fill operation in their row.

actions:
  - action: parse_and_reshape_input
    description: Convert the flattened input string into a 2D numpy array with the correct dimensions (e.g., 3x13).
  - action: copy_grid
    description: Create a modifiable copy of the reshaped input grid to serve as the output grid.
  - action: identify_marker_pairs_per_row
    description: Scan each row of the reshaped input grid to find rows containing exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.
  - action: determine_fill_parameters
    description: For each identified marker pair, determine the start column, end column, and fill color.
      - start_column: Minimum column index of the pair.
      - end_column: Maximum column index of the pair.
      - fill_color: The color of the marker pair pixels.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels between the start_column and end_column (inclusive) to the fill_color.
  - action: preserve_unmodified_rows
    description: Rows that do not contain a valid marker pair remain unchanged in the output grid (achieved by copying initially).
  - action: return_output
    description: Return the transformed 2D grid. (Note: Consider if flattening is needed based on task requirements, but standard ARC usually expects 2D).

properties:
  - property: grid_dimensions
    description: Height (3) and width (13) of the grid, consistent across examples.
  - property: row_independence
    description: The transformation rule is applied independently to each row.
