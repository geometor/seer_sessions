Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels represented by integers (colors). The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output in all examples.
2.  **Background Color:** The predominant color is white (0), acting as the background. The background pixels seem largely unaffected by the transformation, except where specific filling occurs.
3.  **Foreground Objects:** The significant elements in the input grids are pairs of non-white pixels located on the same row.
    *   In `train_1`, the pairs are yellow (4).
    *   In `train_2` and `train_3`, the pairs are azure (8).
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation appears to be filling the horizontal space *between* the pairs of non-white pixels found in each row.
5.  **Filling Color:** The color used for filling is always the same as the color of the pair of pixels in that row.
6.  **Row Independence:** The transformation seems to operate independently on each row. If a row contains a qualifying pair of pixels, the fill occurs; otherwise, the row remains unchanged.
7.  **Pair Definition:** The transformation specifically targets rows containing exactly two non-white pixels of the same color. These two pixels define the start and end points of the horizontal line segment to be filled.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between pairs of same-colored pixels in each row.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: pixel
    description: An individual cell in the grid with a color value.
  - element: background_pixel
    description: Pixels with the value 0 (white), generally static.
  - element: marker_pixel
    description: Non-white pixels (values 1-9) that indicate points of interest.
  - element: marker_pair
    description: Exactly two marker pixels of the same color located within the same row in the input grid. They define the boundaries for the fill operation.

relationships:
  - type: location
    description: Marker pairs exist within a single row.
  - type: color_identity
    description: The two pixels forming a marker pair must have the same color value.
  - type: boundary
    description: The marker pair defines the start and end columns for the fill operation in their row.

actions:
  - action: identify_marker_pairs
    description: Scan each row of the input grid to find rows containing exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.
  - action: determine_fill_parameters
    description: For each identified marker pair, determine the start column, end column, and fill color.
      - start_column: Minimum column index of the pair.
      - end_column: Maximum column index of the pair.
      - fill_color: The color of the marker pair pixels.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels between the start_column and end_column (inclusive) to the fill_color.
  - action: copy_unmodified_rows
    description: Rows that do not contain a marker pair are copied directly from the input to the output grid without changes.

properties:
  - property: input_grid_dimensions
    description: Height and width of the input grid.
  - property: output_grid_dimensions
    description: Height and width of the output grid (same as input).
  - property: row_independence
    description: The transformation rule is applied independently to each row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  For each row in the input grid:
    a.  Find all non-white pixels in the current row, noting their colors and column indices.
    b.  Check if there are exactly two non-white pixels found in this row.
    c.  Check if these two non-white pixels have the same color.
    d.  If both conditions (exactly two pixels, same color) are true:
        i.  Identify the color of these two pixels (`fill_color`).
        ii. Identify the column index of the leftmost pixel (`col_start`).
        iii. Identify the column index of the rightmost pixel (`col_end`).
        iv. In the output grid, for the current row, set the color of all pixels from `col_start` to `col_end` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
3.  Return the completed output grid.
