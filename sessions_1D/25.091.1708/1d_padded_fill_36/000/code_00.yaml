task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between pairs of same-colored pixels in each row.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: pixel
    description: An individual cell in the grid with a color value.
  - element: background_pixel
    description: Pixels with the value 0 (white), generally static.
  - element: marker_pixel
    description: Non-white pixels (values 1-9) that indicate points of interest.
  - element: marker_pair
    description: Exactly two marker pixels of the same color located within the same row in the input grid. They define the boundaries for the fill operation.

relationships:
  - type: location
    description: Marker pairs exist within a single row.
  - type: color_identity
    description: The two pixels forming a marker pair must have the same color value.
  - type: boundary
    description: The marker pair defines the start and end columns for the fill operation in their row.

actions:
  - action: identify_marker_pairs
    description: Scan each row of the input grid to find rows containing exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.
  - action: determine_fill_parameters
    description: For each identified marker pair, determine the start column, end column, and fill color.
      - start_column: Minimum column index of the pair.
      - end_column: Maximum column index of the pair.
      - fill_color: The color of the marker pair pixels.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels between the start_column and end_column (inclusive) to the fill_color.
  - action: copy_unmodified_rows
    description: Rows that do not contain a marker pair are copied directly from the input to the output grid without changes.

properties:
  - property: input_grid_dimensions
    description: Height and width of the input grid.
  - property: output_grid_dimensions
    description: Height and width of the output grid (same as input).
  - property: row_independence
    description: The transformation rule is applied independently to each row.
