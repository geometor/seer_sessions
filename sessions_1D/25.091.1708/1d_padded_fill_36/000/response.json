The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output in all examples.\n2.  **Background Color:** The predominant color is white (0), acting as the background. The background pixels seem largely unaffected by the transformation, except where specific filling occurs.\n3.  **Foreground Objects:** The significant elements in the input grids are pairs of non-white pixels located on the same row.\n    *   In `train_1`, the pairs are yellow (4).\n    *   In `train_2` and `train_3`, the pairs are azure (8).\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation appears to be filling the horizontal space *between* the pairs of non-white pixels found in each row.\n5.  **Filling Color:** The color used for filling is always the same as the color of the pair of pixels in that row.\n6.  **Row Independence:** The transformation seems to operate independently on each row. If a row contains a qualifying pair of pixels, the fill occurs; otherwise, the row remains unchanged.\n7.  **Pair Definition:** The transformation specifically targets rows containing exactly two non-white pixels of the same color. These two pixels define the start and end points of the horizontal line segment to be filled.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
