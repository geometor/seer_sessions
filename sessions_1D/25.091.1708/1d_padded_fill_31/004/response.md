*   **Assessment:**
    The initial analysis incorrectly treated the input/output grids as single rows (1D) instead of multiple rows (2D). The provided code reflects this misunderstanding, attempting to find the first and last non-white pixel across the flattened grid and filling a single segment. The test results clearly show this is wrong; the transformation needs to be applied independently to each row of the grid. The core logic of finding the start and end points of a non-white color and filling between them seems correct, but it must be scoped to individual rows.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Modify the perception and facts to correctly represent the data as 2D grids.
    2.  Update the natural language program to describe a row-by-row process.
    3.  For each row:
        *   Identify the non-white color (assuming only one non-white color per row, or using the color of the first non-white pixel).
        *   Find the column index of the first (leftmost) occurrence of *any* non-white pixel in that row.
        *   Find the column index of the last (rightmost) occurrence of *any* non-white pixel in that row.
        *   Fill the pixels *between* these start and end column indices (exclusive of the endpoints) in that specific row with the identified non-white color.
        *   If a row contains fewer than two non-white pixels, it remains unchanged.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Let's examine the structure and key indices for each example row by row.

```
*   **Findings from Metrics:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are indeed 2D grids.
    *   The transformation is applied row by row.
    *   For rows with two or more non-white pixels in the input (e.g., Ex1 Row 0, Ex2 Row 0, Ex3 Row 0), the output fills the space *between* the first and last non-white pixel with the same color. The original non-white pixels are preserved.
    *   For rows with only *one* non-white pixel in the input (e.g., Ex2 Row 1, Row 2, Row 3; Ex3 Row 1, Row 2, Row 3, Row 4), the transformation still occurs, but the start and end points seem to be defined differently or combined with information from other rows. **Correction:** Re-examining the outputs for rows with single input pixels reveals they are *not* simply copied. The filled segment in the output extends from that single pixel's position to the column index of the *last non-white pixel* found in *any* row *before* it that contained non-white pixels, *or* if no preceding row had non-white pixels, it extends to the last non-white pixel in the *first subsequent row* with non-white pixels. This requires a more complex state or multi-pass approach. **Further Correction:** Looking closely at Example 2 and 3 outputs, it seems simpler: if a row has only *one* non-white pixel, the fill operation uses the column index of that pixel as the `start_index` and the column index of the *last* non-white pixel *in the entire input grid* as the `end_index` (or perhaps the maximum `end_index` found across all rows with >= 2 points?). Let's refine:
        *   Find the maximum column index (`max_end_col`) among all *last* non-white pixels across all rows in the input.
        *   For each row:
            *   Find non-white pixels.
            *   If >= 2 non-white pixels: `start_col` = first index, `end_col` = last index. Fill between `start_col` and `end_col`.
            *   If == 1 non-white pixel: `start_col` = the single index, `end_col` = `max_end_col`. Fill between `start_col` and `end_col`.
            *   If == 0 non-white pixels: do nothing.
        *   The fill color is always the color of the non-white pixel(s) in that row.

    Let's test this refined hypothesis with the metrics:
    *   Ex 1: `max_end_col` = 18. Rows 0, 3, 6 have >= 2 points, fill 7 to 18. Correct.
    *   Ex 2: `max_end_col` = 26. Row 0 has >= 2 points, fill 5 to 26. Correct. Row 1 has 1 point at 7, fill 7 to 26. Correct. Row 2 has 1 point at 23, fill 23 to 26. Correct. Row 3 has 1 point at 7, fill 7 to 26. Correct.
    *   Ex 3: `max_end_col` = 27. Row 0 has >= 2 points, fill 4 to 27. Correct. Row 1 has 1 point at 5, fill 5 to 27. **Output shows fill 5 to 26.** Hmm. Row 2 has 1 point at 25, fill 25 to 27. **Output shows fill 25 to 26.** Hmm. Row 3 has 1 point at 5, fill 5 to 27. **Output shows fill 5 to 26.** Row 4 has 1 point at 26, fill 26 to 27. **Output shows fill 26 to 26 (no fill).**

    **Revised Hypothesis:** The `end_col` is not simply the max across the grid. Maybe it's the max `end_col` from rows *with 2 or more points*?
    *   Ex 1: Max `end_col` from rows with >=2 points is 18. Works.
    *   Ex 2: Max `end_col` from rows with >=2 points is 26 (only Row 0). Works.
    *   Ex 3: Max `end_col` from rows with >=2 points is 27 (only Row 0). This still doesn't explain outputs for rows 1, 2, 3, 4.

    **Let's reconsider the definition of "between".** The initial code `output_grid[r, start_col + 1 : end_col] = fill_color` fills *strictly between*. The outputs look like they fill *inclusively* from `start_col` to `end_col`. Let's re-check outputs with this assumption.

    *   Ex 1: Row 0, Input [7, 18]. Output filled [7..18]. Correct.
    *   Ex 2: Row 0, Input [5, 26]. Output filled [5..26]. Correct. Row 1, Input [7]. Output filled [7..26]. Correct. Row 2, Input [23]. Output filled [23..26]. Correct. Row 3, Input [7]. Output filled [7..26]. Correct. (Using `max_end_col`=26 for single-point rows).
    *   Ex 3: Row 0, Input [4, 27]. Output filled [4..27]. Correct. Row 1, Input [5]. Output filled [5..26]. Row 2, Input [25]. Output filled [25..26]. Row 3, Input [5]. Output filled [5..26]. Row 4, Input [26]. Output filled [26..26]. (Outputs seem inconsistent with a single `max_end_col` rule).

    **What if the `end_col` for single-point rows is the `end_col` of the *nearest preceding row* that had >= 2 points?**
    *   Ex 3: Row 0 has `end_col`=27.
        *   Row 1 (point at 5): Nearest preceding row with >=2 points is Row 0, `end_col`=27. Fill 5 to 27. **Still doesn't match output [5..26].**

    **Final attempt hypothesis:** The process involves two passes or global information.
    1. Find all non-white points and their colors per row.
    2. Determine the overall maximum `end_col` across all rows (`global_max_end_col`).
    3. For each row:
        a. Find `start_col` (first non-white) and `local_end_col` (last non-white) *for that row*. If only one point, `start_col` = `local_end_col` = index. If no points, skip row.
        b. Determine the `fill_color` for the row (color of the first non-white pixel).
        c. Determine the `effective_end_col` for this row. If the row has >= 2 points, `effective_end_col` = `local_end_col`. If the row has 1 point, `effective_end_col` = `global_max_end_col`.
        d. Fill the output row from `start_col` *inclusive* to `effective_end_col` *inclusive* with `fill_color`.

    Testing this:
    *   Ex 1: `global_max_end_col`=18.
        *   Row 0: >=2 points. `start=7`, `local_end=18`. `effective_end=18`. Fill [7..18]. OK.
        *   Rows 1,2,4,5: Skip. OK.
        *   Row 3: >=2 points. `start=7`, `local_end=18`. `effective_end=18`. Fill [7..18]. OK.
        *   Row 6: >=2 points. `start=7`, `local_end=18`. `effective_end=18`. Fill [7..18]. OK.
    *   Ex 2: `global_max_end_col`=26.
        *   Row 0: >=2 points. `start=5`, `local_end=26`. `effective_end=26`. Fill [5..26]. OK.
        *   Row 1: 1 point. `start=7`, `local_end=7`. `effective_end=26`. Fill [7..26]. OK.
        *   Row 2: 1 point. `start=23`, `local_end=23`. `effective_end=26`. Fill [23..26]. OK.
        *   Row 3: 1 point. `start=7`, `local_end=7`. `effective_end=26`. Fill [7..26]. OK.
    *   Ex 3: `global_max_end_col`=27.
        *   Row 0: >=2 points. `start=4`, `local_end=27`. `effective_end=27`. Fill [4..27]. OK.
        *   Row 1: 1 point. `start=5`, `local_end=5`. `effective_end=27`. Fill [5..27]. **Output is [5..26] - FAIL.**
        *   Row 2: 1 point. `start=25`, `local_end=25`. `effective_end=27`. Fill [25..27]. **Output is [25..26] - FAIL.**
        *   Row 3: 1 point. `start=5`, `local_end=5`. `effective_end=27`. Fill [5..27]. **Output is [5..26] - FAIL.**
        *   Row 4: 1 point. `start=26`, `local_end=26`. `effective_end=27`. Fill [26..27]. **Output is [26..26] - FAIL.**

    There must be something specific about Ex 3. The output `end_col` for rows 1, 2, 3 seems to be 26, not 27. Why 26? Row 4's input is at index 26. Is the `global_max_end_col` adjusted somehow? Maybe the `global_max_end_col` is the maximum of the `local_end_col`s, *excluding* those rows where `start_col == local_end_col`?
    *   Ex 3 Recalculated:
        *   Row 0: start=4, end=27. Contributes 27 to max end.
        *   Row 1: start=5, end=5. Ignored for max end.
        *   Row 2: start=25, end=25. Ignored for max end.
        *   Row 3: start=5, end=5. Ignored for max end.
        *   Row 4: start=26, end=26. Ignored for max end.
        *   So, `global_max_end_col` = 27. This hypothesis also fails.

    Let's return to the basic idea: Fill from `start_col` to `end_col` *inclusively*.
    What determines `end_col`?
    It appears `end_col` for *every* row (that contains any non-white pixel) is the maximum `end_col` found across *all* rows.
    *   Ex 1: Max `end_col` is 18. All affected rows fill to 18.
    *   Ex 2: Max `end_col` is 26. All affected rows fill to 26.
    *   Ex 3: Max `end_col` is 27. All affected rows should fill to 27?
        *   Row 0: start=4, fill to 27. Matches output.
        *   Row 1: start=5, fill to 27. Output fills to 26.
        *   Row 2: start=25, fill to 27. Output fills to 26.
        *   Row 3: start=5, fill to 27. Output fills to 26.
        *   Row 4: start=26, fill to 27. Output fills to 26.

    **The inconsistency is in Example 3.** Is it possible the output shown for Example 3 is wrong, or there's a detail missed? Let's look *very* closely at Ex 3 Input/Output.
    Input:
    Row 0: 4 at 4, 4 at 27
    Row 1: 4 at 5
    Row 2: 4 at 25
    Row 3: 4 at 5
    Row 4: 4 at 26

    Output:
    Row 0: 4s from 4 to 27 (inclusive)
    Row 1: 4s from 5 to 26 (inclusive)
    Row 2: 4s from 25 to 26 (inclusive)
    Row 3: 4s from 5 to 26 (inclusive)
    Row 4: 4 at 26 (fill 26 to 26)

    It seems the target `end_col` is *not* the absolute maximum (27), but rather the maximum *relevant* end column, which appears to be 26 in this case. Why 26? It's the position of the rightmost point *that is not also the leftmost point in its row AND is not the absolute maximum*. This is getting complicated.

    Let's simplify again. Assume row-by-row processing.
    **Hypothesis - Fill Inclusively between first/last in row:**
    *   For each row:
        *   Find first non-white (`start_col`) and last non-white (`end_col`).
        *   If found (`start_col` exists):
            *   Get `fill_color` (from `start_col`).
            *   Fill output row from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) with `fill_color`.
        *   Else (all white): Copy row.

    Testing this simple hypothesis:
    *   Ex 1: Row 0: start=7, end=18. Fill [7..18]. OK. Rows 1,2,4,5: OK. Row 3: start=7, end=18. Fill [7..18]. OK. Row 6: start=7, end=18. Fill [7..18]. OK. **Matches Example 1.**
    *   Ex 2: Row 0: start=5, end=26. Fill [5..26]. OK. Row 1: start=7, end=7. Fill [7..7]. **Output shows [7..26] - FAIL.**
    *   Ex 3: Row 0: start=4, end=27. Fill [4..27]. OK. Row 1: start=5, end=5. Fill [5..5]. **Output shows [5..26] - FAIL.**

    This confirms global information (like the overall max end column) *is* necessary. The failure point is how that global information modifies the `end_col` for rows with only one point.

    **Refined Hypothesis 2 (incorporating global max end):**
    1. Find the maximum column index (`global_max_end_col`) where a non-white pixel occurs across the entire input grid.
    2. Create the output grid as a copy of the input.
    3. For each row `r`:
        a. Find the indices of all non-white pixels in the input row `r`.
        b. If any non-white pixels exist:
            i. `start_col` = index of the first non-white pixel.
            ii. `fill_color` = color of the pixel at `start_col`.
            iii. Fill the output row `r` from `start_col` (inclusive) to `global_max_end_col` (inclusive) with `fill_color`.

    Testing Refined Hypothesis 2:
    *   Ex 1: `global_max_end_col`=18.
        *   Row 0: start=7. Fill [7..18]. OK.
        *   Row 3: start=7. Fill [7..18]. OK.
        *   Row 6: start=7. Fill [7..18]. OK. **Matches Example 1.**
    *   Ex 2: `global_max_end_col`=26.
        *   Row 0: start=5. Fill [5..26]. OK.
        *   Row 1: start=7. Fill [7..26]. OK.
        *   Row 2: start=23. Fill [23..26]. OK.
        *   Row 3: start=7. Fill [7..26]. OK. **Matches Example 2.**
    *   Ex 3: `global_max_end_col`=27.
        *   Row 0: start=4. Fill [4..27]. OK.
        *   Row 1: start=5. Fill [5..27]. **Output is [5..26] - FAIL.**
        *   Row 2: start=25. Fill [25..27]. **Output is [25..26] - FAIL.**
        *   Row 3: start=5. Fill [5..27]. **Output is [5..26] - FAIL.**
        *   Row 4: start=26. Fill [26..27]. **Output is [26..26] - FAIL.**

    This hypothesis works for Ex1 and Ex2 but fails on Ex3. The `global_max_end_col` rule is too simple. What is special about column 27 in Ex3? It only appears in Row 0. The other points (5, 25, 26) appear in rows with only single points.

    Maybe the `global_max_end_col` is determined only from rows that have *more than one* non-white pixel?
    *   Ex 1: Rows 0, 3, 6 have end=18. `max_end_multi` = 18.
    *   Ex 2: Row 0 has end=26. `max_end_multi` = 26.
    *   Ex 3: Row 0 has end=27. `max_end_multi` = 27.
    This doesn't change the outcome for Ex3.

    Let's reconsider the Ex3 output again. Why does it stop at 26 for rows 1, 2, 3, 4? Index 26 is the `start_col` for row 4. Is it the maximum `start_col`? No, start=25 exists. Is it the maximum `local_end_col` among rows with only one point? Yes (Row 1 end=5, Row 2 end=25, Row 3 end=5, Row 4 end=26. Max is 26).

    **Refined Hypothesis 3 (Max End from Multi-Point OR Max End from Single-Point):**
    1. Find `max_end_multi`: the maximum `local_end_col` across all rows with >= 2 non-white points. (Set to -1 if no such rows).
    2. Find `max_end_single`: the maximum `local_end_col` across all rows with == 1 non-white point. (Set to -1 if no such rows).
    3. Determine the `effective_global_end_col = max(max_end_multi, max_end_single)`.
    4. Create the output grid as a copy of the input.
    5. For each row `r`:
        a. Find indices of non-white pixels.
        b. If any exist:
            i. `start_col` = first index.
            ii. `fill_color` = color at `start_col`.
            iii. Fill output row `r` from `start_col` to `effective_global_end_col` (inclusive) with `fill_color`.

    Testing Refined Hypothesis 3:
    *   Ex 1: `max_end_multi`=18. `max_end_single`=-1. `effective_global_end_col`=18. Fill uses 18. OK.
    *   Ex 2: `max_end_multi`=26. `max_end_single`=23 (from row 2). `effective_global_end_col`=26. Fill uses 26. OK.
    *   Ex 3: `max_end_multi`=27. `max_end_single`=26 (from row 4). `effective_global_end_col`=27. Fill uses 27. **Still predicts filling to 27, fails on rows 1-4.**

    The process must be simpler. What if the filling *only* happens between the first and last point *within a row*? That failed Ex2 and Ex3.

    Could the color matter? No, always seems to be the color already present.

    What if the rule is just: Fill from first non-white pixel *up to* the last non-white pixel *found anywhere in the grid*?
    This is Hypothesis 2, which failed Ex3.

    Let's look at the discrepancy in Ex3 again:
    Hypothesis 2 predicts fill [5..27] but output is [5..26] for row 1.
    Hypothesis 2 predicts fill [25..27] but output is [25..26] for row 2.
    Hypothesis 2 predicts fill [26..27] but output is [26..26] for row 4.

    The *only* difference between the prediction and output is column 27. Column 27 is white in the output for rows 1, 2, 3, 4, but colored in row 0.
    Maybe the rule is: Fill from `start_col` to `global_max_end_col`, *but* if the pixel at `global_max_end_col` in the *input* grid for that specific row was white (0), don't fill that last cell?

    **Refined Hypothesis 4 (Hypothesis 2 + End Condition):**
    1. Find `global_max_end_col`.
    2. Create output grid as copy of input.
    3. For each row `r`:
        a. Find non-white indices.
        b. If any exist:
            i. `start_col` = first index.
            ii. `fill_color` = color at `start_col`.
            iii. Determine fill range end: `current_end = global_max_end_col`.
            iv. Fill output row `r` from `start_col` (inclusive) to `current_end` (inclusive) with `fill_color`.
            v. **Check:** If the input grid pixel at `input[r, global_max_end_col]` was 0 (white), *and* `global_max_end_col > start_col`, then reset the output pixel `output[r, global_max_end_col]` back to 0 (white).

    Testing Refined Hypothesis 4:
    *   Ex 1: `global_max_end_col`=18.
        *   Row 0: start=7. Fill [7..18]. Input[0, 18]=6 (not white). No reset. OK.
        *   Row 3: start=7. Fill [7..18]. Input[3, 18]=6 (not white). No reset. OK.
        *   Row 6: start=7. Fill [7..18]. Input[6, 18]=6 (not white). No reset. OK. **Matches Example 1.**
    *   Ex 2: `global_max_end_col`=26.
        *   Row 0: start=5. Fill [5..26]. Input[0, 26]=3 (not white). No reset. OK.
        *   Row 1: start=7. Fill [7..26]. Input[1, 26]=0 (white). Reset output[1, 26] to 0. **Output shows 3 here - FAIL.**
    *   Ex 3: `global_max_end_col`=27.
        *   Row 0: start=4. Fill [4..27]. Input[0, 27]=4 (not white). No reset. OK.
        *   Row 1: start=5. Fill [5..27]. Input[1, 27]=0 (white). Reset output[1, 27] to 0. Output is [5..26]. OK.
        *   Row 2: start=25. Fill [25..27]. Input[2, 27]=0 (white). Reset output[2, 27] to 0. Output is [25..26]. OK.
        *   Row 3: start=5. Fill [5..27]. Input[3, 27]=0 (white). Reset output[3, 27] to 0. Output is [5..26]. OK.
        *   Row 4: start=26. Fill [26..27]. Input[4, 27]=0 (white). Reset output[4, 27] to 0. Output is [26..26]. OK. **Matches Example 3.**

    This hypothesis works for Ex1 and Ex3, but fails Ex2. The outputs are inconsistent with this simple end-condition check.

    What if the `end_col` used for filling is the `global_max_end_col`, unless the row itself contains the pixel at `global_max_end_col`, in which case the `end_col` is simply the `local_end_col` for that row? No, that would fail Ex 1 Row 0.

    Let's reconsider the structure. Is it about connecting points?
    In each row, connect the first point to the last point *in that row*.
    *Then*, for every point that is *not* a last point in its row, extend the line rightwards until it hits the column index equal to the `global_max_end_col`.

    **Refined Hypothesis 5 (Two-stage fill):**
    1. Find `global_max_end_col`.
    2. Initialize output grid as copy of input.
    3. **Stage 1: Local Fill**
       For each row `r`:
       a. Find non-white indices.
       b. If >= 1 index exists:
          i. `start_col` = first index.
          ii. `local_end_col` = last index.
          iii. `fill_color` = color at `start_col`.
          iv. Fill output row `r` from `start_col` to `local_end_col` (inclusive) with `fill_color`.
    4. **Stage 2: Global Extension**
       For each row `r`:
       a. Find non-white indices *in the input row*.
       b. If exactly 1 index exists OR (>=2 indices exist AND `local_end_col < global_max_end_col`):
          i. `current_fill_start` = `local_end_col + 1`. (Start filling after the local segment)
          ii. `fill_color` = color at `start_col`.
          iii. Fill output row `r` from `current_fill_start` to `global_max_end_col` (inclusive) with `fill_color`.

    Testing Refined Hypothesis 5:
    *   Ex 1: `global_max_end_col`=18.
        *   Row 0: Stage 1 fills [7..18]. `local_end`=18. Since `local_end == global_max_end_col`, Stage 2 does nothing. OK.
        *   Rows 3, 6 are same. OK. **Matches Example 1.**
    *   Ex 2: `global_max_end_col`=26.
        *   Row 0: Stage 1 fills [5..26]. `local_end`=26. Stage 2 does nothing. OK.
        *   Row 1: Stage 1 fills [7..7]. `local_end`=7. Stage 2 condition (1 point) met. Fill [8..26]. Combined: [7..26]. OK.
        *   Row 2: Stage 1 fills [23..23]. `local_end`=23. Stage 2 condition (1 point) met. Fill [24..26]. Combined: [23..26]. OK.
        *   Row 3: Stage 1 fills [7..7]. `local_end`=7. Stage 2 condition (1 point) met. Fill [8..26]. Combined: [7..26]. OK. **Matches Example 2.**
    *   Ex 3: `global_max_end_col`=27.
        *   Row 0: Stage 1 fills [4..27]. `local_end`=27. Stage 2 does nothing. OK.
        *   Row 1: Stage 1 fills [5..5]. `local_end`=5. Stage 2 condition (1 point) met. Fill [6..27]. Combined: [5..27]. **Output is [5..26] - FAIL.**

    This is remarkably close, but still fails Ex3. The only way Ex3 works is if the target end column for rows 1, 2, 3, 4 is 26, not 27. Why would 26 be chosen over 27?

    Could it be the maximum column index that contains a non-white color in *more than one* row?
    *   Ex 1: Col 7 (Rows 0,3,6), Col 18 (Rows 0,3,6). Max is 18. Matches `global_max_end_col`.
    *   Ex 2: Col 7 (Rows 1,3), Col 26 (Row 0). Max is 26. Matches `global_max_end_col`.
    *   Ex 3: Col 4 (Row 0), Col 5 (Rows 1,3), Col 25 (Row 2), Col 26 (Row 4), Col 27 (Row 0). None of these columns appear in more than one row except column 5. Max is 5. This doesn't work.

    Back to basics: What transformation achieves the exact results?
    - Find max end column index overall (`max_c`).
    - For each row:
        - Find first non-white index (`start_c`). If none, skip.
        - Color is `input[r, start_c]`.
        - Fill `output[r, start_c : max_c + 1]` with color.

    This was Hypothesis 2. It worked for 1 & 2. It failed Ex3 because it filled col 27 in rows 1-4.
    The *only* modification needed for Ex3 is to *not* fill column 27 in rows where the input was white at column 27.

    **Refined Hypothesis 6 (Hypothesis 2 + Selective End Fill):**
    1. Find `global_max_end_col`.
    2. Create output grid as copy of input.
    3. For each row `r`:
        a. Find non-white indices in the input row `r`.
        b. If any non-white pixels exist:
            i. `start_col` = index of the first non-white pixel.
            ii. `fill_color` = color of the pixel at `start_col`.
            iii. Fill the output row `r` from `start_col` (inclusive) up to `global_max_end_col` (exclusive) with `fill_color`. -> `output[r, start_col : global_max_end_col] = fill_color`
            iv. Explicitly set the pixel at the end column: `output[r, global_max_end_col] = fill_color`.

    Let's re-test Hypothesis 2 (Fill inclusively start to global_max_end) results:
    *   Ex 1: OK.
    *   Ex 2: OK.
    *   Ex 3:
        *   Row 0: Fills [4..27]. OK.
        *   Row 1: Fills [5..27]. Needs [5..26].
        *   Row 2: Fills [25..27]. Needs [25..26].
        *   Row 3: Fills [5..27]. Needs [5..26].
        *   Row 4: Fills [26..27]. Needs [26..26].

    The rule seems to be: Fill from `start_col` to `global_max_end_col` inclusive, UNLESS `start_col == global_max_end_col`, in which case only fill that single cell. AND if the `input[r, global_max_end_col]` was originally white, THEN the filling stops at `global_max_end_col - 1`.

    **Refined Hypothesis 7 (Combining conditions):**
    1. Find `global_max_end_col`.
    2. Initialize output grid as copy of input.
    3. For each row `r`:
        a. Find non-white indices in input row `r`.
        b. If any exist:
            i. `start_col` = first index.
            ii. `fill_color` = color at `start_col`.
            iii. Determine `effective_end_col` for this row:
                If `input[r, global_max_end_col] != 0`: # If the target end cell is already colored in input
                    `effective_end_col = global_max_end_col`
                Else: # Target end cell is white in input
                    `effective_end_col = global_max_end_col - 1`
            iv. Ensure `effective_end_col >= start_col`. If not, set `effective_end_col = start_col`.
            v. Fill `output[r, start_col : effective_end_col + 1]` with `fill_color`.

    Testing Refined Hypothesis 7:
    *   Ex 1: `global_max_end_col`=18.
        *   Row 0: `start=
