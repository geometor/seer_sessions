*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code incorrectly assumed the transformation involved filling the segment between the *first* and *last* occurrence of the non-white color in each row. The results clearly show that the transformation consistently fills the segment between the *first* and the *second* occurrence of the non-white color (inclusive) in each row. The strategy is to update the logic to identify the first two occurrences and fill the range between them.

*   **Gather Metrics:**
    Let's analyze the indices of the non-white pixels for each example.
