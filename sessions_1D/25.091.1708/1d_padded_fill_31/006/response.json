The results clearly show that the transformation consistently fills the segment between the *first* and the *second* occurrence of the non-white color (inclusive) in each row. The strategy is to update the logic to identify the first two occurrences and fill the range between them.\n\n*   **Gather Metrics:**\n    Let's analyze the indices of the non-white pixels for each example.\n    "
