task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D
grid_shape: (3, 29) # Observed in all examples
input_composition:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - foreground_pixels:
      color: single non-white color per grid (varies: 6, 3, 4)
      distribution: multiple pixels per row, aligned vertically across rows (same column indices contain the color in each row)
output_composition:
  - background_color: white (0) (outside the filled range in each row)
  - foreground_pixels:
      color: same as input foreground color
      distribution: contiguous horizontal segments in each row
transformation:
  scope: row-independent
  action_per_row:
    - find_color: Identify the non-white color (`fill_color`) present in the row. (Note: it's the same color for all rows in a grid).
    - find_indices: Locate the column index of the first (leftmost) occurrence and the last (rightmost) occurrence of `fill_color` within that row. Let these be `start_col` and `end_col`.
    - fill_segment: Change the color of all pixels in the current row between `start_col` (exclusive) and `end_col` (exclusive) to `fill_color`.
invariance:
  - grid dimensions (3x29)
  - row structure (transformation applied independently to each row)
  - color and position of the original non-white pixels in each row.
  - color of white pixels outside the `[start_col, end_col]` range in each row.
  - the non-white color used for filling is the same as the one present in the input.
