*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are both single rows (1D grids).
    *   Each input row contains mostly white pixels (0) and a few pixels of a single specific color (magenta, green, or yellow in the examples).
    *   The output row appears to be generated by filling the space *between* the first and last occurrence of the non-white color with that same color.
    *   The pixels outside the range defined by the first and last non-white pixel remain white.
    *   The original non-white pixels keep their positions and color.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    input_composition:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - foreground_pixels:
          count: multiple
          color: single non-white color (varies per example: 6, 3, 4)
          distribution: sparse
    output_composition:
      - background_color: white (0) (outside the filled range)
      - foreground_pixels:
          color: same as input foreground color
          distribution: contiguous block spanning from the first to the last input foreground pixel
    transformation:
      action: fill_segment
      target: white pixels (0)
      range: strictly between the first and last occurrence of the non-white color
      fill_color: the non-white color present in the input
    invariance:
      - grid dimensions
      - position and color of original non-white pixels
      - color of white pixels outside the identified range
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single non-white color (let's call it `fill_color`) present in the input row.
    2.  Find the index of the first (leftmost) pixel with `fill_color`. Store this as `start_index`.
    3.  Find the index of the last (rightmost) pixel with `fill_color`. Store this as `end_index`.
    4.  Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row.
    5.  Iterate through the indices `i` from `start_index + 1` up to `end_index - 1`.
    6.  For each index `i`, set the color of the pixel at position `i` in the output row to `fill_color`.
    7.  Return the modified output row.
