Analysis using the `code_execution` tool confirmed that:\n1.  The input/output examples provided are consistent with a grid size of 3x17 (not 3x21 as initially assumed based on a miscount).\n2.  The transformation rule derived previously (\"For each row, if it contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color, fill the horizontal segment between them (inclusive) with that color. Otherwise, keep the row as is.\") perfectly matches the input-output relationship for all three examples when applied to the correctly shaped 3x17 grids.\n3.  The failure reported in the execution log strongly suggests an issue with how the input data was passed to the `transform` function during the test (e.g., incorrect shape, wrong data type) or a subtle implementation bug, rather than an incorrect understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to proceed with the confirmed transformation rule, ensuring the implementation correctly handles the input grid format (assuming 3x17 or dynamically determined dimensions if necessary) and applies the row-wise filling logic as described. The Natural Language Program and Facts should be updated to reflect the confirmed grid dimensions and rule clarity.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe `code_execution` output provides detailed metrics:\n"
