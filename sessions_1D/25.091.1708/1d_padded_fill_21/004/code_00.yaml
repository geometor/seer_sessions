Task: Fill horizontal segments between specific pairs of pixels within each row.

Input_Format: Grid (List of Lists or Numpy Array), deduced to be 3x17 for training examples.

Output_Format: Grid of the same dimensions as the input.

Core_Objects:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns)
      - background_color: white (0)
  - type: Row
    properties:
      - index: integer
      - pixels: list of color values (integers 0-9)
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - location: (row_index, column_index)
  - type: Non_White_Pixel_Pair
    properties:
      - pixel1: Pixel
      - pixel2: Pixel
      - color: integer (must be the same for both pixels, and not white)
      - row_index: integer (must be the same for both pixels)
      - col1: integer (column index of pixel1)
      - col2: integer (column index of pixel2)

Relationships_Conditions:
  - Transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - A row is modified **if and only if**:
    1. It contains exactly two non-white pixels.
    2. These two non-white pixels have the identical color value.

Actions:
  - Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  - For each row:
    - Identify all non-white pixels (location and color).
    - Check if the conditions for modification (exactly two identical non-white pixels) are met.
    - If conditions met:
      - Identify the `fill_color` (the color of the pair).
      - Identify the `start_col` (minimum column index of the pair).
      - Identify the `end_col` (maximum column index of the pair).
      - In the output grid's corresponding row, set the color of all pixels from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
      - Pixels outside this range [start_col, end_col] in the row retain their original color.
    - If conditions not met:
      - Copy the row from the input grid to the output grid without changes.
