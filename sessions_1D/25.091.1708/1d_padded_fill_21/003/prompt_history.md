**Perception:**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation operates row by row. In rows containing exactly two non-white pixels of the same color, the segment of the row starting from the first non-white pixel and ending at the second non-white pixel (inclusive) is filled with that color. All other pixels, including those in rows that do not meet this specific condition (e.g., rows with zero, one, or more than two non-white pixels, or two non-white pixels of different colors), remain unchanged. The examples show this pattern with green (3) and orange (7) pixels against a white (0) background.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Fill horizontal segments between pairs of pixels.

Elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: integer
      - columns: integer
      - pixels: list of lists of integers (0-9)
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
  - type: Row
    properties:
      - index: integer
      - pixels: list of integers
      - non_white_pixels: list of Pixel objects or indices

Relationships:
  - Within each Row:
    - identify non_white_pixels.
    - count non_white_pixels.
    - check if all non_white_pixels have the same color.
  - Between Input and Output Grid:
    - Dimensions are identical.
    - Rows are processed independently.
    - Pixels are potentially modified based on row content.

Actions:
  - Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  - For each row:
    - Find all non-white pixels and their column indices.
    - Check conditions:
      - Exactly two non-white pixels exist.
      - Both non-white pixels have the same color.
    - If conditions met:
      - Determine the color (`fill_color`) and the start (`col1`) and end (`col2`) column indices of the pair.
      - Modify the row: Set the color of all pixels from `col1` to `col2` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
    - If conditions not met:
      - Keep the row unchanged.
  - Assemble the modified/unmodified rows into the output grid.

Derived_Properties:
  - Segment: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels within a row.
  - Segment_to_fill: The segment defined by the pair of identical non-white pixels in a qualifying row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Process the input grid row by row. For each row:
    a.  Identify the column indices and colors of all non-white pixels in the current row.
    b.  Count the number of non-white pixels found.
    c.  Check if the count is exactly two.
    d.  If the count is two, check if both non-white pixels have the same color.
    e.  **If both conditions (count is 2 AND colors are the same) are true:**
        i.  Determine the color of the pair (let's call it `fill_color`).
        ii. Identify the column indices of the two pixels (let's call them `col1` and `col2`, assuming `col1 < col2`).
        iii. Create a new version of the current row where all pixels from column `col1` to `col2` (inclusive) are set to `fill_color`. The pixels outside this range retain their original colors from the input row.
        iv. Place this modified row into the corresponding row index of the output grid.
    f.  **If either condition is false (count is not 2 OR colors are different):**
        i.  Copy the current row from the input grid directly into the corresponding row index of the output grid without modification.
3.  Return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The previous execution attempt failed because the transformation function returned the input unchanged for all examples. Analysis using the `code_execution` tool confirmed that:
1.  The input/output examples provided are consistent with a grid size of 3x17 (not 3x21 as initially assumed based on a miscount).
2.  The transformation rule derived previously ("For each row, if it contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color, fill the horizontal segment between them (inclusive) with that color. Otherwise, keep the row as is.") perfectly matches the input-output relationship for all three examples when applied to the correctly shaped 3x17 grids.
3.  The failure reported in the execution log strongly suggests an issue with how the input data was passed to the `transform` function during the test (e.g., incorrect shape, wrong data type) or a subtle implementation bug, rather than an incorrect understanding of the transformation rule.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to proceed with the confirmed transformation rule, ensuring the implementation correctly handles the input grid format (assuming 3x17 or dynamically determined dimensions if necessary) and applies the row-wise filling logic as described. The Natural Language Program and Facts should be updated to reflect the confirmed grid dimensions and rule clarity.

**Metrics:**

The `code_execution` output provides detailed metrics:
