Task: Fill horizontal segments between pairs of pixels.

Elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: integer
      - columns: integer
      - pixels: list of lists of integers (0-9)
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
  - type: Row
    properties:
      - index: integer
      - pixels: list of integers
      - non_white_pixels: list of Pixel objects or indices

Relationships:
  - Within each Row:
    - identify non_white_pixels.
    - count non_white_pixels.
    - check if all non_white_pixels have the same color.
  - Between Input and Output Grid:
    - Dimensions are identical.
    - Rows are processed independently.
    - Pixels are potentially modified based on row content.

Actions:
  - Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  - For each row:
    - Find all non-white pixels and their column indices.
    - Check conditions:
      - Exactly two non-white pixels exist.
      - Both non-white pixels have the same color.
    - If conditions met:
      - Determine the color (`fill_color`) and the start (`col1`) and end (`col2`) column indices of the pair.
      - Modify the row: Set the color of all pixels from `col1` to `col2` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
    - If conditions not met:
      - Keep the row unchanged.
  - Assemble the modified/unmodified rows into the output grid.

Derived_Properties:
  - Segment: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels within a row.
  - Segment_to_fill: The segment defined by the pair of identical non-white pixels in a qualifying row.
