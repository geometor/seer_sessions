In rows containing exactly two non-white pixels of the same color, the segment of the row starting from the first non-white pixel and ending at the second non-white pixel (inclusive) is filled with that color. All other pixels, including those in rows that do not meet this specific condition (e.g., rows with zero, one, or more than two non-white pixels, or two non-white pixels of different colors), remain unchanged. The examples show this pattern with green (3) and orange (7) pixels against a white (0) background.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
