            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis and the provided Python code correctly identified the core transformation: for each row, find the leftmost and rightmost pixels of a specific non-background color and fill the segment between them (inclusive) with that color.\n\nHowever, the execution results show a significant mismatch between the `Transformed Output` generated by the code and the `Expected Output`. Specifically, the `Transformed Output` seems to fill the row from the leftmost non-background pixel *to the end of the row*, rather than just to the rightmost non-background pixel.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests either:\n1.  A bug in the provided Python code's implementation of the slicing/filling logic.\n2.  An issue with the execution environment or how the output was captured/reported, leading to incorrect `Transformed Output` logs.\n3.  A misunderstanding of the grid dimensions, although the 3x21 assumption seems consistent across examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Verify the assumed grid dimensions (3x21) using code execution.\n2.  Re-run the core logic of the provided Python code within the `tool_code` environment on one example to see if it produces the `Expected Output` or the incorrect `Transformed Output` from the logs. This will help isolate whether the issue is in the code's logic or external factors.\n3.  Based on the verification, confirm or refine the Natural Language Program and Facts. If the code *does* produce the expected output under controlled execution, we will stick with the original hypothesis and assume the logs were faulty. If it produces the incorrect output, we need to debug the code logic itself.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
