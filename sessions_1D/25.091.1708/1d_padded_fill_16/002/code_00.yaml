task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  grid_dimensions: Variable, inferred from input (e.g., 8x9 in examples).
  background_color: 0 (white)
  processing_unit: Row

input_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height (e.g., 8)
      - width (e.g., 9)
      - pixels (list of lists)
  - type: row
    properties:
      - index
      - list_of_pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color_value
      - row_index
      - column_index

output_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - same height as input
      - same width as input
      - derived pixel values based on row transformation

    description: >
      For each row in the input grid, find the horizontal segment defined 
      by the leftmost and rightmost non-background pixels and fill that 
      segment with the non-background color.
    steps:
      - for each row in the input grid:
          - identify non_background_pixels (pixels with color != 0).
          - if no non_background_pixels exist in the row:
              - copy the row to the output grid unchanged (filled with background color).
          - if non_background_pixels exist:
              - determine the unique non_background_color C present in the row. 
                (Assumption: Only one non-background color per relevant row).
              - find the minimum column_index (min_col) of pixels with color C.
              - find the maximum column_index (max_col) of pixels with color C.
              - create the corresponding output row:
                  - fill pixels from column index min_col to max_col (inclusive) with color C.
                  - fill all other pixels in the row with the background_color (0).

relationships:
  - pixels within the same row.
  - leftmost non_background_pixel in a row.
  - rightmost non_background_pixel in a row.
  - horizontal segment between leftmost and rightmost pixels (inclusive).

assumptions:
  - Each relevant row (containing non-background pixels) contains only one type of non-background color.
  - The background color is always 0 (white).
  - Input grid dimensions can be inferred from the flattened representation and are consistent between input and output. The examples appear to use 8x9 grids.
