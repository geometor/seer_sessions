task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: 0 (white)
  processing_unit: Row

input_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height
      - width
  - type: row
    properties:
      - index
      - list_of_pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color_value
      - row_index
      - column_index

output_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - same height as input
      - same width as input
      - derived pixel values

transformation:
  - name: process_rows_independently
    steps:
      - for each row in the input grid:
          - identify non_background_pixels (color != 0)
          - if no non_background_pixels exist:
              - copy the row to the output grid unchanged
          - if non_background_pixels exist:
              - determine the unique non_background_color (assumption: only one per row)
              - find the minimum column_index (min_col) of pixels with this color
              - find the maximum column_index (max_col) of pixels with this color
              - create the output row:
                  - fill pixels from min_col to max_col (inclusive) with the non_background_color
                  - fill all other pixels in the row with the background_color (0)

relationships:
  - pixels within the same row
  - leftmost non_background_pixel in a row
  - rightmost non_background_pixel in a row
  - horizontal span between leftmost and rightmost pixels

assumptions:
  - Each row contains at most one type of non-background color.
  - The background color is always 0 (white).
