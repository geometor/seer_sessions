Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels, represented by numbers 0-9. In the examples provided, the grids appear to be 7 rows by 9 columns.
2.  **Color Usage:** Each example uses a single non-background color: magenta (6) in train_1, orange (7) in train_2, and azure (8) in train_3. The background is always white (0).
3.  **Transformation Locus:** The transformation seems to operate independently on each row of the grid. Rows without any non-background color remain unchanged (all white).
4.  **Core Logic:** For rows containing a non-background color, the transformation identifies the horizontal span occupied by that color. It finds the leftmost pixel and the rightmost pixel of that color within the row. Then, it fills all the pixels *between* these two endpoints (inclusive) with the same color.
5.  **Handling Single Pixels:** If a row contains only a single pixel of a non-background color (as seen in train_3 and one row of train_2), the leftmost and rightmost pixel are the same. Filling the span between them simply means keeping that single pixel as it is. The row effectively remains unchanged in this case.
6.  **Color Preservation:** The color used for filling is the same as the non-background color originally present in that row.
7.  **Background:** Pixels outside the filled horizontal span in a processed row become (or remain) the background color (white/0).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: 0 (white)
  processing_unit: Row

input_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height
      - width
  - type: row
    properties:
      - index
      - list_of_pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color_value
      - row_index
      - column_index

output_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - same height as input
      - same width as input
      - derived pixel values

transformation:
  - name: process_rows_independently
    steps:
      - for each row in the input grid:
          - identify non_background_pixels (color != 0)
          - if no non_background_pixels exist:
              - copy the row to the output grid unchanged
          - if non_background_pixels exist:
              - determine the unique non_background_color (assumption: only one per row)
              - find the minimum column_index (min_col) of pixels with this color
              - find the maximum column_index (max_col) of pixels with this color
              - create the output row:
                  - fill pixels from min_col to max_col (inclusive) with the non_background_color
                  - fill all other pixels in the row with the background_color (0)

relationships:
  - pixels within the same row
  - leftmost non_background_pixel in a row
  - rightmost non_background_pixel in a row
  - horizontal span between leftmost and rightmost pixels

assumptions:
  - Each row contains at most one type of non-background color.
  - The background color is always 0 (white).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (0).
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom (row index `r`).
3.  For the current row `r`:
    a.  Find all pixels in this row that are not the background color (0).
    b.  Check if any non-background pixels were found.
    c.  If non-background pixels exist:
        i.  Identify the color (`C`) of these non-background pixels (assuming only one non-background color `C` exists per row based on examples).
        ii. Find the column index of the leftmost pixel with color `C` in row `r`. Call this `min_col`.
        iii. Find the column index of the rightmost pixel with color `C` in row `r`. Call this `max_col`.
        iv. In the output grid, for the current row `r`, set the color of all pixels from column `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to `C`.
    d.  If no non-background pixels exist in the input row `r`, the corresponding row in the output grid remains filled with the background color (0) (as initialized).
4.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.
