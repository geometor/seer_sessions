            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels, represented by numbers 0-9. In the examples provided, the grids appear to be 7 rows by 9 columns.\n2.  **Color Usage:** Each example uses a single non-background color: magenta (6) in train_1, orange (7) in train_2, and azure (8) in train_3. The background is always white (0).\n3.  **Transformation Locus:** The transformation seems to operate independently on each row of the grid. Rows without any non-background color remain unchanged (all white).\n4.  **Core Logic:** For rows containing a non-background color, the transformation identifies the horizontal span occupied by that color. It finds the leftmost pixel and the rightmost pixel of that color within the row. Then, it fills all the pixels *between* these two endpoints (inclusive) with the same color.\n5.  **Handling Single Pixels:** If a row contains only a single pixel of a non-background color (as seen in train_3 and one row of train_2), the leftmost and rightmost pixel are the same. Filling the span between them simply means keeping that single pixel as it is. The row effectively remains unchanged in this case.\n6.  **Color Preservation:** The color used for filling is the same as the non-background color originally present in that row.\n7.  **Background:** Pixels outside the filled horizontal span in a processed row become (or remain) the background color (white/0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
