task_type: row_wise_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: true # Input and output grids have the same shape
  - background_color: 0 (white)
row_processing:
  - independent_rows: Each row is processed based only on its own content.
  - target_pixels: Non-white pixels (color C > 0) within the row.
objects_in_row:
  - item: non_white_pixel_sequence
    attributes:
      - color: C (unique within the row)
      - indices: [idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, ..., idx_n] (positions of color C)
transformation_logic:
  - type: segment_filling_by_pairing
  - steps:
      - for_each_row:
          - identify: non_white_color C (if any)
          - find: all indices [idx_1, ..., idx_n] of color C
          - pair_indices: create pairs (idx_1, idx_2), (idx_3, idx_4), ..., (idx_{n-1}, idx_n) if n is even, or (idx_1, idx_2), ..., (idx_{n-2}, idx_{n-1}) if n is odd. Ignore the last index if n is odd.
          - generate_output_row: start with a copy of the input row.
          - modify_output_row: for each pair (start_idx, end_idx), fill the range from start_idx to end_idx (inclusive) with color C.
assumptions:
  - Each row contains at most one non-white color.
  - If a row contains non-white pixels, there will be at least two to form a pair (implied by examples, might need re-evaluation if a test case violates this). Update: Examples show an even number of points always. Assume an even number of non-white pixels if any exist.
  - The transformation only fills; it does not remove existing non-white pixels.
relationships:
  - output_row depends only on input_row
  - filled_segments depend on paired indices of non_white_pixels
