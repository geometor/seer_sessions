*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output are presented as sequences (1D arrays) of integers representing colors. White (0) is the background color.
    *   Each input sequence contains multiple occurrences of a single non-white color (e.g., red=2, green=3). These non-white pixels are separated by white pixels.
    *   The transformation identifies the span covered by the non-white pixels.
    *   The output sequence fills the gap between the first and last non-white pixel with that same non-white color. Pixels outside this span remain white.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis, based on the first example, incorrectly assumed the transformation involved filling the entire span between the very first and very last non-white pixel in each row. The results across all three examples clearly show this is wrong. The transformed outputs incorrectly fill large continuous blocks, whereas the expected outputs show multiple, shorter filled segments within each row.

The consistent pattern across all examples suggests that the transformation identifies pairs of non-white pixels within each row and fills the space *between* each pair. The key is to correctly identify these pairs. It seems the non-white pixels are grouped sequentially (1st with 2nd, 3rd with 4th, etc.) to define the start and end points of the segments to be filled.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Refine Row Processing Logic:** Modify the algorithm to find *all* indices of the non-white color in a row.
2.  **Implement Pairing:** Group these indices into consecutive pairs.
3.  **Apply Fill Per Pair:** Iterate through the identified pairs and fill the segment between the start and end index of each pair in the output grid. Rows with fewer than two non-white pixels or only background pixels remain unchanged.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's re-examine the indices of the non-white pixels in each input row and the corresponding filled segments in the output rows.

The metrics confirm the revised hypothesis:

*   **Example 1:** Input indices (Red=2) are [2, 7, 13, 18, 24, 29]. Output segments are (2, 7), (13, 18), (24, 29). Pairs are (1st, 2nd), (3rd, 4th), (5th, 6th).
*   **Example 2:** Input indices (Green=3) are [4, 8, 15, 19, 26, 30]. Output segments are (4, 8), (15, 19), (26, 30). Pairs are (1st, 2nd), (3rd, 4th), (5th, 6th).
*   **Example 3:** Input indices (Red=2) are [0, 6, 11, 17, 22, 28]. Output segments are (0, 6), (11, 17), (22, 28). Pairs are (1st, 2nd), (3rd, 4th), (5th, 6th).

The transformation operates independently on each row by pairing consecutive non-white pixels of the same color and filling the span between them.

    attributes:
      - color: C (unique within the row)
      - indices: [idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, ..., idx_n] (positions of color C)
transformation_logic:
  - type: segment_filling_by_pairing
  - steps:
      - for_each_row:
          - identify: non_white_color C (if any)
          - find: all indices [idx_1, ..., idx_n] of color C
          - pair_indices: create pairs (idx_1, idx_2), (idx_3, idx_4), ..., (idx_{n-1}, idx_n) if n is even, or (idx_1, idx_2), ..., (idx_{n-2}, idx_{n-1}) if n is odd. Ignore the last index if n is odd.
          - generate_output_row: start with a copy of the input row.
          - modify_output_row: for each pair (start_idx, end_idx), fill the range from start_idx to end_idx (inclusive) with color C.
assumptions:
  - Each row contains at most one non-white color.
  - If a row contains non-white pixels, there will be at least two to form a pair (implied by examples, might need re-evaluation if a test case violates this). Update: Examples show an even number of points always. Assume an even number of non-white pixels if any exist.
  - The transformation only fills; it does not remove existing non-white pixels.
relationships:
  - output_row depends only on input_row
  - filled_segments depend on paired indices of non_white_pixels

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row `r` of the input grid.
3.  Initialize an empty list `non_white_indices`.
4.  Find the unique non-white color `C` present in row `r`. If no non-white color exists, continue to the next row.
5.  Find all column indices `j` where the pixel `input_grid[r, j]` has color `C` and add them to `non_white_indices`.
6.  Check if the number of indices found (`len(non_white_indices)`) is greater than or equal to 2.
7.  If yes, iterate through the `non_white_indices` list taking two indices at a time (index `k` and `k+1`, where `k` increments by 2: 0, 2, 4, ...).
    *   Let `start_col = non_white_indices[k]`.
    *   Let `end_col = non_white_indices[k+1]`.
    *   Iterate through all column indices `col` from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive).
    *   Set the pixel `output_grid[r, col]` to color `C`.
8.  After processing all rows, return the modified `output_grid`.
