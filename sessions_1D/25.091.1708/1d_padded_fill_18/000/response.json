The non-background pixels appear in distinct rows. The output grids retain the same dimensions as the input. The transformation operates row by row. For each row in the input grid that contains non-background pixels, the output grid fills the horizontal segment between the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of that non-background color in that row with the same color. Rows containing only the background color remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
