task_type: shape_completion / horizontal_line_drawing
scope: grid-wide_bounds, row-wise_application
objects:
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
  - type: primary_colored_pixel
    color: non-white (e.g., azure, blue, orange)
    properties:
      - is_unique_color: True (only one non-white color per grid)
      - location: (row_index, column_index)
  - type: horizontal_line_segment
    color: same as primary_colored_pixel
    properties:
      - row_index
      - start_column: global_min_col
      - end_column: global_max_col
actions:
  - identify_primary_color: C (the single non-white color in the input)
  - find_all_pixels_of_color_C
  - calculate_global_bounds:
      - find_min_column_index: global_min_col (across all pixels of color C)
      - find_max_column_index: global_max_col (across all pixels of color C)
  - identify_target_rows: Rows that contain at least one pixel of color C in the input.
  - draw_lines_in_output:
      - for_each_target_row:
          - fill_segment:
              from: (row_index, global_min_col)
              to: (row_index, global_max_col)
              color: C
relationships:
  - All non-white pixels in the input share the same color (primary_colored_pixel).
  - The horizontal extent (global_min_col, global_max_col) of the output lines depends on the column indices of *all* primary_colored_pixels in the input.
  - A line is drawn in an output row *if and only if* that same row contained at least one primary_colored_pixel in the input.
state_changes:
  - The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.
  - In the target rows, all pixels between global_min_col and global_max_col (inclusive) are changed to the primary_color C.
  - Rows not containing the primary_color in the input remain unchanged.
assumptions:
  - There is exactly one non-white color present in any given input grid.
  - There is at least one non-white pixel in the input grid.
