**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code failed because it incorrectly applied the filling logic on a row-by-row basis, calculating the minimum and maximum column extent *within each row* independently. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` (even with the formatting issues in the prompt's text representation) revealed that the filled segments in the output span a consistent range of columns across multiple rows. This suggests the horizontal extent is determined globally, not locally per row.

Furthermore, the code execution attempts highlighted severe inconsistencies and likely truncations in the text representations of the grids provided in the original prompt for both inputs and outputs. This makes direct numerical comparison based on those strings unreliable.

The strategy is to revise the transformation logic based on visual inspection of the examples and the identified failure mode of the previous code. The core idea is that the horizontal boundaries for filling are determined by the overall minimum and maximum column indices of the non-background color across the *entire* input grid, not just within individual rows. The filling operation is then applied only to those rows that originally contained the non-background color.

**Metrics (Based on Visual Interpretation and Initial Analysis):**

Since the provided grid strings are unreliable for code execution, metrics are based on the visual patterns and the previously extracted (but potentially inaccurate due to string issues) coordinates:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: Assumed 6x30 (based on input string length before error)
    *   Non-Background Color: Azure (8)
    *   Input Locations (approx): Rows 0-5 contain single Azure pixels.
    *   Inferred Global Min/Max Columns: Min Col ~9, Max Col ~28
    *   Output Pattern: Rows 0-5 (or at least those containing Azure initially) are filled with Azure between the global min/max columns.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 6x18
    *   Non-Background Color: Blue (1)
    *   Input Locations (approx): (0, 12), (1, 15), (2, 11), (3, 14), (4, 10), (5, 13)
    *   Inferred Global Min/Max Columns: Min Col 10, Max Col 15
    *   Output Pattern: Rows 0-5 are filled with Blue between columns 10 and 15.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 6x18
    *   Non-Background Color: Orange (7)
    *   Input Locations (approx): (0, 2), (1, 19), (2, 11), (3, 18), (4, 10), (5, 17)
    *   Inferred Global Min/Max Columns: Min Col 2, Max Col 19
    *   Output Pattern: Rows 0-5 are filled with Orange between columns 2 and 19.

```yaml
task_type: shape_completion / horizontal_line_drawing
scope: grid-wide_bounds, row-wise_application
objects:
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
  - type: primary_colored_pixel
    color: non-white (e.g., azure, blue, orange)
    properties:
      - is_unique_color: True (only one non-white color per grid)
      - location: (row_index, column_index)
  - type: horizontal_line_segment
    color: same as primary_colored_pixel
    properties:
      - row_index
      - start_column: global_min_col
      - end_column: global_max_col
actions:
  - identify_primary_color: C (the single non-white color in the input)
  - find_all_pixels_of_color_C
  - calculate_global_bounds:
      - find_min_column_index: global_min_col (across all pixels of color C)
      - find_max_column_index: global_max_col (across all pixels of color C)
  - identify_target_rows: Rows that contain at least one pixel of color C in the input.
  - draw_lines_in_output:
      - for_each_target_row:
          - fill_segment:
              from: (row_index, global_min_col)
              to: (row_index, global_max_col)
              color: C
relationships:
  - All non-white pixels in the input share the same color (primary_colored_pixel).
  - The horizontal extent (global_min_col, global_max_col) of the output lines depends on the column indices of *all* primary_colored_pixels in the input.
  - A line is drawn in an output row *if and only if* that same row contained at least one primary_colored_pixel in the input.
state_changes:
  - The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.
  - In the target rows, all pixels between global_min_col and global_max_col (inclusive) are changed to the primary_color C.
  - Rows not containing the primary_color in the input remain unchanged.
assumptions:
  - There is exactly one non-white color present in any given input grid.
  - There is at least one non-white pixel in the input grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0).
3.  If no non-white pixels are found, return the original input grid.
4.  Determine the single non-white color (`C`) present in the input grid.
5.  Find the column indices of all pixels with color `C`.
6.  Calculate the minimum (`global_min_col`) and maximum (`global_max_col`) of these column indices across the entire grid.
7.  Identify the set of unique row indices (`target_rows`) that contain at least one pixel of color `C` in the input grid.
8.  Iterate through each row index `r` from 0 to the grid height minus 1.
9.  If `r` is in the set `target_rows`:
    a.  In the output grid, change the color of all pixels in row `r` from column `global_min_col` to `global_max_col` (inclusive) to color `C`.
10. Return the modified output grid.
