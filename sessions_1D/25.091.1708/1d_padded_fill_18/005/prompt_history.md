*   **Perception**:
    The input grids are primarily composed of the background color white (0), with a few scattered pixels of a single non-background color (azure (8), blue (1), or orange (7) in the examples). The non-background pixels appear in distinct rows. The output grids retain the same dimensions as the input. The transformation operates row by row. For each row in the input grid that contains non-background pixels, the output grid fills the horizontal segment between the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of that non-background color in that row with the same color. Rows containing only the background color remain unchanged.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code failed because it incorrectly applied the filling logic on a row-by-row basis, calculating the minimum and maximum column extent *within each row* independently. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` (even with the formatting issues in the prompt's text representation) revealed that the filled segments in the output span a consistent range of columns across multiple rows. This suggests the horizontal extent is determined globally, not locally per row.

Furthermore, the code execution attempts highlighted severe inconsistencies and likely truncations in the text representations of the grids provided in the original prompt for both inputs and outputs. This makes direct numerical comparison based on those strings unreliable.

The strategy is to revise the transformation logic based on visual inspection of the examples and the identified failure mode of the previous code. The core idea is that the horizontal boundaries for filling are determined by the overall minimum and maximum column indices of the non-background color across the *entire* input grid, not just within individual rows. The filling operation is then applied only to those rows that originally contained the non-background color.

**Metrics (Based on Visual Interpretation and Initial Analysis):**

Since the provided grid strings are unreliable for code execution, metrics are based on the visual patterns and the previously extracted (but potentially inaccurate due to string issues) coordinates:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: Assumed 6x30 (based on input string length before error)
    *   Non-Background Color: Azure (8)
    *   Input Locations (approx): Rows 0-5 contain single Azure pixels.
    *   Inferred Global Min/Max Columns: Min Col ~9, Max Col ~28
    *   Output Pattern: Rows 0-5 (or at least those containing Azure initially) are filled with Azure between the global min/max columns.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 6x18
    *   Non-Background Color: Blue (1)
    *   Input Locations (approx): (0, 12), (1, 15), (2, 11), (3, 14), (4, 10), (5, 13)
    *   Inferred Global Min/Max Columns: Min Col 10, Max Col 15
    *   Output Pattern: Rows 0-5 are filled with Blue between columns 10 and 15.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 6x18
    *   Non-Background Color: Orange (7)
    *   Input Locations (approx): (0, 2), (1, 19), (2, 11), (3, 18), (4, 10), (5, 17)
    *   Inferred Global Min/Max Columns: Min Col 2, Max Col 19
    *   Output Pattern: Rows 0-5 are filled with Orange between columns 2 and 19.
