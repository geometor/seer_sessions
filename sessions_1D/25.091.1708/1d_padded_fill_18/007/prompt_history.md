*   **Perception**:
    The input grids are primarily composed of the background color white (0), with a few scattered pixels of a single non-background color (azure (8), blue (1), or orange (7) in the examples). The non-background pixels appear in distinct rows. The output grids retain the same dimensions as the input. The transformation operates row by row. For each row in the input grid that contains non-background pixels, the output grid fills the horizontal segment between the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of that non-background color in that row with the same color. Rows containing only the background color remain unchanged.

    relationships:
      - pixels within the same row
      - leftmost and rightmost colored pixels define the bounds of the filled segment in a row
    state_changes:
      - background_pixels within the identified horizontal segment [min_col, max_col] in a relevant row change to the colored_pixel_color C.
      - colored_pixels remain the same color.
      - background_pixels outside the identified segments remain white.
      - rows with only background_pixels remain unchanged.
    assumptions:
      - Within a single row containing colored pixels, all colored pixels share the same color.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    3.  For the current row, identify the indices of all columns containing non-white pixels.
    4.  If no non-white pixels are found in the current row, proceed to the next row.
    5.  If non-white pixels are found:
        a.  Determine the color (`C`) of the first non-white pixel encountered in the row (based on the assumption that all non-white pixels in a relevant row share the same color).
        b.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) among the non-white pixels in this row.
        c.  Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) among the non-white pixels in this row.
        d.  In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels from column `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to color `C`.
    6.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code attempted a transformation based on identifying a single non-white color (C), finding its global minimum and maximum column extent across the entire grid, and then applying this horizontal fill across all rows that originally contained C. The execution results show that this approach produced outputs that were significantly different from the expected outputs, specifically by filling much wider horizontal segments than intended in the target rows. The core error seems to be the assumption of using *global* column bounds derived from all instances of the color C. The expected outputs suggest that the filling bounds might be determined differently, possibly row-by-row or based on a subset of the colored pixels. The strategy will be to re-analyze the relationship between the input pixel locations and the output filled segments, focusing on how the `min_col` and `max_col` for filling are determined for each relevant row. The previous code's failure indicates the "global bounds" hypothesis derived from the initial analysis was incorrect, despite seeming correct after the grid dimension correction. Let's re-examine the first successful code's logic.

*   **Metrics:**
    The `code_execution` block was used to re-parse the grids assuming a 3x29 shape for all examples, derived from the output structure.

    
```
    Input 1 Shape: (3, 29)
    Output 1 Shape: (3, 29)
    Input 1: Color=8, MinCol=9, MaxCol=26, TargetRows=[0 1 2]
    Output 1: MinCol=9, MaxCol=26, TargetRows=[0 1 2]
    --------------------
    Input 2 Shape: (3, 29)
    Output 2 Shape: (3, 29)
    Input 2: Color=1, MinCol=12, MaxCol=25, TargetRows=[0 1 2]
    Output 2: MinCol=12, MaxCol=25, TargetRows=[0 1 2]
    --------------------
    Input 3 Shape: (3, 29)
    Output 3 Shape: (3, 29)
    Input 3: Color=7, MinCol=2, MaxCol=19, TargetRows=[0 1 2]
    Output 3: MinCol=2, MaxCol=19, TargetRows=[0 1 2]
    ```


    *   **Analysis:** This analysis confirms that for *these specific examples*, the filled horizontal segment in the output corresponds exactly to the global minimum and maximum column indices of the non-white color found anywhere in the input grid. The rows filled are precisely those rows that contained the non-white color in the input. This contradicts the failure report of the code which implemented this exact logic. There might be an issue with how the evaluation was performed or how the results were reported/interpreted previously. Given the metrics derived directly from the provided example data, the logic of using *global horizontal bounds* applied to *target rows* appears correct for these training examples. The initial "row-wise" interpretation (from the very first attempt) seems incorrect based on this data. The discrepancy lies between the reported failure of the second code attempt and the direct analysis of the input/output pairs provided here. Sticking to the evidence from the input/output pairs, the global bounds approach seems correct.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: shape_completion
    scope: grid-wide_bounds_row-specific_application # Bounds determined globally, applied row-wise
    objects:
      - type: background_pixel
        color: white (0)
      - type: primary_colored_pixel
        color: non-white (C) # Assumed single unique non-white color per grid
        properties:
          - grid_coordinates: (row, col) list
    actions:
      - find_primary_pixels: Locate all pixels with the non-white color C.
      - identify_primary_color: Determine the color C.
      - calculate_global_horizontal_bounds:
          find_min_column: Determine global_min_col (minimum column index among all primary pixels).
          find_max_column: Determine global_max_col (maximum column index among all primary pixels).
      - identify_target_rows: Find the set of unique row indices containing at least one primary pixel.
      - fill_segments_in_target_rows:
          Initialize output grid as a copy of input.
          For each row index r in target_rows:
            Fill the horizontal segment in the output grid:
              from: (r, global_min_col)
              to: (r, global_max_col)
              color: C
    state_changes:
      - Pixels within the segment [global_min_col, global_max_col] in target_rows change to color C in the output grid.
      - Pixels in rows without any primary color remain unchanged.
      - Pixels in target rows outside the segment [global_min_col, global_max_col] remain unchanged.
    assumptions:
      - There is exactly one non-white color present in the input grid.
      - The horizontal extent of the fill is determined by the leftmost and rightmost columns containing this color anywhere in the grid.
      - This fill is applied only to rows that originally contained at least one pixel of this color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    2.  Find the coordinates `(r, c)` of all non-white pixels in the input grid.
    3.  If no non-white pixels exist, return the initial output grid.
    4.  Determine the single non-white color `C` from these pixels.
    5.  Find the minimum column index (`global_min_col`) among all found non-white pixel coordinates.
    6.  Find the maximum column index (`global_max_col`) among all found non-white pixel coordinates.
    7.  Identify the set of unique row indices (`target_rows`) that contain at least one non-white pixel.
    8.  Iterate through each row index `r` present in `target_rows`.
    9.  For the current row `r` in the output grid, set the color of all pixels from column `global_min_col` to `global_max_col` (inclusive) to the color `C`.
    10. Return the modified output grid.
