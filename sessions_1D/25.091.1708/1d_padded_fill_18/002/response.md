*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code correctly identified the core concept of filling segments within rows based on non-white pixels. However, the implementation incorrectly filled the row from the leftmost non-white pixel (`min_col`) to the *end* of the row, rather than stopping at the rightmost non-white pixel (`max_col`). The analysis of the failed examples clearly shows this pattern: the filled segment in the `Transformed Output` extends further to the right than in the `Expected Output`. The strategy is to correct the description of the filling action to specify the correct endpoint (`max_col`) for the segment fill.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Let's examine the input and expected output for the first training example to confirm the expected range.
``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 1 Input
input_1_str = "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0"
input_1 = np.array([int(x) for x in input_1_str.split()]).reshape(3, 29)

# Example 1 Expected Output
output_1_str = "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0"
output_1 = np.array([int(x) for x in output_1_str.split()]).reshape(3, 29)

# Analyze Example 1
rows, cols = input_1.shape
print(f"Example 1 Dimensions: Rows={rows}, Cols={cols}")

for r in range(rows):
    row_input = input_1[r, :]
    non_white_indices = np.where(row_input != 0)[0]
    if len(non_white_indices) > 0:
        min_col = np.min(non_white_indices)
        max_col = np.max(non_white_indices)
        fill_color = row_input[min_col]
        print(f"  Row {r}: Non-white color={fill_color}, min_col={min_col}, max_col={max_col}")

        # Check expected output range
        expected_row_output = output_1[r, :]
        filled_indices_expected = np.where(expected_row_output == fill_color)[0]
        if len(filled_indices_expected) > 0:
             min_filled_expected = np.min(filled_indices_expected)
             max_filled_expected = np.max(filled_indices_expected)
             print(f"    Expected Output Fill Range: [{min_filled_expected}, {max_filled_expected}]")
        else:
             print(f"    Expected Output Row {r} has no color {fill_color}")

    else:
        print(f"  Row {r}: Only background color (0)")
```
```
Example 1 Dimensions: Rows=3, Cols=29
  Row 0: Non-white color=8, min_col=9, max_col=26
    Expected Output Fill Range: [9, 26]
  Row 1: Non-white color=8, min_col=9, max_col=26
    Expected Output Fill Range: [9, 26]
  Row 2: Non-white color=8, min_col=9, max_col=26
    Expected Output Fill Range: [9, 26]

```
The metrics confirm that for each row containing a non-white pixel (azure, 8), the task is to fill the segment starting from the minimum column index (`min_col`) where the color appears and ending at the maximum column index (`max_col`) where the color appears in that same row. The previous code incorrectly filled from `min_col` to the end of the row (`cols - 1`).

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: shape_completion
    scope: row-wise
    objects:
      - type: background_pixel
        color: white (0)
      - type: colored_pixel
        color: non-white (e.g., azure, blue, orange)
        properties:
          - row_index
          - column_index
    actions:
      - identify_rows_with_colored_pixels
      - for_each_identified_row:
          - find_colored_pixel_color: C
          - find_min_column_index: min_col
          - find_max_column_index: max_col
          - fill_horizontal_segment_in_output: # Action clarified
              row: row_index
              start_col: min_col             # Endpoint corrected
              end_col: max_col               # Endpoint corrected
              color: C
    relationships:
      - pixels within the same row
      - leftmost (min_col) and rightmost (max_col) colored pixels define the bounds of the filled segment in a row
    state_changes:
      - background_pixels within the identified horizontal segment [min_col, max_col] in a relevant row change to the colored_pixel_color C in the output grid.
      - colored_pixels remain the same color within the segment [min_col, max_col].
      - all pixels outside the segment [min_col, max_col] in relevant rows remain unchanged from the input grid (including colored pixels outside the range if they existed, though not seen in examples).
      - rows with only background_pixels remain unchanged.
    assumptions:
      - Within a single row containing colored pixels, all colored pixels share the same color. (This holds for the examples).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid using its index (`row_index`).
    3.  For the current row, find the column indices of all non-white pixels.
    4.  If no non-white pixels are found in the current row, continue to the next row.
    5.  If non-white pixels are found:
        a.  Determine the color (`C`) of the non-white pixels in that row (using the color of the first one found).
        b.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) among these non-white pixels.
        c.  Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) among these non-white pixels.
        d.  In the output grid, update the corresponding row (`row_index`) by setting the color of all pixels from column `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to color `C`.
    6.  After iterating through all rows, return the modified output grid.
