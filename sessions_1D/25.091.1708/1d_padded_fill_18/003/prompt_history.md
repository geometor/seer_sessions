*   **Perception**:
    The input grids are primarily composed of the background color white (0), with a few scattered pixels of a single non-background color (azure (8), blue (1), or orange (7) in the examples). The non-background pixels appear in distinct rows. The output grids retain the same dimensions as the input. The transformation operates row by row. For each row in the input grid that contains non-background pixels, the output grid fills the horizontal segment between the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of that non-background color in that row with the same color. Rows containing only the background color remain unchanged.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code correctly identified the core concept of filling segments within rows based on non-white pixels. However, the implementation incorrectly filled the row from the leftmost non-white pixel (`min_col`) to the *end* of the row, rather than stopping at the rightmost non-white pixel (`max_col`). The analysis of the failed examples clearly shows this pattern: the filled segment in the `Transformed Output` extends further to the right than in the `Expected Output`. The strategy is to correct the description of the filling action to specify the correct endpoint (`max_col`) for the segment fill.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Let's examine the input and expected output for the first training example to confirm the expected range.

    else:
        print(f"  Row {r}: Only background color (0)")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Example 1 Dimensions: Rows=3, Cols=29
  Row 0: Non-white color=8, min_col=9, max_col=26
    Expected Output Fill Range: [9, 26]
  Row 1: Non-white color=8, min_col=9, max_col=26
    Expected Output Fill Range: [9, 26]
  Row 2: Non-white color=8, min_col=9, max_col=26
    Expected Output Fill Range: [9, 26]

```
The metrics confirm that for each row containing a non-white pixel (azure, 8), the task is to fill the segment starting from the minimum column index (`min_col`) where the color appears and ending at the maximum column index (`max_col`) where the color appears in that same row. The previous code incorrectly filled from `min_col` to the end of the row (`cols - 1`).
