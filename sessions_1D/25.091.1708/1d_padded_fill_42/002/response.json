            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code execution revealed that the first hypothesis was too broad. The code filled segments between *all* pairs of identical non-white pixels, leading to overfilling compared to the expected outputs. The analysis of the failed examples showed that only specific segments between identical non-white pixels should be filled.\n\nComparing the input and output grids across examples revealed a more nuanced pattern:\n1.  The filling operation happens row by row.\n2.  For a given non-white color `C` in a row, we need to consider its locations (column indices).\n3.  Sorting these indices, we look at *adjacent* pairs `(index[i], index[i+1])`.\n4.  A segment between an adjacent pair is a candidate for filling *only if* all pixels between them in the input grid are white (0).\n5.  Among these candidates, only those corresponding to an *even* pair index (`i = 0, 2, 4, ...`) are actually filled.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the algorithm to incorporate these constraints: identify adjacent pairs of the same color, check if the intervening segment is purely white, and apply the fill only for the 0th, 2nd, 4th, etc., such pairs found for each color in each row.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n| Example | Color | Input Indices     | Adjacent Pairs `(i: col1, col2)` | Segment White? | Fill Condition `(White & i%2==0)` | Output Filled Segments | Matches? |\n| :------ | :---- | :---------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------- |\n| Train 1 | 5     | `[1,5,11,15,21,25]` | `(0: 1,5)` `(1: 5,11)` `(2: 11,15)` `(3: 15,21)` `(4: 21,25)` | Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes          | `(i=0): Yes` `(i=1): No` `(i=2): Yes` `(i=3): No` `(i=4): Yes` | `(1,5), (11,15), (21,25)` | Yes      |\n| Train 2 | 4     | `[1,4,11,14,21,24]` | `(0: 1,4)` `(1: 4,11)` `(2: 11,14)` `(3: 14,21)` `(4: 21,24)` | Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes          | `(i=0): Yes` `(i=1): No` `(i=2): Yes` `(i=3): No` `(i=4): Yes` | `(1,4), (11,14), (21,24)` | Yes      |\n| Train 3 | 5     | `[0,5,10,15,20,25]` | `(0: 0,5)` `(1: 5,10)` `(2: 10,15)` `(3: 15,20)` `(4: 20,25)` | Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes          | `(i=0): Yes` `(i=1): No` `(i=2): Yes` `(i=3): No` `(i=4): Yes` | `(0,5), (10,15), (20,25)` | Yes      |\n\n*(Note: Output Filled Segments column refers to the range between the bounding indices, e.g., `(1,5)` means columns 2, 3, 4 were filled).*\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
