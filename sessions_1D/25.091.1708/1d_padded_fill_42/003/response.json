Create an output grid identical to the input grid.\n2.  Go through each row of the grid one by one.\n3.  For the current row being processed:\n    a.  Find every distinct non-white color (`C`) that appears in this row of the input grid.\n    b.  For each distinct non-white color `C`:\n        i.  Make a list of the column numbers where `C` is located in the input row, and sort this list in increasing order. Call it `indices`.\n        ii. If there are two or more locations for `C` (the list `indices` has at least two numbers):\n            1.  Look at pairs of consecutive locations from the sorted list: the first and second (`indices[0]`, `indices[1]`), the second and third (`indices[1]`, `indices[2]`), and so on, up to the second-to-last and last (`indices[n-1]`, `indices[n]`). Keep track of the position of each pair in this sequence (0th pair, 1st pair, 2nd pair, etc.). Let the pair be `(col1, col2)` and its position index be `i`.\n            2.  For each pair `(col1, col2)`: Check if all the pixels in the *input* row strictly between `col1` and `col2` (from column `col1 + 1` up to `col2 - 1`) are white (color 0).\n            3.  If they *are* all white, *and* if the position index `i` of this pair is an even number (0, 2, 4, ...), then change the color of the pixels in the *output* row from column `col1 + 1` to `col2 - 1` (inclusive) to color `C`.\n4.  After processing all rows, return the final output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills alternating horizontal gaps between adjacent same-colored pixels if the gap is white.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to a NumPy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    height, width = grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each row of the grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        # Extract the current row from the *original* input grid \n        # This is important because decisions are based on the input state\n        row_data = grid[r, :] \n        \n        # Find unique non-white colors (anything other than 0) in this row\n        unique_colors = np.unique(row_data)\n        non_white_colors = unique_colors[unique_colors != 0]\n\n        # Process each unique non-white color found in the row\n        for color in non_white_colors:\n            # Find the column indices where this color appears in the original row\n            # np.where returns a tuple, we need the first element (the array of indices)\n            indices = np.where(row_data == color)[0] \n            \n            # Sort indices just in case np.where doesn't guarantee order (though it usually does)\n            indices.sort() \n\n            # We need at least two points to form segments between them\n            if len(indices) >= 2:\n                # Iterate through adjacent pairs of indices\n                # The loop goes up to len(indices) - 1 because each i uses indices[i] and indices[i+1]\n                for i in range(len(indices) - 1):\n                    col1 = indices[i]\n                    col2 = indices[i+1]\n\n                    # Check if there is actually a gap between the two pixels\n                    if col2 > col1 + 1:\n                        # Extract the segment between col1 and col2 (exclusive) from the original row data\n                        segment = row_data[col1 + 1 : col2]\n                        \n                        # Check if the segment contains only white pixels (0)\n                        is_segment_white = np.all(segment == 0)\n                        \n                        # Check if the pair index 'i' is even (0th pair, 2nd pair, etc.)\n                        is_pair_index_even = (i % 2 == 0)\n                        \n                        # If the segment is all white AND it's an even-indexed pair, fill the gap in the output grid\n                        if is_segment_white and is_pair_index_even:\n                            # Fill the segment in the output grid between col1 and col2 (exclusive) \n                            # with the current color.
