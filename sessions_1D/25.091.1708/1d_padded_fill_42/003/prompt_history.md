*   **Perception:**
    The input and output are single-row grids (1x30). Each input grid contains white pixels (0) and pixels of one other color (gray (5) or yellow (4)). These non-white pixels appear multiple times, seemingly in pairs, separated by white pixels. The output grid maintains the original non-white pixels and fills the white pixels located horizontally between pairs of identical non-white pixels with that same non-white color. The transformation acts independently on each row (though all examples are single-row) and for each distinct non-white color present.

*   **Facts:**

      input_composition: Primarily white pixels (0) with sparse occurrences of one or more non-white colors.
      output_composition: Similar to input, but white pixels between pairs of identical non-white pixels on the same row are filled with that non-white color.

        - For each unique non_white_color C:
          - Find all column indices `cols` where color C exists in the current row.

          - For each pair `(col1, col2)`:
            - Fill the pixels in the output grid at the current row, between columns `col1` and `col2` (exclusive), with color C.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code execution revealed that the first hypothesis was too broad. The code filled segments between *all* pairs of identical non-white pixels, leading to overfilling compared to the expected outputs. The analysis of the failed examples showed that only specific segments between identical non-white pixels should be filled.

Comparing the input and output grids across examples revealed a more nuanced pattern:
1.  The filling operation happens row by row.
2.  For a given non-white color `C` in a row, we need to consider its locations (column indices).
3.  Sorting these indices, we look at *adjacent* pairs `(index[i], index[i+1])`.
4.  A segment between an adjacent pair is a candidate for filling *only if* all pixels between them in the input grid are white (0).
5.  Among these candidates, only those corresponding to an *even* pair index (`i = 0, 2, 4, ...`) are actually filled.

The strategy is to refine the algorithm to incorporate these constraints: identify adjacent pairs of the same color, check if the intervening segment is purely white, and apply the fill only for the 0th, 2nd, 4th, etc., such pairs found for each color in each row.

**Metrics:**

| Example | Color | Input Indices     | Adjacent Pairs `(i: col1, col2)` | Segment White? | Fill Condition `(White & i%2==0)` | Output Filled Segments | Matches? |
| :------ | :---- | :---------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------- |

| Train 2 | 4     | `[1,4,11,14,21,24]` | `(0: 1,4)` `(1: 4,11)` `(2: 11,14)` `(3: 14,21)` `(4: 21,24)` | Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes          | `(i=0): Yes` `(i=1): No` `(i=2): Yes` `(i=3): No` `(i=4): Yes` | `(1,4), (11,14), (21,24)` | Yes      |
| Train 3 | 5     | `[0,5,10,15,20,25]` | `(0: 0,5)` `(1: 5,10)` `(2: 10,15)` `(3: 15,20)` `(4: 20,25)` | Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes          | `(i=0): Yes` `(i=1): No` `(i=2): Yes` `(i=3): No` `(i=4): Yes` | `(0,5), (10,15), (20,25)` | Yes      |

*(Note: Output Filled Segments column refers to the range between the bounding indices, e.g., `(1,5)` means columns 2, 3, 4 were filled).*

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid identical to the input grid.
2.  Go through each row of the grid one by one.
3.  For the current row being processed:
    a.  Find every distinct non-white color (`C`) that appears in this row of the input grid.
    b.  For each distinct non-white color `C`:
        i.  Make a list of the column numbers where `C` is located in the input row, and sort this list in increasing order. Call it `indices`.
        ii. If there are two or more locations for `C` (the list `indices` has at least two numbers):
            1.  Look at pairs of consecutive locations from the sorted list: the first and second (`indices[0]`, `indices[1]`), the second and third (`indices[1]`, `indices[2]`), and so on, up to the second-to-last and last (`indices[n-1]`, `indices[n]`). Keep track of the position of each pair in this sequence (0th pair, 1st pair, 2nd pair, etc.). Let the pair be `(col1, col2)` and its position index be `i`.
            2.  For each pair `(col1, col2)`: Check if all the pixels in the *input* row strictly between `col1` and `col2` (from column `col1 + 1` up to `col2 - 1`) are white (color 0).
            3.  If they *are* all white, *and* if the position index `i` of this pair is an even number (0, 2, 4, ...), then change the color of the pixels in the *output* row from column `col1 + 1` to `col2 - 1` (inclusive) to color `C`.
4.  After processing all rows, return the final output grid.
