Transforms the input grid by filling alternating horizontal gaps composed entirely of white pixels between adjacent occurrences of the same non-white color.

1.  Create an output grid identical to the input grid.
2.  Go through each row of the grid one by one.
3.  For the current row being processed:
    a.  Find every distinct non-white color (`C`) that appears in this row of the input grid.
    b.  For each distinct non-white color `C`:
        i.  Make a list of the column numbers where `C` is located in the input row, and sort this list in increasing order. Call it `indices`.
        ii. If there are two or more locations for `C` (the list `indices` has at least two numbers):
            1.  Look at pairs of consecutive locations from the sorted list: the first and second (`indices[0]`, `indices[1]`), the second and third (`indices[1]`, `indices[2]`), and so on, up to the second-to-last and last (`indices[n-1]`, `indices[n]`). Keep track of the position of each pair in this sequence (0th pair, 1st pair, 2nd pair, etc.). Let the pair be `(col1, col2)` and its position index be `i`.
            2.  For each pair `(col1, col2)`: Check if all the pixels in the *input* row strictly between `col1` and `col2` (from column `col1 + 1` up to `col2 - 1`) are white (color 0).
            3.  If they *are* all white, *and* if the position index `i` of this pair is an even number (0, 2, 4, ...), then change the color of the pixels in the *output* row from column `col1 + 1` to `col2 - 1` (inclusive) to color `C`.
4.  After processing all rows, return the final output grid.
