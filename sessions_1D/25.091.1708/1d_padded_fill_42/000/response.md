*   **Perception:**
    The input and output are single-row grids (1x30). Each input grid contains white pixels (0) and pixels of one other color (gray (5) or yellow (4)). These non-white pixels appear multiple times, seemingly in pairs, separated by white pixels. The output grid maintains the original non-white pixels and fills the white pixels located horizontally between pairs of identical non-white pixels with that same non-white color. The transformation acts independently on each row (though all examples are single-row) and for each distinct non-white color present.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_dimensionality: 2D # Even though examples are 1D, the rule should generalize
      grid_size: variable, examples are 1x30
      input_composition: Primarily white pixels (0) with sparse occurrences of one or more non-white colors.
      output_composition: Similar to input, but white pixels between pairs of identical non-white pixels on the same row are filled with that non-white color.

    elements:
      - object: pixel
        properties:
          - color: (0-9)
          - position: (row, column)
      - object: row
        properties:
          - pixels: ordered list of pixels

    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: Pixels are arranged in rows and columns.
      - type: pairing
        description: Pixels of the same non-white color within the same row can form pairs based on their column indices.
      - type: containment
        description: White pixels can be located horizontally between a pair of non-white pixels of the same color.

    actions:
      - name: identify_pairs
        input: row, non_white_color
        output: list of column index pairs (col1, col2) where col1 < col2 and the pixel color at (row, col1) and (row, col2) matches non_white_color.
      - name: fill_between
        input: row, column_pair (col1, col2), fill_color
        output: modified row where pixels at (row, j) for col1 < j < col2 are changed to fill_color.
        condition: Applies only to pixels that were originally white (0). However, simply overwriting seems sufficient based on examples, as only white pixels are between the pairs.

    transformation:
      description: Fill horizontal gaps between same-colored anchors.
      steps:
        - Iterate through each row of the input grid.
        - For each row, identify unique non-white colors present.
        - For each unique non_white_color C:
          - Find all column indices `cols` where color C exists in the current row.
          - Generate all pairs of indices `(col1, col2)` from `cols` such that `col1 < col2`.
          - For each pair `(col1, col2)`:
            - Fill the pixels in the output grid at the current row, between columns `col1` and `col2` (exclusive), with color C.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2.  Process the grid row by row. For each row:
        a.  Find all unique non-white colors present in that row.
        b.  For each unique non-white color `C` identified:
            i.  Find the column indices of all pixels that have color `C` in the current row.
            ii. If there are at least two pixels of color `C`:
                1.  Consider every distinct pair of these column indices, `(col1, col2)`, where `col1` is less than `col2`.
                2.  For each such pair, change the color of all pixels in the output grid located at the current row and at columns strictly between `col1` and `col2` to color `C`.
    3.  Return the modified output grid.
