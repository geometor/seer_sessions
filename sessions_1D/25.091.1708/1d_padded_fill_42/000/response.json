These non-white pixels appear multiple times, seemingly in pairs, separated by white pixels. The output grid maintains the original non-white pixels and fills the white pixels located horizontally between pairs of identical non-white pixels with that same non-white color. The transformation acts independently on each row (though all examples are single-row) and for each distinct non-white color present.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
