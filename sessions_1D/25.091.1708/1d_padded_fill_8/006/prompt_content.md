```python
"""
Processes each row of an input grid independently. 
If a row contains exactly two non-white pixels (pixels with color > 0) of the same color, it fills the horizontal segment between these two pixels (inclusive) with that color. 
Otherwise, the row remains unchanged.

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Applies a row-wise segment filling transformation to the input grid.

    For each row, it identifies non-white pixels. If exactly two such pixels
    exist and share the same color, the horizontal span between them (inclusive)
    in the output grid row is filled with that color. Otherwise, the row
    is copied unchanged from the input to the output.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): A 2D list representing the input grid where
                                     each inner list is a row and values are integers 0-9.
