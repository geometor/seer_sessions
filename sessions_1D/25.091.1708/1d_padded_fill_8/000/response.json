By analyzing the length of the strings and the visual pattern in the output, we can infer the dimensions.\n    *   Example 1: Input/Output length 69 suggests 3x23 grids.\n    *   Example 2: Input/Output length 65 suggests 5x13 grids.\n    *   Example 3: Input/Output length 69 suggests 3x23 grids.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary background color is white (0). Each example features a single foreground color: green (3) in example 1, orange (7) in example 2, and yellow (4) in example 3.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** In each example, some rows contain exactly two pixels of the foreground color, separated by white pixels. Other rows might contain only white pixels.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** Rows containing only white pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output. Rows that contained two pixels of the foreground color in the input now have a solid horizontal line segment of that same foreground color connecting the original positions of the two pixels (inclusive).\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core operation appears to be identifying rows with exactly two non-white pixels (which happen to be the same color in all examples) and filling the horizontal space between them (inclusive) with that color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
