rules:

    conditions:
      - property: count(non_white_pixels_in_row)

        target: pixels in the row between min_col_index and max_col_index (inclusive)
        value: color of the non-white pixels
  - description: Rows not meeting the conditions remain unchanged.
    conditions:
      - property: count(non_white_pixels_in_row) != 2
        # OR potentially color(pixel1) != color(pixel2) if that case existed

derived_properties:
  - segment: horizontal line segment defined by two endpoint pixels of the same color in a row.
