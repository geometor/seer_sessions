task_description: Fill horizontal segments defined by pairs of pixels in a grid.
grid_properties:
  - transformation_scope: row-wise
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - foreground_colors: variable (one per example: 3-green, 7-orange, 4-yellow)
objects:
  - type: pixel_pair
    definition: Two pixels within the same row having the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: C (where C > 0)
      - row_index: r
      - column_indices: [col1, col2]
  - type: horizontal_segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels within a single row.
actions:
  - name: identify_pixel_pairs
    input: input_grid_row
    output: list_of_pixel_pairs (or empty list)
    condition: Each row is checked independently. Find all non-white pixels. If exactly two are found and they share the same color, they form a pixel_pair.
  - name: fill_segment
    input: pixel_pair
    output: modified_output_grid_row
    condition: A pixel_pair exists for the row.
    effect: In the corresponding output grid row, set the color of all pixels between min(col1, col2) and max(col1, col2) (inclusive) to the color C of the pixel_pair.
  - name: copy_row
    input: input_grid_row
    output: identical_output_grid_row
    condition: No pixel_pair is identified for the row.
    effect: The output grid row is identical to the input grid row.
