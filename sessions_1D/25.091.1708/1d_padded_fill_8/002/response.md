**General Assessment & Strategy**

The previous attempt failed because the input data was provided as a flattened string, while the transformation logic assumed a 2D grid structure (like a list of lists or a 2D NumPy array). The code executed, but because the input structure was incorrect (likely treated as a 1D array), the row-based analysis (`np.where(row != 0)`, `output_array[r, col_start : col_end + 1] = color1`) did not operate as intended on the visual rows of the grid.

The strategy is to:
1.  Recognize that the input strings represent 2D grids.
2.  Determine the correct dimensions (height and width) for each input grid. This might involve inferring from the output dimensions, finding factors of the input length, or assuming a standard way dimensions are provided.
3.  Reshape the flattened input into the correct 2D structure *before* applying the transformation logic.
4.  The core transformation logic identified previously (find rows with exactly two identical non-white pixels and fill the segment between them) appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples and should work once applied to the correctly structured input.

**Correction on Metrics:** The tool code execution revealed an error in my manual calculation for Example 2. The input/output strings actually have length 69, not 65. The visual structure in the prompt for Example 2 might be misleading, or there's an inconsistency. Let's recalculate based on length 69. Factors of 69 are 1, 3, 23, 69. A 3x23 grid seems most plausible, matching Examples 1 and 3. Let's re-run analysis for Example 2 with 3x23 dimensions.
