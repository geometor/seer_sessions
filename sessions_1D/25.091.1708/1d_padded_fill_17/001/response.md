"""
Fill horizontal gaps between specific pairs of non-white pixels.

1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2. For each row in the input grid:
    a. Identify all non-white pixels in that row.
    b. Group the column indices of these non-white pixels based on their color.
    c. For each distinct non-white color `C` present in the row:
        i. Retrieve the sorted list of column indices `cols = [c1, c2, c3, c4, ...]` where pixels have color `C`.
        ii. Iterate through this list, taking indices two at a time to form pairs: `(c1, c2)`, `(c3, c4)`, `(c5, c6)`, etc. Stop if an index is left unpaired.
        iii. For each formed pair `(start_col, end_col)`:
            1. Check if all pixels in the *input* grid, located at the current row between `start_col + 1` and `end_col - 1`, are white (color 0).
            2. If this condition is true, then update the *output* grid: for every column index `k` from `start_col + 1` to `end_col - 1`, set the pixel color at the current row and column `k` to `C`.
3. Return the final output grid.
