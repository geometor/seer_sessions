            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples appear to show transformations on 1-dimensional grids (single rows), although the underlying ARC framework supports 2D grids. In these examples, the length of the row is 44.\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses white (0) and one other color (green=3, red=2, gray=5).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white pixels (0) to the non-white color present in the input row.\n4.  **Pattern:** The change occurs *between* pairs of non-white pixels. Specifically, if there are pixels of color `C` at column `c1` and column `c2` (`c1 < c2`) in the input row, and all pixels between `c1` and `c2` are white (0), then these intermediate white pixels are changed to color `C` in the output.\n5.  **Pairing Rule:** Observing the examples, particularly train\\_1 where multiple green pixels exist, the pairing is not between *all* consecutive pixels of the same color. Instead, it pairs the 1st occurrence with the 2nd, the 3rd with the 4th, the 5th with the 6th, and so on, for each specific color within the row.\n    *   Train 1 (Green=3 at 3, 13, 19, 29, 35, 43): Pairs are (3, 13), (19, 29), (35, 43). The gaps between these pairs (13-19, 29-35) are *not* filled.\n    *   Train 3 (Gray=5 at 5, 10, 21, 26, 37, 42): Pairs are (5, 10), (21, 26), (37, 42).\n6.  **Condition:** The filling only happens if the segment strictly *between* the paired pixels consists entirely of white pixels (0).\n7.  **Scope:** The transformation seems to operate independently on each row if the input were a 2D grid, although the examples only show 1D cases.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Examples use white (0) and one other color per grid.\n  - Objects:\n      - Pixels: Characterized by color and position (row, column).\n      - Non-white pixels: Act as markers or endpoints.\n      - White pixels: Potential candidates for color change.\n\nOutput:\n  - Type: Grid (same dimensions as input)\n  - Content: Pixels, where some white pixels from the input may be changed to a non-white color.\n\nTransformation:\n  - Action: Horizontal filling with color.\n  - Objects Involved: Non-white pixels, intervening white pixels.\n  - Grouping: Process rows independently. Within a row, group non-white pixels by color.\n  - Pairing Rule: For each color C in a row, list its column indices [c1, c2, c3, c4, ...]. Form pairs (c1, c2), (c3, c4), (c5, c6), etc.\n  - Condition: Filling occurs for a pair (ci, c(i+1)) only if all pixels at columns k (where ci < k < c(i+1)) in the input row are white (0).\n  - Result: If the condition is met for a pair (ci, c(i+1)) of color C, change the color of pixels at columns k (ci < k < c(i+1)) in the output row to C. Pixels not involved in filling retain their input color.\n```"
