Task: Fill horizontal gaps between specific pairs of non-white pixels.

Input:
  - Type: Grid (appears 1xN in examples)
  - Content: Pixels with colors (0-9). Examples use white (0) and one other color per grid.
  - Objects:
      - Pixels: Characterized by color and position (row, column).
      - Non-white pixels: Act as markers or endpoints.
      - White pixels: Potential candidates for color change.

Output:
  - Type: Grid (same dimensions as input)
  - Content: Pixels, where some white pixels from the input may be changed to a non-white color.

Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal filling with color.
  - Objects Involved: Non-white pixels, intervening white pixels.
  - Grouping: Process rows independently. Within a row, group non-white pixels by color.
  - Pairing Rule: For each color C in a row, list its column indices [c1, c2, c3, c4, ...]. Form pairs (c1, c2), (c3, c4), (c5, c6), etc.
  - Condition: Filling occurs for a pair (ci, c(i+1)) only if all pixels at columns k (where ci < k < c(i+1)) in the input row are white (0).
  - Result: If the condition is met for a pair (ci, c(i+1)) of color C, change the color of pixels at columns k (ci < k < c(i+1)) in the output row to C. Pixels not involved in filling retain their input color.
