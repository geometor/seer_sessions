Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single-row grids represented as a flat list, but conceptually they operate on rows. It seems more likely these represent multiple rows stacked vertically, where each example shows the transformation applied independently to each row. Let's assume each line break in the input/output representation corresponds to a new row in a 2D grid.
    *   Example 1 Input: 3 rows, 21 columns.
    *   Example 2 Input: 3 rows, 30 columns.
    *   Example 3 Input: 3 rows, 34 columns.
2.  **Colors:** The significant colors are Red (2), Green (3), and Blue (1). White (0) is the background.
3.  **Input Pattern:** Each row in the input contains one or more isolated pixels of a single non-white color.
4.  **Output Pattern:** Each corresponding row in the output contains a solid horizontal line segment of the same color as the input pixels for that row.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves identifying the non-white pixels in a row and filling a horizontal segment based on their positions.
6.  **Key Observation:** The way the segment is filled seems to depend on the *color* of the pixels in the row.
    *   For Red (2) and Blue (1) pixels (Examples 1 and 3), the output line segment spans exactly from the leftmost non-white pixel to the rightmost non-white pixel in that row.
    *   For Green (3) pixels (Example 2), the output line segment spans from the leftmost non-white pixel all the way to the right edge of the grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  Structure: 2D grid
  Background_Color: white (0)
Row_Processing:
  Action: Independent processing for each row.
  Condition: Row must contain at least one non-white pixel.
Input_Objects:
  Type: Isolated non-white pixels within a row.
  Property: All non-white pixels in a single row share the same color in the examples.
  Identification:
    - Leftmost non-white pixel column index (min_col).
    - Rightmost non-white pixel column index (max_col).
    - Color of non-white pixels (C).
Output_Objects:
  Type: Solid horizontal line segment within a row.
  Property: Color matches the input non-white pixels (C).
  Formation_Rule:
    - Start_Column: min_col
    - End_Column:
        Conditional:
          - IF C is green (3): Grid's rightmost column index.
          - ELSE: max_col
    - Filling: All pixels between Start_Column and End_Column (inclusive) are set to color C.
Rows_Without_Non_White_Pixels:
  Action: Remain unchanged (all white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid to preserve dimensions and background.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row, find the column indices of all non-white pixels.
4.  If no non-white pixels are found in the current row, proceed to the next row without modifying the output grid's corresponding row.
5.  If non-white pixels are found:
    a. Determine the color (C) of these pixels (it's assumed all non-white pixels in a row have the same color based on the examples).
    b. Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) among these non-white pixels.
    c. Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) among these non-white pixels.
    d. Check the color C:
        i.  If C is green (value 3), set the target end column (`end_col`) to the index of the last column of the grid (i.e., grid width - 1).
        ii. If C is any other non-white color (e.g., red (2) or blue (1)), set the target end column (`end_col`) to `max_col`.
    e. In the corresponding row of the output grid, update the pixel colors: for every column index `j` from `min_col` to `end_col` (inclusive), set the pixel color to C.
6.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.
