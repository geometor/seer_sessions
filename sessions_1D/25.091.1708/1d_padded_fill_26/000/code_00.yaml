Grid_Properties:
  Structure: 2D grid
  Background_Color: white (0)
Row_Processing:
  Action: Independent processing for each row.
  Condition: Row must contain at least one non-white pixel.
Input_Objects:
  Type: Isolated non-white pixels within a row.
  Property: All non-white pixels in a single row share the same color in the examples.
  Identification:
    - Leftmost non-white pixel column index (min_col).
    - Rightmost non-white pixel column index (max_col).
    - Color of non-white pixels (C).
Output_Objects:
  Type: Solid horizontal line segment within a row.
  Property: Color matches the input non-white pixels (C).
  Formation_Rule:
    - Start_Column: min_col
    - End_Column:
        Conditional:
          - IF C is green (3): Grid's rightmost column index.
          - ELSE: max_col
    - Filling: All pixels between Start_Column and End_Column (inclusive) are set to color C.
Rows_Without_Non_White_Pixels:
  Action: Remain unchanged (all white).
