This strongly suggests the data represents a 1-dimensional grid (a single row of 41 pixels).\n    *   The input grid consists mainly of white pixels (0). It contains a small number of non-white pixels.\n    *   In each example, all non-white pixels in the input share the same color (yellow=4 in train_1, magenta=6 in train_2, azure=8 in train_3).\n    *   The non-white pixels appear in pairs. In each pair, the two pixels are separated by one or more white pixels. There are exactly three such pairs in each input example.\n    *   The output grid is generated by modifying the input grid. The modification involves filling the space *between* the two pixels of each identified pair with the color of that pair. The original non-white pixels remain unchanged. The pixels outside these filled segments also remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
