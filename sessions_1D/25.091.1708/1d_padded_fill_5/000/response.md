*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output data are presented as sequences of numbers (colors). Each sequence has 41 elements. This strongly suggests the data represents a 1-dimensional grid (a single row of 41 pixels).
    *   The input grid consists mainly of white pixels (0). It contains a small number of non-white pixels.
    *   In each example, all non-white pixels in the input share the same color (yellow=4 in train_1, magenta=6 in train_2, azure=8 in train_3).
    *   The non-white pixels appear in pairs. In each pair, the two pixels are separated by one or more white pixels. There are exactly three such pairs in each input example.
    *   The output grid is generated by modifying the input grid. The modification involves filling the space *between* the two pixels of each identified pair with the color of that pair. The original non-white pixels remain unchanged. The pixels outside these filled segments also remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: line_drawing_completion
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Assumed based on the number of elements (41, a prime number)
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: (white=0, yellow=4, magenta=6, azure=8)
          - position: (index within the 1D grid)
      - type: pair_of_pixels
        properties:
          - color: (non-white color, same for both pixels in a pair)
          - location: (index_start, index_end)
          - separation: (pixels between index_start and index_end are initially white)
        count: 3 pairs per input example
      - type: segment
        properties:
          - color: (non-white color corresponding to the pair)
          - location: (range of indices from index_start to index_end, inclusive)
        relationship: Represents the filled space between and including a pair_of_pixels in the output.
    actions:
      - name: identify_pairs
        inputs: input_grid (1D)
        outputs: list of pairs [(color, index_start, index_end), ...]
        description: Find all non-white pixels. Group them by order of appearance into pairs (first with second, third with fourth, etc.). Verify both pixels in a pair have the same color and the space between them is white.
      - name: fill_segment
        inputs: grid, pair (color, index_start, index_end)
        outputs: modified_grid
        description: Change the color of all pixels in the grid from index_start to index_end (inclusive) to the specified color.
    constraints:
      - All non-white pixels in the input belong to the same color category.
      - The number of non-white pixels in the input is always even.
      - The pixels between members of a pair are always white (0) in the input.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Start with the input grid (assumed to be a single row).
    2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
    3.  Find the indices of all non-white pixels in the input grid.
    4.  Group these indices into consecutive pairs based on their order: (first index, second index), (third index, fourth index), and so on.
    5.  For each pair of indices (`index_start`, `index_end`):
        a.  Identify the color `C` of the pixels at `index_start` and `index_end` (they should be the same).
        b.  Modify the output grid by setting the color of all pixels from `index_start` to `index_end` (inclusive) to color `C`.
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
