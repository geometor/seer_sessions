*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain mostly white pixels (0) and a few isolated non-white pixels (blue=1, green=3, orange=7).
    *   In each example, the non-white pixels appear in different rows but seem to maintain a consistent column alignment within that example.
    *   The output grids retain the same dimensions as the input grids.
    *   The transformation operates row by row.
    *   For each row in the input grid:
        *   If the row contains only white pixels, the corresponding output row is identical (all white).
        *   If the row contains a non-white pixel, locate the column index of that pixel. The output row is modified such that all pixels from that column index to the rightmost column are filled with the color of the non-white pixel found in the input row. All pixels to the left of that starting column index remain white.
    *   The color of the non-white pixel in the input row determines the color used for filling in the output row.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    transformation_scope: row-wise
    background_color: 0 # white
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color (non-zero)
          - position (row_index, column_index)
    row_processing:
      condition: presence of a non-white pixel in the input row
      action:
        - identify the first non-white pixel from left to right
        - record its color (C) and column index (idx)
        - generate output row:
          - pixels from column 0 to idx-1 are set to white (0)
          - pixels from column idx to the last column are set to color C
      fallback (if no non-white pixel):
        - copy the input row to the output row (all white)
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions remain constant between input and output
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index.
    3.  For the current row:
        a.  Initialize a variable `first_non_white_col` to -1 and `fill_color` to 0 (white).
        b.  Scan the row from left to right (column 0 to the last column).
        c.  If a non-white pixel is encountered at column `c`:
            i.  Set `first_non_white_col` to `c`.
            ii. Set `fill_color` to the color of the pixel at `(row_index, c)`.
            iii. Stop scanning the current row (break the inner loop).
        d.  Construct the corresponding row for the output grid:
            i.  If `first_non_white_col` is -1 (meaning the input row was all white), fill the output row entirely with white (0).
            ii. If `first_non_white_col` is not -1, fill the output row from column `first_non_white_col` to the last column with `fill_color`. Fill columns 0 to `first_non_white_col - 1` with white (0).
    4.  Return the completed output grid.

## General Assessment

The previous execution (`code_00.py`) failed. The results showed that the transformed output was entirely white, indicating that the core logic within the function (filling a segment between two identical non-white pixels) was never triggered.

Analysis of the provided input strings and expected output dimensions revealed a discrepancy:
*   Input strings consistently contained 75 elements.
*   Output strings contained 72 elements (Examples 1 & 2) or 54 elements (Example 3).

Assuming a consistent 3-row structure (based on visual pattern similarity across examples), the input grids must be 3x25. The output grids are 3x24 (Examples 1 & 2) and 3x18 (Example 3).

Re-analyzing the 3x25 input grids confirmed that each relevant row contains exactly two non-white pixels, and these two pixels are always of the same color. This matches the logic implemented in `code_00.py`.

Therefore, the failure likely stemmed from the execution environment incorrectly processing or reshaping the input data before passing it to the `transform` function, rather than a flaw in the core transformation rule identified.

The updated strategy incorporates the variable output dimensions:
1.  Identify the two same-colored non-white pixels in each row of the 3x25 input grid.
2.  Determine the start and end columns for the fill segment.
3.  Determine the target output grid dimensions (e.g., 3x24 or 3x18 based on the example). A general rule for determining this from the input alone needs further clarification if it's not provided for the test case.
4.  Create the output grid with the target dimensions.
5.  Fill the segment in the corresponding output row, ensuring the fill does not exceed the output grid's boundaries.
