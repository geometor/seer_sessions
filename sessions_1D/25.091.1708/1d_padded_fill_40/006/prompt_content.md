```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions based on a row-wise rule.
The background color is white (0).
For each row in the input grid:
1. If the row contains exactly two non-white pixels, and these two pixels are of the same color (C):
    a. Identify the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (start_col).
    b. Identify the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (end_col).
    c. The corresponding output row is filled with white pixels (0) except for the segment between start_col and end_col (inclusive), which is filled with color C.
2. If a row does not meet the condition in step 1 (i.e., it has 0, 1, or more than 2 non-white pixels, or 2 non-white pixels of different colors), the corresponding output row remains entirely white (0).
