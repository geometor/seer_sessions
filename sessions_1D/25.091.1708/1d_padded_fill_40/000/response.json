The output row is modified such that all pixels from that column index to the rightmost column are filled with the color of the non-white pixel found in the input row. All pixels to the left of that starting column index remain white.\n    *   The color of the non-white pixel in the input row determines the color used for filling in the output row.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
