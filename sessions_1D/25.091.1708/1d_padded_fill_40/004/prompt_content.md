Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Processes each row of the input grid independently to produce the output grid.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
The background color is white (0).

For each row in the input grid:
1. If the row contains only white pixels (0), the corresponding output row is also all white.
2. If the row contains exactly two non-white pixels:
    a. Identify the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (start_col).
    b. Identify the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (end_col).
    c. Determine the color (fill_color) of these non-white pixels (they have the same color in the examples).
    d. The corresponding output row is filled with white pixels (0) everywhere except for the segment between start_col and end_col (inclusive). This segment is filled with fill_color.
3. Cases with a number of non-white pixels other than zero or two are not explicitly handled based on the provided examples, but the logic implicitly leaves the output row white if the condition in step 2 isn't met.
