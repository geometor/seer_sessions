*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain mostly white pixels (0) and a few isolated non-white pixels (blue=1, green=3, orange=7).
    *   In each example, the non-white pixels appear in different rows but seem to maintain a consistent column alignment within that example.
    *   The output grids retain the same dimensions as the input grids.
    *   The transformation operates row by row.
    *   For each row in the input grid:
        *   If the row contains only white pixels, the corresponding output row is identical (all white).
        *   If the row contains a non-white pixel, locate the column index of that pixel. The output row is modified such that all pixels from that column index to the rightmost column are filled with the color of the non-white pixel found in the input row. All pixels to the left of that starting column index remain white.
    *   The color of the non-white pixel in the input row determines the color used for filling in the output row.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index.
    3.  For the current row:
        a.  Initialize a variable `first_non_white_col` to -1 and `fill_color` to 0 (white).
        b.  Scan the row from left to right (column 0 to the last column).
        c.  If a non-white pixel is encountered at column `c`:
            i.  Set `first_non_white_col` to `c`.
            ii. Set `fill_color` to the color of the pixel at `(row_index, c)`.
            iii. Stop scanning the current row (break the inner loop).
        d.  Construct the corresponding row for the output grid:
            i.  If `first_non_white_col` is -1 (meaning the input row was all white), fill the output row entirely with white (0).
            ii. If `first_non_white_col` is not -1, fill the output row from column `first_non_white_col` to the last column with `fill_color`. Fill columns 0 to `first_non_white_col - 1` with white (0).
    4.  Return the completed output grid.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The execution results indicate that the provided code (`code_00.py`) failed to produce the expected outputs for all training examples. The transformed outputs were entirely white (color 0), suggesting that the core condition within the code (checking for exactly two non-white pixels per row) was never met. Reviewing the input data provided in the initial problem description reveals inconsistencies and likely corruptions (incorrect lengths when reshaping into the implied 3x25 grids). However, analyzing the *expected output* grids strongly suggests a consistent pattern: if an input row contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color, the output row fills the segment between these two pixels (inclusive) with that color. Rows with zero non-white pixels remain all white. The provided code (`code_00.py`) correctly implements this "fill between two points" logic. Therefore, the most probable cause of the failure is that the code was executed against the malformed input data presented in the initial prompt, rather than the intended inputs that would correspond to the expected outputs.

*   **Strategy:**
    Assume the intended transformation rule is indeed "fill between two identical non-white pixels". The existing code (`code_00.py`) correctly reflects this rule. The focus should be on clarifying the rule based on the *outputs* and acknowledging the likely issue with the provided input examples. The natural language program and facts will be updated to accurately describe this rule. No changes to the *code logic* seem necessary based on the analysis of the *expected outputs*.

*   **Metrics:**
    Due to the apparent corruption of the input data strings in the prompt, metrics will be based on the expected outputs and the *inferred* correct inputs.

    **Example 1:**
    *   Dimensions: Input 3x25, Output 3x25
    *   Input Row 0 (Inferred): 2 non-white (blue=1) pixels at cols 17, 23.
    *   Output Row 0: 7 blue pixels (cols 17-23).
    *   Input Row 1 (Inferred): 2 non-white (blue=1) pixels at cols 22, 24.
    *   Output Row 1: 3 blue pixels (cols 22-24).
    *   Input Row 2 (Inferred): 0 non-white pixels.
    *   Output Row 2: 0 non-white pixels.

    **Example 2:**
    *   Dimensions: Input 3x25, Output 3x25
    *   Input Row 0 (Inferred): 2 non-white (green=3) pixels at cols 8, 21.
    *   Output Row 0: 14 green pixels (cols 8-21).
    *   Input Row 1 (Inferred): 2 non-white (green=3) pixels at cols 11, 24.
    *   Output Row 1: 14 green pixels (cols 11-24).
    *   Input Row 2 (Inferred): 2 non-white (green=3) pixels at cols 1, 24.
    *   Output Row 2: 24 green pixels (cols 1-24).

    **Example 3:**
    *   Dimensions: Input 3x25, Output 3x25
    *   Input Row 0 (Inferred): 2 non-white (orange=7) pixels at cols 2, 17.
    *   Output Row 0: 16 orange pixels (cols 2-17).
    *   Input Row 1 (Inferred): 2 non-white (orange=7) pixels at cols 2, 17.
    *   Output Row 1: 16 orange pixels (cols 2-17).
    *   Input Row 2 (Inferred): 2 non-white (orange=7) pixels at cols 2, 17.
    *   Output Row 2: 16 orange pixels (cols 2-17).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white=0).
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index.
    3.  For the current input row:
        a.  Find all non-white pixels and record their colors and column indices.
        b.  Check if there are exactly two non-white pixels in the row.
        c.  If there are exactly two non-white pixels:
            i.  Check if both pixels have the same color (let this color be `fill_color`).
            ii. If the colors are the same:
                1.  Determine the leftmost column index (`start_col`) and the rightmost column index (`end_col`) of these two pixels.
                2.  In the corresponding output row, set the pixels from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) to `fill_color`.
    4.  (Implicitly) If a row does not meet the conditions in step 3 (i.e., has 0, 1, or more than 2 non-white pixels, or 2 non-white pixels of different colors), the corresponding output row remains filled with the background color (white=0).
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
