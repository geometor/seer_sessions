task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0) always present.
  - shape_consistency: input and output grids share the same dimensions.
  - shape_observed: 3x22 in all training examples.
input_objects:
  - type: point_pair
  - definition: Two non-white pixels within the same row.
  - properties:
      - color: Must be identical for both points in the pair. Color varies between examples (red(2), azure(8), orange(7)).
      - count_per_row: Exactly one such pair exists per relevant row (i.e., rows are either all white or contain exactly one pair).
output_objects:
  - type: horizontal_line_segment
  - definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white color in a row.
  - properties:
      - color: Same as the color of the input point_pair in that row.
      - endpoints: Defined by the column indices of the input point_pair.
      - length: Calculated as (rightmost_column - leftmost_column + 1).
transformation_scope: independent_row_processing
transformation_rule:
  - identify: Rows containing exactly two non-white pixels of the same color (`C`).
  - locate: Find the minimum (`min_col`) and maximum (`max_col`) column indices of these two pixels.
  - apply: In the output grid's corresponding row, set the color of all pixels in columns from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to `C`.
  - default: Rows not meeting the identification criteria are copied unchanged from input to output.
