            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe core issue identified in the previous step was a mismatch between the expected input format (2D numpy arrays) for the `transform` function and the format likely used during the failed testing (flattened strings). The provided execution results showed the code did not modify the input grids, leading to mismatches with the expected outputs.\n\nMy analysis, involving reconstructing the 2D grids from the flattened strings and verifying the transformation logic against the examples, confirms that the original perception of the task was accurate. The transformation rule involves finding rows with exactly two non-white pixels of the same color and filling the horizontal segment between them.\n\nThe strategy remains to use the previously developed logic, ensuring it operates correctly on 2D numpy arrays. The natural language program accurately describes this process and requires no modification based on the successful analysis of the properly formatted examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered using code execution after correctly parsing inputs as 3x22 grids:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 22), Output Shape: (3, 22)\n    *   Colors: Input {0, 2}, Output {0, 2}\n    *   Input Row Non-White Counts: [2, 2, 2]\n    *   Output Row Non-White Counts: [8, 8, 8]\n    *   Transformation: Rows 0, 1, 2 successfully filled between columns 0-7 with color 2 (red).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 22), Output Shape: (3, 22)\n    *   Colors: Input {0, 8}, Output {0, 8}\n    *   Input Row Non-White Counts: [2, 2, 2]\n    *   Output Row Non-White Counts: [8, 8, 8]\n    *   Transformation: Rows 0, 1, 2 successfully filled between columns 9-16 with color 8 (azure).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 22), Output Shape: (3, 22)\n    *   Colors: Input {0, 7}, Output {0, 7}\n    *   Input Row Non-White Counts: [2, 2, 2]\n    *   Output Row Non-White Counts: [10, 10, 10]\n    *   Transformation: Rows 0, 1, 2 successfully filled between columns 0-9 with color 7 (orange).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
