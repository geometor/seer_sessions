All other pixels in the row are white.\n    *   The transformation identifies the pair of identical non-white pixels in each row.\n    *   The output is generated by changing the color of the white pixels located horizontally *between* the identified pair of non-white pixels to match the color of the pair.\n    *   The original non-white pixels and any white pixels outside the span of the pair remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
