```python
import numpy as np

"""
Iterate through each row of the input grid independently. 
For the current row, identify the non-white color present (C). There will be exactly two pixels with this color.
Find the column index of the leftmost pixel with color C (col_start) and the rightmost pixel with color C (col_end).
Iterate through the columns strictly between col_start and col_end (i.e., from col_start + 1 up to, but not including, col_end).
For each column index c in this range, set the pixel at (current_row, c) in the output grid to color C.
Leave all other pixels unchanged.
