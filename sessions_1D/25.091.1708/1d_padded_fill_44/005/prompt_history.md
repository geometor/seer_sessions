*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are grids of pixels with the same dimensions.
    *   Each example involves a transformation that operates independently on each row of the input grid.
    *   Each row in the input contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by one or more white (0) pixels. All other pixels in the row are white.
    *   The transformation identifies the pair of identical non-white pixels in each row.
    *   The output is generated by changing the color of the white pixels located horizontally *between* the identified pair of non-white pixels to match the color of the pair.
    *   The original non-white pixels and any white pixels outside the span of the pair remain unchanged.

    1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
    2.  For the current row, identify the non-white color present (let this be `C`).
    3.  Find the column index of the leftmost pixel with color `C` (let this be `col_start`).
    4.  Find the column index of the rightmost pixel with color `C` (let this be `col_end`).
    5.  Iterate through the columns from `col_start + 1` up to `col_end - 1`.
    6.  For each pixel within this column range in the current row, change its color to `C`.
    7.  Keep all other pixels in the row (including the original pixels at `col_start` and `col_end`) unchanged.
    8.  Construct the output grid row by row based on these modifications.

## General Assessment

The provided code failed to produce the correct output for any of the training examples. The transformed output was identical to the input in all cases. This indicates that the core transformation logic within the code (filling pixels between markers) was likely never executed.

Based on the code structure and the way numpy handles array creation, the most probable cause of failure is that the `input_grid` was passed to the `transform` function as a flat, 1-dimensional list instead of the expected 2-dimensional list of lists representing the grid structure. When `np.array()` receives a 1D list, it creates a 1D array. Subsequent operations assuming a 2D structure (like accessing rows `input_np[r]` or getting shape `height, width = input_np.shape`) would fail or produce incorrect results, leading to the `find_marker_indices_and_color` function not finding valid markers and thus no pixels being filled.

The strategy to resolve this is to ensure the input data is correctly interpreted as a 2D grid *before* applying the transformation logic. Assuming the `transform` function will receive the standard ARC format (list of lists), the existing code's logic *should* be correct. No changes to the core transformation logic seem necessary based on the visual examples; the error lies in the execution context or data handling leading into the function.

**Summary of Metrics Across Examples:**
*   **Dimensions:** Input and Output dimensions are identical in all examples (3x10 based on assumption).
*   **Palette:** The color palette (unique colors present) remains the same between input and output for each example. Only white(0) and one non-white color exist in each case.
*   **Markers:** Each row in every input grid contains exactly two non-white pixels ('markers'). These two markers always share the same non-white color.
*   **Transformation:** The change from input to output involves coloring *only* the white(0) pixels located horizontally *between* the two marker pixels in each row. The color used for filling is the color of the markers in that row.
*   **Pixel Changes:** The number of pixels changed per row varies (2, 1, 1 for examples 1, 2, 3 respectively) based on the distance between the markers. Total pixels changed are 6, 3, and 3 respectively.
*   **Invariance:** The marker pixels themselves, and any white pixels outside the horizontal span defined by the markers, remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom. Let the current row index be `r`.
3.  For the current row `r`:
    a.  Find all non-white pixels. Identify their column indices and their color. There will be exactly two such pixels, and they will have the same color (let it be `C`).
    b.  Determine the leftmost column index (`col_start`) and the rightmost column index (`col_end`) of these two pixels of color `C`.
    c.  Iterate through the columns `c` from `col_start + 1` up to (but not including) `col_end`.
    d.  For each column `c` in this range, set the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to `C`.
4.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
