*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are grids of pixels with the same dimensions.
    *   Each example involves a transformation that operates independently on each row of the input grid.
    *   Each row in the input contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by one or more white (0) pixels. All other pixels in the row are white.
    *   The transformation identifies the pair of identical non-white pixels in each row.
    *   The output is generated by changing the color of the white pixels located horizontally *between* the identified pair of non-white pixels to match the color of the pair.
    *   The original non-white pixels and any white pixels outside the span of the pair remain unchanged.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
    2.  For the current row, identify the non-white color present (let this be `C`).
    3.  Find the column index of the leftmost pixel with color `C` (let this be `col_start`).
    4.  Find the column index of the rightmost pixel with color `C` (let this be `col_end`).
    5.  Iterate through the columns from `col_start + 1` up to `col_end - 1`.
    6.  For each pixel within this column range in the current row, change its color to `C`.
    7.  Keep all other pixels in the row (including the original pixels at `col_start` and `col_end`) unchanged.
    8.  Construct the output grid row by row based on these modifications.
