**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt failed because the code implemented a transformation that filled pixels *strictly between* two marker pixels in each row, whereas the example outputs show that the fill should include the marker pixels themselves, effectively drawing a horizontal line segment *from* the first marker *to* the second marker (inclusive). The core logic of identifying the markers per row was likely correct, but the range of application for the fill color was misinterpreted based on the initial natural language description versus the actual output data.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the understanding of the transformation rule based on the example outputs.
2.  Update the Natural Language Program to specify filling the segment inclusively between the markers.
3.  Modify the corresponding code logic (specifically the loop range) to implement this inclusive fill.

**Metrics:**

Assuming input grids are 3x10 based on the number of elements (30) and visual pattern repetition:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Grid: 3x10
    *   Output Grid: 3x10
    *   Marker Color: 2 (Red)
    *   Marker Indices (Row 0): 1, 4
    *   Fill Range (Row 0): Columns 1 to 4 (inclusive)
    *   Pixels Changed: 6 (indices (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3) changed from 0 to 2)
    *   Previous Code Result: Match False, 6 pixels off (no pixels were changed)

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Grid: 3x10
    *   Output Grid: 3x10
    *   Marker Color: 4 (Yellow)
    *   Marker Indices (Row 0): 0, 2
    *   Fill Range (Row 0): Columns 0 to 2 (inclusive)
    *   Pixels Changed: 3 (indices (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) changed from 0 to 4)
    *   Previous Code Result: Match False, 3 pixels off (no pixels were changed)

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Grid: 3x10
    *   Output Grid: 3x10
    *   Marker Color: 7 (Orange)
    *   Marker Indices (Row 0): 6, 8
    *   Fill Range (Row 0): Columns 6 to 8 (inclusive)
    *   Pixels Changed: 3 (indices (0,7), (1,7), (2,7) changed from 0 to 7)
    *   Previous Code Result: Match False, 3 pixels off (no pixels were changed)

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently, from top to bottom (let the current row index be `r`).
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Find all non-white (non-zero) pixels. Identify their color (`C`) and their column indices. (Based on the examples, there will be exactly two such pixels, and they will have the same color `C`).
    b.  Determine the minimum column index (`col_start`) and the maximum column index (`col_end`) among these non-white pixels.
    c.  Iterate through the columns from `col_start` to `col_end` (inclusive).
    d.  For each column index `c` in this range, set the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to `C`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
