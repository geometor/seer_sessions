            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single rows of pixels (effectively 1D grids).\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and a single non-white color per example (magenta/6 in train\\_1 and train\\_3, red/2 in train\\_2).\n3.  **Key Pattern:** The input rows contain pairs of the same non-white color separated by one or more white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be filling the gap between these pairs. Specifically, if two pixels of the same color `C` (where `C > 0`) are found at indices `i` and `j` (`i < j`) in a row, and *all* pixels strictly between `i` and `j` are white (0), then the output row has all pixels from index `i` to `j` (inclusive) set to color `C`.\n5.  **Independence:** The filling operations for different pairs seem independent. If multiple such valid pairs exist in a row, the filling happens for each one. The examples suggest this applies even if the pairs involve different colors (though not shown in these specific examples). The process occurs row by row if the grid had multiple rows.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Let the current row index be `r`.\n3.  For the current row `r`, iterate through all possible pairs of distinct column indices `c1` and `c2`, ensuring `c1 < c2`.\n4.  Retrieve the colors from the *input* grid at positions `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)`. Let these be `color1` and `color2`.\n5.  Check if `color1` is equal to `color2` and if this color is not white (i.e., `color1 > 0`).\n6.  If the colors match and are non-white, then examine all pixels in the *input* row `r` strictly between columns `c1` and `c2` (i.e., from column `c1 + 1` to `c2 - 1`). Check if *all* these intervening pixels are white (color 0).\n7.  If both conditions are met (matching non-white pair separated *only* by white pixels), then modify the *output* grid: for every column index `k` from `c1` to `c2` (inclusive), set the color of the pixel at `(r, k)` in the output grid to `color1`.\n8.  After checking all possible pairs (`c1`, `c2`) for the current row `r`, proceed to the next row.\n9.  Once all rows have been processed, the final modified output grid is the result."
