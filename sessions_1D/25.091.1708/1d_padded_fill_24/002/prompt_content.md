```python
"""
Processes an input grid (represented as a list of lists or numpy array) 
row by row. For each row, it identifies pairs of pixels that have the same 
non-white color (value > 0). If all pixels strictly between such a pair 
are white (value 0), it fills the entire segment from the first pixel 
of the pair to the second pixel (inclusive) with the pair's color in 
the output grid. The process is applied independently for all such 
valid pairs found in the input row.

    """
    Transforms the input grid by filling segments between pairs of identical
    non-white colors separated only by white pixels within each row.
