**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of varying dimensions (Example 1 & 2: 7x9, Example 3: 8x9). The background color is consistently white (0).
2.  **Core Elements:** The key elements are the non-white pixels within each row. Their presence, count, position, and color dictate the transformation.
3.  **Row Independence:** The transformation process operates independently on each row. The changes in one row do not affect any other row.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves filling segments of rows horizontally based on the non-white pixels present in the input row.
5.  **Conditional Filling:** There are two distinct filling behaviors based on the *number* of non-white pixels in a row:
    *   **Single Non-White Pixel:** If a row contains exactly one non-white pixel, the output row is filled with that pixel's color starting from its column index and extending all the way to the right edge of the grid. Pixels to the left remain white.
    *   **Multiple Non-White Pixels:** If a row contains two or more non-white pixels, the output row is filled *between* the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel and the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (inclusive). The color used for filling is the color of the *leftmost* non-white pixel in that row. Pixels outside this horizontal segment remain white.
    *   **No Non-White Pixels:** If a row contains only white pixels, the output row remains unchanged (all white).

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed because the rule for handling rows with a single non-white pixel was incorrect. The initial hypothesis was that such rows should be filled from the pixel's column to the right edge of the grid. The results show this is wrong. The fill does not always extend to the edge.

The analysis of the failed examples reveals a dependency on a grid-wide property: the maximum column index containing *any* non-white pixel across the *entire* input grid seems to determine the right boundary for fills originating from single-pixel rows. The rule for rows with multiple pixels (filling between the leftmost and rightmost pixel in that row using the leftmost pixel's color) appears correct and does not use this global maximum column.

The strategy is to:
1.  Pre-calculate the maximum column index (`max_col_overall`) containing any non-white pixel in the input grid. Handle the edge case where the grid is entirely white.
2.  Modify the row processing logic:
    *   If a row has zero non-white pixels, it remains white.
    *   If a row has one non-white pixel (at `col`, color `C`), fill the output row with `C` from `col` to `max_col_overall` (inclusive).
    *   If a row has two or more non-white pixels, find the minimum (`min_col_row`) and maximum (`max_col_row`) column indices *within that row*. Fill the output row with the color of the pixel at `min_col_row` from `min_col_row` to `max_col_row` (inclusive).
