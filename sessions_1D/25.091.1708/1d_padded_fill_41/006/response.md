## General Assessment

The previous code (`code_00.py`) correctly identified the row-wise processing and the importance of non-white pixels. It also correctly identified a global property (`max_col_overall`) influencing the transformation. However, it applied this global property incorrectly in the case where a row contained *multiple* non-white pixels.

The failures in Examples 2 and 3 indicate that the filling rule needs refinement based on the *number* of non-white pixels within a specific row. The key insight is that the right boundary of the fill changes depending on whether there's one or more than one non-white pixel in the row.

**Strategy:**
