            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed because the rule for handling rows with a single non-white pixel was incorrect. The initial hypothesis was that such rows should be filled from the pixel's column to the right edge of the grid. The results show this is wrong. The fill does not always extend to the edge.\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples reveals a dependency on a grid-wide property: the maximum column index containing *any* non-white pixel across the *entire* input grid seems to determine the right boundary for fills originating from single-pixel rows. The rule for rows with multiple pixels (filling between the leftmost and rightmost pixel in that row using the leftmost pixel's color) appears correct and does not use this global maximum column.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Pre-calculate the maximum column index (`max_col_overall`) containing any non-white pixel in the input grid. Handle the edge case where the grid is entirely white.\n2.  Modify the row processing logic:\n    *   If a row has zero non-white pixels, it remains white.\n    *   If a row has one non-white pixel (at `col`, color `C`), fill the output row with `C` from `col` to `max_col_overall` (inclusive).\n    *   If a row has two or more non-white pixels, find the minimum (`min_col_row`) and maximum (`max_col_row`) column indices *within that row*. Fill the output row with the color of the pixel at `min_col_row` from `min_col_row` to `max_col_row` (inclusive).\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
