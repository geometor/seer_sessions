Okay, let's break down the transformation in this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single rows (1-dimensional grids).
2.  **Colors Used:** The examples use white (0) as a background/separator, and blue (1) or gray (5) as the primary colors within each example.
3.  **Input Pattern:** In the input grids, non-white pixels (blue or gray) appear separated by sequences of exactly three white pixels (`C 0 0 0 C`, where C is the non-white color). There might be leading or trailing white pixels. The non-white color is consistent within each example input.
4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output grids, the sequences of `C 0 0 0 C` from the input are transformed into solid blocks of the non-white color `C C C C C`. Any leading or trailing white pixels from the input remain unchanged.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is filling the white pixels that lie *between* two non-white pixels of the *same* color. The filling color is the color of the bounding non-white pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill segments of white pixels between identical non-white pixels.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
colors_used:
  - white (0) - background/separator
  - blue (1) - object color in example 1
  - gray (5) - object color in examples 2 & 3
objects:
  - type: segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels.
    subtypes:
      - non_white_pixel: A single pixel with color blue (1) or gray (5).
      - white_segment: A contiguous sequence of one or more white (0) pixels.
relationships:
  - type: bounding
    description: A white_segment is bounded if it has a non_white_pixel immediately to its left and immediately to its right.
  - type: color_match
    description: The bounding non_white_pixels match if they have the same color value.
actions:
  - name: fill
    input: A white_segment that is bounded by matching non_white_pixels.
    output: The white_segment pixels are changed to the color of the bounding non_white_pixels.
    condition: The fill action only occurs if a white_segment is bounded by two non_white_pixels of the *same* color.
invariance:
  - Pixels that are not part of a white_segment bounded by matching non_white_pixels remain unchanged. This includes initial non-white pixels and any white pixels not bounded appropriately (e.g., leading/trailing white pixels, or white pixels between non-white pixels of *different* colors, though the latter doesn't occur in the examples).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid (row) to serve as the output grid.
2.  Initialize the index (`last_non_white_idx`) and color (`last_non_white_color`) of the most recently encountered non-white pixel; set the initial index to -1.
3.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right using the current index `i` and current color `c`.
4.  If the current pixel's color `c` is not white (0):
    a.  Check if a previous non-white pixel has been recorded (`last_non_white_idx != -1`) AND if the current color `c` is the same as the `last_non_white_color`.
    b.  If both conditions in (a) are true, then fill the segment in the output grid between the previous non-white pixel and the current one: Iterate from index `last_non_white_idx + 1` up to `i - 1` and set the color of each pixel in the output grid to `c`.
    c.  Update the tracking variables: set `last_non_white_idx = i` and `last_non_white_color = c`.
5.  After iterating through all pixels in the input grid, return the modified output grid.
