Okay, let's break down the transformation in this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single rows (1-dimensional grids).
2.  **Colors Used:** The examples use white (0) as a background/separator, and blue (1) or gray (5) as the primary colors within each example.
3.  **Input Pattern:** In the input grids, non-white pixels (blue or gray) appear separated by sequences of exactly three white pixels (`C 0 0 0 C`, where C is the non-white color). There might be leading or trailing white pixels. The non-white color is consistent within each example input.
4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output grids, the sequences of `C 0 0 0 C` from the input are transformed into solid blocks of the non-white color `C C C C C`. Any leading or trailing white pixels from the input remain unchanged.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is filling the white pixels that lie *between* two non-white pixels of the *same* color. The filling color is the color of the bounding non-white pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill segments of white pixels between identical non-white pixels.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
colors_used:
  - white (0) - background/separator
  - blue (1) - object color in example 1
  - gray (5) - object color in examples 2 & 3
objects:
  - type: segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels.
    subtypes:
      - non_white_pixel: A single pixel with color blue (1) or gray (5).
      - white_segment: A contiguous sequence of one or more white (0) pixels.
relationships:
  - type: bounding
    description: A white_segment is bounded if it has a non_white_pixel immediately to its left and immediately to its right.
  - type: color_match
    description: The bounding non_white_pixels match if they have the same color value.
actions:
  - name: fill
    input: A white_segment that is bounded by matching non_white_pixels.
    output: The white_segment pixels are changed to the color of the bounding non_white_pixels.
    condition: The fill action only occurs if a white_segment is bounded by two non_white_pixels of the *same* color.
invariance:
  - Pixels that are not part of a white_segment bounded by matching non_white_pixels remain unchanged. This includes initial non-white pixels and any white pixels not bounded appropriately (e.g., leading/trailing white pixels, or white pixels between non-white pixels of *different* colors, though the latter doesn't occur in the examples).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid (row) to serve as the output grid.
2.  Initialize the index (`last_non_white_idx`) and color (`last_non_white_color`) of the most recently encountered non-white pixel; set the initial index to -1.
3.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right using the current index `i` and current color `c`.
4.  If the current pixel's color `c` is not white (0):
    a.  Check if a previous non-white pixel has been recorded (`last_non_white_idx != -1`) AND if the current color `c` is the same as the `last_non_white_color`.
    b.  If both conditions in (a) are true, then fill the segment in the output grid between the previous non-white pixel and the current one: Iterate from index `last_non_white_idx + 1` up to `i - 1` and set the color of each pixel in the output grid to `c`.
    c.  Update the tracking variables: set `last_non_white_idx = i` and `last_non_white_color = c`.
5.  After iterating through all pixels in the input grid, return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed because it incorrectly generalized the filling rule. It assumed *any* sequence of white pixels between two identical non-white pixels should be filled. The analysis of the failed examples reveals a more specific condition: the filling only occurs when the sequence of pixels matches either `C 0 0 C` or `C 0 0 0 C`, where `C` is a non-white color. Furthermore, the transformation replaces this entire pattern (length 4 or 5) with a solid block of color `C` of the same length. The previous code only filled the intermediate zeros and incorrectly handled patterns with more than three zeros between the non-white pixels.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code to specifically look for these two patterns (`C 0 0 C` and `C 0 0 0 C`) and replace them entirely with `C C C C` or `C C C C C`, respectively.

**Metrics:**

The code execution analyzed the relationship between consecutive pairs of identical non-white pixels in the input and the corresponding segment in the output.

*   **Key Finding:** A transformation (filling) occurs if and only if the distance `d` between the indices of two *consecutive* identical non-white pixels `C` (i.e., `d = index2 - index1`) is either 3 (pattern `C 0 0 C`) or 4 (pattern `C 0 0 0 C`).
*   **Transformation Rule:** When `d=3` or `d=4`, the entire segment in the output from `index1` to `index2` (inclusive) is filled with the color `C`.
*   **No Transformation:** When the distance `d` is not 3 or 4 (e.g., `d=5` or `d=6` as seen in the examples), the pixels between `index1` and `index2` remain white (0) in the output.

**YAML Facts:**

    properties:
      - color: (white, blue, gray)
      - index: position in the 1D grid
  - type: pattern
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels.
    subtypes:
      - target_pattern_1: A sequence of 4 pixels C 0 0 C, where C is a non-white color (1 or 5 in examples) and 0 is white.
      - target_pattern_2: A sequence of 5 pixels C 0 0 0 C, where C is a non-white color (1 or 5 in examples) and 0 is white.
      - replacement_pattern_1: A sequence of 4 pixels C C C C, where C is the non-white color from the corresponding target_pattern_1.

  - type: spatial
    description: Identifying consecutive pixels forming target_pattern_1 or target_pattern_2.
  - type: identity
    description: The non-white color C must be identical at the start and end of a target pattern.
actions:
  - name: replace_pattern
    input: An instance of target_pattern_1 or target_pattern_2 found in the input grid.
    output: The identified pattern in the grid is replaced by the corresponding replacement_pattern_1 or replacement_pattern_2.
    condition: The action is applied wherever target_pattern_1 or target_pattern_2 occurs.
invariance:
  - Pixels not part of a successfully identified target_pattern_1 or target_pattern_2 remain unchanged.
processing_order: Replacements can potentially overlap if patterns share a boundary pixel (e.g., C00C00C). A left-to-right scan and replacement approach should handle this implicitly by modifying the grid as patterns are found. Alternatively, identify all patterns first, then apply replacements. A simpler approach given the examples is to iterate and modify a copy of the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid (row) to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right, examining potential starting positions `i` for the target patterns.
3.  At each position `i`, check if the pixel `input_grid[i]` has a non-white color `C`.
4.  If `input_grid[i]` is non-white (`C != 0`):
    a.  Check if the pattern `C 0 0 C` exists starting at `i`. This means checking if `i+3` is within the grid bounds, `input_grid[i+1] == 0`, `input_grid[i+2] == 0`, and `input_grid[i+3] == C`.
    b.  If pattern `C 0 0 C` is found, modify the *output* grid: set `output_grid[i]` to `C`, `output_grid[i+1]` to `C`, `output_grid[i+2]` to `C`, and `output_grid[i+3]` to `C`.
    c.  If pattern `C 0 0 C` was *not* found, check if the pattern `C 0 0 0 C` exists starting at `i`. This means checking if `i+4` is within the grid bounds, `input_grid[i+1] == 0`, `input_grid[i+2] == 0`, `input_grid[i+3] == 0`, and `input_grid[i+4] == C`.
    d.  If pattern `C 0 0 0 C` is found, modify the *output* grid: set `output_grid[i]` to `C`, `output_grid[i+1]` to `C`, `output_grid[i+2]` to `C`, `output_grid[i+3]` to `C`, and `output_grid[i+4]` to `C`.
5.  Continue iterating through all possible starting positions `i` in the input grid. Note: Since we are modifying a *copy* (the output grid), the checks in steps 4a and 4c always use the original *input* grid values. This avoids issues with overlapping patterns affecting subsequent checks within the same pass.
6.  After iterating through all positions, return the modified output grid.
