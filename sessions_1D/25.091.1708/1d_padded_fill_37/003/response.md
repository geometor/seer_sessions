"""
Replace specific patterns involving pairs of identical non-white colors 
separated by exactly two or three white pixels with a solid block of that non-white color. 
Specifically, 'C 0 0 C' becomes 'C C C C' and 'C 0 0 0 C' becomes 'C C C C C', 
where C is any non-white color (1-9) and 0 is white. 
The transformation operates on a single row (1D grid). 
Pixels not part of these specific patterns remain unchanged.
