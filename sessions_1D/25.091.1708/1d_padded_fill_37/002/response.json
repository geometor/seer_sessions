            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code failed because it incorrectly generalized the filling rule. It assumed *any* sequence of white pixels between two identical non-white pixels should be filled. The analysis of the failed examples reveals a more specific condition: the filling only occurs when the sequence of pixels matches either `C 0 0 C` or `C 0 0 0 C`, where `C` is a non-white color. Furthermore, the transformation replaces this entire pattern (length 4 or 5) with a solid block of color `C` of the same length. The previous code only filled the intermediate zeros and incorrectly handled patterns with more than three zeros between the non-white pixels.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code to specifically look for these two patterns (`C 0 0 C` and `C 0 0 0 C`) and replace them entirely with `C C C C` or `C C C C C`, respectively.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution analyzed the relationship between consecutive pairs of identical non-white pixels in the input and the corresponding segment in the output.\n\n*   **Key Finding:** A transformation (filling) occurs if and only if the distance `d` between the indices of two *consecutive* identical non-white pixels `C` (i.e., `d = index2 - index1`) is either 3 (pattern `C 0 0 C`) or 4 (pattern `C 0 0 0 C`).\n*   **Transformation Rule:** When `d=3` or `d=4`, the entire segment in the output from `index1` to `index2` (inclusive) is filled with the color `C`.\n*   **No Transformation:** When the distance `d` is not 3 or 4 (e.g., `d=5` or `d=6` as seen in the examples), the pixels between `index1` and `index2` remain white (0) in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
