**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed because it incorrectly generalized the filling rule. It assumed *any* sequence of white pixels between two identical non-white pixels should be filled. The analysis of the failed examples reveals a more specific condition: the filling only occurs when the sequence of pixels matches either `C 0 0 C` or `C 0 0 0 C`, where `C` is a non-white color. Furthermore, the transformation replaces this entire pattern (length 4 or 5) with a solid block of color `C` of the same length. The previous code only filled the intermediate zeros and incorrectly handled patterns with more than three zeros between the non-white pixels.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code to specifically look for these two patterns (`C 0 0 C` and `C 0 0 0 C`) and replace them entirely with `C C C C` or `C C C C C`, respectively.

**Metrics:**

The code execution analyzed the relationship between consecutive pairs of identical non-white pixels in the input and the corresponding segment in the output.

*   **Key Finding:** A transformation (filling) occurs if and only if the distance `d` between the indices of two *consecutive* identical non-white pixels `C` (i.e., `d = index2 - index1`) is either 3 (pattern `C 0 0 C`) or 4 (pattern `C 0 0 0 C`).
*   **Transformation Rule:** When `d=3` or `d=4`, the entire segment in the output from `index1` to `index2` (inclusive) is filled with the color `C`.
*   **No Transformation:** When the distance `d` is not 3 or 4 (e.g., `d=5` or `d=6` as seen in the examples), the pixels between `index1` and `index2` remain white (0) in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Replace specific patterns involving pairs of identical non-white colors separated by two or three white pixels with a solid block of that non-white color.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
colors_used:
  - white (0) - background/separator
  - blue (1) - object color in example 1
  - gray (5) - object color in examples 2 & 3
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (white, blue, gray)
      - index: position in the 1D grid
  - type: pattern
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels.
    subtypes:
      - target_pattern_1: A sequence of 4 pixels C 0 0 C, where C is a non-white color (1 or 5 in examples) and 0 is white.
      - target_pattern_2: A sequence of 5 pixels C 0 0 0 C, where C is a non-white color (1 or 5 in examples) and 0 is white.
      - replacement_pattern_1: A sequence of 4 pixels C C C C, where C is the non-white color from the corresponding target_pattern_1.
      - replacement_pattern_2: A sequence of 5 pixels C C C C C, where C is the non-white color from the corresponding target_pattern_2.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Identifying consecutive pixels forming target_pattern_1 or target_pattern_2.
  - type: identity
    description: The non-white color C must be identical at the start and end of a target pattern.
actions:
  - name: replace_pattern
    input: An instance of target_pattern_1 or target_pattern_2 found in the input grid.
    output: The identified pattern in the grid is replaced by the corresponding replacement_pattern_1 or replacement_pattern_2.
    condition: The action is applied wherever target_pattern_1 or target_pattern_2 occurs.
invariance:
  - Pixels not part of a successfully identified target_pattern_1 or target_pattern_2 remain unchanged.
processing_order: Replacements can potentially overlap if patterns share a boundary pixel (e.g., C00C00C). A left-to-right scan and replacement approach should handle this implicitly by modifying the grid as patterns are found. Alternatively, identify all patterns first, then apply replacements. A simpler approach given the examples is to iterate and modify a copy of the grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid (row) to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right, examining potential starting positions `i` for the target patterns.
3.  At each position `i`, check if the pixel `input_grid[i]` has a non-white color `C`.
4.  If `input_grid[i]` is non-white (`C != 0`):
    a.  Check if the pattern `C 0 0 C` exists starting at `i`. This means checking if `i+3` is within the grid bounds, `input_grid[i+1] == 0`, `input_grid[i+2] == 0`, and `input_grid[i+3] == C`.
    b.  If pattern `C 0 0 C` is found, modify the *output* grid: set `output_grid[i]` to `C`, `output_grid[i+1]` to `C`, `output_grid[i+2]` to `C`, and `output_grid[i+3]` to `C`.
    c.  If pattern `C 0 0 C` was *not* found, check if the pattern `C 0 0 0 C` exists starting at `i`. This means checking if `i+4` is within the grid bounds, `input_grid[i+1] == 0`, `input_grid[i+2] == 0`, `input_grid[i+3] == 0`, and `input_grid[i+4] == C`.
    d.  If pattern `C 0 0 0 C` is found, modify the *output* grid: set `output_grid[i]` to `C`, `output_grid[i+1]` to `C`, `output_grid[i+2]` to `C`, `output_grid[i+3]` to `C`, and `output_grid[i+4]` to `C`.
5.  Continue iterating through all possible starting positions `i` in the input grid. Note: Since we are modifying a *copy* (the output grid), the checks in steps 4a and 4c always use the original *input* grid values. This avoids issues with overlapping patterns affecting subsequent checks within the same pass.
6.  After iterating through all positions, return the modified output grid.
