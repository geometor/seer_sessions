There might be leading or trailing white pixels. The non-white color is consistent within each example input.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output grids, the sequences of `C 0 0 0 C` from the input are transformed into solid blocks of the non-white color `C C C C C`. Any leading or trailing white pixels from the input remain unchanged.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is filling the white pixels that lie *between* two non-white pixels of the *same* color. The filling color is the color of the bounding non-white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
