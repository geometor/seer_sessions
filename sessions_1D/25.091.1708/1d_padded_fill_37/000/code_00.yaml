task_description: Fill segments of white pixels between identical non-white pixels.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
colors_used:
  - white (0) - background/separator
  - blue (1) - object color in example 1
  - gray (5) - object color in examples 2 & 3
objects:
  - type: segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels.
    subtypes:
      - non_white_pixel: A single pixel with color blue (1) or gray (5).
      - white_segment: A contiguous sequence of one or more white (0) pixels.
relationships:
  - type: bounding
    description: A white_segment is bounded if it has a non_white_pixel immediately to its left and immediately to its right.
  - type: color_match
    description: The bounding non_white_pixels match if they have the same color value.
actions:
  - name: fill
    input: A white_segment that is bounded by matching non_white_pixels.
    output: The white_segment pixels are changed to the color of the bounding non_white_pixels.
    condition: The fill action only occurs if a white_segment is bounded by two non_white_pixels of the *same* color.
invariance:
  - Pixels that are not part of a white_segment bounded by matching non_white_pixels remain unchanged. This includes initial non-white pixels and any white pixels not bounded appropriately (e.g., leading/trailing white pixels, or white pixels between non-white pixels of *different* colors, though the latter doesn't occur in the examples).
