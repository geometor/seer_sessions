task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors 0-9.
  - element: pixel
    description: Individual cell in the grid with a color value.
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0 to 9. 0 is white/background.
      - position: Row and column index.
  - element: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels in the grid.
objects:
  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: A pixel with a color other than 0 (white).
    identified_by: Pixel value > 0.
  - object: horizontal_span
    description: A segment within a row defined by the leftmost and rightmost non_white_pixels in that row.
    properties:
      - start_column: Column index of the leftmost non_white_pixel.
      - end_column: Column index of the rightmost non_white_pixel.
      - color: The color of the non_white_pixels defining the span (assumed consistent within the row based on examples).
      - row_index: The row index where the span exists.
actions:
  - action: identify_span_boundaries
    description: For each row, find the minimum and maximum column index of any non_white_pixel.
    inputs:
      - row
    outputs:
      - start_column (or null if no non_white_pixels)
      - end_column (or null if no non_white_pixels)
      - color (or null if no non_white_pixels)
  - action: fill_span
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the identified horizontal_span (inclusive of start and end columns) to the span's color.
    condition: Only if a horizontal_span exists for the row (i.e., the row contains non_white_pixels).
    inputs:
      - row_index
      - start_column
      - end_column
      - color
    outputs:
      - Modified row in the output grid.
relationships:
  - relationship: row_independence
    description: The transformation applied to one row does not depend on the content of other rows.
  - relationship: color_inheritance
    description: The fill color used in the output row is determined by the color of the non_white_pixels in the corresponding input row.
