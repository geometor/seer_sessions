            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 2D arrays of pixels. The examples show relatively sparse grids, mostly white (0), with some non-white pixels.\n2.  **Input Pattern:** The input grids feature vertical lines or segments composed of a single non-white color (gray '5' in examples 1 & 2, magenta '6' in example 3). These lines are separated by white pixels. In some rows, there might be multiple segments of the same color (e.g., example 3 has pixels at columns 13 and 15 in certain rows).\n3.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids show that the gaps *between* the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels *within each row* have been filled with the same non-white color found in that row in the input.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal fill operation performed independently on each row. The fill color is determined by the non-white color present in that row in the input. The fill extends from the first (leftmost) non-white pixel to the last (rightmost) non-white pixel in that row. Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Color Consistency:** The non-white color used for filling in the output is always the same as the non-white color present in the corresponding input row. Examples suggest only one non-white color exists per relevant row in the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
