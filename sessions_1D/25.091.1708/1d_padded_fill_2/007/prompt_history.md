Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 2D arrays of pixels. The examples show relatively sparse grids, mostly white (0), with some non-white pixels.
2.  **Input Pattern:** The input grids feature vertical lines or segments composed of a single non-white color (gray '5' in examples 1 & 2, magenta '6' in example 3). These lines are separated by white pixels. In some rows, there might be multiple segments of the same color (e.g., example 3 has pixels at columns 13 and 15 in certain rows).
3.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids show that the gaps *between* the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels *within each row* have been filled with the same non-white color found in that row in the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal fill operation performed independently on each row. The fill color is determined by the non-white color present in that row in the input. The fill extends from the first (leftmost) non-white pixel to the last (rightmost) non-white pixel in that row. Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged.
5.  **Color Consistency:** The non-white color used for filling in the output is always the same as the non-white color present in the corresponding input row. Examples suggest only one non-white color exists per relevant row in the input.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the current row index.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Find all non-white pixels (pixels with color > 0).
    b.  If no non-white pixels are found in the row, proceed to the next row (the corresponding output row remains unchanged from the input).
    c.  If non-white pixels are found:
        i.  Determine the color of these non-white pixels (based on the examples, there's only one non-white color per relevant row). Store this color.
        ii. Find the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel in this row. Store this as `min_col`.
        iii. Find the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel in this row. Store this as `max_col`.
        iv. Iterate through all columns from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive).
        v.  For each column in this range, set the color of the pixel at the current row index and the current column index in the *output* grid to the stored non-white color.
4.  After processing all rows, the output grid contains the final transformed result.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the row-by-row nature of the transformation and the color inheritance. However, the definition of the "span" to be filled was too broad. The previous code filled the entire horizontal extent from the leftmost non-white pixel to the rightmost non-white pixel in each row. The provided results clearly show this is incorrect, especially in Example 3, where the fill only occurs *between* the two magenta (6) pixels, not across a larger range.

The new strategy is to refine the definition of the area to be filled. Instead of filling the entire span defined by the minimum and maximum column indices of non-white pixels in a row, the transformation appears to fill the gaps *between consecutive pairs* of non-white pixels *only if they share the same color*.

**Findings from Metrics:**

1.  **Confirmation:** The analysis confirms the hypothesis. In all relevant rows across the examples, the pixels that change from white (0) to non-white in the output are located exclusively *between* pairs of input non-white pixels that share the *same color*.
2.  **Fill Color:** The color used for filling the gap is consistently the same as the color of the pair of input pixels defining that gap.
3.  **Consecutive Pairs:** The filling occurs between *consecutive* non-white pixels (when sorted by column index) of the same color. If a row had, for example, `... 5 ... 5 ... 5 ...`, the gaps between the first and second `5` and between the second and third `5` would both be filled with `5`.
4.  **No Fill Otherwise:** Rows with zero or one non-white pixel remain unchanged regarding this fill operation (they retain their original pixels). Pairs of non-white pixels with *different* colors do not trigger a fill between them.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the current row index.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Find all non-white pixels (pixels with color > 0).
    b.  If there are fewer than two non-white pixels in the row, proceed to the next row (the corresponding output row remains unchanged from the input, except for the initial copy).
    c.  If there are two or more non-white pixels:
        i.  Create a list of these non-white pixels, storing each as a tuple `(column_index, color)`.
        ii. Sort this list based on the `column_index`.
        iii. Iterate through the sorted list, examining consecutive pairs of pixels (pixel `i` and pixel `i+1`).
        iv. For each pair:
            1.  Let the left pixel be `(col1, color1)` and the right pixel be `(col2, color2)`.
            2.  Check if `color1` is equal to `color2`.
            3.  If the colors are the same, then in the *output* grid's current row, set the color of all pixels from column `col1` to column `col2` (inclusive) to `color1`.
4.  After processing all rows, the output grid contains the final transformed result.
