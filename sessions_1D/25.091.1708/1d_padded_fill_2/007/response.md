"""
Transforms the input grid by filling horizontal gaps between consecutive pairs of non-white pixels of the same color within each row.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3. For each row:
    a. Find all non-white pixels (color > 0).
    b. If fewer than two non-white pixels exist, continue to the next row.
    c. Sort the non-white pixels by their column index.
    d. Iterate through consecutive pairs of these sorted pixels.
    e. If a pair has the same color:
        i. Get the column index of the left pixel (col1) and the right pixel (col2).
        ii. Fill the corresponding row in the output grid from col1 to col2 (inclusive) with that color.
4. Return the modified output grid.
