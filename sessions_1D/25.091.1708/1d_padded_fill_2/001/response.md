"""
Transforms the input grid by performing a horizontal fill operation on each row independently.
For each row in the input grid:
1. Find all non-white pixels (color > 0).
2. If non-white pixels exist:
   a. Identify the color of these pixels (assuming only one non-white color per relevant row).
   b. Find the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (`min_col`).
   c. Find the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (`max_col`).
   d. In the corresponding row of the output grid, set all pixels from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to the identified non-white color.
3. If no non-white pixels exist in a row, that row remains unchanged in the output.
