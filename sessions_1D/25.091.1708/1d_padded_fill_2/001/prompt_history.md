Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 2D arrays of pixels. The examples show relatively sparse grids, mostly white (0), with some non-white pixels.
2.  **Input Pattern:** The input grids feature vertical lines or segments composed of a single non-white color (gray '5' in examples 1 & 2, magenta '6' in example 3). These lines are separated by white pixels. In some rows, there might be multiple segments of the same color (e.g., example 3 has pixels at columns 13 and 15 in certain rows).
3.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids show that the gaps *between* the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels *within each row* have been filled with the same non-white color found in that row in the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal fill operation performed independently on each row. The fill color is determined by the non-white color present in that row in the input. The fill extends from the first (leftmost) non-white pixel to the last (rightmost) non-white pixel in that row. Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged.
5.  **Color Consistency:** The non-white color used for filling in the output is always the same as the non-white color present in the corresponding input row. Examples suggest only one non-white color exists per relevant row in the input.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors 0-9.
  - element: pixel
    description: Individual cell in the grid with a color value.
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0 to 9. 0 is white/background.
      - position: Row and column index.
  - element: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels in the grid.
objects:
  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: A pixel with a color other than 0 (white).
    identified_by: Pixel value > 0.
  - object: horizontal_span
    description: A segment within a row defined by the leftmost and rightmost non_white_pixels in that row.
    properties:
      - start_column: Column index of the leftmost non_white_pixel.
      - end_column: Column index of the rightmost non_white_pixel.
      - color: The color of the non_white_pixels defining the span (assumed consistent within the row based on examples).
      - row_index: The row index where the span exists.
actions:
  - action: identify_span_boundaries
    description: For each row, find the minimum and maximum column index of any non_white_pixel.
    inputs:
      - row
    outputs:
      - start_column (or null if no non_white_pixels)
      - end_column (or null if no non_white_pixels)
      - color (or null if no non_white_pixels)
  - action: fill_span
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the identified horizontal_span (inclusive of start and end columns) to the span's color.
    condition: Only if a horizontal_span exists for the row (i.e., the row contains non_white_pixels).
    inputs:
      - row_index
      - start_column
      - end_column
      - color
    outputs:
      - Modified row in the output grid.
relationships:
  - relationship: row_independence
    description: The transformation applied to one row does not depend on the content of other rows.
  - relationship: color_inheritance
    description: The fill color used in the output row is determined by the color of the non_white_pixels in the corresponding input row.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the current row index.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Find all non-white pixels (pixels with color > 0).
    b.  If no non-white pixels are found in the row, proceed to the next row (the corresponding output row remains unchanged from the input).
    c.  If non-white pixels are found:
        i.  Determine the color of these non-white pixels (based on the examples, there's only one non-white color per relevant row). Store this color.
        ii. Find the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel in this row. Store this as `min_col`.
        iii. Find the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel in this row. Store this as `max_col`.
        iv. Iterate through all columns from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive).
        v.  For each column in this range, set the color of the pixel at the current row index and the current column index in the *output* grid to the stored non-white color.
4.  After processing all rows, the output grid contains the final transformed result.
