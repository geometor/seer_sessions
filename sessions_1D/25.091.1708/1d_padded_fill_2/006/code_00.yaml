task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors 0-9.
  - element: pixel
    description: Individual cell in the grid with a color value.
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0 to 9. 0 is white/background.
      - position: Row and column index.
  - element: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels in the grid.
objects:
  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: A pixel with a color other than 0 (white).
    identified_by: Pixel value > 0.
    properties:
      - color
      - column_index
  - object: horizontal_gap
    description: A sequence of one or more white pixels located horizontally between two non_white_pixels within the same row.
    properties:
      - start_column: Column index immediately after the left non_white_pixel.
      - end_column: Column index immediately before the right non_white_pixel.
      - row_index: The row index where the gap exists.
  - object: same_color_pixel_pair
    description: Two non_white_pixels within the same row that have the same color and are consecutive when considering all non_white_pixels sorted by column index.
    properties:
      - left_pixel: The non_white_pixel with the smaller column index.
      - right_pixel: The non_white_pixel with the larger column index.
      - color: The shared color of the two pixels.
      - row_index: The row index where the pair exists.
actions:
  - action: find_sorted_non_white_pixels
    description: For each row, identify all non_white_pixels and sort them based on their column index.
    inputs:
      - row
    outputs:
      - sorted list of (column_index, color) tuples for non_white_pixels.
  - action: identify_gaps_between_pairs
    description: Iterate through the sorted non_white_pixels in a row to find consecutive pairs with the same color.
    inputs:
      - sorted list of non_white_pixels for a row.
    outputs:
      - List of gaps, where each gap is defined by the (start_column, end_column, fill_color) derived from a same_color_pixel_pair. The start_column is the column of the left pixel, and end_column is the column of the right pixel.
  - action: fill_identified_gaps
    description: For each identified gap, change the color of all pixels within that gap (from the column of the left pixel to the column of the right pixel, inclusive) to the color of the pair.
    condition: Only acts on gaps identified between same_color_pixel_pairs.
    inputs:
      - row_index
      - start_column (column of left pixel)
      - end_column (column of right pixel)
      - fill_color
    outputs:
      - Modified row in the output grid.
relationships:
  - relationship: row_independence
    description: The transformation applied to one row does not depend on the content of other rows.
  - relationship: color_match_fill
    description: Filling only occurs between consecutive non_white_pixels if they have the same color. The fill color matches the pair's color.
