**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed because it implemented a simple horizontal fill between the minimum and maximum column indices of non-white pixels *within each row*. The comparison between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs reveals a more complex pattern:

1.  **Examples 1 & 2:** The fill in a given row `r` seems to connect the column of the single non-white pixel in row `r` to the column of the single non-white pixel in the *next* row (`r+1`).
2.  **Example 3:** The fill occurs *within* a row, connecting the two non-white pixels present in that row.

The strategy is to refine the understanding of the transformation rule based on these distinct behaviors. The rule likely depends on the number and arrangement of non-white pixels within a row and potentially its relationship with adjacent rows. We need to identify the conditions that trigger the "connect-to-next-row" fill versus the "fill-within-row" fill.

**Metrics and Analysis**

import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid_str):
    grid = np.array([list(map(int, row.split())) for row in grid_str.strip().split('\n')])
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    analysis = []
    for r in range(rows):
        row_data = grid[r, :]
        non_white_indices = np.where(row_data > 0)[0]
        non_white_pixels = []
        if len(non_white_indices) > 0:
            for c in non_white_indices:
                non_white_pixels.append({'row': r, 'col': c, 'color': int(row_data[c])})
        analysis.append({
            'row_index': r,
            'num_non_white': len(non_white_indices),

**Revised Analysis based on Code Output:**

My initial manual parsing of the input strings was incorrect due to the flat representation. The code execution reveals that *all* examples have inputs that are single rows with multiple non-white pixels.

*   **Train 1 Input:** Single row, 6 gray (5) pixels at columns 5, 15, 23, 33, 41, 51.
*   **Train 1 Output:** Single row, filled gray (5) from col 5 to 15, col 15 to 23, col 23 to 33, col 33 to 41, col 41 to 51. This looks like filling between *consecutive* non-white pixels in the row.
*   **Train 2 Input:** Single row, 6 gray (5) pixels at columns 3, 12, 21, 30, 39, 48.
*   **Train 2 Output:** Single row, filled gray (5) from col 3 to 12, col 12 to 21, col 21 to 30, col 30 to 39, col 39 to 48. Again, filling between consecutive non-white pixels.
*   **Train 3 Input:** Single row, 6 magenta (6) pixels at columns 13, 15, 31, 33, 49, 51.
*   **Train 3 Output:** Single row, filled magenta (6) from col 13 to 15, col 31 to 33, col 49 to 51. Again, filling between *consecutive pairs* of non-white pixels.

**Conclusion:** The transformation fills the horizontal span *between pairs of consecutive non-white pixels* within each row, using the color of those pixels. Rows with fewer than two non-white pixels remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Find all non-white pixels (color > 0) and record their column indices and colors.
    b.  Sort these non-white pixels based on their column index.
    c.  Iterate through the sorted non-white pixels from left to right (i.e., increasing column index). Consider pairs of adjacent pixels in this sorted list (pixel `i` and pixel `i+1`).
    d.  For each pair:
        i.  Check if the two pixels (`pixel i` and `pixel i+1`) have the *same color*.
        ii. If they have the same color, identify the column index of the left pixel (`start_col`) and the column index of the right pixel (`end_col`).
        iii. In the corresponding row of the *output* grid, set the color of all pixels from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) to the color of the pair.
4.  After processing all rows, the output grid contains the final transformed result.
