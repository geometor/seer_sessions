task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9). Often just a single row in examples.
  - element: pixel
    description: Individual cell with color and position (row, column).
  - element: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels.
objects:
  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: A pixel with color > 0.
    identified_by: Pixel value > 0.
  - object: consecutive_pixel_pair
    description: Two non_white_pixels of the same color within the same row, ordered by column index, such that there are only white pixels (color 0) between them in that row.
    properties:
      - pixel1: The non_white_pixel with the smaller column index.
      - pixel2: The non_white_pixel with the larger column index.
      - color: The color shared by pixel1 and pixel2.
      - row_index: The row where the pair exists.
      - start_col: Column index of pixel1.
      - end_col: Column index of pixel2.
actions:
  - action: find_consecutive_pairs
    description: For each row, identify all pairs of consecutive non_white_pixels of the same color.
    inputs:
      - row
    outputs:
      - list_of_consecutive_pixel_pairs
  - action: fill_between_pair
    description: For each identified consecutive_pixel_pair, change the color of all pixels in the output grid between start_col and end_col (inclusive) in the corresponding row_index to the pair's color.
    inputs:
      - consecutive_pixel_pair (containing row_index, start_col, end_col, color)
    outputs:
      - Modified row segment in the output grid.
relationships:
  - relationship: row_independence
    description: The transformation applied to one row depends only on the pixels within that row.
  - relationship: color_consistency
    description: The fill color is determined by the color of the non_white_pixels forming the consecutive pair.
  - relationship: intra_row_adjacency
    description: The key relationship is between non-white pixels adjacent horizontally within the same row, separated only by white pixels.
