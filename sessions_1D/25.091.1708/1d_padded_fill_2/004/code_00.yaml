task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors 0-9. Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - element: pixel
    description: Individual cell in the grid with a color value.
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0 to 9. 0 is white/background.
      - position: Row and column index.
  - element: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels in the grid. Transformations are applied independently to each row.
objects:
  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: A pixel with a color other than 0 (white).
    identified_by: Pixel value > 0.
  - object: row_span
    description: A horizontal segment within a single row defined by the extent of non-white pixels in the input row.
    properties:
      - start_column: Column index of the leftmost non_white_pixel in the input row.
      - end_column: Column index of the rightmost non_white_pixel in the input row.
      - color: The color of the non_white_pixels in the input row (assumed to be unique within the row based on examples).
      - row_index: The row index where the span exists.
    condition: Exists only if the input row contains at least one non_white_pixel.
actions:
  - action: identify_row_span_properties
    description: For each row in the input grid, find the minimum and maximum column index of any non_white_pixel and determine their color.
    inputs:
      - row (from input grid)
    outputs:
      - start_column (or null if no non_white_pixels)
      - end_column (or null if no non_white_pixels)
      - color (or null if no non_white_pixels)
  - action: fill_row_span
    description: In the output grid, set the color of all pixels within the identified row_span (inclusive of start and end columns) to the span's color.
    condition: Only if a row_span exists for the corresponding input row (i.e., the input row contained non_white_pixels).
    inputs:
      - row_index
      - start_column
      - end_column
      - color
    outputs:
      - Modified row in the output grid.
relationships:
  - relationship: row_independence
    description: The transformation applied to one row depends only on the content of that same row in the input.
  - relationship: color_inheritance
    description: The fill color used in the output row is determined solely by the color of the non_white_pixels found in the corresponding input row.
  - relationship: span_definition
    description: The horizontal extent of the fill operation in a row is defined by the minimum and maximum column indices of *all* non-white pixels present in that input row.
