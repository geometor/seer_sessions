## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input format. The inputs provided (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) are presented as flat strings of space-separated integers, not as 2D lists or arrays which the `transform` function expected. The function, therefore, treated the input as having only one row (or failed to process it correctly with NumPy), and the condition `len(non_white_indices) == 2` was never met for any effective "row" it perceived.

The core transformation logic (finding two non-white pixels in a row and filling between them) appears correct based on visually comparing the *intended* input grids (if reshaped) and the outputs.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Input Preprocessing:** Confirm the dimensions of the grid represented by the flat string. Assuming a square grid, the length of the string (number of elements) will be `N*N`. We need to calculate `N` and reshape the input string into an `N x N` grid *before* applying the transformation logic.
2.  **Verify Logic:** Re-run the core logic on the correctly reshaped input grids to ensure it produces the expected outputs.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to explicitly mention the input format and the necessary reshaping step.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the input strings to determine the grid dimensions and check the number of non-white pixels per row *after* reshaping.

        results[name] = f"Error: Cannot form a square grid from {num_pixels} pixels."
        continue

```
**Revised Assessment:**

The code execution reveals a critical misunderstanding. The input strings **do not represent square grids**. Each string contains 42 elements. 42 is not a perfect square. This invalidates the assumption of a 6x6 grid.

Let's re-examine the *visual* representation from the initial problem description (which might be different from the string representation provided later):

*   **train_1 input:** Seems like 6 rows, 7 columns (6x7 = 42).
*   **train_1 output:** Seems like 6 rows, 7 columns.
*   **train_2 input:** Seems like 6 rows, 7 columns.
*   **train_2 output:** Seems like 6 rows, 7 columns.
*   **train_3 input:** Seems like 6 rows, 7 columns.
*   **train_3 output:** Seems like 6 rows, 7 columns.

**New Strategy:**

1.  **Input Preprocessing:** Reshape the input string into a 6x7 grid.
2.  **Verify Logic:** Apply the transformation logic (find two non-white pixels per row, fill between) to the 6x7 grid.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update facts and the program to reflect the 6x7 grid structure and the row-based filling operation.

Let's re-run the metric gathering with the 6x7 assumption.

```
**Final Reassessment:**

The metrics *still* show that **no row contains exactly two non-white pixels** even when interpreted as a 6x7 grid. The `non_white_counts_per_row` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` for all examples. This means each row in the input has only *one* non-white pixel.

This contradicts the initial visual interpretation and the proposed logic. Let's reconsider the visual input/output pairs *carefully*.

*   **train_1:** Input has single gray pixels in column 0. Output has horizontal gray lines starting from column 0 and extending to column 6 (filling 7 cells).
*   **train_2:** Input has single gray pixels in column 6. Output has horizontal gray lines starting from column 6 and extending *backwards* to column 1 (filling 6 cells).
*   **train_3:** Input has single magenta pixels in column 3. Output has horizontal magenta lines starting from column 3 and extending to column 7 (filling 5 cells).

**New Hypothesis:**

The transformation rule seems to be:

1.  Identify the single non-white pixel in each row.
2.  Determine its color and column index (`c`).
3.  Determine the width (`W`) of the grid.
4.  In the output grid, fill the corresponding row with that color, starting from column `c` to column `W-1` (inclusive).

Let's test this hypothesis mentally:

*   **train_1:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 0), color 5. Fill row `r` from col 0 to col 6 with 5. -> Matches output.
*   **train_2:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 6), color 5. Fill row `r` from col 6 to col 6 with 5. -> **Does not match output.** The output fills from col 1 to col 6.
*   **train_3:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 3), color 6. Fill row `r` from col 3 to col 6 with 6. -> Matches output.

Okay, `train_2` breaks the simple "fill to the right edge" rule. What's different about `train_2`? The single pixel is in the *last* column (index 6).

**Revised Hypothesis 2:**

1.  Identify the single non-white pixel in each row. Let its color be `color` and column index be `c`.
2.  Determine the width (`W`) of the grid.
3.  If the pixel is *not* in the last column (`c < W-1`): Fill the output row from column `c` to column `W-1` (inclusive) with `color`.
4.  If the pixel *is* in the last column (`c == W-1`): Fill the output row from column `1` to column `W-1` (inclusive) with `color`.

Let's test this:

*   **train_1:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 0), color 5. `c=0 < 6`. Fill row `r` from col 0 to col 6 with 5. -> Matches output.
*   **train_2:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 6), color 5. `c=6 == 6`. Fill row `r` from col 1 to col 6 with 5. -> Matches output.
*   **train_3:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 3), color 6. `c=3 < 6`. Fill row `r` from col 3 to col 6 with 6. -> Matches output.

This hypothesis seems consistent with all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Parse Input:** Read the input string of space-separated integers.
2.  **Reshape Grid:** Determine the grid dimensions (6 rows, 7 columns). Reshape the input data into a 6x7 grid.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create an empty 6x7 output grid, initially filled with white (0).
4.  **Iterate Rows:** For each row `r` from 0 to 5:
    a.  **Find Marker:** Locate the single non-white pixel in the input grid's row `r`. Record its column index `c` and its color `fill_color`.
    b.  **Check Position:** Determine if the marker pixel is in the last column (`c == 6`).
    c.  **Fill Output Row:**
        i.  **If `c == 6`:** Fill the output grid's row `r` from column 1 to column 6 (inclusive) with `fill_color`.
        ii. **If `c < 6`:** Fill the output grid's row `r` from column `c` to column 6 (inclusive) with `fill_color`.
5.  **Return Output:** Return the completed 6x7 output grid.
