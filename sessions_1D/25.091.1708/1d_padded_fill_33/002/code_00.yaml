task_description: Fill parts of rows based on the position of a single non-white pixel in that row.
grid_properties:
  format: Input is a flat string of space-separated integers representing a grid.
  dimensions: 6 rows x 7 columns (height=6, width=7) based on element count (42) and visual examples.
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: Marker Pixel
    description: A single non-white pixel present in each row of the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Varies (gray=5, magenta=6).
      column_index: Defines the start or end point of the fill operation.
      unique_per_row: True (based on examples).
actions:
  - name: Reshape Input
    description: Convert the flat input string into a 6x7 grid (NumPy array or list of lists).
  - name: Identify Marker Pixel
    description: For each row, find the column index 'c' and color 'color' of the single non-white pixel.
  - name: Fill Row Segment
    description: Modify the corresponding row in the output grid based on the marker pixel's position.
    conditions:
      - condition: If the marker pixel is in the last column (c == width - 1).
        effect: Fill the row from column 1 to column 'c' (inclusive) with 'color'. The pixel at column 0 remains white.
      - condition: If the marker pixel is not in the last column (c < width - 1).
        effect: Fill the row from column 'c' to the last column (width - 1) (inclusive) with 'color'. Pixels before column 'c' remain white.
output_grid:
  properties:
    dimensions: Same as input (6x7).
    content: Contains horizontal segments of color determined by the input marker pixels, on a white background.
