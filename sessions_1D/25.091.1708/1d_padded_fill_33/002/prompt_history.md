Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are square grids (6x6 in the examples).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) as the background and one other non-
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    For each row in the input grid:
    1. Find all non-white (non-0) pixels.
    2. If exactly two non-white pixels are found in a row:
       a. Determine the color of these pixels (they should be the same color).
       b. Find the column indices of these two pixels.
       c. Fill all cells in that row, between and including these two column indices, with the identified color.
    3. If a row does not have exactly two non-white pixels, it remains unchanged in the output.
