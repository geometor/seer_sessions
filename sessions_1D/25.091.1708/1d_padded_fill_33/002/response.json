            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input format. The inputs provided (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) are presented as flat strings of space-separated integers, not as 2D lists or arrays which the `transform` function expected. The function, therefore, treated the input as having only one row (or failed to process it correctly with NumPy), and the condition `len(non_white_indices) == 2` was never met for any effective \"row\" it perceived.\n\nThe core transformation logic (finding two non-white pixels in a row and filling between them) appears correct based on visually comparing the *intended* input grids (if reshaped) and the outputs.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Input Preprocessing:** Confirm the dimensions of the grid represented by the flat string. Assuming a square grid, the length of the string (number of elements) will be `N*N`. We need to calculate `N` and reshape the input string into an `N x N` grid *before* applying the transformation logic.\n2.  **Verify Logic:** Re-run the core logic on the correctly reshaped input grids to ensure it produces the expected outputs.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to explicitly mention the input format and the necessary reshaping step.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the input strings to determine the grid dimensions and check the number of non-white pixels per row *after* reshaping.\n\n"

The `non_white_counts_per_row` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` for all examples. This means each row in the input has only *one* non-white pixel.\n\nThis contradicts the initial visual interpretation and the proposed logic. Let's reconsider the visual input/output pairs *carefully*.\n\n*   **train_1:** Input has single gray pixels in column 0. Output has horizontal gray lines starting from column 0 and extending to column 6 (filling 7 cells).\n*   **train_2:** Input has single gray pixels in column 6. Output has horizontal gray lines starting from column 6 and extending *backwards* to column 1 (filling 6 cells).\n*   **train_3:** Input has single magenta pixels in column 3. Output has horizontal magenta lines starting from column 3 and extending to column 7 (filling 5 cells).\n\n**New Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation rule seems to be:\n\n1.  Identify the single non-white pixel in each row.\n2.  Determine its color and column index (`c`).\n3.  Determine the width (`W`) of the grid.\n4.  In the output grid, fill the corresponding row with that color, starting from column `c` to column `W-1` (inclusive).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis mentally:\n\n*   **train_1:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 0), color 5. Fill row `r` from col 0 to col 6 with 5. -> Matches output.\n*   **train_2:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 6), color 5. Fill row `r` from col 6 to col 6 with 5. -> **Does not match output.** The output fills from col 1 to col 6.\n*   **train_3:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 3), color 6. Fill row `r` from col 3 to col 6 with 6. -> Matches output.\n\nOkay, `train_2` breaks the simple \"fill to the right edge\" rule. What's different about `train_2`? The single pixel is in the *last* column (index 6).\n\n**Revised Hypothesis 2:**\n\n1.  Identify the single non-white pixel in each row. Let its color be `color` and column index be `c`.\n2.  Determine the width (`W`) of the grid.\n3.  If the pixel is *not* in the last column (`c < W-1`): Fill the output row from column `c` to column `W-1` (inclusive) with `color`.\n4.  If the pixel *is* in the last column (`c == W-1`): Fill the output row from column `1` to column `W-1` (inclusive) with `color`.\n\nLet's test this:\n\n*   **train_1:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 0), color 5. `c=0 < 6`. Fill row `r` from col 0 to col 6 with 5. -> Matches output.\n*   **train_2:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 6), color 5. `c=6 == 6`. Fill row `r` from col 1 to col 6 with 5. -> Matches output.\n*   **train_3:** Width=7. Pixel at (r, 3), color 6. `c=3 < 6`. Fill row `r` from col 3 to col 6 with 6. -> Matches output.\n\nThis hypothesis seems consistent with all examples.\n\n## Documented Facts (YAML)\n\n"
