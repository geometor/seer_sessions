Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are square grids (6x6 in the examples).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) as the background and one other non-

       b. Find the column indices of these two pixels.
       c. Fill all cells in that row, between and including these two column indices, with the identified color.
