"""
Transforms a 6x7 input grid based on the position and color of a single non-white 'marker' pixel in each row, applying different rules for even and odd rows.

1. Initialize a new 6x7 output grid filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
2. For each row `r` (from 0 to 5) in the input grid:
    a. Find the single non-white pixel (the "marker"). Let its column index be `c` and its color be `clr`.
    b. Check if the row index `r` is even (0, 2, 4) or odd (1, 3, 5).
    c. If `r` is even:
        i. If `c` is 0, fill the output row `r` from column 0 to 6 (inclusive) with `clr`.
        ii. If `c` is 3, fill the output row `r` from column 3 to 6 (inclusive) with `clr`.
        iii. Otherwise (if `c` is any other value), place the marker `clr` at `(r, c)` in the output grid.
    d. If `r` is odd:
        i. If `c` is 4, fill the output row `r` from column 0 to 5 (inclusive) with `clr`.
        ii. Otherwise (if `c` is any other value), place the marker `clr` at `(r, c)` in the output grid.
3. Return the completed output grid.
