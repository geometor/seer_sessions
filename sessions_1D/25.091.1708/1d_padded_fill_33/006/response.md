Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code (`code_00.py`) failed on all training examples, producing completely white grids. The core assumption in that code was that each relevant row contained *exactly two* non-white pixels, which were then used as endpoints for filling. The results clearly show this assumption is incorrect. The code failed because the condition `len(non_white_indices) == 2` was never met for any row in the examples, therefore no modifications were made to the initial white output grid.

The strategy is to re-examine the input-output pairs, paying close attention to:
1.  The actual number of non-white pixels in each input row.
2.  The position and color of these pixels.
3.  How the output pattern relates to the input pixel's position, color, and potentially the row index.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's confirm the grid dimensions and analyze the pixel patterns row by row.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a flat list representing a 6x7 grid. Reshape the input into a 6x7 array.
2.  Create a new 6x7 output grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from row index `r = 0` to `r = 5`.
4.  For each input row `r`:
    a.  Find the single non-white pixel (the "marker"). Identify its column index `c` and its color `clr`.
    b.  Check if the row index `r` is even or odd.
    c.  **If `r` is even (0, 2, 4):**
        i.  If the marker's column `c` is 0, fill the entire corresponding output row `r` (columns 0 through 6) with the marker's color `clr`.
        ii. If the marker's column `c` is 3, fill the corresponding output row `r` from column 3 through 6 (inclusive) with the marker's color `clr`.
        iii. Otherwise (if `c` is any other value, e.g., 6), place a single pixel of color `clr` at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid, leaving the rest of the output row white.
    d.  **If `r` is odd (1, 3, 5):**
        i.  If the marker's column `c` is 4, fill the corresponding output row `r` from column 0 through 5 (inclusive) with the marker's color `clr`. Leave column 6 white.
        ii. Otherwise (if `c` is any other value, e.g., 0), place a single pixel of color `clr` at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid, leaving the rest of the output row white.
5.  After processing all rows, return the completed 6x7 output grid (converted back to a list of lists if necessary).
