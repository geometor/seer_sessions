Based on the number of elements (42) and the visual pattern in the examples, the grids appear to be 3 rows high and 14 columns wide.\n2.  **Color Usage:** Each example uses exactly two colors: white (0) as the background and one other color (gray=5, orange=7, or red=2). The specific non-white color changes between examples but is consistent within a single input/output pair.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** In the input grids, the non-white pixels are sparsely placed within each row. Often, there are two or more non-white pixels per row, separated by white pixels.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output grids, horizontal segments are formed using the non-white color. These segments appear to span the gap between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels found in the corresponding input row.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve finding the horizontal extent (leftmost to rightmost occurrence) of the non-white color in each row of the input and then filling that entire horizontal span with the same non-white color in the output grid. Rows containing only white pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Find the column index of the first (leftmost) pixel with color `C`. Store this as `start_col`. If no pixel has color `C`, `start_col` is undefined.\n    b.  Find the column index of the last (rightmost) pixel with color `C`. Store this as `end_col`. If no pixel has color `C`, `end_col` is undefined.\n    c.

If color `C` was not found in row `r` (i.e., `start_col` and `end_col` are undefined), leave row `r` of the output grid as all white.\n6.  Return the completed output grid."
