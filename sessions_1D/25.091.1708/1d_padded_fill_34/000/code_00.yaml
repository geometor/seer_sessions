task_description: Fill horizontal segments defined by the first and last non-white pixels in each row.
grid_properties:
  height: 3
  width: 14
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0), gray (5), orange (7), or red (2)
  - type: horizontal_segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels within a single row.
relationships:
  - The non-white color used is consistent within an input-output pair but varies across pairs.
  - In the input, non-white pixels act as markers for segment boundaries within each row.
  - In the output, horizontal segments are filled with the non-white color.
transformation:
  - Identify the unique non-white color present in the input grid.
  - For each row:
    - Find the column index of the first occurrence of the non-white color.
    - Find the column index of the last occurrence of the non-white color.
    - If non-white pixels exist in the row:
      - Create the corresponding output row by filling all pixels between the first and last column index (inclusive) with the non-white color.
      - Pixels outside this range remain white.
    - If no non-white pixels exist in the row:
      - Copy the row unchanged (all white) to the output.
  - The output grid dimensions are the same as the input grid dimensions.
