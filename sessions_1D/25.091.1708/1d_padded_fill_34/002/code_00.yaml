task_description: Fill horizontal segments in each row, bounded by the first and last non-white pixels in that row.
grid_properties:
  size_relation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  dimensions:
    height: 3 (consistent across examples)
    width: 14 (consistent across examples)
colors:
  background: white (0)
  foreground: A single non-white color per example (gray=5, orange=7, red=2 observed). This color is used for marking boundaries and filling segments.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer 0-9
  - type: row_segment
    definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels within a single row.
    properties:
      bounding_color: The single non-white color present in the input grid.
      start_column: Index of the first (leftmost) pixel of the bounding_color in the input row.
      end_column: Index of the last (rightmost) pixel of the bounding_color in the input row.
transformation_logic:
  - per_row: The transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - steps:
      1. Identify the single non-white color (C) present in the input grid.
      2. For each row in the input grid:
         a. Find the column index of the first occurrence of C (min_col).
         b. Find the column index of the last occurrence of C (max_col).
         c. If C exists in the row (min_col and max_col are defined):
            - In the corresponding output row, set the color of pixels from min_col to max_col (inclusive) to C.
            - Set all other pixels in the output row (before min_col and after max_col) to the background color (white, 0).
         d. If C does not exist in the row:
            - Copy the input row (all white) to the corresponding output row.
