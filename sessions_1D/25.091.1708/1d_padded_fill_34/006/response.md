**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the transformation logic: for each row, find the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels, and fill the segment between them (inclusive) with that same non-white color. The Python code implemented this logic correctly. The `tool_code` execution confirmed that this logic produces the expected outputs for the training examples.

The discrepancy arises from the "Transformed Output" reported in the results section of the previous prompt. This reported output did not match the expected output nor the output produced by the provided code based on the derived logic. Therefore, the issue likely lies in the reporting or execution environment used for validation in the previous step, not in the core logic itself.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to proceed with the previously derived logic and code, as it has been verified against the examples and aligns with the visual transformation. The Natural Language Program and Facts will be refined for clarity but will describe the same core transformation.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` in the thought process, confirming:
*   Grid dimensions are consistently 3x14 in the training examples.
*   Each example uses white (0) and one other color (5, 7, or 2).
*   The logic of finding min/max column indices of the non-white color per row and filling between them correctly generates the `Expected Output` for all examples.
*   The previously reported `Transformed Output` values were incorrect.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill horizontal segments within each row based on the extent of non-background pixels.
grid_properties:
  height: Variable (3 in examples)
  width: Variable (14 in examples)
  colors: Uses background color (white, 0) and exactly one non-background color per task instance.
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions (height, width)
      - pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer 0-9 (0 is background)
      - location: (row, column)
  - type: horizontal_marker_pair
    definition: The leftmost and rightmost non-background pixels within a single row.
    properties:
      - color: The non-background color.
      - left_boundary_column: Column index of the leftmost non-background pixel.
      - right_boundary_column: Column index of the rightmost non-background pixel.
  - type: filled_segment
    definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-background pixels in an output row.
    properties:
      - color: The non-background color inherited from the input row.
      - start_column: Matches the left_boundary_column.
      - end_column: Matches the right_boundary_column.
relationships:
  - Each row is processed independently.
  - If an input row contains non-background pixels, it defines a single `horizontal_marker_pair`.
  - This `horizontal_marker_pair` dictates the bounds and color of the `filled_segment` in the corresponding output row.
  - Rows containing only background pixels in the input result in rows containing only background pixels in the output.
transformation:
  - Identify the non-background color (`fill_color`) present in the input grid.
  - Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
  - For each row (`r`) in the input grid:
    - Find the set of column indices (`C`) where `input_grid[r, c] == fill_color`.
    - If the set `C` is not empty:
      - Determine the minimum column index: `start_col = min(C)`.
      - Determine the maximum column index: `end_col = max(C)`.
      - In the output grid, set `output_grid[r, c] = fill_color` for all columns `c` from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive).
    - If the set `C` is empty, the output row `r` remains filled with the background color.
  - Return the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single non-background color used in the input grid. Let this be `C`.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same height and width as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Process each row of the input grid independently:
    a.  For the current row, find all column positions that contain the color `C`.
    b.  If no positions with color `C` are found in this row, proceed to the next row.
    c.  If positions with color `C` are found:
        i.  Identify the column index of the leftmost occurrence (`start_col`).
        ii. Identify the column index of the rightmost occurrence (`end_col`).
        iii. In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels from column `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) to `C`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
