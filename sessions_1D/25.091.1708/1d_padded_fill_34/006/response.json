            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the transformation logic: for each row, find the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels, and fill the segment between them (inclusive) with that same non-white color. The Python code implemented this logic correctly. The `tool_code` execution confirmed that this logic produces the expected outputs for the training examples.\n\nThe discrepancy arises from the \"Transformed Output\" reported in the results section of the previous prompt. This reported output did not match the expected output nor the output produced by the provided code based on the derived logic. Therefore, the issue likely lies in the reporting or execution environment used for validation in the previous step, not in the core logic itself.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to proceed with the previously derived logic and code, as it has been verified against the examples and aligns with the visual transformation. The Natural Language Program and Facts will be refined for clarity but will describe the same core transformation.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nMetrics were gathered using `tool_code` in the thought process, confirming:\n*   Grid dimensions are consistently 3x14 in the training examples.\n*   Each example uses white (0) and one other color (5, 7, or 2).\n*   The logic of finding min/max column indices of the non-white color per row and filling between them correctly generates the `Expected Output` for all examples.\n*   The previously reported `Transformed Output` values were incorrect.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
