Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids. Based on the number of elements (42) and the visual pattern in the examples, the grids appear to be 3 rows high and 14 columns wide.
2.  **Color Usage:** Each example uses exactly two colors: white (0) as the background and one other color (gray=5, orange=7, or red=2). The specific non-white color changes between examples but is consistent within a single input/output pair.
3.  **Input Pattern:** In the input grids, the non-white pixels are sparsely placed within each row. Often, there are two or more non-white pixels per row, separated by white pixels.
4.  **Output Pattern:** In the output grids, horizontal segments are formed using the non-white color. These segments appear to span the gap between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels found in the corresponding input row.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve finding the horizontal extent (leftmost to rightmost occurrence) of the non-white color in each row of the input and then filling that entire horizontal span with the same non-white color in the output grid. Rows containing only white pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill horizontal segments defined by the first and last non-white pixels in each row.
grid_properties:
  height: 3
  width: 14
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0), gray (5), orange (7), or red (2)
  - type: horizontal_segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels within a single row.
relationships:
  - The non-white color used is consistent within an input-output pair but varies across pairs.
  - In the input, non-white pixels act as markers for segment boundaries within each row.
  - In the output, horizontal segments are filled with the non-white color.
transformation:
  - Identify the unique non-white color present in the input grid.
  - For each row:
    - Find the column index of the first occurrence of the non-white color.
    - Find the column index of the last occurrence of the non-white color.
    - If non-white pixels exist in the row:
      - Create the corresponding output row by filling all pixels between the first and last column index (inclusive) with the non-white color.
      - Pixels outside this range remain white.
    - If no non-white pixels exist in the row:
      - Copy the row unchanged (all white) to the output.
  - The output grid dimensions are the same as the input grid dimensions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.
2.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid. Let this color be `C`.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with white (0).
4.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom (row index `r` from 0 to height-1).
5.  For the current row `r`:
    a.  Find the column index of the first (leftmost) pixel with color `C`. Store this as `start_col`. If no pixel has color `C`, `start_col` is undefined.
    b.  Find the column index of the last (rightmost) pixel with color `C`. Store this as `end_col`. If no pixel has color `C`, `end_col` is undefined.
    c.  If both `start_col` and `end_col` were found for row `r`:
        i.  Iterate through the columns from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive).
        ii. For each column index `c` in this range, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to color `C`.
    d.  If color `C` was not found in row `r` (i.e., `start_col` and `end_col` are undefined), leave row `r` of the output grid as all white.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
