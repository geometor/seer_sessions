Fill horizontal segments in each row defined by the first and last occurrence of the non-white pixel color.

For each row in the input grid:
1. Identify the unique non-white color present in the entire input grid.
2. Find the column index of the leftmost occurrence of this non-white color in the row.
3. Find the column index of the rightmost occurrence of this non-white color in the row.
4. If non-white pixels are found in the row, fill the corresponding row in the output grid 
   between the leftmost and rightmost indices (inclusive) with that non-white color.
5. If a row contains only the background color (white, 0), leave the corresponding row in the
