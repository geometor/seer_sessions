task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)

input_features:
  - property: grid_dimensions
    value: [1, N] # N was 51 in the examples
  - property: background_color
    value: 0 (white)
  - property: foreground_element
    description: Pixels of a single non-white color C.
    value_constraint: Only one color C != 0 exists in the input.
    occurrence: Present at multiple indices in the row.

transformation:
  - action: identify_color
    description: Determine the non-white color C present in the input row.
  - action: find_indices
    description: Find all column indices where color C appears.
  - action: find_bounds
    input: indices of color C
    description: Determine the minimum (min_col) and maximum (max_col) index among the found indices.
  - action: fill_segment
    output_grid: Create a new 1xN grid, initially all white (0).
    description: Set the color of pixels from min_col to max_col (inclusive) in the output grid to color C.

output_features:
  - property: grid_dimensions
    value: Same as input [1, N]
  - property: background_color
    value: 0 (white)
  - property: foreground_element
    description: A single contiguous horizontal segment of color C.
    location: Spans columns from min_col to max_col identified from the input.
    color: Same color C as identified in the input.
