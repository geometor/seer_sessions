            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The examples show input and output grids represented as flat strings of numbers. Based on the transformation pattern (filling horizontal segments) and the length of the strings (42 and 51 respectively, which are not common grid dimensions like 6x7 or 7x6 that would immediately fit the pairs), it seems most likely these represent single rows (1xN grids). The tool usage confirmed they are 1x51 grids.\n2.  **Color Usage:** Each input grid contains white pixels (0) and pixels of exactly one other color (orange-7 in example 1 & 2, red-2 in example 3).\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation identifies the locations of the non-white pixels in the input row. It then finds the leftmost (minimum index) and rightmost (maximum index) occurrence of this color. The output grid is generated by filling all pixels between these minimum and maximum indices (inclusive) with that same non-white color. Pixels outside this range remain white.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The key \"objects\" are the contiguous segments of the non-white color in the input, although they might be separated by white pixels. The transformation effectively finds the bounding box (in 1D) of all instances of the non-white color and fills it.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
