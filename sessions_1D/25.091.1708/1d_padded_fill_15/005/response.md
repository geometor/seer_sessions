Transformation Rule:
1. Given an input grid (which is assumed to be a single row), create a new output grid of the same size, initially filled with white pixels (color 0).
2. Identify the single non-white color C used in the input row.
3. Find all the column positions (indices) where color C appears in the input row. Collect these indices into a sorted list.
4. Check if the number of identified indices is even. If not, something is unexpected, return the initial white grid.
5. Iterate through the sorted list of indices, taking them two at a time: the first index is start_1, the second is end_1; the third index is start_2, the fourth is end_2; and so on.
6. For each pair (start_index, end_index) obtained, modify the output grid: set the color of all pixels in the row from column start_index to end_index (inclusive) to color C.
7. Return the modified output grid.
