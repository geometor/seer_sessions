task_type: horizontal_segment_fill
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Interpreted as 1xN rows based on transformation logic
background_color: 0 (white)

input_objects:
  - object: background
    color: 0
    description: The predominant color in the grid.
  - object: foreground_pixels
    color: C (where C is a single color != 0, e.g., 7 or 2)
    description: Multiple individual pixels of the same non-background color scattered within the background.
    properties:
      - count: Fixed number (6) in all examples, though likely variable in general.
      - distribution: Located at various column indices within the single row.

actions:
  - action: identify_foreground_color
    input: input_grid
    output: color C
    description: Find the unique non-zero color present in the input grid.
  - action: find_foreground_indices
    input: input_grid, color C
    output: list_of_indices
    description: Identify all column indices where color C appears in the (first row of the) input grid.
  - action: determine_horizontal_bounds
    input: list_of_indices
    output: min_index, max_index
    description: Find the minimum and maximum values in the list of column indices.
  - action: create_output_grid
    input: input_grid_shape
    output: output_grid (initialized with background color 0)
    description: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (0).
  - action: fill_segment
    input: output_grid, min_index, max_index, color C
    output: modified output_grid
    description: In the first row of the output grid, change the color of all pixels from column min_index to max_index (inclusive) to color C.

output_objects:
  - object: background
    color: 0
    description: Fills the grid outside the filled segment.
  - object: filled_segment
    color: C (same as input foreground color)
    description: A single contiguous horizontal block of color C.
    location: Spans the first row from column min_index to max_index (inclusive), where bounds are determined from the input foreground pixels.
