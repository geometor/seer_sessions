task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: marker_pixels
    color: non-white (e.g., magenta (6), gray (5))
    properties:
      - appear_in_pairs
      - define_segments
relationships:
  - type: pairing
    description: Non-white pixels of the same color form pairs based on their position in the row. Assuming sorted indices i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4..., pairs are (i_1, i_2), (i_3, i_4), etc.
  - type: spatial_containment
    description: White pixels located between the indices of a pair are spatially contained within the segment defined by that pair.
actions:
  - action: identify_pairs
    inputs: input_row
    outputs: list_of_pairs (each pair contains indices and color)
    description: Find all non-white pixels. For each non-white color, sort the indices of pixels with that color. Group the sorted indices into consecutive pairs [(idx1, idx2), (idx3, idx4), ...].
  - action: fill_segment
    inputs: pair (indices idx1, idx2; color C), row
    outputs: modified_row
    description: For a given pair with color C at indices idx1 and idx2 (idx1 < idx2), change the color of all pixels in the row from index idx1 + 1 to idx2 - 1 (inclusive) to color C.
transformation_goal: Fill the segments between identified pairs of non-white pixels with the color of the respective pair.
