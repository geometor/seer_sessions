"""
Transforms the input 2D grid by processing each row independently. 
For each row:
1. Identifies pairs of pixels of the same non-white color based on their column indices.
2. Fills the horizontal segment (pixels) between each pair with the color of that pair.
Assumes the input grid can be represented as a rectangular 2D structure. 
Handles the potential length inconsistency in train_1 by focusing on the row-wise pattern observed in all examples' outputs.
