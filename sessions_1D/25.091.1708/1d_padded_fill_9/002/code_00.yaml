task_type: grid_transformation_rowwise
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  dimensions: 3x18 (inferred)
  background_color: white (0)
components:
  - type: row_segment
    properties:
      - defined_by_pairs_of_pixels
      - endpoints_share_same_non_white_color
      - interior_initially_white
objects_in_input:
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: non-white (magenta (6), gray (5))
    properties:
      - occur_in_pairs_within_each_row
      - define_horizontal_segments
relationships:
  - type: row_containment
    description: Each row is processed independently.
  - type: pairing
    description: Within each row, non-white pixels of the same color form pairs based on their column index. Assuming sorted column indices c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4... for a color C in a row, pairs are (c_1, c_2), (c_3, c_4), etc.
  - type: spatial_containment
    description: White pixels located horizontally between the column indices of a pair within the same row are contained within the segment defined by that pair.
actions:
  - action: identify_row_pairs
    inputs: grid_row
    outputs: list_of_pairs (each pair contains column indices and color)
    description: For a single row, find all non-white pixels. For each non-white color C, sort the column indices of pixels with that color. Group the sorted indices into consecutive pairs [(col1, col2), (col3, col4), ...].
  - action: fill_horizontal_segment
    inputs: pair (column indices col1, col2; color C), row_array
    outputs: modified_row_array
    description: For a given pair in a row with color C at columns col1 and col2 (col1 < col2), change the color of all pixels in that row from column col1 + 1 to col2 - 1 (inclusive) to color C.
transformation_goal: For each row independently, identify pairs of pixels of the same non-white color and fill the horizontal segment between each pair with that color.
data_issues:
  - example: train_1
    issue: Input length (53) inconsistent with output length (54) and standard ARC grid constraints. Assumed typo, treating as 3x18 based on output and other examples.
