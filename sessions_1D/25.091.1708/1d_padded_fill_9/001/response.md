"""
Fill the segments between identified pairs of non-white pixels with the color of the respective pair.

1. Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row.
2. Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input row.
3. For each unique non-white color `C`:
    a. Find the indices of all pixels in the input row that have the color `C`.
    b. Sort these indices in ascending order.
    c. Iterate through the sorted indices, taking them two at a time to form pairs: `(index1, index2)`, `(index3, index4)`, etc.
    d. For each pair `(idx_start, idx_end)`:
        i. Iterate through all indices `j` from `idx_start + 1` up to `idx_end - 1`.
        ii. Set the color of the pixel at index `j` in the output row to `C`.
4. Return the modified output row.
