task_description: Fill the rectangular bounding box defined by the single non-background color present in the input grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels. Dimensions need careful interpretation from flattened input but visually appear wider than tall in examples.
    properties:
      - height: The number of rows (e.g., 3 in examples).
      - width: The number of columns (e.g., 9 in examples).
  - element: background_pixel
    value: 0
    color: white
    description: The pixel color filling most of the grid area.
  - element: foreground_pixel
    description: The single pixel color present in the input grid that is not the background color.
    properties:
      - color_value: Varies (e.g., 5, 3, 6).
      - locations: Appears in specific locations, often forming distinct shapes (like two vertical lines in the examples).
  - element: bounding_box
    description: The smallest rectangle enclosing all foreground pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - min_row: The minimum row index containing a foreground pixel.
      - max_row: The maximum row index containing a foreground pixel.
      - min_col: The minimum column index containing a foreground pixel.
      - max_col: The maximum column index containing a foreground pixel.
      - area: (max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)
  - element: filled_rectangle
    description: The rectangular area in the output grid corresponding to the input bounding box, filled with the foreground color.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the foreground color.
      - location: Occupies rows from min_row to max_row and columns from min_col to max_col.
      - pixel_count: Equal to the area of the bounding_box.

relationships:
  - type: defines
    subject: foreground_pixel_locations_in_input
    object: bounding_box
    description: The set of all coordinates containing the foreground pixel defines the parameters (min/max row/col) of the bounding box.
  - type: determines
    subject: input_grid_dimensions
    object: output_grid_dimensions
    description: The output grid has the same height and width as the input grid.
  - type: transformation
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid by calculating the bounding box of the foreground color and filling that corresponding area in the output grid with the foreground color, setting all other pixels to the background color.

actions:
  - action: determine_grid_shape
    description: Infer the height and width of the grid from the input data (requires careful handling, visual inspection suggests W>H).
  - action: identify_foreground_color
    description: Scan the input grid to find the single color value that is not 0 (background).
  - action: find_foreground_pixels
    description: Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all pixels matching the foreground color.
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    description: Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices from the identified foreground pixel coordinates.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
  - action: fill_bounding_box
    description: In the output grid, set the color of all pixels within the calculated bounding box (inclusive rows and columns) to the identified foreground color.
