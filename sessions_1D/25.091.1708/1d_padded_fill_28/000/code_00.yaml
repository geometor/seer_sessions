task_description: Fill the rectangular bounding box defined by a non-background color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - element: background_pixel
    value: 0
    color: white
    description: The most frequent pixel color, typically filling most of the grid.
  - element: foreground_pixel
    description: The single pixel color present in the input grid that is not the background color. Varies between examples (gray, green, magenta).
  - element: vertical_lines
    description: In the input, the foreground pixels form two distinct, parallel vertical lines of the same height and color.
    properties:
      - height: Consistent within an example (e.g., 3 pixels tall).
      - color: The foreground color.
      - separation: Separated horizontally by one or more background pixels.
  - element: filled_rectangle
    description: In the output, the area spanning horizontally between the leftmost and rightmost foreground pixels and vertically between the topmost and bottommost foreground pixels is filled entirely with the foreground color.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the foreground color from the input.
      - bounds: Defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the foreground pixels in the input.

relationships:
  - type: defines
    subject: foreground_pixels_in_input
    object: bounding_box
    description: The locations of all foreground pixels in the input define a minimum bounding box (minimum/maximum row and column).
  - type: transforms_to
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
  - type: fills
    subject: transformation_rule
    object: bounding_box_in_output
    description: The transformation rule fills the calculated bounding box in the output grid with the foreground color.

actions:
  - action: identify_foreground_color
    description: Find the single color in the input grid that is not the background color (white, 0).
  - action: determine_bounding_box
    description: Find the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column containing any pixel of the foreground color in the input grid.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: fill_rectangle
    description: Set the color of all pixels within the determined bounding box (inclusive) in the output grid to the identified foreground color.
