Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids contain a background color (white, 0) and exactly one other color (gray, green, or magenta in the examples).
2.  **Non-Background Objects**: The non-background color forms two distinct vertical lines of the same height (3 pixels in all examples).
3.  **Spacing**: These vertical lines are separated by one or more columns of the background color.
4.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids retain the same dimensions and background color as the input.
5.  **Transformation**: The transformation fills the rectangular area defined by the bounding box of the non-background pixels in the input grid with that same non-background color. Specifically, it fills the space *between* the two vertical lines, including the columns of the lines themselves, over the same rows occupied by the lines.

## YAML Facts Documentation


```yaml
task_description: Fill the rectangular bounding box defined by a non-background color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - element: background_pixel
    value: 0
    color: white
    description: The most frequent pixel color, typically filling most of the grid.
  - element: foreground_pixel
    description: The single pixel color present in the input grid that is not the background color. Varies between examples (gray, green, magenta).
  - element: vertical_lines
    description: In the input, the foreground pixels form two distinct, parallel vertical lines of the same height and color.
    properties:
      - height: Consistent within an example (e.g., 3 pixels tall).
      - color: The foreground color.
      - separation: Separated horizontally by one or more background pixels.
  - element: filled_rectangle
    description: In the output, the area spanning horizontally between the leftmost and rightmost foreground pixels and vertically between the topmost and bottommost foreground pixels is filled entirely with the foreground color.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the foreground color from the input.
      - bounds: Defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the foreground pixels in the input.

relationships:
  - type: defines
    subject: foreground_pixels_in_input
    object: bounding_box
    description: The locations of all foreground pixels in the input define a minimum bounding box (minimum/maximum row and column).
  - type: transforms_to
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
  - type: fills
    subject: transformation_rule
    object: bounding_box_in_output
    description: The transformation rule fills the calculated bounding box in the output grid with the foreground color.

actions:
  - action: identify_foreground_color
    description: Find the single color in the input grid that is not the background color (white, 0).
  - action: determine_bounding_box
    description: Find the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column containing any pixel of the foreground color in the input grid.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: fill_rectangle
    description: Set the color of all pixels within the determined bounding box (inclusive) in the output grid to the identified foreground color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single non-white color (`C`) present in the input grid.
2.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) of all pixels with color `C` in the input grid. This defines the bounding box of the color `C`.
3.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white (0).
4.  Fill the rectangular region in the new grid from `min_row` to `max_row` (inclusive) and from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) with the color `C`.
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
