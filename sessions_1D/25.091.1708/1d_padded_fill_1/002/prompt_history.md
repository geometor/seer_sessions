*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are always single rows (1D grids).
    *   Each input row contains multiple pixels of a single non-white color (e.g., red in train\_1, blue in train\_2 and train\_3) interspersed with white pixels (color 0).
    *   The transformation involves identifying the locations of the non-white pixels.
    *   The output row is created by filling the segment between the first and the last non-white pixel (inclusive) with that same non-white color.
    *   Pixels outside this segment (before the first non-white pixel and after the last non-white pixel) remain white.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: fill_segment
    input_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
    output_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
    input_elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - color: non-white (e.g., red (2), blue (1))
            count: multiple occurrences
      - type: segment
        definition: contiguous sequence of pixels
        properties:
          - start_index: index of the first non-white pixel
          - end_index: index of the last non-white pixel
          - color: the single non-white color present in the input row
    transformation:
      - action: identify_color
        target: the single non-white color present in the input row
      - action: find_indices
        target: pixels of the identified non-white color
        output: first_index, last_index
      - action: fill_segment
        target: pixels from first_index to last_index (inclusive)
        using: the identified non-white color
      - action: retain_color
        target: pixels before first_index and after last_index
        using: white (0)
    constraints:
      - The input row contains only one type of non-white color.
      - There are at least two non-white pixels in the input row.
      - The output row has the same dimensions as the input row.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input row.
    2.  Find the index (position) of the first occurrence of this non-white color in the row.
    3.  Find the index (position) of the last occurrence of this non-white color in the row.
    4.  Create an output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white (0).
    5.  Fill the pixels in the output row from the first index to the last index (inclusive) with the identified non-white color.
    6.  The resulting row is the final output.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Identifies the single non-white color in the input row.
    Finds the first and last indices of this color.
