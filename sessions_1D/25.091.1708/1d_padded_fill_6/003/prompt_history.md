Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid in all examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0) as the background color and one other 'active' color per example: gray (5) in the first, magenta (6) in the second, and green (3) in the third.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to operate horizontally, row by row.
4.  **Key Observation:** In each row of the output grid, once an active colored pixel appears (reading from left to right), all subsequent white pixels in that same row are changed to that active color.
5.  **Persistence:** The original positions and colors of the non-white pixels from the input are preserved in the output. Pixels to the left of the first non-white pixel in a row also remain unchanged.
6.  **Row Independence:** The processing of each row appears independent of the others. Rows containing only the background color (white) remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill white pixels to the right of the first non-white pixel in each row with that non-white pixel's color.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions_preserved: true
row_processing:
  - independent: true
  - direction: left-to-right
pixel_transformation:
  - condition: Process each row individually.
  - trigger: Find the first pixel (column index `j`) that is not the background color (white). Let its color be `C`.
  - action:
      - If no non-white pixel is found, the row remains unchanged.
      - If a non-white pixel `C` is found at index `j`:
          - Iterate through pixels from index `j + 1` to the end of the row.
          - If a pixel at index `k` (`k > j`) is white (0), change its color to `C`.
          - Pixels at indices less than or equal to `j` remain unchanged.
          - Non-white pixels at indices greater than `j` remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Initialize a variable `first_non_white_color` to `None` and `first_non_white_index` to `-1`.
    b.  Iterate through the pixels of the current row from left to right (column index `j` from 0 to width-1).
    c.  If `first_non_white_color` is still `None`:
        i. Check if the current pixel's color is not white (0).
        ii. If it's not white, store its color in `first_non_white_color` and its column index `j` in `first_non_white_index`.
    d.  If `first_non_white_color` is *not* `None` (meaning the first non-white pixel in this row has been found):
        i. Check if the current pixel at column index `j` is white (0).
        ii. If it is white, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid's current row at column index `j` to `first_non_white_color`.
4.  After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: filling white pixels (0) to the right of the first non-white pixel in each row with that non-white pixel's color. The provided Python code accurately implements this logic.

However, the test results reported in the previous step indicated mismatches and showed transformed outputs inconsistent with both the expected outputs and the implemented logic. Upon closer inspection and reshaping the flattened input/output data (assuming 9x9 dimensions based on the total number of pixels, 81), it appears the provided Python code *does* produce the correct expected output for all three training examples.

The discrepancy likely stems from an error in the previous test execution or reporting phase, where the `Transformed Output` shown did not reflect the actual result of the provided code.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the grid dimensions using `tool_code`.
2.  Re-affirm the existing transformation logic as it correctly matches the input/expected output pairs when visualized correctly.
3.  Provide the metrics, updated facts, and the natural language program based on the confirmed understanding.
