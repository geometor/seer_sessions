task_description: Fill horizontal segments of white pixels in each row based on bounding non-white pixels.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions_preserved: true
row_processing:
  - independent: true
  - direction: left-to-right
pixel_transformation:
  - condition: Process each row individually.
  - objects: Non-white pixels act as delimiters or triggers.
  - actions_per_row:
      - Find all column indices `j` where the pixel is not white (0). Let these be `j_1, j_2, ..., j_n`.
      - If no non-white pixels exist (`n=0`), the row remains unchanged.
      - If one or more non-white pixels exist:
          - Iterate through the segments defined by these pixels. The first segment starts after the first non-white pixel (`j_1`).
          - For the segment starting after pixel `j_i` (color `C_i`):
              - Define the end of the segment: It's the index of the *next* non-white pixel (`j_{i+1}`) or the end of the row if `j_i` is the last non-white pixel.
              - Iterate through column indices `k` from `j_i + 1` up to (but not including) the segment end index.
              - If the pixel at `(row, k)` in the input grid is white (0), change its color in the output grid to the color `C_i` (the color of the non-white pixel at `j_i` that started the segment).
      - Pixels at non-white indices `j_1, j_2, ..., j_n` retain their original color.
      - Pixels before the first non-white pixel (`j_1`) remain unchanged.
