Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid in all examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0) as the background color and one other 'active' color per example: gray (5) in the first, magenta (6) in the second, and green (3) in the third.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to operate horizontally, row by row.
4.  **Key Observation:** In each row of the output grid, once an active colored pixel appears (reading from left to right), all subsequent white pixels in that same row are changed to that active color.
5.  **Persistence:** The original positions and colors of the non-white pixels from the input are preserved in the output. Pixels to the left of the first non-white pixel in a row also remain unchanged.
6.  **Row Independence:** The processing of each row appears independent of the others. Rows containing only the background color (white) remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill white pixels to the right of the first non-white pixel in each row with that non-white pixel's color.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions_preserved: true
row_processing:
  - independent: true
  - direction: left-to-right
pixel_transformation:
  - condition: Process each row individually.
  - trigger: Find the first pixel (column index `j`) that is not the background color (white). Let its color be `C`.
  - action:
      - If no non-white pixel is found, the row remains unchanged.
      - If a non-white pixel `C` is found at index `j`:
          - Iterate through pixels from index `j + 1` to the end of the row.
          - If a pixel at index `k` (`k > j`) is white (0), change its color to `C`.
          - Pixels at indices less than or equal to `j` remain unchanged.
          - Non-white pixels at indices greater than `j` remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Initialize a variable `first_non_white_color` to `None` and `first_non_white_index` to `-1`.
    b.  Iterate through the pixels of the current row from left to right (column index `j` from 0 to width-1).
    c.  If `first_non_white_color` is still `None`:
        i. Check if the current pixel's color is not white (0).
        ii. If it's not white, store its color in `first_non_white_color` and its column index `j` in `first_non_white_index`.
    d.  If `first_non_white_color` is *not* `None` (meaning the first non-white pixel in this row has been found):
        i. Check if the current pixel at column index `j` is white (0).
        ii. If it is white, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid's current row at column index `j` to `first_non_white_color`.
4.  After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation pattern: filling white pixels to the right of the first non-white pixel in each row. However, the execution results revealed inconsistencies. The metrics gathered using `tool_code` highlighted a critical issue: Example 1 has mismatched input and output lengths (80 vs 78), making it unsuitable for deriving or validating the transformation rule reliably. Examples 2 and 3 have consistent lengths (81) and color sets, supporting the initial hypothesis when interpreted with appropriate grid dimensions (e.g., 9x9 or 3x27 for length 81). Example 3 strongly suggests a 9x9 grid based on the input/output patterns.

The failure reported in the previous stage for all examples is likely due to either the inconsistent data in Example 1 or potential issues in the test harness's handling of grid reshaping or reporting, rather than a fundamental flaw in the core logic derived from the visual patterns of the *expected* outputs.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to refine the understanding based *only* on the consistent Examples 2 and 3. We will assume the standard ARC behavior that input and output grids share dimensions. The natural language program will be clarified to emphasize row independence and the specific conditions for color filling, assuming correct grid dimensions are determined prior to applying the logic.

**Metrics:**

| Example | Input Length | Output Length | Input Colors | Output Colors | Likely Shape | Consistent I/O Length | Rule Consistent (Assuming Shape) | Notes                                     |
| :------ | :----------- | :------------ | :----------- | :------------ | :----------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |

| 2       | 81           | 81            | {0, 6}       | {0, 6}        | 3x27 or 9x9  | Yes                   | Yes                              | Transformation works for either shape     |
| 3       | 81           | 81            | {0, 3}       | {0, 3}        | 9x9          | Yes                   | Yes                              | 9x9 strongly suggested by pattern         |

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Horizontally fill rows with color starting from the first non-background pixel.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions_preserved: true # Standard ARC assumption, holds for valid examples (2, 3)
  - shape_inference: May be needed if input is flat. Example 3 (length 81) suggests 9x9. Example 2 (length 81) could be 9x9 or 3x27.
object_focus:
  - type: Horizontal segment trigger
  - identification: The first (leftmost) pixel in a row that is not white (0).
action_on_row:
  - condition: A non-white trigger pixel exists in the row.
  - target_pixels: All white (0) pixels located strictly to the right of the trigger pixel within the same row.
  - transformation: Change the color of target pixels to the color of the trigger pixel for that row.
  - preservation:
      - Pixels to the left of the trigger pixel remain unchanged.
      - The trigger pixel itself remains unchanged.
      - Non-white pixels to the right of the trigger pixel remain unchanged.
row_processing:
  - independent: Each row is processed based solely on its own content.
  - all_white_rows: If a row contains only white (0) pixels, it remains unchanged as no trigger pixel is found.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3.  For each row `r` from 0 to H-1:
    a.  Initialize a variable `fill_color` to `None`.
    b.  Initialize a flag `trigger_found` to `False`.
    c.  Iterate through the columns `c` from 0 to W-1 for the current row `r`:
        i.  Read the `current_color` of the pixel at `(r, c)` from the *input* grid.
        ii. If `trigger_found` is `False`:
            - If `current_color` is not white (0), set `trigger_found` to `True` and store `current_color` in `fill_color`.
        iii. Else (`trigger_found` is `True`):
            - If `current_color` is white (0), change the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `fill_color`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
