"""
Horizontally fills segments of white pixels (0) in each row based on bounding non-white pixels. 
For each row, find all non-white pixels. Iterate through these non-white pixels. 
For each non-white pixel at index `j` with color `C`, determine the index `k` of the next non-white pixel in the same row (or the end of the row if it's the last one). 
Fill all original white pixels between column `j+1` and `k-1` (inclusive) with color `C`.
Pixels at the locations of the original non-white pixels remain unchanged. 
Pixels before the first non-white pixel remain unchanged.
