task_description: Fill white pixels to the right of the first non-white pixel in each row with that non-white pixel's color.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions_preserved: true
row_processing:
  - independent: true
  - direction: left-to-right
pixel_transformation:
  - condition: Process each row individually.
  - trigger: Find the first pixel (column index `j`) that is not the background color (white). Let its color be `C`.
  - action:
      - If no non-white pixel is found, the row remains unchanged.
      - If a non-white pixel `C` is found at index `j`:
          - Iterate through pixels from index `j + 1` to the end of the row.
          - If a pixel at index `k` (`k > j`) is white (0), change its color to `C`.
          - Pixels at indices less than or equal to `j` remain unchanged.
          - Non-white pixels at indices greater than `j` remain unchanged.
