The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid in all examples.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0) as the background color and one other 'active' color per example: gray (5) in the first, magenta (6) in the second, and green (3) in the third.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to operate horizontally, row by row.\n4.  **Key Observation:** In each row of the output grid, once an active colored pixel appears (reading from left to right), all subsequent white pixels in that same row are changed to that active color.\n5.  **Persistence:** The original positions and colors of the non-white pixels from the input are preserved in the output. Pixels to the left of the first non-white pixel in a row also remain unchanged.\n6.  **Row Independence:** The processing of each row appears independent of the others. Rows containing only the background color (white) remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
