task_description: Horizontally fill rows with color starting from the first non-background pixel.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions_preserved: true # Standard ARC assumption, holds for valid examples (2, 3)
  - shape_inference: May be needed if input is flat. Example 3 (length 81) suggests 9x9. Example 2 (length 81) could be 9x9 or 3x27.
object_focus:
  - type: Horizontal segment trigger
  - identification: The first (leftmost) pixel in a row that is not white (0).
action_on_row:
  - condition: A non-white trigger pixel exists in the row.
  - target_pixels: All white (0) pixels located strictly to the right of the trigger pixel within the same row.
  - transformation: Change the color of target pixels to the color of the trigger pixel for that row.
  - preservation:
      - Pixels to the left of the trigger pixel remain unchanged.
      - The trigger pixel itself remains unchanged.
      - Non-white pixels to the right of the trigger pixel remain unchanged.
row_processing:
  - independent: Each row is processed based solely on its own content.
  - all_white_rows: If a row contains only white (0) pixels, it remains unchanged as no trigger pixel is found.
