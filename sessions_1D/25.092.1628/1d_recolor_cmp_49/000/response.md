Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: All examples use 1-dimensional grids (1 row, multiple columns).
2.  **Colors**:
    *   Input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels.
    *   Output grids contain white (0), red (2), and orange (7) pixels.
3.  **Transformation Pattern**: The transformation seems to operate on contiguous horizontal segments (runs) of red pixels.
    *   In `train_1`, two segments of four red pixels (`2 2 2 2`) are changed to orange (`7 7 7 7`). Shorter red segments remain unchanged.
    *   In `train_2`, two segments of seven red pixels (`2 2 2 2 2 2 2`) are changed to orange (`7 7 7 7 7 7 7`). A single red pixel remains unchanged.
    *   In `train_3`, two segments of five red pixels (`2 2 2 2 2`) are changed to orange (`7 7 7 7 7`). Shorter red segments remain unchanged.
4.  **Identifying the Rule**: The commonality across the examples is that only the *longest* contiguous segments of red pixels are changed. If there are multiple segments of the same maximum length, all of them are changed. The color change is specifically from red (2) to orange (7).

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Color Transformation based on Segment Length

Input_Colors: [white (0), red (2)]
Output_Colors: [white (0), red (2), orange (7)]
Grid_Dimensions: 1xN (Horizontal 1D array)

Objects:
  - type: segment
    color: red (2)
    definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more red pixels.

Properties:
  - object: segment (red)
    attribute: length
    description: The number of pixels in the segment.

Relationships:
  - type: comparison
    attribute: length
    among: all red segments in the input grid
    operation: find maximum length

Actions:
  - action: identify
    target: all red segments in the input grid
  - action: measure
    target: length of each identified red segment
  - action: determine
    target: maximum length among all red segments
  - action: filter
    target: red segments
    condition: segment length equals the determined maximum length
  - action: recolor
    target: pixels within the filtered red segments
    from_color: red (2)
    to_color: orange (7)
  - action: preserve
    target: all other pixels (white pixels and red pixels not part of the longest segments)
    condition: their color remains unchanged
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input grid horizontally to identify all contiguous segments of red (2) pixels.
2.  Calculate the length (number of pixels) of each identified red segment.
3.  Determine the maximum length found among all red segments in the grid.
4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5.  Iterate through all the identified red segments again.
6.  For each red segment whose length is equal to the maximum length determined in step 3, change the color of all pixels within that segment in the output grid from red (2) to orange (7).
7.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid (white pixels and red pixels belonging to segments shorter than the maximum length) unchanged from their original input color.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
