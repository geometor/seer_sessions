Shorter red segments remain unchanged.\n    *   In `train_2`, two segments of seven red pixels (`2 2 2 2 2 2 2`) are changed to orange (`7 7 7 7 7 7 7`). A single red pixel remains unchanged.\n    *   In `train_3`, two segments of five red pixels (`2 2 2 2 2`) are changed to orange (`7 7 7 7 7`). Shorter red segments remain unchanged.\n4.  **Identifying the Rule**: The commonality across the examples is that only the *longest* contiguous segments of red pixels are changed. If there are multiple segments of the same maximum length, all of them are changed. The color change is specifically from red (2) to orange (7).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
