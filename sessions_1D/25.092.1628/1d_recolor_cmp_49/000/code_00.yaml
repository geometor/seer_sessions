Task: Color Transformation based on Segment Length

Input_Colors: [white (0), red (2)]
Output_Colors: [white (0), red (2), orange (7)]
Grid_Dimensions: 1xN (Horizontal 1D array)

Objects:
  - type: segment
    color: red (2)
    definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more red pixels.

Properties:
  - object: segment (red)
    attribute: length
    description: The number of pixels in the segment.

Relationships:
  - type: comparison
    attribute: length
    among: all red segments in the input grid
    operation: find maximum length

Actions:
  - action: identify
    target: all red segments in the input grid
  - action: measure
    target: length of each identified red segment
  - action: determine
    target: maximum length among all red segments
  - action: filter
    target: red segments
    condition: segment length equals the determined maximum length
  - action: recolor
    target: pixels within the filtered red segments
    from_color: red (2)
    to_color: orange (7)
  - action: preserve
    target: all other pixels (white pixels and red pixels not part of the longest segments)
    condition: their color remains unchanged
