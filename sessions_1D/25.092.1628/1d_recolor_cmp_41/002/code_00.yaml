Task: Replace the single longest 1D sequence of green pixels with red.

Input:
  Type: 2D array (Grid) of integers (pixels), likely provided as a NumPy array.
  Colors:
    - Background: White (0)
    - Target: Green (3)
    - Replacement: Red (2)
    - Other colors may be present but are unaffected.
  Dimensions: Variable (examples are 24 pixels, consistent with 6x4 or 4x6, but must handle general NxM grids).

Output:
  Type: 2D array (Grid) of integers (pixels) with the same dimensions as the input.

Elements:
  - Pixels: Individual cells with color values.
  - Grid: The 2D arrangement of pixels.
  - Flattened Sequence: The grid's pixels read row-by-row, top-to-bottom, left-to-right, forming a 1D sequence.
  - Contiguous Sub-sequence: A run of identical pixel values within the flattened sequence.

Properties:
  - Sequence Length: The number of pixels in a contiguous sub-sequence.
  - Sequence Color: The color value of the pixels in the sub-sequence.
  - Sequence Position: The starting index of the sub-sequence within the flattened sequence.

Actions:
  - Flatten: Convert the 2D input grid into a 1D sequence.
  - Identify: Find all contiguous sub-sequences of Green (3) pixels in the flattened sequence.
  - Measure: Determine the length of each identified Green sequence.
  - Compare: Find the maximum length among all Green sequences.
  - Select: Choose the Green sequence that has the maximum length. If multiple sequences share the maximum length, select the one with the smallest starting index (appears earliest in the flattened sequence).
  - Replace: In the flattened sequence, change the color value of every pixel within the selected longest Green sequence from Green (3) to Red (2).
  - Reshape: Convert the modified 1D sequence back into a 2D grid with the original input dimensions.

Relationships:
  - The transformation targets exactly one sequence: the single longest contiguous sequence of Green pixels found in the flattened representation of the grid.
  - Only the pixels within this specific sequence are modified.
  - All other pixels retain their original color and position relative to the grid structure.
  - The output grid must maintain the original dimensions of the input grid.
