## Perception

The input and output are presented as one-dimensional arrays of integers, representing pixel colors. The primary colors involved are white (0), green (3), and red (2). The transformation appears to involve identifying specific sequences of green pixels in the input and changing their color to red in the output.

Observing the examples:
1.  **train_1:** The longest sequence of green pixels (`3 3 3 3 3`, length 5) is changed to red (`2 2 2 2 2`).
2.  **train_2:** The longest sequence of green pixels (`3 3 3 3`, length 4) is changed to red (`2 2 2 2`).
3.  **train_3:** The longest sequence of green pixels (`3 3 3 3 3 3 3`, length 7) is changed to red (`2 2 2 2 2 2 2`).

The core operation is locating the single longest contiguous block of green pixels (value 3) within the 1D input array and replacing all pixels in that block with red pixels (value 2). Other green pixels and pixels of other colors remain unchanged. If there happened to be multiple sequences of the same maximal length, the examples suggest the *first* such sequence encountered (reading left-to-right) is the one modified, though this scenario isn't explicitly demonstrated in the provided examples.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Color replacement based on sequence length

Input:
  Type: 1D array of integers (pixels)
  Colors:
    - White (0)
    - Green (3)
    - Other colors (potentially, though not modified in examples)

Output:
  Type: 1D array of integers (pixels) - Modified version of input.

Elements:
  - Pixels: Individual cells with color values.
  - Sequences: Contiguous runs of pixels with the same color value. Specifically interested in sequences of Green (3) pixels.

Properties:
  - Sequence Length: The number of pixels in a contiguous sequence.

Actions:

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a one-dimensional array of pixel colors.
2.  Iterate through the input array to identify all contiguous sequences (runs) of green pixels (value 3). Keep track of the starting index and length of each green sequence found.
3.  Determine the maximum length found among all identified green sequences.
4.  Identify the specific green sequence that has this maximum length. If multiple sequences share the maximum length, select the one that appears earliest (smallest starting index) in the array.
5.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output array.
6.  Modify the output array by changing the color of all pixels within the selected longest green sequence from green (3) to red (2).
7.  Return the modified output array.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: finding the single longest contiguous sequence of green pixels (3) and changing them to red (2). However, it incorrectly assumed the input data structure was strictly a 1D list based on the flattened representation in the examples. The execution errors ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly indicate that the underlying data structure passed to the `transform` function by the execution environment is a 2D NumPy array. The previous code failed because it attempted operations designed for 1D lists directly on this 2D array structure, leading to ambiguous boolean comparisons.

The strategy to resolve this is:
1.  Acknowledge that the input is likely a 2D NumPy array, even if presented flattened in examples.
2.  Modify the process to first flatten the 2D input grid into a 1D sequence.
3.  Apply the original logic: find the longest green sequence in the flattened 1D version.
4.  Modify this 1D sequence by changing the identified green pixels to red.
5.  Reshape the modified 1D sequence back into the original 2D grid dimensions.

This approach preserves the discovered transformation rule while adapting to the actual data structure used by the execution framework.

## Metrics

Based on the analysis and tool execution:

*   **Input Data Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray` by the execution environment.
*   **Input Data Shape:** Likely 2D. The examples provided (length 24) are consistent with shapes like 6x4 or 4x6. Analysis of train_2 suggested a 6x4 shape was appropriate for interpreting the transformation spatially, although the core logic ultimately operates on the flattened 1D representation. The key is that the code must handle *any* valid 2D shape (up to 30x30).
*   **Transformation Core Logic:** Operates on a 1D representation of the grid. Finds the single longest contiguous sequence of green pixels (3).
*   **Target Sequence Identification:**
    *   Example 1 (1x24): Longest green sequence length 5, starts at index 18.
    *   Example 2 (1x24): Longest green sequence length 4, starts at index 16.
    *   Example 3 (1x24): Longest green sequence length 7, starts at index 5.
    *   Tie-breaking: If multiple sequences share the maximum length, the one with the lowest starting index (first encountered) is chosen.
*   **Modification:** Changes the color of pixels in the identified sequence from green (3) to red (2).
*   **Output Data:** Must have the same shape and type as the input.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Replace the single longest 1D sequence of green pixels with red.

Input:
  Type: 2D array (Grid) of integers (pixels), likely provided as a NumPy array.
  Colors:
    - Background: White (0)
    - Target: Green (3)
    - Replacement: Red (2)
    - Other colors may be present but are unaffected.
  Dimensions: Variable (examples are 24 pixels, consistent with 6x4 or 4x6, but must handle general NxM grids).

Output:
  Type: 2D array (Grid) of integers (pixels) with the same dimensions as the input.

Elements:
  - Pixels: Individual cells with color values.
  - Grid: The 2D arrangement of pixels.
  - Flattened Sequence: The grid's pixels read row-by-row, top-to-bottom, left-to-right, forming a 1D sequence.
  - Contiguous Sub-sequence: A run of identical pixel values within the flattened sequence.

Properties:
  - Sequence Length: The number of pixels in a contiguous sub-sequence.
  - Sequence Color: The color value of the pixels in the sub-sequence.
  - Sequence Position: The starting index of the sub-sequence within the flattened sequence.

Actions:
  - Flatten: Convert the 2D input grid into a 1D sequence.
  - Identify: Find all contiguous sub-sequences of Green (3) pixels in the flattened sequence.
  - Measure: Determine the length of each identified Green sequence.
  - Compare: Find the maximum length among all Green sequences.
  - Select: Choose the Green sequence that has the maximum length. If multiple sequences share the maximum length, select the one with the smallest starting index (appears earliest in the flattened sequence).
  - Replace: In the flattened sequence, change the color value of every pixel within the selected longest Green sequence from Green (3) to Red (2).
  - Reshape: Convert the modified 1D sequence back into a 2D grid with the original input dimensions.

Relationships:
  - The transformation targets exactly one sequence: the single longest contiguous sequence of Green pixels found in the flattened representation of the grid.
  - Only the pixels within this specific sequence are modified.
  - All other pixels retain their original color and position relative to the grid structure.
  - The output grid must maintain the original dimensions of the input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, assumed to be a 2D NumPy array. Record its original dimensions (height and width).
2.  Flatten the 2D input grid into a 1D list or array, preserving the order (e.g., row-major order: top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
3.  Initialize variables to track the maximum length found so far (`max_length = 0`) and the starting index of the longest green sequence (`longest_sequence_start = -1`).
4.  Iterate through the flattened 1D sequence to identify all contiguous sequences of green pixels (value 3). For each green sequence found:
    a.  Note its starting index and length.
    b.  Compare its length to the current `max_length`.
    c.  If the current sequence's length is greater than `max_length`, update `max_length` to this new length and store the sequence's starting index in `longest_sequence_start`.
5.  After checking all sequences, if a longest green sequence was found (`longest_sequence_start != -1`):
    a.  Create a mutable copy of the flattened 1D sequence.
    b.  Iterate from `longest_sequence_start` for `max_length` steps. In each step, change the pixel value at the current index in the copied sequence from green (3) to red (2).
6.  If no green sequences were found, use the original flattened sequence.
7.  Reshape the (potentially modified) 1D sequence back into a 2D grid using the original height and width recorded in step 1.
8.  Return the resulting 2D grid.
