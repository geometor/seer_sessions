Task: Color replacement based on sequence length

Input:
  Type: 1D array of integers (pixels)
  Colors:
    - White (0)
    - Green (3)
    - Other colors (potentially, though not modified in examples)

Output:
  Type: 1D array of integers (pixels) - Modified version of input.

Elements:
  - Pixels: Individual cells with color values.
  - Sequences: Contiguous runs of pixels with the same color value. Specifically interested in sequences of Green (3) pixels.

Properties:
  - Sequence Length: The number of pixels in a contiguous sequence.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all contiguous sequences of Green (3) pixels in the input array.
  - Measure: Determine the length of each Green sequence.
  - Compare: Find the maximum length among all Green sequences.
  - Select: Choose the first sequence encountered that has the maximum length.
  - Replace: Change the color value of every pixel within the selected sequence from Green (3) to Red (2).

Relationships:
  - The transformation targets the Green sequence that is longer than any other Green sequence in the input array.
  - Only the pixels within the single longest Green sequence are modified.
  - All other pixels retain their original color.
