The primary colors involved are white (0), green (3), and red (2). The transformation appears to involve identifying specific sequences of green pixels in the input and changing their color to red in the output.\n\nObserving the examples:\n1.  **train_1:** The longest sequence of green pixels (`3 3 3 3 3`, length 5) is changed to red (`2 2 2 2 2`).\n2.  **train_2:** The longest sequence of green pixels (`3 3 3 3`, length 4) is changed to red (`2 2 2 2`).\n3.  **train_3:** The longest sequence of green pixels (`3 3 3 3 3 3 3`, length 7) is changed to red (`2 2 2 2 2 2 2`).\n\nThe core operation is locating the single longest contiguous block of green pixels (value 3) within the 1D input array and replacing all pixels in that block with red pixels (value 2). Other green pixels and pixels of other colors remain unchanged. If there happened to be multiple sequences of the same maximal length, the examples suggest the *first* such sequence encountered (reading left-to-right) is the one modified, though this scenario isn't explicitly demonstrated in the provided examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
