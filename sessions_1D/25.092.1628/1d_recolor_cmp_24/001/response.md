Identify all contiguous segments of maroon (9) pixels in the input row.
Determine the maximum length among these maroon segments.
Create an output row by copying the input row.
For each maroon segment in the input, if its length is equal to the maximum length, change the corresponding pixels in the output row to red (2). Otherwise, leave the segment as maroon (9). White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
