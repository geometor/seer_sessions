The input grid contains segments of maroon pixels separated by white pixels. The output grid shows that some of these maroon segments have been replaced entirely by red (2) segments of the same length and position, while others remain unchanged. The transformation appears to target specific maroon segments based on their properties relative to other maroon segments within the same input row.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

For each segment, compare its length to the maximum length determined in step 2.\n6.
