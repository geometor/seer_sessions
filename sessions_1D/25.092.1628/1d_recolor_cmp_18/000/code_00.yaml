Task: Color transformation based on object properties.

Input_Grid:
  - Property: Contains pixels of white (0) and gray (5).
  - Structure: 1-dimensional (row vector) in examples.

Output_Grid:
  - Property: Contains pixels of white (0), gray (5), and green (3).
  - Derivation: Based on transforming specific objects from the input grid.

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal blocks of gray (5) pixels.
  - Properties:
    - Color: gray (5)
    - Length: Number of pixels in the block.
  - Identification: Separated by one or more white (0) pixels.

Relationships:
  - Comparison: The lengths of all gray blocks within a single input grid are compared.
  - Maximum: The greatest length among all gray blocks is identified.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all contiguous horizontal blocks of gray pixels.
  - Measure: Determine the length of each identified gray block.
  - Compare: Find the maximum length among these blocks.
  - Transform:
    - Condition: If a gray block's length equals the maximum length found.
    - Action: Change all pixels within that specific block from gray (5) to green (3).
    - Otherwise: Pixels retain their original color (white or gray).
