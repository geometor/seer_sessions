The output grids introduce green (3) pixels, replacing some of the gray ones. White pixels remain unchanged.\n3.  **Objects:** The relevant objects appear to be contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of gray pixels. These blocks are separated by one or more white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* gray blocks to green.\n5.  **Pattern Seeking:**\n    *   In `train_1`, two gray blocks of length 4 are changed to green. Other gray blocks (lengths 1, 2, 3) remain gray.\n    *   In `train_2`, one gray block of length 7 is changed to green. Other gray blocks (lengths 3, 4, 6) remain gray.\n    *   In `train_3`, one gray block of length 5 is changed to green. Other gray blocks (lengths 2, 3) remain gray.\n6.  **Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies all horizontal contiguous blocks of gray pixels within the input grid. It determines the length of each block. It finds the maximum length among all these gray blocks. Then, *only* the gray block(s) that have this maximum length are changed entirely to green pixels in the output. All other pixels (white pixels and gray blocks shorter than the maximum length) retain their original color.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

For each identified gray block, calculate its length (number of pixels).\n3.  Determine the maximum length found among all gray blocks in the grid. If no gray blocks exist, the maximum length is 0.\n4.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n5.  Iterate through the identified gray blocks again.\n6.  For each gray block, compare its length to the maximum length determined in step 3.\n7.  If a gray block's length is equal to the maximum length, change the color of all pixels corresponding to that block in the output grid to green (3).\n8.  Leave all other pixels (white pixels and gray blocks shorter than the maximum length) unchanged from their input grid colors.\n9.  Return the final output grid."
