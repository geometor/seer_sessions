**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are presented as flattened strings of integers, representing 2D grids of pixels. Based on the number of elements (27), the grid dimensions are likely 3x9 or 9x3. Analyzing the patterns, a 3x9 grid structure appears more meaningful.
2.  **Colors:** The input grid uses white (0) and azure (8). The output grid uses white (0), azure (8), and introduces maroon (9).
3.  **Background:** The white (0) pixels appear to act as a static background, remaining unchanged between input and output.
4.  **Objects:** The core objects seem to be contiguous horizontal segments (runs) of azure (8) pixels within each row.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selectively changing the color of azure (8) pixels to maroon (9). Pixels that are not azure (8) or are part of specific azure segments remain unchanged.
6.  **Rule:** The change from azure (8) to maroon (9) seems dependent on the *length* of the horizontal contiguous segment of azure pixels. In the example (assuming 3x9), azure segments of length 4 or 5 change to maroon, while segments of length 1, 2, or 3 remain azure.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Dimensions: Assumed 3x9 based on pattern coherence.
  Input Colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
  Output Colors: [white (0), azure (8), maroon (9)]
Background:
  Color: white (0)
  Behavior: Static, unchanged between input and output.
Objects:
  Type: Horizontal contiguous segments of azure (8) pixels.
  Location: Within each row of the grid.
  Property: Length (number of pixels in the segment).
Transformation:
  Action: Conditional color change.
  Input Color: azure (8)
  Output Color: maroon (9)
  Condition: The change applies to all pixels within a horizontal azure (8) segment if the segment's length is >= 4.
  Otherwise: Pixels in segments shorter than 4 remain azure (8).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input into a 2D grid (assume 3x9 dimensions).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
4.  Within each row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments composed entirely of azure (8) pixels.
5.  For each identified azure segment:
    a.  Determine the length of the segment.
    b.  If the length is 4 or greater, modify the corresponding pixels in the output grid, changing their color from azure (8) to maroon (9).
6.  Pixels not part of an azure segment, or part of an azure segment with length less than 4, retain their original color in the output grid.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
