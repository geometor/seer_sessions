            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the transformation for the first training example but failed on the subsequent two. The failures reveal that the initial hypothesis \u2013 changing azure blocks of *length 4* to yellow \u2013 was too specific and likely coincidental to the first example.\n\nThe errors in examples 2 and 3 show that azure blocks of different lengths (5 and 7) can also be changed, and the output color is consistently yellow (4), regardless of the original block's length. This suggests the length of the block to be modified is determined by a more complex rule involving the properties of *all* azure blocks present in the input, not just a fixed length check.\n\nThe strategy is to re-analyze all three examples, focusing on the properties of the set of azure blocks in each input (lengths, counts, frequencies) to find a consistent rule that explains which block length is targeted for transformation in all cases. The target color appears fixed at yellow (4). The revised hypothesis involves identifying the most frequent block length (excluding the shortest length, and using the largest length in case of ties) as the trigger for the color change.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the azure blocks in each example to test the revised hypothesis.\n"
