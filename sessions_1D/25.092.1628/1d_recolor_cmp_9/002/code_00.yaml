task_description: Modify specific horizontal azure blocks to yellow based on length frequency analysis.

elements:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0), azure (8), yellow (4)
  - element: block
    definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (initially azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - location: Start and end indices within the row.

input_features:
  - grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - colors_present: white (0), azure (8)
  - objects:
      - type: block
        color: azure
        properties_observed:
          - A set of blocks with varying lengths and potentially varying frequencies.

output_features:
  - grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - colors_present: white (0), azure (8), yellow (4)
  - objects:
      - type: block
        color: azure (blocks whose length did not match the selection criteria)
      - type: block
        color: yellow (blocks whose length matched the selection criteria)

transformation:
  - action: Identify all horizontal blocks of azure (8) pixels.
  - action: Calculate the length of each azure block.
  - action: Determine the frequency of each distinct length.
  - condition: Identify the shortest length among all azure blocks found.
  - action: Filter out the shortest length from consideration. If only one length exists, no blocks are changed.
  - condition: Among the remaining lengths, find the length(s) with the highest frequency.
  - condition: If there is a tie for the highest frequency, select the largest length among those tied.
  - action: Identify all azure blocks whose length matches the selected length (from the previous step).
  - consequence: Change the color of all pixels within the identified matching blocks to yellow (4).
  - otherwise: Leave all other pixels (white pixels and non-selected azure blocks) unchanged.
