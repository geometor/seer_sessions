## Perception

The input is a single row (1D grid) containing pixels of two colors: white (0) and azure (8). The azure pixels form contiguous horizontal blocks separated by white pixels.
The output is also a single row, identical in size to the input.
Comparing the input and output, most pixels remain the same. However, one specific block of azure pixels in the input has changed its color to yellow (4) in the output.
The input has four distinct blocks of azure pixels with lengths 2, 3, 4, and 2 respectively.
In the output, the blocks of length 2, 3, and 2 remain azure (8), while the block of length 4 has become yellow (4).
This suggests a rule related to the properties of the azure blocks, specifically their length. The block whose length (4) matches the numerical value of the yellow color (4) is the one that undergoes the transformation.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid row from left to right.
2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks composed entirely of azure (8) pixels.
3.  For each identified azure block, determine its length (number of pixels).
4.  If the length of an azure block is exactly 4, change the color of all pixels in that block to yellow (4).
5.  Leave all other pixels (white pixels and azure blocks of lengths other than 4) unchanged.
6.  The resulting grid is the output.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identified the transformation for the first training example but failed on the subsequent two. The failures reveal that the initial hypothesis – changing azure blocks of *length 4* to yellow – was too specific and likely coincidental to the first example.

The errors in examples 2 and 3 show that azure blocks of different lengths (5 and 7) can also be changed, and the output color is consistently yellow (4), regardless of the original block's length. This suggests the length of the block to be modified is determined by a more complex rule involving the properties of *all* azure blocks present in the input, not just a fixed length check.

The strategy is to re-analyze all three examples, focusing on the properties of the set of azure blocks in each input (lengths, counts, frequencies) to find a consistent rule that explains which block length is targeted for transformation in all cases. The target color appears fixed at yellow (4). The revised hypothesis involves identifying the most frequent block length (excluding the shortest length, and using the largest length in case of ties) as the trigger for the color change.

## Metrics Analysis

Let's analyze the azure blocks in each example to test the revised hypothesis.

The code execution confirms the revised hypothesis:

*   **Train 1:** Lengths [2, 2, 3, 4]. Shortest=2. Other lengths [3, 4]. Frequencies {3:1, 4:1}. Tie, select largest -> 4. Actual change: L=4 block changed. Correct.
*   **Train 2:** Lengths [2, 4, 5, 5]. Shortest=2. Other lengths [4, 5]. Frequencies {4:1, 5:2}. Select most frequent -> 5. Actual change: L=5 blocks changed. Correct.
*   **Train 3:** Lengths [2, 6, 7]. Shortest=2. Other lengths [6, 7]. Frequencies {6:1, 7:1}. Tie, select largest -> 7. Actual change: L=7 block changed. Correct.
    *(Correction from manual analysis: Lengths are 6, 2, 7, not 7, 2, 7 as initially thought)*.

The rule consistently identifies the correct length of the azure block(s) to modify across all examples. The target color is always yellow (4).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid (which is a single row) to identify all contiguous horizontal blocks of azure (8) pixels. Record the start index, end index, and length for each block.
2.  If no azure blocks are found, return the input grid unchanged.
3.  Create a list of the lengths of all found azure blocks.
4.  Determine the frequency of each unique length.
5.  Find the minimum length among all identified azure blocks (the shortest length).
6.  Create a new set of lengths by excluding the shortest length found in the previous step. If this set is empty (meaning all blocks had the same, shortest length), return the input grid unchanged.
7.  From this filtered set of lengths, find the maximum frequency of occurrence.
8.  Identify all lengths from the filtered set that occur with this maximum frequency.
9.  If there is only one length with the maximum frequency, select this length as the target length.
10. If there are multiple lengths with the same maximum frequency (a tie), select the largest length among them as the target length.
11. Iterate through all the original azure blocks identified in step 1.
12. For each azure block, check if its length is equal to the target length selected in steps 9 or 10.
13. If a block's length matches the target length, change the color of all pixels within that block (from its start index to its end index) to yellow (4).
14. Leave all white pixels and all azure blocks whose lengths do *not* match the target length unchanged.
15. The resulting grid is the output.
