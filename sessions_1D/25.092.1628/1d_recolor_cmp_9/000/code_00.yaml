task_description: Change the color of specific horizontal blocks based on their length.

elements:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0), azure (8), yellow (4)
  - element: block
    definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - location: Start and end indices within the row.

input_features:
  - grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - colors_present: white (0), azure (8)
  - objects:
      - type: block
        color: azure
        properties_observed:
          - length: 2 (at indices 1-2)
          - length: 3 (at indices 6-8)
          - length: 4 (at indices 12-15)
          - length: 2 (at indices 17-18)

output_features:
  - grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - colors_present: white (0), azure (8), yellow (4)
  - objects:
      - type: block
        color: azure
        properties_observed:
          - length: 2 (at indices 1-2)
          - length: 3 (at indices 6-8)
          - length: 2 (at indices 17-18)
      - type: block
        color: yellow
        properties_observed:
          - length: 4 (at indices 12-15) # Changed from azure

transformation:
  - action: Identify horizontal blocks of azure (8) pixels.
  - condition: Check if the length of an azure block is exactly 4.
  - consequence: If the condition is met, change the color of all pixels within that block to yellow (4).
  - otherwise: Leave the block unchanged.
