The azure pixels form contiguous horizontal blocks separated by white pixels.\nThe output is also a single row, identical in size to the input.\nComparing the input and output, most pixels remain the same. However, one specific block of azure pixels in the input has changed its color to yellow (4) in the output.\nThe input has four distinct blocks of azure pixels with lengths 2, 3, 4, and 2 respectively.\nIn the output, the blocks of length 2, 3, and 2 remain azure (8), while the block of length 4 has become yellow (4).\nThis suggests a rule related to the properties of the azure blocks, specifically their length. The block whose length (4) matches the numerical value of the yellow color (4) is the one that undergoes the transformation.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
