## General Assessment

The initial analysis based only on `train_1` led to an incorrect hypothesis (changing azure blocks of length 7). The code generated from this hypothesis failed on `train_2` and `train_3`. `train_2` revealed that blocks shorter than 7 could be changed, and `train_3` further contradicted the length 7 rule.

The error arises from generalizing from a single example. By analyzing all three examples, a new pattern emerges: the transformation targets the *longest* contiguous horizontal block(s) of azure pixels. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, all are transformed.

The strategy is to:
1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks of azure pixels.
2.  Calculate the length of each block.
3.  Determine the maximum length found among these blocks.
4.  Iterate through the identified blocks again (or store their start/end positions).
5.  Change the color of any azure block whose length equals the determined maximum length to gray.

## Metrics

Let's verify the block lengths and maximum lengths for each example using code execution.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Helper function to find azure blocks and their lengths/positions
def find_azure_blocks(row):
    blocks = []
    current_pos = 0
    while current_pos < len(row):
        if row[current_pos] == 8: # Start of a potential block
            start_pos = current_pos
            while current_pos < len(row) and row[current_pos] == 8:
                current_pos += 1
            end_pos = current_pos # end_pos is exclusive
            length = end_pos - start_pos
            blocks.append({'start': start_pos, 'end': end_pos, 'length': length})
        else:
            current_pos += 1
    return blocks

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input row to identify all contiguous horizontal blocks composed entirely of azure (8) pixels. Record the start position, end position (exclusive), and length for each block found.
2.  If no azure blocks are found, make no changes to the input row and return it as the output.
3.  If azure blocks are found, determine the maximum length among all the identified blocks.
4.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
5.  Iterate through the recorded azure blocks. For each block, check if its length is equal to the maximum length determined in step 3.
6.  If a block's length matches the maximum length, change the color of all pixels within that block (from its start position up to, but not including, its end position) in the output row to gray (5).
7.  Leave all other pixels (white pixels and azure blocks whose lengths are less than the maximum length) in the output row unchanged from their original input color.
8.  Return the modified output row.
