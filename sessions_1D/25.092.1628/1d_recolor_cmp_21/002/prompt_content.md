```python
import numpy as np

"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal blocks of azure (8) pixels in the input row.
If an azure block has a length exactly equal to 7, changes the color of all 
pixels within that block to gray (5). Leaves all other pixels unchanged.
Assumes the input grid has only one row.
