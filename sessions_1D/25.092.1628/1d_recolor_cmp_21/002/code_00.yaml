elements:
  - type: pixel_grid
    description: A single row of pixels. Assumed shape is 1xN.
  - type: color
    values: [white (0), azure (8), gray (5)]
  - type: object
    identifier: contiguous_horizontal_azure_block
    description: A sequence of one or more adjacent azure (8) pixels in the row.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - length: count of pixels in the block
      - start_index: position of the first pixel in the block
      - end_index: position after the last pixel in the block

transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: all contiguous_horizontal_azure_blocks
    output: list_of_azure_blocks_with_properties
  - action: calculate
    input: list_of_azure_blocks_with_properties
    computation: find the maximum length among all identified blocks
    condition: handle case where no azure blocks exist (max_length = 0 or N/A)
    output: max_azure_block_length
  - action: iterate
    target: list_of_azure_blocks_with_properties
    condition: block length == max_azure_block_length
    sub_action:
      - action: change_color
        target: pixels within the qualifying block (from start_index to end_index)
        from_color: azure (8)
        to_color: gray (5)
  - action: keep
    target: all other pixels (white pixels and azure blocks not matching the max_length criteria)
    properties:
      - color: unchanged

relationships:
  - type: positional_invariance
    description: The positions of white pixels and unchanged azure blocks are preserved.
  - type: size_invariance
    description: The length of the transformed block(s) remains the same, only the color changes.
  - type: context_dependence
    description: The decision to change a block depends on the lengths of *all* other azure blocks within the same row.
