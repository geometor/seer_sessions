            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis based only on `train_1` led to an incorrect hypothesis (changing azure blocks of length 7). The code generated from this hypothesis failed on `train_2` and `train_3`. `train_2` revealed that blocks shorter than 7 could be changed, and `train_3` further contradicted the length 7 rule.\n\nThe error arises from generalizing from a single example. By analyzing all three examples, a new pattern emerges: the transformation targets the *longest* contiguous horizontal block(s) of azure pixels. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, all are transformed.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks of azure pixels.\n2.  Calculate the length of each block.\n3.  Determine the maximum length found among these blocks.\n4.  Iterate through the identified blocks again (or store their start/end positions).\n5.  Change the color of any azure block whose length equals the determined maximum length to gray.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's verify the block lengths and maximum lengths for each example using code execution.\n\n"
