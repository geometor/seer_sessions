The output is largely the same as the input, except for one specific block of azure pixels. This block, which originally consisted of seven consecutive azure pixels, has been changed to gray (5) pixels in the output. Other blocks of azure pixels, with lengths of five and six respectively, remain unchanged. The white pixels also remain unchanged. This suggests the transformation rule targets contiguous horizontal blocks of azure pixels based on their length. Specifically, blocks of azure pixels with a length of exactly seven are transformed into blocks of gray pixels of the same length.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
