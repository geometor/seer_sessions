The output maintains the same length and structure but introduces red (2) pixels. The transformation rule appears to depend on the length of contiguous runs of green pixels. Specifically, horizontal runs of exactly five green pixels in the input are replaced by runs of five red pixels in the output. Runs of green pixels with lengths other than five, as well as all white pixels, remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
