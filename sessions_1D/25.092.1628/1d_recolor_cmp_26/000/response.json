White pixels (0) and some blue pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Objects**: The primary objects of interest seem to be contiguous horizontal segments (lines) of blue pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern**: The change from blue to yellow depends on the *length* of these horizontal blue segments. Specifically, it relates to the maximum length found among all blue segments in the input grid.\n6.  **Rule Inference**: By comparing the lengths of segments that change versus those that don't across the examples, a pattern emerges:\n    *   In Example 1, the maximum segment length is 4. Segments of length 4 are changed.\n    *   In Example 2, the maximum segment length is 7. The segment of length 7 is changed.\n    *   In Example 3, the maximum segment length is 6. Segments of length 6 *and* length 5 are changed.\n    *   This suggests that segments with the maximum length (`max_len`) and segments with length `max_len - 1` are targeted for change.\n\n### Factual Documentation\n\n"

Scan the input grid row by row to identify all contiguous horizontal segments consisting only of blue (1) pixels. For each segment found, record its row index, start column, end column, and calculate its length.\n3.  Determine the maximum length (`max_len`) among all the horizontal blue segments identified in step 2. If no blue segments exist, `max_len` is 0, and the program finishes, returning the copied grid.\n4.  Iterate through the list of identified horizontal blue segments again.\n5.  For each segment, check if its length is equal to `max_len` or equal to `max_len - 1`.\n6.  If a segment's length satisfies the condition in step 5, modify the copied grid by changing the color of all pixels within that segment's coordinates (from its start column to its end column in its specific row) from blue (1) to yellow (4).\n7.  After checking all segments, return the modified grid as the final output."
