task_description: Change the color of specific horizontal blue segments to yellow based on their length relative to the longest horizontal blue segment(s) in the grid.

elements:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9) representing a color (0=white, 1=blue, 4=yellow).
      - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (rows x columns).
      - content: 2D array of pixels.
  - element: horizontal_segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of the same color within a single row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment (specifically focusing on blue=1).
      - row_index: The row number where the segment is located.
      - start_column: The column index of the first pixel in the segment.
      - end_column: The column index of the last pixel in the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment (end_column - start_column + 1).

transformation:
  action: Identify horizontal segments of blue (1) pixels.
  condition:
    - Find the maximum length (`max_len`) among all horizontal blue segments in the input grid.
    - Select segments whose length is equal to `max_len` OR `max_len - 1`.
  effect: Change the color of all pixels within the selected segments from blue (1) to yellow (4).
  invariance:
    - Pixels that are initially white (0) remain white.
    - Blue (1) pixels that are part of horizontal segments with lengths *not* equal to `max_len` or `max_len - 1` remain blue.

relationships:
  - type: comparison
    attribute: length
    context: Comparing the length of each horizontal blue segment to the maximum length found across all such segments in the grid.
