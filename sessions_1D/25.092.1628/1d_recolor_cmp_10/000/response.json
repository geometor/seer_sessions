            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure**: The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or vectors) of integers representing colors. The colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and orange (7).\n2.  **Color Transformation**: The core transformation involves changing the color of some azure (8) pixels to orange (7). White (0) pixels remain unchanged. Not all azure pixels are changed.\n3.  **Pattern Identification**: The change specifically targets contiguous sequences (segments) of azure pixels. By comparing the segments of azure pixels in the input and the locations of the orange pixels in the output across the examples, a pattern emerges:\n    *   In `train_1`, the input has azure segments of lengths 4, 2, 3, and 2. The segment of length 4 is changed to orange.\n    *   In `train_2`, the input has azure segments of lengths 3, 3, 5, and 3. The segment of length 5 is changed to orange.\n    *   In `train_3`, the input has azure segments of lengths 7, 2, and 2. The segment of length 7 is changed to orange.\n4.  **Rule Inference**: The transformation identifies the *longest* contiguous segment of azure (8) pixels in the input array. All pixels within this longest segment are then recolored to orange (7). If multiple segments share the maximum length, the examples suggest only one is changed (likely the first one encountered, though this specific case isn't explicitly tested in the provided examples).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
