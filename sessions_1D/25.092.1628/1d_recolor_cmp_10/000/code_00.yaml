task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - azure (8)
  - orange (7)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_segment
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - length
      - start_index
      - end_index
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: 1D grid
    target_color: azure (8)
    output: list of segments (start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: find_longest_segment
    input: list of segments
    criteria: maximum length
    tie_breaking: select the first segment encountered (implied by examples)
    output: the single longest segment
  - name: recolor_segment
    input_grid: 1D grid
    target_segment: the identified longest segment
    original_color: azure (8)
    new_color: orange (7)
    output_grid: modified 1D grid
relationships:
  - pixels within a segment are adjacent and have the same color (azure 8).
  - segments are separated by pixels of a different color (white 0).
invariance:
  - white (0) pixels are unchanged.
  - azure (8) pixels not part of the single longest segment are unchanged.
  - the length and structure of the grid remain the same.
