Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input/Output Structure**: The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or vectors) of integers representing colors. The colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and orange (7).
2.  **Color Transformation**: The core transformation involves changing the color of some azure (8) pixels to orange (7). White (0) pixels remain unchanged. Not all azure pixels are changed.
3.  **Pattern Identification**: The change specifically targets contiguous sequences (segments) of azure pixels. By comparing the segments of azure pixels in the input and the locations of the orange pixels in the output across the examples, a pattern emerges:
    *   In `train_1`, the input has azure segments of lengths 4, 2, 3, and 2. The segment of length 4 is changed to orange.
    *   In `train_2`, the input has azure segments of lengths 3, 3, 5, and 3. The segment of length 5 is changed to orange.
    *   In `train_3`, the input has azure segments of lengths 7, 2, and 2. The segment of length 7 is changed to orange.
4.  **Rule Inference**: The transformation identifies the *longest* contiguous segment of azure (8) pixels in the input array. All pixels within this longest segment are then recolored to orange (7). If multiple segments share the maximum length, the examples suggest only one is changed (likely the first one encountered, though this specific case isn't explicitly tested in the provided examples).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - azure (8)
  - orange (7)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_segment
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - length
      - start_index
      - end_index
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: 1D grid
    target_color: azure (8)
    output: list of segments (start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: find_longest_segment
    input: list of segments
    criteria: maximum length
    tie_breaking: select the first segment encountered (implied by examples)
    output: the single longest segment
  - name: recolor_segment
    input_grid: 1D grid
    target_segment: the identified longest segment
    original_color: azure (8)
    new_color: orange (7)
    output_grid: modified 1D grid
relationships:
  - pixels within a segment are adjacent and have the same color (azure 8).
  - segments are separated by pixels of a different color (white 0).
invariance:
  - white (0) pixels are unchanged.
  - azure (8) pixels not part of the single longest segment are unchanged.
  - the length and structure of the grid remain the same.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input 1D grid from left to right to identify all contiguous segments composed entirely of azure (8) pixels. Record the start index, end index, and length of each such segment.
2.  Compare the lengths of all identified azure segments and determine the maximum length.
3.  Select the *first* segment found during the scan that has this maximum length.
4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
5.  For the selected segment, change the color of all pixels within its start and end indices (inclusive) in the output grid from azure (8) to orange (7).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
