task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Confirmed via analysis, even if examples appear 1D
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - azure (8)
  - orange (7)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    color: azure (8)
    definition: A contiguous sequence of azure pixels within the same row.
    properties:
      - row_index
      - start_column_index
      - end_column_index
      - length
actions:
  - name: identify_horizontal_segments
    input: 2D grid
    target_color: azure (8)
    output: list of all horizontal azure segments (row, start_col, end_col, length) across all rows.
  - name: find_globally_longest_segment
    input: list of horizontal segments
    criteria: maximum length
    tie_breaking: select the first segment encountered (scan top-to-bottom row, then left-to-right column)
    output: the single segment with the overall maximum length
  - name: recolor_segment
    input_grid: 2D grid
    target_segment: the identified globally longest segment (specified by row, start_col, end_col)
    original_color: azure (8)
    new_color: orange (7)
    output_grid: modified 2D grid
relationships:
  - pixels within a horizontal segment are adjacent horizontally and have the same color (azure 8).
  - horizontal segments are separated horizontally by pixels of a different color or grid boundaries.
  - segments in different rows are distinct unless connected vertically (not relevant for this task's logic).
invariance:
  - white (0) pixels are unchanged.
  - azure (8) pixels not part of the single globally longest segment are unchanged.
  - the dimensions (shape) of the grid remain the same.
