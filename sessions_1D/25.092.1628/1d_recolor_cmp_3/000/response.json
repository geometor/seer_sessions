The transformation selectively changes the color of some blue pixels to magenta (6), while leaving white pixels and other blue pixels unchanged. The change appears targeted towards a specific region of blue pixels in each example. Observing the examples, the blue pixels that change to magenta consistently form a solid rectangular block. Comparing this block to other potential rectangular blocks of blue pixels within the input grid suggests a pattern based on size. In each case, the rectangle of blue pixels that changes to magenta is the one with the largest area (height times width) compared to all other possible solid blue rectangles in the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    ```"

The assumed behavior is that only one such rectangle exists or the rule applies to all if there's a tie (though recoloring overlapping areas twice with magenta has no effect).\n    grid_size_invariant: Yes, the transformation logic does not depend on the grid dimensions, only on the relative shapes within it.\n    "
