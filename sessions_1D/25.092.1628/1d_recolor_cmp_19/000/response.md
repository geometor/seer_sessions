**Perception:**

The input and output grids consist of a white background (0) and horizontal segments of orange pixels (7). In the output grid, some of the orange segments have been changed to yellow (4), while others remain orange. The white background pixels are unchanged. The key transformation seems to involve identifying specific orange segments based on a property and changing their color. Comparing the examples, the segments that change color appear to be the longest horizontal orange segments within each input grid. If there are multiple segments of the maximum length, they all change color. Shorter segments remain orange.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid row by row to identify all distinct horizontal, contiguous segments composed solely of orange (7) pixels.
2.  For each identified orange segment, determine its length (number of pixels).
3.  Find the maximum length among all the identified orange segments in the grid.
4.  Iterate through all the identified orange segments again.
5.  If an orange segment's length is equal to the maximum length found in step 3, change the color of all pixels within that segment from orange (7) to yellow (4).
6.  Leave all other pixels (the white background pixels and any orange segments whose length is less than the maximum length) unchanged.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.
