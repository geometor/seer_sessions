# YAML representation of task observations
# Focus: Identify objects, properties, actions, and relationships

elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static container for other elements
  - type: segment
    color: orange (7)
    shape: horizontal contiguous line of pixels
    properties:
      - length: count of pixels in the segment
      - position: row and column indices
  - type: segment # derived in output
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: horizontal contiguous line of pixels
    origin: transformed orange segments
    properties:
      - length: count of pixels in the segment
      - position: row and column indices

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Orange segments exist on the white background.
  - type: comparison
    description: The lengths of different orange segments are compared within each input grid.

actions:
  - type: identify
    target: horizontal contiguous segments of orange (7) pixels
  - type: measure
    target: identified orange segments
    property: length
  - type: compare
    description: Find the maximum length among all identified orange segments.
  - type: filter
    description: Select only those orange segments whose length equals the maximum length.
  - type: transform
    target: selected orange segments (those with maximum length)
    change: color from orange (7) to yellow (4)
  - type: preserve
    target: white background pixels and orange segments not matching the maximum length
    change: no change in color or position
