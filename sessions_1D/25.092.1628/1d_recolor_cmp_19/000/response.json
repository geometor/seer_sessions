In the output grid, some of the orange segments have been changed to yellow (4), while others remain orange. The white background pixels are unchanged. The key transformation seems to involve identifying specific orange segments based on a property and changing their color. Comparing the examples, the segments that change color appear to be the longest horizontal orange segments within each input grid. If there are multiple segments of the maximum length, they all change color. Shorter segments remain orange.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
