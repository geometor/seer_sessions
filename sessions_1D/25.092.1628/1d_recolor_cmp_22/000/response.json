Although ARC tasks usually involve 2D grids, the examples strongly suggest processing the data as a 1D sequence or potentially a grid with a single relevant row for the core logic. Given the transformation seen across examples, treating the input as a flat 1D sequence seems most consistent.\n2.  **Colors:** The key colors involved are white (0 - background), red (2 - target color), and azure (8 - replacement color).\n3.  **Core Object:** The primary object of interest is a contiguous horizontal block (or segment) of red (2) pixels within the 1D sequence.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies a specific block of red pixels based on a property (length) and changes its color.\n5.  **Rule:** The rule appears to be: find the *longest* contiguous sequence of red (2) pixels in the input array. Change all the pixels in *that specific sequence* to azure (8). All other pixels remain unchanged. The examples provided do not show ties for the longest sequence, suggesting we only need to handle the case of a unique longest sequence.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
