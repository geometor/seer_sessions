task_context:
  grid_representation: Primarily 1D sequence for analysis, though originally potentially 2D.
  colors_involved:
    - background: 0 (white)
    - target: 2 (red)
    - replacement: 8 (azure)
  pertinent_objects:
    - type: contiguous_block
      color: 2 (red)
      orientation: horizontal (within the 1D sequence)
      properties:
        - length
transformation_rule:
  input_scan: Iterate through the 1D sequence of pixels.
  object_identification: Locate all distinct contiguous blocks of the target color (red).
  selection_criterion:
    - property: length
    - rule: find the maximum length among all identified blocks.
  action:
    - target_object: The block(s) matching the maximum length criterion. (Assuming unique based on examples).
    - modification: Change the color of all pixels within the selected block.
    - color_change: from target color (red: 2) to replacement color (azure: 8).
  output_generation: The output sequence is identical to the input, except for the pixels within the identified longest red block, which are changed to azure.
