## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are presented as 1D arrays of integers (colors). Although ARC tasks usually involve 2D grids, the examples strongly suggest processing the data as a 1D sequence or potentially a grid with a single relevant row for the core logic. Given the transformation seen across examples, treating the input as a flat 1D sequence seems most consistent.
2.  **Colors:** The key colors involved are white (0 - background), red (2 - target color), and azure (8 - replacement color).
3.  **Core Object:** The primary object of interest is a contiguous horizontal block (or segment) of red (2) pixels within the 1D sequence.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies a specific block of red pixels based on a property (length) and changes its color.
5.  **Rule:** The rule appears to be: find the *longest* contiguous sequence of red (2) pixels in the input array. Change all the pixels in *that specific sequence* to azure (8). All other pixels remain unchanged. The examples provided do not show ties for the longest sequence, suggesting we only need to handle the case of a unique longest sequence.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: Primarily 1D sequence for analysis, though originally potentially 2D.
  colors_involved:
    - background: 0 (white)
    - target: 2 (red)
    - replacement: 8 (azure)
  pertinent_objects:
    - type: contiguous_block
      color: 2 (red)
      orientation: horizontal (within the 1D sequence)
      properties:
        - length
transformation_rule:
  input_scan: Iterate through the 1D sequence of pixels.
  object_identification: Locate all distinct contiguous blocks of the target color (red).
  selection_criterion:
    - property: length
    - rule: find the maximum length among all identified blocks.
  action:
    - target_object: The block(s) matching the maximum length criterion. (Assuming unique based on examples).
    - modification: Change the color of all pixels within the selected block.
    - color_change: from target color (red: 2) to replacement color (azure: 8).
  output_generation: The output sequence is identical to the input, except for the pixels within the identified longest red block, which are changed to azure.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Represent the input grid as a single, one-dimensional sequence of pixels.
2.  Scan this sequence to identify all contiguous segments (blocks) consisting solely of red (color 2) pixels.
3.  For each identified red segment, record its starting position, ending position, and its length.
4.  Determine the maximum length found among all red segments.
5.  Identify the specific red segment that corresponds to this maximum length. (Based on the examples, assume there is only one such longest segment).
6.  Create a new sequence, initially identical to the input sequence, which will become the output.
7.  In the new sequence, change the color of every pixel within the identified longest red segment from red (color 2) to azure (color 8).
8.  Return the modified sequence as the output.
