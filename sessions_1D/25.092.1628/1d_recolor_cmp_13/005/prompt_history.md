*   **Perception:** The task involves processing a single-row grid. The input grid contains sequences of white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grid shows that some sequences of blue pixels have been changed to orange (7), while others remain blue. White pixels are unchanged. Specifically, contiguous horizontal sequences of exactly four blue pixels are transformed into sequences of four orange pixels. Blue sequences of other lengths (like the single blue pixel and the sequence of three blue pixels) are left untouched.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
*   **General Assessment:**
    The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests an issue with how the input data was parsed or handled within the previous execution environment or the Python code itself, likely related to NumPy arrays being used in a boolean context. The code's logic, aiming to find the longest sequence and modify it, seems generally aligned with the task based on a visual inspection of the examples. However, the error prevented validation.

    The strategy is to:
    1.  Ensure the input strings are correctly parsed into the `list[list[int]]` format expected by the Python function (assuming each string represents a single row).
    2.  Re-verify the core logic by systematically analyzing each training example: identifying all blue sequences, finding the maximum length among them, and confirming that *only* sequences matching this maximum length are changed to orange.
    3.  Update the documentation (facts and natural language program) to precisely reflect this verified logic.

*   **Metrics and Analysis:**

    Let's analyze each example by parsing the input string into a list of integers (representing the single row) and identifying blue sequences.

*   **Analysis Summary:** The code execution confirms the manual analysis.
    *   In Example 1, the max length is 4. The output shows the three sequences of length 4 changed to orange (7), while the sequences of length 1 and 3 remain blue (1).
    *   In Example 2, the max length is 5. The output shows the single sequence of length 5 changed to orange (7), while the two sequences of length 4 remain blue (1).
    *   In Example 3, the max length is 7. The output shows the single sequence of length 7 changed to orange (7), while the sequences of length 2, 3, and 5 remain blue (1).
