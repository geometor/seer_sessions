*   **Perception:** The task involves processing a single-row grid. The input grid contains sequences of white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grid shows that some sequences of blue pixels have been changed to orange (7), while others remain blue. White pixels are unchanged. Specifically, contiguous horizontal sequences of exactly four blue pixels are transformed into sequences of four orange pixels. Blue sequences of other lengths (like the single blue pixel and the sequence of three blue pixels) are left untouched.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: color_change_conditional
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D as it's a single row
    objects:
      - type: sequence
        color: blue (1)
        attributes:
          - length
    actions:
      - type: color_change
        source_color: blue (1)
        target_color: orange (7)
        condition: Applies only to blue sequences with a length of exactly 4.
    background: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
    unchanged_elements:
      - blue (1) sequences with lengths other than 4.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous horizontal sequences of blue (1) pixels.
    2.  For each identified blue sequence, determine its length.
    3.  If the length of a blue sequence is exactly 4, change the color of all pixels within that specific sequence to orange (7) in the output grid.
    4.  If the length of a blue sequence is not 4, keep the pixels as blue (1) in the output grid.
    5.  Copy all other pixels (white pixels) directly from the input to the output grid without modification.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial hypothesis, focusing on sequences of exactly length 4, was incorrect as it failed to generalize across all training examples. The execution errors ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") indicate a probable type mismatch or incorrect boolean evaluation, potentially arising if the input grid was treated as a NumPy array instead of a standard list of lists within conditional checks, or if a boolean operation was applied element-wise where a single boolean was expected. The analysis of all three examples strongly suggests a revised hypothesis: the transformation targets only the *longest* contiguous sequence(s) of blue pixels. The provided code's logic actually implements this revised hypothesis. The error likely stems from the execution environment or a subtle bug related to data types (list vs NumPy array) rather than the core transformation logic derived from the examples. The strategy is to confirm the "longest sequence" rule, verify input handling, and refine the natural language program and facts accordingly.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: conditional_color_change
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input is a single row grid
    input_colors: [white (0), blue (1)]
    output_colors: [white (0), blue (1), orange (7)]
    objects:
      - type: horizontal_sequence
        color: blue (1)
        attributes:
          - length
          - start_index
    actions:
      - type: identify_sequences
        color: blue (1)
        property: horizontal contiguity
      - type: calculate_maximum
        property: length
        source: identified blue sequences
      - type: color_change
        source_color: blue (1)
        target_color: orange (7)
        condition: Apply only to blue sequences whose length equals the calculated maximum length.
    background: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
    unchanged_elements:
      - blue (1) sequences with lengths not equal to the maximum length.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's single row.
    2.  Iterate through the input row to identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of blue (1) pixels. Record the starting index and length of each sequence found.
    3.  If no blue sequences are found, return the initial output grid copy.
    4.  Determine the maximum length (let's call it `L_max`) among all the identified blue sequences.
    5.  Iterate through the recorded list of blue sequences.
    6.  For each blue sequence, compare its length to `L_max`.
    7.  If a sequence's length is exactly equal to `L_max`, change the color of all pixels within that specific sequence (from its start index for its length) in the output grid row to orange (7).
    8.  Pixels that were not part of a blue sequence with length `L_max` remain unchanged from their initial copied value (either white or blue).
    9.  Return the modified output row, formatted as a single-row grid.
