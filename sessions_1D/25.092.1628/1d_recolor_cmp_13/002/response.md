## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core elements (blue sequences changing to orange on a white background) but failed to generalize the condition correctly across all examples. The code generated based on this faulty assumption naturally failed. The error message (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`) indicates a technical issue, likely arising from the testing framework using NumPy arrays while the provided code implicitly assumed standard Python lists for comparison logic. However, the fundamental problem was the incorrect transformation rule derived from only one example.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-analyze all training examples to find a consistent rule.
2.  Use code execution to verify the pattern and gather precise metrics about sequence lengths.
3.  Formulate an updated hypothesis based on the analysis of all examples.
4.  Refine the Facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the new, more accurate understanding of the transformation.

## Metrics and Analysis

The following metrics were gathered using code execution to analyze the sequences in each training example:

**Analysis Summary:**

*   All inputs are single-row grids of width 28.
*   The transformation involves changing certain blue (1) pixel sequences to orange (7).
*   In each example, the code confirms that the blue sequences changed to orange are *exactly* those that have the maximum length among all blue sequences present in that specific input grid.
    *   Example 1: Max length is 4. All sequences of length 4 are changed.
    *   Example 2: Max length is 5. The sequence of length 5 is changed.
    *   Example 3: Max length is 7. The sequence of length 7 is changed.
*   All blue sequences with lengths *less* than the maximum length remain unchanged.
*   White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
*   No other types of changes were detected.
*   The hypothesis "Change all blue sequences whose length equals the maximum blue sequence length found in the input" holds true for all training examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive a single-row input grid containing white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
2.  Scan the input row to identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of blue (1) pixels. Record the length of each sequence found.
3.  Determine the maximum length (`L_max`) among all identified blue sequences. If no blue sequences exist, `L_max` is 0.
4.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
5.  Iterate through the identified blue sequences again.
6.  For each blue sequence:
    *   If its length is equal to `L_max` (and `L_max` > 0), change the color of all pixels corresponding to this sequence in the output row to orange (7).
    *   If its length is not equal to `L_max`, leave the pixels in the output row as blue (1).
7.  Ensure all pixels that were not part of any blue sequence (i.e., white pixels) are copied unchanged to the output row.
8.  Return the modified row as the output grid.
