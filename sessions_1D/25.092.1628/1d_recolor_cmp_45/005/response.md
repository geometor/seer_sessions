"""
Transforms the input grid based on the rule: identify all contiguous horizontal
blocks of azure (8) pixels in the single input row. Determine the maximum length
among these blocks. Change the color of all azure (8) pixels within the block(s)
that have the maximum length to magenta (6). If multiple blocks share the
maximum length, all such blocks are transformed. Pixels not part of a
maximum-length azure block, and non-azure pixels, remain unchanged.
