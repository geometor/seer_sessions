Input_Grid:
  Type: 1D list of integers (representing a single row grid)
  Colors_Present: white (0), azure (8)

Output_Grid:
  Type: 1D list of integers (same dimensions as input)
  Colors_Present: white (0), azure (8), magenta (6)

Objects:
  - Name: Azure_Block
    Identification: Contiguous sequence of azure (8) pixels in the row.
    Properties:
      - start_index: integer (inclusive)
      - end_index: integer (inclusive)
      - length: integer (number of pixels in the block)

Relationships:
  - Azure_Blocks are separated by non-azure pixels (e.g., white (0)) or grid boundaries.
  - Comparison between Azure_Blocks based on 'length' property.

Actions:
  - Find: Identify all Azure_Blocks in the input row.
  - Calculate: Determine the 'length' for each Azure_Block.
  - Determine_Maximum: Find the maximum 'length' among all identified Azure_Blocks.
  - Filter: Select only the Azure_Blocks whose 'length' equals the maximum length.
  - Transform: For each selected Azure_Block, change the color of all pixels within its 'start_index' and 'end_index' (inclusive) from azure (8) to magenta (6) in the output grid.
  - Preserve: All pixels not part of a maximum-length Azure_Block retain their original color from the input grid.
