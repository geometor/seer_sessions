Grid:
  Type: 1D (single row) based on all examples.
  Dimensions: Consistent between input and output (1x23 in examples).
  Colors:
    - Background/Separator: white (0)
    - Initial Object Color: azure (8)
    - Transformed Object Color: magenta (6)
Objects:
  - Definition: Contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of azure (8) pixels.
  - Properties:
      - Start Index
      - End Index
      - Length (number of pixels)
Relationships:
  - Azure blocks are separated by at least one white (0) pixel or grid boundaries.
Actions:
  - Identification: Locate all distinct contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels within the row.
  - Measurement: Determine the length of each identified block.
  - Comparison: Find the maximum length among all measured blocks.
  - Selection: Identify all blocks whose length equals the maximum length.
  - Transformation: For each selected block, change the color of all its constituent pixels from azure (8) to magenta (6). Pixels in azure blocks shorter than the maximum length remain unchanged. Non-azure pixels remain unchanged.
