"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal blocks of azure (8) pixels in the input row.
Determines the maximum length among these blocks.
Changes the color of all azure (8) pixels within the block(s) that have the maximum length to magenta (6).
If multiple blocks share the maximum length, all such blocks are transformed.
Pixels not part of a maximum-length azure block, and non-azure pixels, remain unchanged.
