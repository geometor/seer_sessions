Grid:
  Type: 1D (single row)
  Input_Colors:
    - Background: white (0)
    - Object_Color: azure (8)
  Output_Colors:
    - Background: white (0)
    - Original_Object_Color: azure (8) # Unchanged objects
    - Transformed_Object_Color: magenta (6)
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of azure (8) pixels.
  - Properties:
      - Start_Index: The 0-based index of the first pixel in the block.
      - End_Index: The 0-based index of the last pixel in the block.
      - Length: The number of pixels in the block (End_Index - Start_Index + 1).
Relationships:
  - Blocks are separated by non-azure pixels (specifically white (0) in examples) or grid boundaries.
  - Multiple blocks can exist within a single input row.
Actions:
  - Identify: Find all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels in the input row.
  - Measure: Calculate the length of each identified block.
  - Compare: Determine the maximum length among all identified blocks.
  - Filter: Select only the azure block(s) whose length equals the maximum length.
  - Transform: For each selected block, change the color of all its constituent pixels in the output grid from azure (8) to magenta (6).
  - Preserve: All other pixels (white background pixels and azure pixels in blocks *not* having the maximum length) remain unchanged.
