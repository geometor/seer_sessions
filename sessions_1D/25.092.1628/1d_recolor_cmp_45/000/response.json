            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are single rows (1D grids). The length varies across potential test cases but is consistent between the input and output of each example (here, 1x23).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and magenta (6). White pixels act as separators or background. Azure pixels form objects of interest. Magenta is the color used for transformation.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* azure (8) pixels to magenta (6) pixels. Not all azure pixels are changed.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The relevant objects appear to be contiguous horizontal blocks (sequences) of azure (8) pixels.\n5.  **Pattern:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the longest block of azure pixels (length 7) is changed to magenta. Shorter blocks (length 1, length 4) are unchanged.\n    *   In `train_2`, the two longest blocks of azure pixels (both length 5) are changed to magenta. Shorter blocks (length 1) are unchanged.\n    *   In `train_3`, the longest block of azure pixels (length 4) is changed to magenta. Shorter blocks (length 2, length 3, length 3) are unchanged.\n6.  **Rule Inference:** The rule seems to be: identify the contiguous block(s) of azure (8) pixels with the greatest length within the row. Replace all azure (8) pixels within *those specific blocks* with magenta (6) pixels. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, all of them are transformed.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
