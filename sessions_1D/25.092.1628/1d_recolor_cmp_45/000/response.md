Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are single rows (1D grids). The length varies across potential test cases but is consistent between the input and output of each example (here, 1x23).
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and magenta (6). White pixels act as separators or background. Azure pixels form objects of interest. Magenta is the color used for transformation.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* azure (8) pixels to magenta (6) pixels. Not all azure pixels are changed.
4.  **Object Identification:** The relevant objects appear to be contiguous horizontal blocks (sequences) of azure (8) pixels.
5.  **Pattern:**
    *   In `train_1`, the longest block of azure pixels (length 7) is changed to magenta. Shorter blocks (length 1, length 4) are unchanged.
    *   In `train_2`, the two longest blocks of azure pixels (both length 5) are changed to magenta. Shorter blocks (length 1) are unchanged.
    *   In `train_3`, the longest block of azure pixels (length 4) is changed to magenta. Shorter blocks (length 2, length 3, length 3) are unchanged.
6.  **Rule Inference:** The rule seems to be: identify the contiguous block(s) of azure (8) pixels with the greatest length within the row. Replace all azure (8) pixels within *those specific blocks* with magenta (6) pixels. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, all of them are transformed.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1D (single row)
  Colors:
    - Background: white (0)
    - Object: azure (8)
    - Transformed: magenta (6)
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal blocks of azure (8) pixels
  - Property: Length (number of pixels in the block)
Relationships:
  - Blocks are separated by white (0) pixels or grid boundaries.
Actions:
  - Identify: Find all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels.
  - Measure: Calculate the length of each identified block.
  - Compare: Determine the maximum length among all blocks.
  - Filter: Select only the blocks that have the maximum length.
  - Transform: Replace the azure (8) pixels within the selected blocks with magenta (6) pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input row to identify all contiguous sequences (blocks) of azure (8) pixels. Record the start position, end position, and length of each block.
2.  Find the maximum length among all identified azure blocks.
3.  Iterate through the recorded blocks again. For every block whose length matches the maximum length found in step 2, change all the pixels within that block's start and end positions in the grid from azure (8) to magenta (6).
4.  Output the modified grid.
