task_description: >
  Identify the single row containing the longest continuous horizontal segment of orange (7) pixels.
  Within that specific row, change only the orange (7) pixels that constitute this longest segment to maroon (9).
  All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Constant between input and output.
  - colors_input: [white (0), orange (7)]
  - colors_output: [white (0), orange (7), maroon (9)]

objects:
  - type: grid_row
    properties:
      - index: Vertical position (0-based from top).
      - pixels: Sequence of color values.
  - type: horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - color: The color of the contiguous pixels (focus on orange (7)).
      - length: Number of contiguous pixels.
      - location: The row index.
      - start_col: The starting column index (inclusive) of the segment.
      - end_col: The ending column index (inclusive) of the segment.

relationships:
  - type: contains
    subject: grid_row
    object: horizontal_segment
    description: Each row may contain zero, one, or more horizontal segments of various colors and lengths.
  - type: selects
    subject: transformation_logic
    object: grid_row
    description: Selects the unique row that contains the single longest horizontal segment of orange (7) pixels across the entire grid. (Assumes uniqueness based on examples).

actions:
  - action: find_longest_orange_segment_location
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
      - color_to_find: orange (7)
      - dimension: horizontal
    output:
      - target_row_index: Index of the row containing the overall longest segment.
      - segment_start_col: Starting column index of that longest segment.
      - segment_end_col: Ending column index of that longest segment.
      - max_length: Length of the longest segment.
    details: >
      Iterates through each row, finds the longest contiguous horizontal segment of the specified color within that row,
      keeping track of its start/end columns and length. Compares these lengths across rows to find the overall
      maximum length and returns the details (row index, start/end columns) of that single longest segment.
      Returns default values (e.g., -1) if the color is not found or no segments exist. Assumes a unique longest segment exists based on examples.
  - action: update_segment_color
    input:
      - input_grid
      - target_row_index
      - segment_start_col
      - segment_end_col
    parameters:
      - color_from: orange (7)
      - color_to: maroon (9)
    output: output_grid
    details: >
      Creates a copy of the input grid. In the row specified by target_row_index, iterates through the columns
      from segment_start_col to segment_end_col (inclusive). If a pixel at these coordinates has the color_from,
      it is changed to color_to in the output grid. All other pixels remain unchanged.

transformation_logic:
  1. Analyze the input grid to find the location (row index, start column, end column) and length of the single longest contiguous horizontal segment of orange (7) pixels (find_longest_orange_segment_location).
  2. If such a segment is found:
     a. Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
     b. Modify the output grid by changing the color of the pixels within the identified segment boundaries (from start_col to end_col inclusive) in the target_row_index from orange (7) to maroon (9) (update_segment_color).
  3. If no orange segment is found, return the input grid unchanged (implicitly handled if defaults from step 1 are used).
  4. Return the final output grid.
