            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are grids of pixels. The examples provided (train_1, train_2, train_3) consistently show input and output grids of the same dimensions (4 rows x 8 columns).\n2.  **Colors Used:** The input grids use white (0) and orange (7). The output grids use white (0), orange (7), and maroon (9). Maroon (9) seems to be introduced as part of the transformation.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between input and output appear localized to a single row in each example.\n    *   In `train_1`, the second row changes: `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0` becomes `9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0`.\n    *   In `train_2`, the third row changes: `0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0` becomes `0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0`.\n    *   In `train_3`, the third row changes: `0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0` becomes `0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0`.\n4.  **Identifying the Target Row:** The row that gets modified seems to be selected based on a property related to the orange (7) pixels within it. Let's examine the horizontal contiguous sequences of orange pixels in each input:\n    *   **train_1:**\n        *   Row 0: Max length 4 (`7 7 7 7`)\n        *   Row 1: Max length 7 (`7 7 7 7 7 7 7`)\n        *   Row 2: Max length 4 (`7 7 7 7`)\n        *   Row 3: Max length 1 (`7`)\n        *   *Result:* Row 1 (max length 7) is modified.\n    *   **train_2:**\n        *   Row 0: Max length 3 (`7 7 7`)\n        *   Row 1: Max length 4 (`7 7 7 7`)\n        *   Row 2: Max length 5 (`7 7 7 7 7`)\n        *   Row 3: Max length 0\n        *   *Result:* Row 2 (max length 5) is modified.\n    *   **train_3:**\n        *   Row 0: Max length 2 (`7 7`)\n        *   Row 1: Max length 3 (`7 7 7`)\n        *   Row 2: Max length 4 (`7 7 7 7`)\n        *   Row 3: Max length 3 (`7 7 7`)\n        *   *Result:* Row 2 (max length 4) is modified.\n5.  **Rule Synthesis:** The transformation identifies the row containing the single longest contiguous horizontal sequence of orange (7) pixels. Within that specific row *only*, all orange (7) pixels are changed to maroon (9). All other pixels in the grid retain their original colors. The examples do not show ties for the longest sequence; if a tie occurred, a tie-breaking rule (e.g., first row encountered) might be needed, but based *only* on these examples, we assume a unique row contains the longest segment.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
