task_description: Identify the row with the longest continuous horizontal segment of orange (7) pixels and change all orange pixels in that row to maroon (9).

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Constant between input and output.
  - colors_input: [white (0), orange (7)]
  - colors_output: [white (0), orange (7), maroon (9)] # Maroon (9) replaces orange (7) under specific conditions.

objects:
  - type: grid_row
    properties:
      - index: Vertical position (0-based from top).
      - pixels: Sequence of color values.
  - type: horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - color: The color of the contiguous pixels (focus on orange (7)).
      - length: Number of contiguous pixels.
      - location: The row index and starting/ending column indices.

relationships:
  - type: contains
    subject: grid_row
    object: horizontal_segment
    description: Each row may contain one or more horizontal segments of various colors.

actions:
  - action: find_max_segment
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
      - color_to_find: orange (7)
      - dimension: horizontal
    output:
      - target_row_index: Index of the row containing the longest segment.
      - max_length: Length of the longest segment.
    details: Iterates through rows, finds the longest contiguous horizontal run of the specified color in each, and identifies the overall maximum length and the corresponding row index. Assumes uniqueness based on examples.
  - action: update_row_color
    input:
      - input_grid
      - target_row_index
    parameters:
      - color_from: orange (7)
      - color_to: maroon (9)
    output: output_grid
    details: Creates a copy of the input grid. In the row specified by target_row_index, changes all pixels with color_from to color_to. Leaves all other pixels unchanged.

transformation_logic:
  1. Analyze the input grid to find the row containing the longest contiguous horizontal sequence of orange (7) pixels (find_max_segment).
  2. Identify the index of this target row.
  3. Modify the target row by changing all orange (7) pixels to maroon (9) (update_row_color).
  4. Return the modified grid.
