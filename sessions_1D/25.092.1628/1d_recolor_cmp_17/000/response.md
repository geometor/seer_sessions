Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are single rows (or 1xN grids) of pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved are white (0), orange (7), and gray (5). Other colors might be present but seem unaffected.
3.  **Key Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing a sequence of orange (7) pixels to gray (5) pixels.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:**
    *   In all examples, only a specific contiguous block of orange (7) pixels is altered.
    *   Not all orange blocks are changed.
    *   Comparing the changed block across examples:
        *   Example 1: `7 7 7 7` (length 4) is changed. Other orange blocks (`7`, `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`, `7`, `7`) are present. The changed block is the longest among those with length > 1.
        *   Example 2: `7 7 7 7 7` (length 5) is changed. Other orange blocks (`7 7 7 7`, `7 7 7 7`, `7 7 7 7`, `7 7 7 7`) are present. The changed block is the longest.
        *   Example 3: `7 7 7 7 7 7 7` (length 7) is changed. Other orange blocks (`7`, `7`, `7 7 7`, `7 7 7 7`) are present. The changed block is the longest.
5.  **Rule Inference:** The transformation identifies the *longest* contiguous horizontal block of orange (7) pixels within the input row. This specific block is then replaced with pixels of the gray (5) color, maintaining the block's original length and position. If there were multiple blocks of the same maximum length, the examples suggest the rightmost (last occurring) one might be chosen, although this specific tie-breaking scenario isn't explicitly tested in the provided examples. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: Grid Transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - orange (7) # Primary target color
  - gray (5)  # Replacement color
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - horizontal_contiguity
      - length
actions:
  - identify_blocks:
      target_color: orange (7)
      contiguity: horizontal
  - filter_blocks:
      condition: length > 1 # Implicitly observed, but the longest block always had length > 1. Let's refine to just "longest".
  - find_longest_block:
      from_set: orange_blocks
      tie_breaking: rightmost (assumed, not strictly proven by examples)
  - replace_color:
      target_block: the identified longest orange block
      new_color: gray (5)
relationships:
  - Input grid dimensions == Output grid dimensions
  - Pixels outside the identified longest orange block remain unchanged.
  - The replacement block (gray) occupies the exact same position and has the same length as the original target block (orange).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid horizontally to identify all contiguous blocks (sequences) of orange (7) pixels. Record the starting position and length of each block.
3.  Determine the maximum length found among all identified orange blocks.
4.  Identify the specific orange block(s) that have this maximum length.
5.  If there is only one block with the maximum length, select it. If there are multiple blocks with the same maximum length, select the one that appears furthest to the right (i.e., has the largest starting index).
6.  Iterate through the pixel positions occupied by the selected block in the output grid.
7.  For each position within the selected block, change the pixel's color from orange (7) to gray (5).
8.  Return the modified output grid.
