Other colors might be present but seem unaffected.\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing a sequence of orange (7) pixels to gray (5) pixels.\n4.  **Pattern Recognition:**\n    *   In all examples, only a specific contiguous block of orange (7) pixels is altered.\n    *   Not all orange blocks are changed.\n    *   Comparing the changed block across examples:\n        *   Example 1: `7 7 7 7` (length 4) is changed. Other orange blocks (`7`, `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`, `7`, `7`) are present. The changed block is the longest among those with length > 1.\n        *   Example 2: `7 7 7 7 7` (length 5) is changed. Other orange blocks (`7 7 7 7`, `7 7 7 7`, `7 7 7 7`, `7 7 7 7`) are present. The changed block is the longest.\n        *   Example 3: `7 7 7 7 7 7 7` (length 7) is changed. Other orange blocks (`7`, `7`, `7 7 7`, `7 7 7 7`) are present. The changed block is the longest.\n5.  **Rule Inference:** The transformation identifies the *longest* contiguous horizontal block of orange (7) pixels within the input row. This specific block is then replaced with pixels of the gray (5) color, maintaining the block's original length and position. If there were multiple blocks of the same maximum length, the examples suggest the rightmost (last occurring) one might be chosen, although this specific tie-breaking scenario isn't explicitly tested in the provided examples. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
