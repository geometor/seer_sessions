task_type: Grid Transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - orange (7) # Primary target color
  - gray (5)  # Replacement color
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - horizontal_contiguity
      - length
actions:
  - identify_blocks:
      target_color: orange (7)
      contiguity: horizontal
  - filter_blocks:
      condition: length > 1 # Implicitly observed, but the longest block always had length > 1. Let's refine to just "longest".
  - find_longest_block:
      from_set: orange_blocks
      tie_breaking: rightmost (assumed, not strictly proven by examples)
  - replace_color:
      target_block: the identified longest orange block
      new_color: gray (5)
relationships:
  - Input grid dimensions == Output grid dimensions
  - Pixels outside the identified longest orange block remain unchanged.
  - The replacement block (gray) occupies the exact same position and has the same length as the original target block (orange).
