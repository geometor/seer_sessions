Okay, let's analyze the provided example pair.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input is a single row (1x20 grid) containing sequences of white pixels (0) and green pixels (3). There are two distinct contiguous blocks of green pixels separated by a single white pixel. The first green block has a length of 7, and the second has a length of 6.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output is also a 1x20 grid. It retains the same structure of white and colored blocks. However, the first block of green pixels from the input has been changed to maroon pixels (9). The second block of green pixels remains unchanged.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a color change applied selectively to green pixels. Specifically, the longest contiguous horizontal block of green pixels in the input has its color changed from green (3) to maroon (9). Shorter blocks of green pixels, and all white pixels, are left unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Change the color of the longest horizontal contiguous block(s) of a specific color.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row presented)
  - colors_used: [white (0), green (3), maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - length: count of adjacent pixels of the same color in the row
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    criteria: maximum length among all green blocks
actions:
  - identify: locate all contiguous horizontal blocks of green (3) pixels.
  - measure: determine the length of each identified green block.
  - select: identify the green block(s) with the greatest length.
  - transform: change the color of the pixels within the selected longest green block(s) to maroon (9).
  - maintain: keep all other pixels (white pixels and shorter green blocks) unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid row by row (in this case, there's only one row).
2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) composed entirely of green (3) pixels.
3.  Calculate the length (number of pixels) of each identified green block.
4.  Determine the maximum length found among all green blocks.
5.  Locate the green block(s) that have this maximum length.
6.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
7.  For every pixel position occupied by the longest green block(s) identified in step 5, change the pixel color in the output grid from green (3) to maroon (9).
8.  All other pixel positions in the output grid retain their original color from the input grid.
