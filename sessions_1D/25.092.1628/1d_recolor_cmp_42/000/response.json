There are two distinct contiguous blocks of green pixels separated by a single white pixel. The first green block has a length of 7, and the second has a length of 6.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output is also a 1x20 grid. It retains the same structure of white and colored blocks. However, the first block of green pixels from the input has been changed to maroon pixels (9). The second block of green pixels remains unchanged.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a color change applied selectively to green pixels. Specifically, the longest contiguous horizontal block of green pixels in the input has its color changed from green (3) to maroon (9). Shorter blocks of green pixels, and all white pixels, are left unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
