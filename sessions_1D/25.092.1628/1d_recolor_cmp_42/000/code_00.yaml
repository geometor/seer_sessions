task_description: Change the color of the longest horizontal contiguous block(s) of a specific color.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row presented)
  - colors_used: [white (0), green (3), maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - length: count of adjacent pixels of the same color in the row
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    criteria: maximum length among all green blocks
actions:
  - identify: locate all contiguous horizontal blocks of green (3) pixels.
  - measure: determine the length of each identified green block.
  - select: identify the green block(s) with the greatest length.
  - transform: change the color of the pixels within the selected longest green block(s) to maroon (9).
  - maintain: keep all other pixels (white pixels and shorter green blocks) unchanged.
