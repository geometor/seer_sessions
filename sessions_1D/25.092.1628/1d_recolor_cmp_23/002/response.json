            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\n1.  **Assessment:** The initial Python code failed on all training examples with the error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This strongly suggests the code received a NumPy array (possibly 2D) as input, while it was written expecting a Python `List[int]`. The core transformation logic, however, appears correct when the input/output pairs are analyzed as 1D sequences. The rule involves finding azure (8) blocks surrounded by white (0), determining the maximum length among these, and changing *only the first* such block encountered (left-to-right) to orange (7).\n2.  **Strategy:** Refine the natural language program to explicitly state that only the *first* block meeting the criteria is modified. The Coder phase must focus on creating a Python function that correctly handles the likely NumPy array input format while implementing this \"find first longest surrounded block\" logic.\n\n## Metrics (Based on 1D interpretation)\n\nThe following table summarizes the analysis of each training example when treated as a 1D sequence, verifying the \"first longest surrounded block\" hypothesis.\n\n| Ex | Len | Azure Blocks (Start,End,Len)                | Surrounded Azure Blocks (Start,End,Len)         | Max Surrounded Len | First Block w/ Max Len (Start,End) | Actual Change (Start,End,Len) | Matches Rule |\n| -- | :-: | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------: | :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :----------: |\n| 1  | 28  | (2,2,1),(5,8,4),(10,16,7),(18,24,7)         | (2,2,1),(5,8,4),(10,16,7),(18,24,7)             | 7                  | (10, 16)                           | (10, 16, 7)                   |     Yes      |\n| 2  | 28  | (1,3,3),(7,8,2),(11,11,1),(14,17,4),...     | (1,3,3),(7,8,2),(11,11,1),(14,17,4),...         | 4                  | (14, 17)                           | (14, 17, 4)                   |     Yes      |\n| 3  | 28  | (3,3,1),(6,7,2),(11,15,5),(17,18,2),(21,22,2) | (3,3,1),(6,7,2),(11,15,5),(17,18,2),(21,22,2) | 5                  | (11, 15)                           | (11, 15, 5)                   |     Yes      |\n\n*(Note: ... indicates additional blocks not relevant to the max length determination)*\n*(Note: Block format is (start_index, end_index, length))*\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Store the original shape if necessary for reconstruction (though based on analysis, the output seems to retain the flattened structure).\n2.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the (flattened) input sequence.\n3.  Scan the input sequence to identify all contiguous blocks composed solely of azure (8) pixels. For each block, record its start index, end index, and length.\n4.  Create an empty list called `candidate_blocks`.\n5.  Iterate through the identified azure blocks. For each block:\n    *   Check if its start index is greater than 0 AND the pixel at `start_index - 1` is white (0).\n    *   Check if its end index is less than `sequence_length - 1` AND the pixel at `end_index + 1` is white (0).\n    *   If both conditions are true, add the block's information (start, end, length) to the `candidate_blocks` list. Maintain the order based on start index.\n6.  If `candidate_blocks` is empty, return the unmodified output sequence (potentially reshaped to original dimensions if input was 2D and reshaping is required).\n7.  Determine the maximum length (`max_len`) present among all blocks in `candidate_blocks`.\n8.  Iterate through `candidate_blocks` *in the order they were added*.
