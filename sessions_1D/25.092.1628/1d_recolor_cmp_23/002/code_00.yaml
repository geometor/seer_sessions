task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively treated as a flat sequence/list for the core logic
input_type_assumption: numpy.ndarray # Likely cause of original code failure
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - azure (8)
  - orange (7)
objects:
  - pixel: Basic unit with a color value (0, 7, or 8).
  - sequence: A 1D list/array of pixels derived from the input.
  - block: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color within the 1D sequence.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels (focus on azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - position: Start and end indices within the sequence.
      - context: Pixels immediately preceding and succeeding the block (must be white for candidacy).
actions:
  - identify_azure_blocks: Find all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels in the sequence.
  - check_surroundings: For each azure block, determine if it is immediately preceded by white (0) and immediately followed by white (0). Handle boundary conditions (indices 0 and n-1) as not being surrounded by white.
  - filter_surrounded_blocks: Create an ordered list of azure blocks that meet the surrounding criteria (ordered by start index).
  - find_max_length: Determine the maximum length among the surrounded azure blocks. Returns 0 if no surrounded blocks exist.
  - find_first_max_block: Identify the first block (scanning left-to-right) in the list of surrounded blocks that possesses the calculated maximum length.
  - change_color: Modify the color of all pixels within the identified *first*, maximum-length, surrounded block to orange (7).
relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels are adjacent horizontally in the sequence.
  - grouping: Pixels of the same color form blocks.
  - order: Blocks are processed based on their position (left-to-right).
  - conditionality: Color change depends on block color (azure), surrounding colors (white), block length (maximum among surrounded), and order (first occurrence).
invariants:
  - White (0) pixels always remain white (0).
  - Azure (8) pixels remain azure (8) unless they are part of the *single* block selected for transformation.
  - The length and dimensions (if originally 2D) of the grid/sequence remain unchanged.
