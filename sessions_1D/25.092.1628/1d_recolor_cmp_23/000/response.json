The output sequences contain white (0), azure (8), and orange (7) pixels. The transformation involves changing the color of certain azure blocks to orange based on their properties and context. Specifically, the length of the azure block and its immediate neighbors (being white pixels) determine if a color change occurs.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
