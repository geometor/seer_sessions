            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: finding contiguous blocks of azure (8), checking if they are surrounded by white (0), finding the maximum length among those surrounded blocks, and changing the color to orange (7).\n\nHowever, the results for `train_1` reveal a flaw in the previous interpretation. The code changed only the *first* block matching the maximum length criterion, while the expected output requires *all* blocks matching this criterion to be changed.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program and the corresponding logic to ensure all azure blocks that are (1) surrounded by white and (2) have the maximum length among such surrounded blocks are changed to orange.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's re-examine the examples with the refined understanding:\n\n**train_1:**\n*   Input: `0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0`\n*   Azure Blocks:\n    *   `8` at index 2 (length 1) - Not surrounded by white.\n    *   `8 8 8 8` at indices 5-8 (length 4) - Not surrounded by white (left neighbor is 0, right neighbor is 8).\n    *   `8 8 8 8 8 8 8` at indices 10-16 (length 7) - Surrounded by white (index 9 is 0, index 17 is 0).\n    *   `8 8 8 8 8 8 8` at indices 18-24 (length 7) - Surrounded by white (index 17 is 0, index 25 is 0).\n*   Surrounded Azure Blocks: blocks at indices 10-16 (len 7) and 18-24 (len 7).\n*   Maximum length among surrounded blocks: 7.\n*   Blocks matching max length: Both the block at 10-16 and the block at 18-24.\n*   Transformation: Change both blocks to orange (7).\n*   Expected Output: `0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0`\n*   Previous Code Output: `0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0` (Incorrect - only changed the first max-length block).\n\n**train_2:**\n*   Input: `0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0`\n*   Azure Blocks:\n    *   `8 8 8` at indices 1-3 (length 3) - Surrounded by white (index 0 is 0, index 4 is 0).\n    *   `8 8` at indices 7-8 (length 2) - Surrounded by white (index 6 is 0, index 9 is 0).\n    *   `8` at index 11 (length 1) - Surrounded by white (index 10 is 0, index 12 is 0).\n    *   `8 8 8 8` at indices 14-17 (length 4) - Surrounded by white (index 13 is 0, index 18 is 0).\n    *   `8` at index 19 (length 1) - Not surrounded by white (left is 0, right is 0). *Correction: Surrounded by white.* (index 18 is 0, index 20 is 0).\n    *   `8` at index 23 (length 1) - Surrounded by white (index 22 is 0, index 24 is 0).\n    *   `8 8` at indices 25-26 (length 2) - Surrounded by white (index 24 is 0, index 27 is 0).\n*   Surrounded Azure Blocks: lengths 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2.\n*   Maximum length among surrounded blocks: 4.\n*   Blocks matching max length: Only the block at indices 14-17.\n*   Transformation: Change the block at 14-17 to orange (7).\n*   Expected Output: `0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0`\n*   Previous Code Output: `0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0` (Correct - only one max-length block).\n\n**train_3:**\n*   Input: `0 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0`\n*   Azure Blocks:\n    *   `8` at index 3 (length 1) - Surrounded by white (index 2 is 0, index 4 is 0).\n    *   `8 8` at indices 6-7 (length 2) - Surrounded by white (index 5 is 0, index 8 is 0).\n    *   `8 8 8 8 8` at indices 11-15 (length 5) - Surrounded by white (index 10 is 0, index 16 is 0).\n    *   `8 8` at indices 17-18 (length 2) - Surrounded by white (index 16 is 0, index 19 is 0).\n    *   `8 8` at indices 21-22 (length 2) - Surrounded by white (index 20 is 0, index 23 is 0).\n*   Surrounded Azure Blocks: lengths 1, 2, 5, 2, 2.\n*   Maximum length among surrounded blocks: 5.\n*   Blocks matching max length: Only the block at indices 11-15.\n*   Transformation: Change the block at 11-15 to orange (7).\n*   Expected Output: `0 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0`\n*   Previous Code Output: `0 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0` (Correct - only one max-length block).\n\nThe analysis confirms the hypothesis: *all* azure blocks surrounded by white that share the maximum length among such blocks must be changed to orange.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
