## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: finding contiguous blocks of azure (8), checking if they are surrounded by white (0), finding the maximum length among those surrounded blocks, and changing the color to orange (7).

However, the results for `train_1` reveal a flaw in the previous interpretation. The code changed only the *first* block matching the maximum length criterion, while the expected output requires *all* blocks matching this criterion to be changed.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program and the corresponding logic to ensure all azure blocks that are (1) surrounded by white and (2) have the maximum length among such surrounded blocks are changed to orange.

## Metrics

Let's re-examine the examples with the refined understanding:

**train_1:**
*   Input: `0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0`
*   Azure Blocks:
    *   `8` at index 2 (length 1) - Not surrounded by white.
    *   `8 8 8 8` at indices 5-8 (length 4) - Not surrounded by white (left neighbor is 0, right neighbor is 8).
    *   `8 8 8 8 8 8 8` at indices 10-16 (length 7) - Surrounded by white (index 9 is 0, index 17 is 0).
    *   `8 8 8 8 8 8 8` at indices 18-24 (length 7) - Surrounded by white (index 17 is 0, index 25 is 0).
*   Surrounded Azure Blocks: blocks at indices 10-16 (len 7) and 18-24 (len 7).
*   Maximum length among surrounded blocks: 7.
*   Blocks matching max length: Both the block at 10-16 and the block at 18-24.
*   Transformation: Change both blocks to orange (7).
*   Expected Output: `0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0`
*   Previous Code Output: `0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0` (Incorrect - only changed the first max-length block).

**train_2:**
*   Input: `0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0`
*   Azure Blocks:
    *   `8 8 8` at indices 1-3 (length 3) - Surrounded by white (index 0 is 0, index 4 is 0).
    *   `8 8` at indices 7-8 (length 2) - Surrounded by white (index 6 is 0, index 9 is 0).
    *   `8` at index 11 (length 1) - Surrounded by white (index 10 is 0, index 12 is 0).
    *   `8 8 8 8` at indices 14-17 (length 4) - Surrounded by white (index 13 is 0, index 18 is 0).
    *   `8` at index 19 (length 1) - Not surrounded by white (left is 0, right is 0). *Correction: Surrounded by white.* (index 18 is 0, index 20 is 0).
    *   `8` at index 23 (length 1) - Surrounded by white (index 22 is 0, index 24 is 0).
    *   `8 8` at indices 25-26 (length 2) - Surrounded by white (index 24 is 0, index 27 is 0).
*   Surrounded Azure Blocks: lengths 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2.
*   Maximum length among surrounded blocks: 4.
*   Blocks matching max length: Only the block at indices 14-17.
*   Transformation: Change the block at 14-17 to orange (7).
*   Expected Output: `0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0`
*   Previous Code Output: `0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0` (Correct - only one max-length block).

**train_3:**
*   Input: `0 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0`
*   Azure Blocks:
    *   `8` at index 3 (length 1) - Surrounded by white (index 2 is 0, index 4 is 0).
    *   `8 8` at indices 6-7 (length 2) - Surrounded by white (index 5 is 0, index 8 is 0).
    *   `8 8 8 8 8` at indices 11-15 (length 5) - Surrounded by white (index 10 is 0, index 16 is 0).
    *   `8 8` at indices 17-18 (length 2) - Surrounded by white (index 16 is 0, index 19 is 0).
    *   `8 8` at indices 21-22 (length 2) - Surrounded by white (index 20 is 0, index 23 is 0).
*   Surrounded Azure Blocks: lengths 1, 2, 5, 2, 2.
*   Maximum length among surrounded blocks: 5.
*   Blocks matching max length: Only the block at indices 11-15.
*   Transformation: Change the block at 11-15 to orange (7).
*   Expected Output: `0 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0`
*   Previous Code Output: `0 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0` (Correct - only one max-length block).

The analysis confirms the hypothesis: *all* azure blocks surrounded by white that share the maximum length among such blocks must be changed to orange.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively operates on a single row
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - azure (8)
  - orange (7)
objects:
  - pixel: Basic unit with a color value.
  - block: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (focus on azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - position: Start and end indices within the sequence.
      - context: Pixels immediately preceding and succeeding the block.
        relevant_context: Must be white (0) on both sides.
actions:
  - identify_azure_blocks: Find all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels. Record start, end, length.
  - filter_surrounded_blocks: Select only those azure blocks where the preceding pixel (if it exists) is white (0) AND the succeeding pixel (if it exists) is white (0).
  - find_max_length: Determine the maximum length among the filtered (surrounded) azure blocks. Handle the case where no blocks are surrounded.
  - change_color_of_max_length_blocks: Change the color of *all* pixels within *every* surrounded azure block whose length equals the determined maximum length to orange (7).
relationships:
  - adjacency: Horizontal adjacency defines blocks and surrounding context.
  - grouping: Pixels of the same color form blocks.
  - filtering: Blocks are selected based on color (azure), context (surrounded by white), and property (maximum length among surrounded).
invariants:
  - White (0) pixels always remain white (0).
  - Azure (8) pixels not part of a block meeting *all* criteria (azure color, surrounded by white, maximum length among surrounded) remain azure (8).
  - The length of the sequence remains unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks of azure (8) pixels in the input sequence. For each block, record its start index, end index, and length.
3.  Create a list of "candidate" blocks by filtering the identified azure blocks. A block is a candidate if:
    *   It is not at the very beginning of the sequence (its start index > 0).
    *   The pixel immediately preceding it (at index `start - 1`) is white (0).
    *   It is not at the very end of the sequence (its end index < sequence length - 1).
    *   The pixel immediately succeeding it (at index `end + 1`) is white (0).
4.  If the list of candidate blocks is empty, no changes are needed; return the initial output sequence copy.
5.  If there are candidate blocks, determine the maximum length present among *only* the blocks in the candidate list.
6.  Iterate through the list of candidate blocks again.
7.  For each candidate block whose length is equal to the maximum length determined in step 5, change the color of all pixels within that block's range (from its start index to its end index, inclusive) in the output sequence to orange (7).
8.  Return the modified output sequence.
