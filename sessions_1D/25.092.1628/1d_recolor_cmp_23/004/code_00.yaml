task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively operates on a single row
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - azure (8)
  - orange (7)
objects:
  - pixel: Basic unit with a color value.
  - block: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (focus on azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - position: Start and end indices within the sequence.
      - context: Pixels immediately preceding and succeeding the block.
        relevant_context: Must be white (0) on both sides.
actions:
  - identify_azure_blocks: Find all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels. Record start, end, length.
  - filter_surrounded_blocks: Select only those azure blocks where the preceding pixel (if it exists) is white (0) AND the succeeding pixel (if it exists) is white (0).
  - find_max_length: Determine the maximum length among the filtered (surrounded) azure blocks. Handle the case where no blocks are surrounded.
  - change_color_of_max_length_blocks: Change the color of *all* pixels within *every* surrounded azure block whose length equals the determined maximum length to orange (7).
relationships:
  - adjacency: Horizontal adjacency defines blocks and surrounding context.
  - grouping: Pixels of the same color form blocks.
  - filtering: Blocks are selected based on color (azure), context (surrounded by white), and property (maximum length among surrounded).
invariants:
  - White (0) pixels always remain white (0).
  - Azure (8) pixels not part of a block meeting *all* criteria (azure color, surrounded by white, maximum length among surrounded) remain azure (8).
  - The length of the sequence remains unchanged.
