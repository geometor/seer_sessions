"""
Transforms a 1D sequence (potentially represented as a 1xN 2D array) of pixels.
The transformation identifies all contiguous horizontal blocks of azure (8) pixels.
It then filters these blocks to find those immediately surrounded by white (0) pixels on both sides.
Among these surrounded blocks, it determines the maximum length.
Finally, it changes the color of the pixels within the *first* such block (encountered from left-to-right) 
that has this maximum length to orange (7). All other pixels retain their original color.
The output grid retains the original dimensions (likely 1xN).
