*   **Perception:** The task operates on 1D sequences (or single rows) of pixels. The input sequences contain white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The output sequences contain white (0), azure (8), and orange (7) pixels. The transformation involves changing the color of certain azure blocks to orange based on their properties and context. Specifically, the length of the azure block and its immediate neighbors (being white pixels) determine if a color change occurs.

*   **Facts:**

    colors_involved:
      - white (0)
      - azure (8)

    objects:
      - pixel: Basic unit with a color value.
      - block: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
        properties:
          - color: The color of the pixels in the block (azure in this focus).
          - length: The number of pixels in the block.
          - position: Start and end indices within the sequence.
          - context: Pixels immediately preceding and succeeding the block.
    actions:
      - identify_azure_blocks: Find all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels.
      - check_surroundings: For each azure block, determine if it is immediately preceded by white (0) and immediately followed by white (0). Handle boundary conditions as if they are not white (0).
      - find_max_length: Among the azure blocks surrounded by white (0), find the maximum length.
      - change_color: Change the color of all azure blocks that are surrounded by white (0) AND have the maximum length found in the previous step to orange (7).
    relationships:
      - adjacency: Pixels are adjacent horizontally.
      - grouping: Pixels of the same color form blocks.
      - conditionality: Color change depends on block length and adjacency to white pixels.
    invariants:
      - White (0) pixels always remain white (0).
      - Azure (8) pixels that are part of blocks not meeting the criteria (not surrounded by white OR not of maximum length among surrounded blocks) remain azure (8).
      - The length of the sequence remains unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
    2.  Scan the input sequence to identify all contiguous horizontal blocks composed solely of azure (8) pixels. Record their start index, end index, and length.
    3.  Create a list of "candidate" blocks: Filter the identified azure blocks, keeping only those that are immediately preceded by a white (0) pixel AND immediately followed by a white (0) pixel. (A block at the very beginning or end of the sequence cannot be surrounded by white pixels).
    4.  If the list of candidate blocks is empty, the transformation is complete, and the initial copy of the input is the final output.
    5.  If there are candidate blocks, determine the maximum length among them.
    6.  Iterate through the list of candidate blocks again. For each candidate block whose length equals the determined maximum length, change the color of all pixels within that block's range (from its start index to its end index) in the output sequence to orange (7).
    7.  Return the modified output sequence.

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment and Strategy

1.  **Assessment:** The initial Python code failed on all training examples with the error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This strongly suggests the code received a NumPy array (possibly 2D) as input, while it was written expecting a Python `List[int]`. The core transformation logic, however, appears correct when the input/output pairs are analyzed as 1D sequences. The rule involves finding azure (8) blocks surrounded by white (0), determining the maximum length among these, and changing *only the first* such block encountered (left-to-right) to orange (7).
2.  **Strategy:** Refine the natural language program to explicitly state that only the *first* block meeting the criteria is modified. The Coder phase must focus on creating a Python function that correctly handles the likely NumPy array input format while implementing this "find first longest surrounded block" logic.

## Metrics (Based on 1D interpretation)

The following table summarizes the analysis of each training example when treated as a 1D sequence, verifying the "first longest surrounded block" hypothesis.

| Ex | Len | Azure Blocks (Start,End,Len)                | Surrounded Azure Blocks (Start,End,Len)         | Max Surrounded Len | First Block w/ Max Len (Start,End) | Actual Change (Start,End,Len) | Matches Rule |
| -- | :-: | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------: | :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :----------: |
| 1  | 28  | (2,2,1),(5,8,4),(10,16,7),(18,24,7)         | (2,2,1),(5,8,4),(10,16,7),(18,24,7)             | 7                  | (10, 16)                           | (10, 16, 7)                   |     Yes      |
| 2  | 28  | (1,3,3),(7,8,2),(11,11,1),(14,17,4),...     | (1,3,3),(7,8,2),(11,11,1),(14,17,4),...         | 4                  | (14, 17)                           | (14, 17, 4)                   |     Yes      |
| 3  | 28  | (3,3,1),(6,7,2),(11,15,5),(17,18,2),(21,22,2) | (3,3,1),(6,7,2),(11,15,5),(17,18,2),(21,22,2) | 5                  | (11, 15)                           | (11, 15, 5)                   |     Yes      |

```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively treated as a flat sequence/list for the core logic
input_type_assumption: numpy.ndarray # Likely cause of original code failure
colors_involved:
  - white (0)
  - azure (8)
  - orange (7)
objects:
  - pixel: Basic unit with a color value (0, 7, or 8).
  - sequence: A 1D list/array of pixels derived from the input.
  - block: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color within the 1D sequence.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels (focus on azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - position: Start and end indices within the sequence.
      - context: Pixels immediately preceding and succeeding the block (must be white for candidacy).
actions:
  - identify_azure_blocks: Find all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels in the sequence.
  - check_surroundings: For each azure block, determine if it is immediately preceded by white (0) and immediately followed by white (0). Handle boundary conditions (indices 0 and n-1) as not being surrounded by white.
  - filter_surrounded_blocks: Create an ordered list of azure blocks that meet the surrounding criteria (ordered by start index).
  - find_max_length: Determine the maximum length among the surrounded azure blocks. Returns 0 if no surrounded blocks exist.
  - find_first_max_block: Identify the first block (scanning left-to-right) in the list of surrounded blocks that possesses the calculated maximum length.
  - change_color: Modify the color of all pixels within the identified *first*, maximum-length, surrounded block to orange (7).
relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels are adjacent horizontally in the sequence.
  - grouping: Pixels of the same color form blocks.
  - order: Blocks are processed based on their position (left-to-right).
  - conditionality: Color change depends on block color (azure), surrounding colors (white), block length (maximum among surrounded), and order (first occurrence).
invariants:
  - White (0) pixels always remain white (0).
  - Azure (8) pixels remain azure (8) unless they are part of the *single* block selected for transformation.
  - The length and dimensions (if originally 2D) of the grid/sequence remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid (assume it's a NumPy array, potentially 1D or 2D). If it's 2D, flatten it into a 1D sequence for processing. Store the original shape if necessary for reconstruction (though based on analysis, the output seems to retain the flattened structure).
2.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the (flattened) input sequence.
3.  Scan the input sequence to identify all contiguous blocks composed solely of azure (8) pixels. For each block, record its start index, end index, and length.
4.  Create an empty list called `candidate_blocks`.
5.  Iterate through the identified azure blocks. For each block:
    *   Check if its start index is greater than 0 AND the pixel at `start_index - 1` is white (0).
    *   Check if its end index is less than `sequence_length - 1` AND the pixel at `end_index + 1` is white (0).
    *   If both conditions are true, add the block's information (start, end, length) to the `candidate_blocks` list. Maintain the order based on start index.
6.  If `candidate_blocks` is empty, return the unmodified output sequence (potentially reshaped to original dimensions if input was 2D and reshaping is required).
7.  Determine the maximum length (`max_len`) present among all blocks in `candidate_blocks`.
8.  Iterate through `candidate_blocks` *in the order they were added*. Find the *first* block whose length equals `max_len`.
9.  If such a block is found (let its range be `first_max_start` to `first_max_end`):
    *   Modify the `output_sequence`: For each index `i` from `first_max_start` to `first_max_end` (inclusive), set `output_sequence[i]` to orange (7).
10. Return the modified `output_sequence` (potentially reshaped).
