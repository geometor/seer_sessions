For each row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of blue pixels (value 1).\n3. Determine the length of each blue segment found.\n4. Find the maximum length among these segments within the row.\n5. Identify the blue segment(s) in the row that have this maximum length.\n6. If there's only one segment with the maximum length, select it.\n7. If multiple segments share the maximum length, select the one that appears earliest (i.e., has the smallest starting column index).\n8. Change the color of all pixels within this selected segment from blue (1) to yellow (4).\n9. Leave all other pixels (including other blue segments that were not selected) unchanged.\n10.
