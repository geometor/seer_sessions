Grid:
  - type: 2D Array
  - dimensions: 4x8 (inferred)
  - background_color: white (0)

Objects:
  - type: Contiguous Pixels
  - color: maroon (9)
  - connectivity: 4-way (horizontal/vertical)

  - action: Color Change
  - target_criteria: The single largest maroon object (by pixel count).
  - input_color: maroon (9)
