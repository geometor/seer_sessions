Calculate the size (number of pixels) for each identified maroon object. Determine the maximum size among these objects. Locate the maroon object that corresponds to this maximum size. Create a copy of the input grid. Change the color of all pixels belonging to the identified largest maroon object from maroon (9) to yellow (4) in the copied grid.
