*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output are single-row grids (or 1D arrays) of the same dimensions (1x26).
    *   The input grid contains white (0) and orange (7) pixels.
    *   The output grid contains white (0), orange (7), and blue (1) pixels.
    *   The transformation involves changing the color of a specific contiguous horizontal segment of orange pixels to blue.
    *   Comparing input and output, the segment of five orange pixels from index 9 to 13 (`7 7 7 7 7`) in the input is changed to blue (`1 1 1 1 1`) in the output.
    *   Other orange segments exist in the input, but they remain unchanged in the output.
    *   The changed segment `7 7 7 7 7` is surrounded by white (0) pixels in the input: `... 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 ...`.
    *   Other orange segments also surrounded by white pixels (`0 7 0`, `0 7 7 7 7 0`, `0 7 7 7 0`) are shorter and do not change color.
    *   This suggests the transformation targets the longest horizontal segment of orange pixels that is enclosed by white pixels on both its left and right sides.

    relationships_and_conditions:
      - condition: Identify horizontal segments of orange pixels.
      - condition: Filter for segments where the pixel immediately to the left AND the pixel immediately to the right are both white. Include boundary checks (cannot be bordered by grid edge if considering it 'white').
      - condition: Calculate the length of each qualifying segment.
      - condition: Determine the maximum length among these qualifying segments.
      - rule: Apply the color_change action (orange to blue) only to the qualifying segment(s) that have this maximum length.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments composed entirely of orange (7) pixels within the input grid row.
    2.  For each identified orange segment, check if it is immediately bordered by a white (0) pixel on its left side and a white (0) pixel on its right side within the grid.
    3.  From the segments that meet this bordering condition, determine the maximum length.
    4.  Identify all segments that satisfy the bordering condition and have this maximum length.
    5.  Change the color of all pixels within these identified longest, white-bordered segments from orange (7) to blue (1).
    6.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.
