**General Assessment**

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms the initial suspicion that the input and output data are multi-dimensional grids (NumPy arrays in the testing environment) rather than simple 1D lists. The previous code attempted to iterate and compare elements as if it were a 1D list, causing errors when encountering array slices or entire rows during iteration or comparison.

The core logic identified—finding the longest contiguous sequence of azure (8) and changing its color to blue (1)—appears sound based on visual inspection of the flattened examples. However, this logic needs to be adapted to a 2D grid context. The concept of a "contiguous sequence" most likely refers to a *horizontal* sequence within a single row.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Grid Dimensions:** Treat the input as a 2D grid. Use `tool_code` to determine the likely dimensions by reshaping the provided 1D data. The length of each example is 21, suggesting potential shapes like 3x7 or 7x3.
2.  **Adapt Sequence Finding:** Modify the sequence detection logic to operate row by row on the 2D grid, identifying horizontal contiguous sequences of azure pixels.
3.  **Identify Global Maximum:** Keep track of the longest horizontal sequence found across *all* rows. Store its length, row index, start column, and end column.
4.  **Implement Tie-breaking:** Refine the tie-breaking rule for the 2D context. If multiple horizontal sequences share the maximum length:
    *   Prioritize the sequence in the highest row index (bottom-most).
    *   If there's still a tie (multiple max-length sequences in the same bottom-most row), prioritize the one with the highest starting column index (right-most).
5.  **Apply Transformation:** Create a copy of the input grid and change the color of the pixels belonging to the selected longest sequence (identified by row index, start column, end column) from azure (8) to blue (1).

Longest Azure Sequence (with tie-breaking):

```
The code execution confirms:
1.  The inputs are consistently length 21, making a 3x7 grid shape highly probable.
2.  Reshaping to 3x7 grids aligns visually with the transformation (longest horizontal sequence changing color).
3.  The logic for finding horizontal azure sequences works correctly for the examples.
4.  The logic for selecting the single longest sequence (using the defined tie-breaking: lowest row, then rightmost start column) correctly identifies the sequence that is modified in each training example.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
Output_Colors: [white (0), azure (8), blue (1)]
Input_Structure: 2D grid of pixels (likely 3x7 for training examples).
Output_Structure: 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input.

Objects:
  - type: horizontal_contiguous_sequence
    color: azure (8)
    location: specific row within the grid
    properties:
      - row_index: integer
      - start_column: integer
      - end_column: integer
      - length: integer (number of pixels = end_column - start_column + 1)

Transformation:
  - type: identification
    target: all horizontal contiguous sequences of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    action: record their row_index, start_column, end_column, and length.
  - type: comparison_selection
    target: the recorded azure sequences.
    action:
      - Find the maximum length among all recorded sequences.
      - Select the sequence(s) possessing this maximum length.
      - Apply tie-breaking rules if multiple sequences have the maximum length:
          1. Select the sequence with the largest row_index (lowest row).
          2. If a tie remains, select the sequence with the largest start_column index (rightmost).
  - type: color_change
    target: the single azure sequence selected after comparison and tie-breaking.
    from_color: azure (8)
    to_color: blue (1)
    scope: All pixels within the selected sequence (from start_column to end_column in the identified row_index).
  - type: preservation
    target: all other pixels in the grid (white pixels and azure pixels not part of the selected longest sequence).
    action: remain unchanged in the output grid.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid with rows and columns. Contiguity is defined horizontally within a row.
  - Numerical: Lengths of sequences are calculated and compared to find the maximum. Row and column indices are used for location and tie-breaking.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list to store information about identified azure sequences.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top (row 0) to bottom.
3.  Within each row, scan from left (column 0) to right to identify all distinct horizontal contiguous sequences (blocks) composed solely of azure (8) pixels.
4.  For each azure sequence found, record its row index, starting column index, ending column index, and its length (number of pixels). Store this information.
5.  After scanning all rows, examine the recorded information for all found azure sequences.
6.  If no azure sequences were found, copy the input grid directly to the output and stop.
7.  Determine the maximum length among all recorded sequences.
8.  Identify the sequence (or sequences) that has this maximum length.
9.  If only one sequence has the maximum length, select it.
10. If multiple sequences share the maximum length, apply tie-breaking rules:
    a.  Select the sequence with the highest row index (located in the lowest row).
    b.  If a tie still exists (multiple max-length sequences in the same lowest row), select the sequence with the highest starting column index (the rightmost one).
11. Create the output grid by making a copy of the input grid.
12. Modify the output grid by changing the color of all pixels within the finally selected sequence (identified by its row index, start column, and end column) from azure (8) to blue (1).
13. Ensure all other pixels in the output grid retain their original colors from the input grid.
