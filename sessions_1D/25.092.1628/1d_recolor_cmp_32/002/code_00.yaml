Input_Colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
Output_Colors: [white (0), azure (8), blue (1)]
Input_Structure: 2D grid of pixels (likely 3x7 for training examples).
Output_Structure: 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input.

Objects:
  - type: horizontal_contiguous_sequence
    color: azure (8)
    location: specific row within the grid
    properties:
      - row_index: integer
      - start_column: integer
      - end_column: integer
      - length: integer (number of pixels = end_column - start_column + 1)

Transformation:
  - type: identification
    target: all horizontal contiguous sequences of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    action: record their row_index, start_column, end_column, and length.
  - type: comparison_selection
    target: the recorded azure sequences.
    action:
      - Find the maximum length among all recorded sequences.
      - Select the sequence(s) possessing this maximum length.
      - Apply tie-breaking rules if multiple sequences have the maximum length:
          1. Select the sequence with the largest row_index (lowest row).
          2. If a tie remains, select the sequence with the largest start_column index (rightmost).
  - type: color_change
    target: the single azure sequence selected after comparison and tie-breaking.
    from_color: azure (8)
    to_color: blue (1)
    scope: All pixels within the selected sequence (from start_column to end_column in the identified row_index).
  - type: preservation
    target: all other pixels in the grid (white pixels and azure pixels not part of the selected longest sequence).
    action: remain unchanged in the output grid.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid with rows and columns. Contiguity is defined horizontally within a row.
  - Numerical: Lengths of sequences are calculated and compared to find the maximum. Row and column indices are used for location and tie-breaking.
