**Perception**

The input and output data are presented as one-dimensional arrays of integers, likely representing rows or flattened grids from an ARC task. The primary colors involved are white (0) and azure (8) in the input, with blue (1) appearing in the output. The transformation appears localized, affecting only a specific subset of the azure pixels.

Observing the examples, the core transformation involves changing the color of a contiguous sequence of azure (8) pixels to blue (1). Not all sequences of azure are altered. By comparing the lengths of the azure sequences within each input, a pattern emerges: the sequence that undergoes the color change is consistently the one with the greatest length.

For instance:
- In `train_1`, the azure sequences have lengths 3, 5, and 1. The sequence of length 5 is changed to blue.
- In `train_2`, the azure sequences have lengths 1, 1, 3, and 4. The sequence of length 4 is changed to blue.
- In `train_3`, the azure sequences have lengths 6, 3, and 7. The sequence of length 7 is changed to blue.

This suggests the rule involves identifying all contiguous blocks of azure pixels, finding the longest block, and changing its color to blue.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
Output_Colors: [white (0), azure (8), blue (1)]
Input_Structure: Likely 1D representation (row or flattened grid) of pixel values.
Output_Structure: Same dimensions and structure as input, with some pixel values changed.

Objects:
  - type: contiguous_sequence
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - length: integer (number of pixels in the sequence)
      - location: start and end indices

Transformation:
  - type: color_change
    target: one specific contiguous sequence of azure (8) pixels
    from_color: azure (8)
    to_color: blue (1)
    condition: The target sequence must be the one with the maximum length among all azure (8) sequences present in the input. If multiple sequences share the maximum length, the examples suggest the last occurring one might be chosen, but this needs confirmation with more data.
  - type: preservation
    target: all other pixels (white pixels and azure pixels not part of the longest sequence)
    action: remain unchanged

Relationships:
  - Comparison: Lengths of all identified azure (8) sequences are compared to find the maximum.
  - Selection: Only the sequence(s) matching the maximum length criteria are selected for the color change action.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input data to identify all distinct contiguous sequences (blocks) composed solely of azure (8) pixels. Record the starting position, ending position, and length of each sequence.
2.  Compare the lengths of all identified azure sequences.
3.  Determine the maximum length found among these sequences.
4.  Identify the specific azure sequence (or sequences, if there's a tie) that has this maximum length. If there is more than one sequence with the maximum length, select the one that appears latest (rightmost) in the input array.
5.  Create the output data by copying the input data.
6.  Modify the output data by changing the color of all pixels within the selected longest azure sequence from azure (8) to blue (1).
7.  Ensure all other pixels retain their original colors from the input.
