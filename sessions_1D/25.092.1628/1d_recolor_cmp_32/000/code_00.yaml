Input_Colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
Output_Colors: [white (0), azure (8), blue (1)]
Input_Structure: Likely 1D representation (row or flattened grid) of pixel values.
Output_Structure: Same dimensions and structure as input, with some pixel values changed.

Objects:
  - type: contiguous_sequence
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - length: integer (number of pixels in the sequence)
      - location: start and end indices

Transformation:
  - type: color_change
    target: one specific contiguous sequence of azure (8) pixels
    from_color: azure (8)
    to_color: blue (1)
    condition: The target sequence must be the one with the maximum length among all azure (8) sequences present in the input. If multiple sequences share the maximum length, the examples suggest the last occurring one might be chosen, but this needs confirmation with more data.
  - type: preservation
    target: all other pixels (white pixels and azure pixels not part of the longest sequence)
    action: remain unchanged

Relationships:
  - Comparison: Lengths of all identified azure (8) sequences are compared to find the maximum.
  - Selection: Only the sequence(s) matching the maximum length criteria are selected for the color change action.
