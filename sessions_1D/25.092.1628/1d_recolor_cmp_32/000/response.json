The primary colors involved are white (0) and azure (8) in the input, with blue (1) appearing in the output. The transformation appears localized, affecting only a specific subset of the azure pixels.\n\nObserving the examples, the core transformation involves changing the color of a contiguous sequence of azure (8) pixels to blue (1). Not all sequences of azure are altered. By comparing the lengths of the azure sequences within each input, a pattern emerges: the sequence that undergoes the color change is consistently the one with the greatest length.\n\nFor instance:\n- In `train_1`, the azure sequences have lengths 3, 5, and 1. The sequence of length 5 is changed to blue.\n- In `train_2`, the azure sequences have lengths 1, 1, 3, and 4. The sequence of length 4 is changed to blue.\n- In `train_3`, the azure sequences have lengths 6, 3, and 7. The sequence of length 7 is changed to blue.\n\nThis suggests the rule involves identifying all contiguous blocks of azure pixels, finding the longest block, and changing its color to blue.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
