Grid:
  Colors:
    - white (0)
    - gray (5)
    - azure (8) # Appears only in output
  Structure: Assumed 1D array (vector) based on data length (26) and failed 2D reshape.

Objects:
  - Type: HorizontalSegment
    Color: gray (5)
    Properties:
      - Length: Integer count of contiguous gray pixels.
      - Position: Start and end indices within the 1D array.
  - Type: Background
    Color: white (0)

Relationships:
  - Comparison: The length of each gray HorizontalSegment is compared against the maximum length found among *all* gray HorizontalSegments within the *same* input grid.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels in the 1D input array.
  - Calculate: Determine the length of each identified segment.
  - FindMaximum: Find the maximum length (`max_len`) among all calculated segment lengths. If no segments, do nothing.
  - ConditionalRecolor:
    - If a gray segment's length == `max_len`, change its color to azure (8).
    - If a gray segment's length < `max_len`, keep its color gray (5).
  - Preserve: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.

Result:
  - The output grid reflects the conditional recoloring of gray segments based on whether their length equals the maximum segment length found in the input.
