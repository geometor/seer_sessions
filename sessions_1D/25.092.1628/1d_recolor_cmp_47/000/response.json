            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are single-channel grids represented by single digits (likely rows of pixels).\n2.  **Colors:** The input grids primarily use white (0) and gray (5). The output grids introduce azure (8) while retaining white (0) and gray (5).\n3.  **Key Features:** The gray pixels (5) in the input form contiguous horizontal segments of varying lengths, separated by white pixels (0).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selectively changing the color of some gray (5) segments to azure (8). White pixels (0) remain unchanged. The rule determining which gray segments change seems related to their length compared to other gray segments within the same grid.\n5.  **Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   In all examples, we identify horizontal runs (segments) of gray pixels.\n    *   We calculate the length of each horizontal gray segment.\n    *   We determine the minimum length among all horizontal gray segments within the input grid.\n    *   Comparing the input and output, it appears that gray segments whose length is strictly greater than this minimum length are changed to azure (8).\n    *   Gray segments whose length is equal to the minimum length remain unchanged (stay gray, 5).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
