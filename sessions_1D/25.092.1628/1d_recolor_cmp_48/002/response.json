ARC tasks typically represent grids as 2D arrays, even if they visually appear 1D (like a single row or column). The previous analysis correctly identified the *logical* operation happening on a single row but failed to account for the standard 2D data structure.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input data structure is indeed 2D, even if only containing one row.\n2.  Update the understanding and documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) to reflect that the transformation specifically targets the *first row* of the 2D input grid.\n3.  The core logic of finding the longest block(s) of red pixels within that row and changing their color remains the same.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"
