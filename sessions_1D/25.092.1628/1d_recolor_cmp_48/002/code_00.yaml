task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Input/Output are 2D arrays
relevant_grid_area: first_row # Operations apply only to the first row (index 0)
colors:
  - background: white (0)
  - input_object_color: red (2)
  - output_object_color: blue (1)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: red (2)
    location: within the first row
    properties:
      - length
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    among: all red blocks in the first row of the input
    criterion: maximum length
actions:
  - type: color_change
    target: red blocks within the first row that have the maximum length
    from_color: red (2)
    to_color: blue (1)
invariance:
  - Pixels outside the first row (if any existed) would remain unchanged.
  - Pixels within the first row that are not part of the longest red block(s) retain their original color.
  - The positions and overall shape of the grid remain the same.
