task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row
colors:
  - background: white (0)
  - input_object: red (2)
  - output_object: blue (1)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    among: all red blocks in the input
    criterion: maximum length
actions:
  - type: color_change
    target: red blocks with maximum length
    from_color: red (2)
    to_color: blue (1)
invariance:
  - Pixels not part of the longest red block(s) retain their original color.
  - The positions and lengths of the changed blocks remain the same, only the color changes.
