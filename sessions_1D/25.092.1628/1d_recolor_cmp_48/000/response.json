The block of length 7 is changed to blue.\n    *   In `train_2`, red blocks have lengths 1, 5, 5. Both blocks of length 5 are changed to blue.\n    *   In `train_3`, red blocks have lengths 2, 3, 4. The block of length 4 is changed to blue.\n*   The rule seems to involve finding the *longest* contiguous block(s) of red pixels and changing their color to blue. If there's a tie for the longest length, all blocks of that maximum length are changed.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
