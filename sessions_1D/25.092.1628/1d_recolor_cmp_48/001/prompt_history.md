Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input and output are both single rows of pixels (effectively 1D grids).
*   The primary colors involved are white (0) as the background, red (2), and blue (1).
*   The input contains various contiguous horizontal blocks (objects) of red pixels separated by white pixels.
*   The output is largely identical to the input, except that certain blocks of red pixels have been changed to blue (1).
*   By comparing the inputs and outputs, it appears the transformation identifies specific contiguous blocks of red pixels based on some property and changes their color.
*   Observing the lengths of the red blocks:
    *   In `train_1`, red blocks have lengths 2, 1, 7, 2. The block of length 7 is changed to blue.
    *   In `train_2`, red blocks have lengths 1, 5, 5. Both blocks of length 5 are changed to blue.
    *   In `train_3`, red blocks have lengths 2, 3, 4. The block of length 4 is changed to blue.
*   The rule seems to involve finding the *longest* contiguous block(s) of red pixels and changing their color to blue. If there's a tie for the longest length, all blocks of that maximum length are changed.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row
colors:
  - background: white (0)
  - input_object: red (2)
  - output_object: blue (1)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    among: all red blocks in the input
    criterion: maximum length
actions:
  - type: color_change
    target: red blocks with maximum length
    from_color: red (2)
    to_color: blue (1)
invariance:
  - Pixels not part of the longest red block(s) retain their original color.
  - The positions and lengths of the changed blocks remain the same, only the color changes.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input row to identify all contiguous horizontal blocks consisting solely of red (2) pixels.
2.  For each identified red block, determine its length (number of pixels).
3.  Find the maximum length among all the red blocks identified in step 2.
4.  Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row.
5.  Iterate through the identified red blocks again. For every red block whose length matches the maximum length found in step 3, change the color of all pixels within that block in the output row from red (2) to blue (1).
6.  Pixels that were not part of any maximum-length red block remain unchanged in the output row.
7.  Return the modified output row.
