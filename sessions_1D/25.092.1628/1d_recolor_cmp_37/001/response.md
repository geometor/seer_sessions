"""
Identifies all contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels in the input row. 
Determines the maximum length among these gray segments. 
Changes the color of all gray segments whose length matches this maximum length to maroon (9). 
Other pixels (white/0 and shorter gray segments) remain unchanged.
