task_description: For each row in the input grid, identify all contiguous horizontal segments of gray pixels. Determine the maximum length among these segments within that row. Change the color of all gray segments in that row whose length equals the maximum length to maroon. Pixels not part of a longest gray segment remain unchanged.
input_format: 2D grid (list of lists or NumPy array) of integers (0-9).
output_format: 2D grid with the same dimensions as the input.
colors:
  - background: white (0)
  - primary: gray (5)
  - transformed: maroon (9)
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: list of rows
      - dimensions: height, width
  - type: row
    properties:
      - pixels: list of integers
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (0, 5, 9)
  - type: horizontal_segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color within a single row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - location: Start and end column indices within the row.
focus_objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
relationships:
  - type: comparison (row-wise)
    property: length
    of: gray horizontal segments within a row
    operation: find_maximum
actions:
  - name: process_grid
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    steps: Iterate through each row of the input_grid and apply 'process_row'.
  - name: process_row
    input: input_row
    output: output_row
    steps:
      - identify_horizontal_segments (input_row, gray) -> gray_segments
      - find_max_length (gray_segments) -> max_len
      - recolor_segments (input_row, gray_segments, max_len) -> output_row
  - name: identify_horizontal_segments
    input: row, target_color
    output: list of horizontal segments (location, length) for the target_color
  - name: find_max_length
    input: list of segment lengths
    output: maximum length value (0 if list is empty)
  - name: recolor_segments
    input: input_row, list_of_gray_segments, maximum_length
    output: output_row
    condition: Change color from gray (5) to maroon (9) for all gray segments whose length equals the maximum length. Keep other pixels unchanged.
