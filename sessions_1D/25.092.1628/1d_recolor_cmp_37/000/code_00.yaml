task_description: Change the color of the longest contiguous horizontal gray segment(s) to maroon.
colors:
  - white: 0
  - gray: 5
  - maroon: 9
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (0, 5, 9)
  - type: segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color along a row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - location: Start and end indices within the row.
focus_objects:
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    of: gray segments
    operation: find_maximum
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input row
    output: list of gray segments (location, length)
  - name: find_max_length
    input: list of gray segment lengths
    output: maximum length value
  - name: recolor_segments
    input: input row, list of gray segments, maximum length value
    output: output row
    condition: Change color from gray (5) to maroon (9) for all gray segments whose length equals the maximum length.
assumptions:
  - The input/output data represents a single row or operates row-wise.
  - Contiguity is defined only horizontally within the row.
