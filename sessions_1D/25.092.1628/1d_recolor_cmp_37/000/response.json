Without explicit dimensions, I will assume these represent single rows for analysis, as the changes observed occur linearly within the sequence. The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), and maroon (9).\n2.  **Core Objects:** The key objects appear to be contiguous horizontal segments (sequences) of gray (5) pixels within the row.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying these gray segments, analyzing their lengths, and selectively changing the color of some segments based on this length analysis.\n4.  **Color Change:** Specifically, gray (5) segments are changed to maroon (9). White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Rule:** By comparing the input and output across the examples, the rule appears to be: find the *longest* contiguous segment(s) of gray pixels. Change *all* segments that match this maximum length to maroon. Shorter gray segments remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
