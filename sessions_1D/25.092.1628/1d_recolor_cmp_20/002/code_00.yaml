task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Input/Output are lists of lists
grid_shape_observed: (1, N) # All examples show single-row grids
input_colors:
  - white (0)
  - blue (1)
output_colors:
  - white (0)
  - blue (1)
  - magenta (6)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    color: blue (1)
    location: within a grid row
    properties:
      - length: count of consecutive blue pixels in the row
relationships:
  - comparison: length of blue segments within the same row
actions:
  - process_grid: iterate through each row of the input grid (only one row in examples)
  - identify: contiguous horizontal segments of blue pixels within the current row
  - calculate: length of each blue segment in the row
  - find: maximum length among all blue segments found in that row
  - select: all blue segments in the row whose length equals the maximum length for that row
  - transform: change the color of selected blue segments from blue (1) to magenta (6) in the output grid row
invariance:
  - grid dimensions remain unchanged
  - white pixels remain unchanged
  - blue segments shorter than the maximum length for their row remain unchanged
  - the position of all pixels remains unchanged
  - transformations are contained within each row (no inter-row dependencies observed)
