The output contains white (0), blue (1), and magenta (6) pixels. The transformation modifies some of the blue pixels to magenta while keeping others blue and leaving the white pixels unchanged. The change seems related to contiguous blocks of blue pixels. Specifically, the longest continuous horizontal sequence(s) of blue pixels in the input are changed to magenta in the output. If there are multiple sequences of the same maximum length, all of them are changed. Shorter sequences of blue pixels remain blue.\n\n**Facts:**\n"
