task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row
input_colors:
  - white (0)
  - blue (1)
output_colors:
  - white (0)
  - blue (1)
  - magenta (6)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length: count of consecutive blue pixels
relationships:
  - comparison: length of blue segments
actions:
  - identify: contiguous horizontal segments of blue pixels
  - calculate: length of each blue segment
  - find: maximum length among all blue segments
  - select: all blue segments whose length equals the maximum length
  - transform: change the color of selected blue segments from blue (1) to magenta (6)
invariance:
  - white pixels remain unchanged
  - blue segments shorter than the maximum length remain unchanged
  - the position of all pixels remains unchanged
