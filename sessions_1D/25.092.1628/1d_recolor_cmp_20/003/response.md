"""
Identifies all contiguous horizontal segments of blue (1) pixels within each row of the input grid.
Calculates the length of each blue segment in the row.
Finds the maximum length among all blue segments found in that row.
Changes the color of all blue segments in the row that have the row's maximum length to magenta (6).
Leaves all other pixels (white pixels and shorter blue segments) unchanged.
The process is applied independently to each row.
