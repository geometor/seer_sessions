            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training example pair.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input consists of a sequence of pixels, primarily white (0) and maroon (9). The maroon pixels form distinct horizontal segments separated by white pixels.\n*   **Output:** The output is a sequence of the same length as the input. It contains white (0), maroon (9), and yellow (4) pixels.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* of the maroon segments to yellow. Comparing the input and output sequences reveals that only specific maroon segments undergo this color change.\n\n**Analysis of Changes:**\n\n1.  **Identify Maroon Segments:** First, we locate all contiguous blocks (segments) of maroon (9) pixels in the input.\n    *   `train_1`: `[9]` (len 1), `[9, 9, 9, 9, 9]` (len 5), `[9, 9, 9, 9]` (len 4), `[9, 9, 9, 9]` (len 4), `[9, 9]` (len 2)\n    *   `train_2`: `[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]` (len 7), `[9, 9, 9, 9]` (len 4), `[9, 9, 9, 9, 9]` (len 5)\n    *   `train_3`: `[9, 9, 9]` (len 3), `[9, 9, 9, 9]` (len 4), `[9, 9, 9, 9]` (len 4), `[9, 9]` (len 2), `[9, 9]` (len 2), `[9, 9]` (len 2)\n2.  **Identify Changed Segments:** Next, we see which segments changed from maroon (9) to yellow (4) in the output.\n    *   `train_1`: The segment of length 5 changed.\n    *   `train_2`: The segment of length 7 changed.\n    *   `train_3`: Both segments of length 4 changed.\n3.  **Determine the Rule:** By observing the lengths of the segments that changed versus those that didn't, a pattern emerges:\n    *   In `train_1`, the longest segment (length 5) changed.\n    *   In `train_2`, the longest segment (length 7) changed.\n    *   In `train_3`, the longest segments (both length 4) changed.\n    *   The rule appears to be: identify the longest horizontal segment(s) of maroon pixels and change their color to yellow. If multiple segments share the maximum length, all of them are changed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
