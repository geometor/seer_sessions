task_description: Change the color of the longest horizontal maroon segment(s) to yellow.
elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background
  - type: pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    role: input_object_component
  - type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    role: output_object_component
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    relevant_color: maroon (9)
properties:
  - name: length
    applies_to: segment
    description: The number of pixels in the segment.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    comparison: maximum
    description: Identify the segment(s) with the greatest length among all maroon segments.
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input grid/sequence
    output: list of maroon segments with their properties (position, length)
  - name: find_max_length
    input: list of maroon segments
    output: the maximum length found
  - name: filter_longest_segments
    input: list of maroon segments, maximum length
    output: list of maroon segments with length equal to the maximum
  - name: recolor_segments
    target: segments identified in filter_longest_segments
    from_color: maroon (9)
    to_color: yellow (4)
    condition: segment length equals maximum length
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: Assumed 1D or transformation applies row-wise independently in 2D.
  - preservation: Size and non-target pixels remain unchanged.
