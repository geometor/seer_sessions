            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" arises because the previous code assumed the input `input_grid` was a 1D list, while it is actually a multi-dimensional NumPy array (representing a 2D grid). The comparison `if pixel == maroon_color:` works for single elements, but somewhere in the interaction with the input structure (likely during initialization or processing), an array is being treated as a boolean, causing the error.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the logic to operate on a 2D NumPy array. The core concept of finding the longest horizontal maroon segments and changing their color to yellow seems correct based on the initial 1D interpretation of the examples. This logic needs to be applied independently to each row of the 2D input grid.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's confirm the structure of the input data for each training example."

Although represented as single rows (1xN) in the provided flat lists, the error indicates the framework likely passes them as multi-dimensional arrays, possibly with varying rows and columns in other hidden test cases. The assumption moving forward should be a generic 2D grid (MxN).\n*   **Segmentation Logic:** The code execution successfully identifies the horizontal maroon segments and their lengths for each (single-row) example.\n*   **Rule Confirmation:** The maximum length calculation confirms the observations made previously:\n    *   Train 1: Max length is 5. Output shows the segment of length 5 changed to yellow.\n    *   Train 2: Max length is 7. Output shows the segment of length 7 changed to yellow.\n    *   Train 3: Max length is 4. Output shows both segments of length 4 changed to yellow.\n*   **Conclusion:** The core logic remains valid but must be applied row by row to a 2D input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
