task_description: For each row in the input grid, identify the longest horizontal segment(s) of maroon pixels and change their color to yellow.
elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background
  - type: pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    role: input_object_component
  - type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    role: output_object_component
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color within a single row.
    relevant_color: maroon (9)
properties:
  - name: length
    applies_to: segment
    description: The number of pixels in the segment.
  - name: location
    applies_to: segment
    description: Start and end column index within its row.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    comparison: maximum
    scope: per_row
    description: Identify the segment(s) with the greatest length among all maroon segments *within the same row*.
actions:
  - name: iterate_rows
    input: input grid
    output: processing applied to each row individually
  - name: identify_segments_in_row
    input: grid row
    output: list of maroon segments in that row with properties (location, length)
  - name: find_max_length_in_row
    input: list of maroon segments for a row
    output: the maximum length found in that row
  - name: filter_longest_segments_in_row
    input: list of maroon segments for a row, maximum length for that row
    output: list of maroon segments from that row with length equal to the maximum
  - name: recolor_segments
    target: segments identified in filter_longest_segments_in_row
    from_color: maroon (9)
    to_color: yellow (4)
    condition: segment length equals maximum length for its row
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 2D (MxN grid)
  - processing_scope: row-wise independent
  - preservation: Grid dimensions and pixels not part of the longest maroon segments in each row remain unchanged.
