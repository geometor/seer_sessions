Observations:
  - Input and output are 1D arrays (or 1xN grids).
  - Pixels involved: white (0), maroon (9), gray (5).
  - Gray pixels only appear in the output.
  - The transformation modifies sequences of maroon pixels.
Objects:
  - Type: Sequence
    - Description: A contiguous run of pixels of the same color.
    - Key Properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the sequence.
      - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      - location: Start and end indices of the sequence.
  - Relevant Sequences:
    - Sequences of maroon (9) pixels.
Relationships:
  - Comparison: The lengths of different maroon sequences within the same input are compared.
  - Maximum Length: There exists a maximum length among all maroon sequences in a given input.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all sequences of consecutive maroon pixels in the input.
  - Calculate: Determine the length of each identified maroon sequence.
  - Find Maximum: Determine the maximum length among all maroon sequences.
  - Filter: Select only those maroon sequences whose length equals the maximum length found.
  - Transform: For each selected sequence, change the color of its pixels from maroon (9) to gray (5).
  - Preserve: Leave all other pixels (white pixels and maroon sequences shorter than the maximum length) unchanged.
