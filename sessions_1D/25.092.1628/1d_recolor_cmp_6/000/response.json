The primary colors involved are white (0) and maroon (9). In the output, gray (5) also appears. The transformation seems to focus on contiguous sequences (runs) of maroon pixels. Comparing input and output pairs reveals that certain sequences of maroon pixels are replaced by sequences of gray pixels of the same length, while others remain unchanged. The key factor determining whether a maroon sequence is changed appears to be its length relative to other maroon sequences within the same input. Specifically, only the sequences with the maximum length are altered.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
