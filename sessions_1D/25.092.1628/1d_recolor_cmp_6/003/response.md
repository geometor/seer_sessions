"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by identifying contiguous sequences (runs) of maroon (9) pixels within the single row. It finds the maximum length among all such sequences. Then, it replaces all maroon sequences that have this maximum length with sequences of gray (5) pixels of the same length in the output grid. All other pixels, including white (0) pixels and maroon sequences shorter than the maximum length, remain unchanged.
