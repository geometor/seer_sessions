Observations:
  - Input and output are 2D grids, specifically 1xN grids (single row).
  - Pixels involved: white (0), maroon (9). Gray (5) appears only in the output.
  - The transformation operates solely on the single row of the grid.
  - The transformation modifies specific contiguous sequences (runs) of maroon pixels.
Objects:
  - Type: Grid
    - Description: A 2D array representing the input or output. In this task, all grids are 1xN.
    - Properties:
      - dimensions: height=1, width=N
      - pixels: Integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - Type: Sequence
    - Description: A contiguous run of pixels of the same color within the grid's single row.
    - Key Properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the sequence (primarily interested in maroon=9).
      - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      - location: Start and end column indices within the row.
Relationships:
  - Comparison: The lengths of different maroon sequences within the grid's row are compared.
  - Maximum Length: There exists a maximum length among all maroon sequences in the row.
Actions:
  - Access Row: Extract the single row from the input grid.
  - Identify Sequences: Locate all contiguous sequences of maroon (9) pixels in the row. Record their start index, end index, and length.
  - Handle No Sequences: If no maroon sequences are found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
  - Find Maximum Length: Determine the maximum length among all identified maroon sequences.
  - Filter by Max Length: Select only those maroon sequences whose length equals the maximum length.
  - Transform Pixels: For each selected sequence:
      - Create a copy of the input grid for the output.
      - Modify the output grid by changing the color of the pixels corresponding to the sequence's location from maroon (9) to gray (5).
  - Preserve Others: Leave all other pixels (white pixels and maroon sequences shorter than the maximum length) in the output grid unchanged from the input grid.
