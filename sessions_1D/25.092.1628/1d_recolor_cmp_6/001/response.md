"""
This program transforms a 1D input grid by identifying contiguous sequences (runs)
of maroon (9) pixels. It finds the maximum length among all such sequences. 
Then, it replaces all maroon sequences that have this maximum length with 
sequences of gray (5) pixels of the same length. All other pixels, including 
maroon sequences shorter than the maximum length and white (0) pixels, remain 
unchanged.
