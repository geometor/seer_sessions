TASK_TYPE: color_transformation
GRID_DIMENSIONS: 1D (or single row 2D)
OBJECTS:
  - type: pixel_segment
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - contiguity: horizontal
      - length: variable
      - position: start_index, end_index
TRANSFORMATION:
  - action: identify_segments
    input: input_grid
    target_color: yellow (4)
    output: list of yellow segments (position and length)
  - action: find_max_length
    input: list of yellow segments
    output: maximum_length
  - action: filter_longest_segments
    input: list of yellow segments, maximum_length
    condition: segment.length == maximum_length
    output: list of longest yellow segments
  - action: change_color
    input: input_grid, list of longest yellow segments
    target_color: magenta (6)
    output: output_grid
RELATIONSHIPS:
  - comparison: segment lengths are compared to find the maximum.
  - identity: segments with length equal to the maximum length are selected.
OUTPUT_GENERATION:
  - copy: pixels not part of the longest yellow segments are copied directly from input to output.
  - modification: pixels within the identified longest yellow segments are changed from yellow (4) to magenta (6).
