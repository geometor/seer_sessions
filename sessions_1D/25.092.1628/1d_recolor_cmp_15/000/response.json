The primary colors involved are white (0), yellow (4), and magenta (6). The transformation seems to focus on contiguous segments of yellow pixels. In each example, the longest horizontal sequence(s) of yellow pixels are identified, and their color is changed to magenta. Other pixels, including shorter segments of yellow pixels and pixels of other colors, remain unchanged. If there are multiple yellow segments tied for the maximum length, all of them are changed to magenta.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
