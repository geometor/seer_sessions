A segment of four magenta pixels starting at index 3.\n2.  A segment of seven magenta pixels starting at index 10.\n\nThe output grid retains the same dimensions and the same white background pixels.\nThe first magenta segment (length 4) remains unchanged in the output.\nThe second magenta segment (length 7) has changed its color from magenta (6) to azure (8) in the output.\n\nThe transformation appears to involve identifying contiguous segments of magenta pixels and modifying the color of one of them based on a property, specifically its length. The longer of the two magenta segments changed color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
