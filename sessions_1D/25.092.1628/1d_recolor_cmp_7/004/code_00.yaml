task_description: For each row in the input grid, identify the longest contiguous horizontal segment(s) of gray pixels and change their color to orange.
grid_representation: Input and output are 2D grids (lists of lists or NumPy arrays).
colors:
  - id: 0
    name: white
    role: background
  - id: 5
    name: gray
    role: target_object_pixel
  - id: 7
    name: orange
    role: replacement_pixel
objects:
  - type: row
    description: A horizontal list of pixels within the grid.
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of gray (5) pixels within a single row.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - location: Start and end column index within the row.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    scope: within_row
    description: Gray segments within the same row are compared based on length to find the maximum length for that row.
actions:
  - name: iterate_rows
    input: input_grid
    output: processing of each row
  - name: identify_segments_in_row
    input: grid_row
    output: list of gray segments (start_index, end_index, length) for that row.
  - name: find_longest_segments_in_row
    input: list of gray segments for a row
    output: list of segments with the maximum length for that row.
  - name: recolor_segment
    input: segment_to_recolor, output_grid_row, new_color (orange/7)
    description: Changes the pixels within the specified segment's range in the corresponding output grid row to the new color.
transformation_rule:
  - step: 1
    action: initialize_output
    description: Create a deep copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
  - step: 2
    action: iterate_rows
    description: Process each row of the input grid independently.
  - step: 3
    action: identify_segments_in_row
    description: For the current row, find all contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels. Record start index, end index, and length.
  - step: 4
    action: find_longest_segments_in_row
    description: If gray segments were found in the row, determine the maximum length among them. Identify all segments in that row matching the maximum length.
  - step: 5
    action: recolor_segment
    description: For each segment identified as longest in the current row, change its pixels in the corresponding row of the output grid from gray (5) to orange (7).
  - step: 6
    action: finalize_output
    description: After processing all rows, the modified output grid is the result.
uncertainties:
  - None currently identified based on the examples and error analysis. The row-by-row application seems consistent.
