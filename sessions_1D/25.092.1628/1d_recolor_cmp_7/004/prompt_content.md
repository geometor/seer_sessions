"""
Changes the color of the longest horizontal segment(s) of gray pixels (5) 
to orange (7) within the single row of the input grid. If multiple segments 
share the maximum length, all of them are changed. Other pixels remain unchanged.

    Returns:
        A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a segment
