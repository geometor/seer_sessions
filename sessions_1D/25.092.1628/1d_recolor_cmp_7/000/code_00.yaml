task_description: Change the color of the longest horizontal segment of gray pixels to orange.
grid_representation: Input and output seem to be 1D arrays representing single rows.
colors:
  - id: 0
    name: white
    role: background
  - id: 5
    name: gray
    role: target_object_pixel
  - id: 7
    name: orange
    role: replacement_pixel
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    description: Segments are compared based on their length to find the maximum.
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input grid (row)
    output: list of gray segments (including start index, end index, and length)
  - name: find_longest_segments
    input: list of gray segments
    output: list of segments with the maximum length
  - name: recolor_segment
    input: segment_to_recolor, output_grid, new_color (orange/7)
    description: Changes the pixels within the specified segment's range in the output grid to the new color.
transformation_rule:
  - step: 1
    action: identify_segments
    description: Find all contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels in the input row.
  - step: 2
    action: find_longest_segments
    description: Determine the maximum length among these segments and identify all segments matching that length.
  - step: 3
    action: initialize_output
    description: Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial output row.
  - step: 4
    action: recolor_segment
    description: For each segment identified as longest, change its pixels in the output row from gray (5) to orange (7).
  - step: 5
    action: finalize_output
    description: The final modified row is the result.
uncertainties:
  - Does the transformation apply independently row-by-row if the input were multi-row? (Assuming single row based on examples).
  - How are ties in maximum length handled? (Assumption: all tied segments are changed).
