The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), and orange (7). The transformation focuses on changing some of the gray pixels to orange pixels, while the white pixels remain unaffected. The key seems to be identifying contiguous blocks (segments) of gray pixels and applying a rule based on the length of these segments. Comparing the input and output across the examples reveals that the *longest* contiguous segment of gray pixels in the input is changed entirely to orange pixels in the output. All other gray segments and the white background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
