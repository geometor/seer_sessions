task_description: Change the color of the longest horizontal segment(s) of gray pixels to orange within the single row of the input grid.
grid_representation: Input and output are 2D grids (e.g., list of lists). All training examples have dimensions 1x23.
colors:
  - id: 0
    name: white
    role: background
  - id: 5
    name: gray
    role: segment_pixel
  - id: 7
    name: orange
    role: replacement_pixel
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D structure containing pixels. In these examples, it's always 1x23.
  - type: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels within the grid. Here, the grid contains only one row.
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of gray (5) pixels within the row.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - start_index: The column index where the segment begins.
      - end_index: The column index where the segment ends.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    description: Gray segments within the row are compared based on their length to find the maximum length.
actions:
  - name: identify_row
    input: input_grid
    output: the_single_row (list of pixels)
    description: Extracts the first (and only) row from the input grid structure.
  - name: identify_segments
    input: the_single_row
    output: list of gray segments (including start index, end index, and length)
    description: Finds all contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels.
  - name: find_longest_segments
    input: list of gray segments
    output: list of longest segments (start index, end index)
    description: Determines the maximum length and identifies all segments matching that length. Handles cases with no segments.
  - name: initialize_output_grid
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid (copy)
    description: Creates a deep copy of the input grid structure to modify.
  - name: recolor_segment
    input: segment_to_recolor (start, end), output_grid, new_color (orange/7)
    description: Changes the pixels within the specified segment's range in the single row of the output grid to the new color.
transformation_rule:
  - step: 1
    action: initialize_output_grid
    description: Create a mutable copy of the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: identify_row
    description: Select the first (and only) row from the input grid copy.
  - step: 3
    action: identify_segments
    description: Find all contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels in this row. Record their start index, end index, and length.
  - step: 4
    action: find_longest_segments
    description: If segments were found, determine the maximum length among them. Identify all segments that have this maximum length. If no segments were found, proceed to step 6.
  - step: 5
    action: recolor_segment
    description: For each segment identified as longest, change its pixels (from start index to end index) in the selected row of the output grid copy from gray (5) to orange (7).
  - step: 6
    action: finalize_output
    description: Return the modified output grid copy.
uncertainties:
  - How to handle multi-row grids (although examples only show single rows). The current logic implicitly assumes operation only on the first row if multiple were present.
  - Confirmation that if multiple segments tie for the longest length, *all* of them are changed (metrics support this, as `pixels_changed_to_orange` equals `max_segment_length * num_longest_segments`, which is `max_segment_length` since `num_longest_segments` is always 1 in the examples).
