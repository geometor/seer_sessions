task_description: Recolor the longest contiguous block of a specific color.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
  colors_input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  colors_output: [white (0), blue (1), green (3)]

objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length (number of consecutive pixels)
      - position (start and end indices)
  - type: background
    color: white (0)

relationships:
  - comparison:
      of: length
      between: all blue (1) contiguous blocks
      purpose: find the maximum length

actions:
  - identify: all contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels.
  - calculate: the length of each identified block.
  - find: the maximum length among these blocks.
  - select: the blue (1) block(s) with the maximum length. (Assumption: If multiple, select the first encountered).
  - recolor: the selected block from blue (1) to green (3).
  - keep: all other pixels unchanged.

constraints:
  - The input grid contains at least one blue (1) pixel block. (Implied by examples).
  - The transformation only affects pixels within the selected longest blue block.
