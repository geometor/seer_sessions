            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples provided are all 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).\n2.  **Colors:** The colors involved are primarily white (0) and blue (1) in the input, and white (0), blue (1), and green (3) in the output. Green (3) seems to be introduced as a result of the transformation.\n3.  **Objects:** The most salient objects appear to be contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels, separated by white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** In each example, a specific block of blue (1) pixels in the input is changed to green (3) pixels in the output. Other blue blocks and all white pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Identifying the Target Block:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the block `1 1 1 1` (length 4) is changed. Other blue blocks have lengths 1, 1, 2, 2. The changed block is the longest.\n    *   In `train_2`, the block `1 1 1 1 1` (length 5) is changed. Other blue blocks have lengths 3, 3, 3, 1. The changed block is the longest.\n    *   In `train_3`, the block `1 1 1 1 1 1 1` (length 7) is changed. Other blue blocks have lengths 2, 6. The changed block is the longest.\n6.  **Rule Inference:** The transformation rule seems to identify the longest contiguous horizontal block of blue (1) pixels and change its color to green (3). If there are multiple blocks of the same maximum length, the examples don't explicitly show which one is chosen, but based on typical ARC conventions, it might be the first one encountered (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
