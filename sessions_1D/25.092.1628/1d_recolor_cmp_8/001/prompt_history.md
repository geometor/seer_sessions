Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples provided are all 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Colors:** The colors involved are primarily white (0) and blue (1) in the input, and white (0), blue (1), and green (3) in the output. Green (3) seems to be introduced as a result of the transformation.
3.  **Objects:** The most salient objects appear to be contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels, separated by white (0) pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** In each example, a specific block of blue (1) pixels in the input is changed to green (3) pixels in the output. Other blue blocks and all white pixels remain unchanged.
5.  **Identifying the Target Block:**
    *   In `train_1`, the block `1 1 1 1` (length 4) is changed. Other blue blocks have lengths 1, 1, 2, 2. The changed block is the longest.
    *   In `train_2`, the block `1 1 1 1 1` (length 5) is changed. Other blue blocks have lengths 3, 3, 3, 1. The changed block is the longest.
    *   In `train_3`, the block `1 1 1 1 1 1 1` (length 7) is changed. Other blue blocks have lengths 2, 6. The changed block is the longest.
6.  **Rule Inference:** The transformation rule seems to identify the longest contiguous horizontal block of blue (1) pixels and change its color to green (3). If there are multiple blocks of the same maximum length, the examples don't explicitly show which one is chosen, but based on typical ARC conventions, it might be the first one encountered (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Recolor the longest contiguous block of a specific color.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
  colors_input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  colors_output: [white (0), blue (1), green (3)]

objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length (number of consecutive pixels)
      - position (start and end indices)
  - type: background
    color: white (0)

relationships:
  - comparison:
      of: length
      between: all blue (1) contiguous blocks
      purpose: find the maximum length

actions:
  - identify: all contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels.
  - calculate: the length of each identified block.
  - find: the maximum length among these blocks.
  - select: the blue (1) block(s) with the maximum length. (Assumption: If multiple, select the first encountered).
  - recolor: the selected block from blue (1) to green (3).
  - keep: all other pixels unchanged.

constraints:
  - The input grid contains at least one blue (1) pixel block. (Implied by examples).
  - The transformation only affects pixels within the selected longest blue block.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid from left to right.
2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) composed entirely of blue (1) pixels.
3.  For each identified blue block, record its length (number of pixels) and its starting position.
4.  Determine the maximum length found among all recorded blue blocks.
5.  Find the first blue block (the one with the smallest starting position) that has this maximum length.
6.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
7.  In the output grid, change the color of all pixels belonging to the identified longest blue block from blue (1) to green (3).
8.  Keep all other pixels in the output grid the same as their corresponding pixels in the input grid.
