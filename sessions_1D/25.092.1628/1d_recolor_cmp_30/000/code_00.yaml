grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 22]
  output: [1, 22]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixel_sequence
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3]
        location: index 3
        length: 4
      - sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
        location: index 10
        length: 5
      - sequence: [3, 3]
        location: index 18
        length: 2
actions:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    target_object: longest contiguous sequence of green (3) pixels
    condition: must be the longest sequence compared to other green sequences
    from_color: green (3)
    to_color: azure (8)
relationships:
  - comparison: length of green pixel sequences
  - result: the sequence with length 5 is the longest
