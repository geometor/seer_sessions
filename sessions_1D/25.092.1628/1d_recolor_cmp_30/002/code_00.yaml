task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 22] # Observed in all examples
  output: [1, 22] # Observed in all examples
data_representation: Grids are likely represented as lists of lists or potentially NumPy arrays.
objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixel_sequence
    color: green (3)
    location: horizontal (within the single row)
    properties:
      - length
      - start_index
actions:
  - type: identify_sequences
    target_color: green (3)
    properties_extracted: start_index, length
  - type: find_maximum_property
    property: length
    source_objects: identified green sequences
  - type: filter_objects
    condition: sequence length equals maximum length
    source_objects: identified green sequences
  - type: color_change
    target_objects: filtered longest green sequences
    from_color: green (3)
    to_color: azure (8)
relationships:
  - comparison: length of green pixel sequences is compared to find the maximum.
  - transformation_trigger: The transformation (color change) is triggered only for sequences whose length matches the maximum length found.
notes:
  - The transformation applies to potentially multiple sequences if they share the maximum length (as seen in Example 3).
  - All pixels not part of the longest green sequence(s) remain unchanged.
  - The ambiguity error during testing suggests potential NumPy array involvement, requiring careful type handling in implementation.
