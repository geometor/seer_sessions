**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output are both single-row grids (1x22).
The input contains white (0) and green (3) pixels.
The output contains white (0), green (3), and azure (8) pixels.
The transformation involves changing the color of a specific segment of green pixels.
Specifically, a contiguous block of five green pixels in the input is changed to five azure pixels in the output.
Other blocks of green pixels (one block of four, one block of two) remain unchanged.
This suggests the transformation targets a specific green block based on some property, possibly its length. The longest block of green pixels (length 5) was the one transformed.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 22]
  output: [1, 22]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixel_sequence
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3]
        location: index 3
        length: 4
      - sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
        location: index 10
        length: 5
      - sequence: [3, 3]
        location: index 18
        length: 2
actions:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    target_object: longest contiguous sequence of green (3) pixels
    condition: must be the longest sequence compared to other green sequences
    from_color: green (3)
    to_color: azure (8)
relationships:
  - comparison: length of green pixel sequences
  - result: the sequence with length 5 is the longest
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine the length of each identified green sequence.
3.  Find the sequence(s) with the maximum length among all green sequences.
4.  For the identified longest green sequence(s), change the color of all pixels within that sequence from green (3) to azure (8).
5.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.

**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code attempt failed due to a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This error typically occurs when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., in an `if` statement condition). Although the provided code explicitly converts input to standard Python lists and integers, the testing environment might still be passing NumPy arrays, or some comparison logic implicitly converts back or operates ambiguously on array-like structures.

The core logic identified (finding the longest contiguous sequence(s) of green pixels and changing them to azure) appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples, especially example 3 which shows multiple sequences being changed when they share the maximum length.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the sequence identification and length calculation for each example using code execution.
2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to explicitly state the rule applies to *all* sequences sharing the maximum length.
3.  Ensure the coder phase carefully handles potential NumPy array inputs, perhaps by explicitly converting the input grid and its elements to standard Python lists and integers at the very beginning of the `transform` function, or by using NumPy-native operations if sticking with NumPy arrays.

actions:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    target_object_description: All contiguous horizontal sequences of green (3) pixels that have the maximum length among all such sequences found in the input row.
    condition: The sequence's length must equal the maximum length found across all green sequences in that row.
    from_color: green (3)
    to_color: azure (8)
    scope: Applies to all sequences meeting the condition. If no green sequences exist, no changes are made.
relationships:
  - comparison: length of green pixel sequences within the row.
  - result: Identification of the maximum length and all sequences matching that length.
invariance:
  - Pixels not part of the longest green sequence(s) retain their original color.
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - The relative order of pixels remains unchanged, only colors are modified.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input grid consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal sequences composed entirely of green (3) pixels within the row. Record the starting index and length of each sequence.
3.  If no green sequences are found, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  Determine the maximum length among all the identified green sequences.
5.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
6.  Iterate through all the identified green sequences. For every sequence whose length exactly matches the maximum length found in step 4, change the color of all pixels within that sequence in the output row from green (3) to azure (8).
7.  Return the modified output row, formatted as a single-row grid.
