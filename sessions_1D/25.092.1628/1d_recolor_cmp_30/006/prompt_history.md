**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output are both single-row grids (1x22).
The input contains white (0) and green (3) pixels.
The output contains white (0), green (3), and azure (8) pixels.
The transformation involves changing the color of a specific segment of green pixels.
Specifically, a contiguous block of five green pixels in the input is changed to five azure pixels in the output.
Other blocks of green pixels (one block of four, one block of two) remain unchanged.
This suggests the transformation targets a specific green block based on some property, possibly its length. The longest block of green pixels (length 5) was the one transformed.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 22]
  output: [1, 22]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixel_sequence
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3]
        location: index 3
        length: 4
      - sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
        location: index 10
        length: 5
      - sequence: [3, 3]
        location: index 18
        length: 2
actions:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    target_object: longest contiguous sequence of green (3) pixels
    condition: must be the longest sequence compared to other green sequences
    from_color: green (3)
    to_color: azure (8)
relationships:
  - comparison: length of green pixel sequences
  - result: the sequence with length 5 is the longest
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine the length of each identified green sequence.
3.  Find the sequence(s) with the maximum length among all green sequences.
4.  For the identified longest green sequence(s), change the color of all pixels within that sequence from green (3) to azure (8).
5.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.
