objects:

    color: green (3)
    location: horizontal (within the single row)
    properties:
      - length
      - start_index
    examples:
      - train_1:
          sequences: [{start: 3, length: 4}, {start: 10, length: 5}, {start: 18, length: 2}]
          max_length: 5

          max_length: 7
          longest_sequences: [{start: 2, length: 7}]
      - train_3:
          sequences: [{start: 1, length: 4}, {start: 7, length: 4}, {start: 14, length: 1}, {start: 16, length: 3}]

actions:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    target_object_description: All contiguous horizontal sequences of green (3) pixels that have the maximum length among all such sequences found in the input row.
    condition: The sequence's length must equal the maximum length found across all green sequences in that row.
    from_color: green (3)
    to_color: azure (8)
    scope: Applies to all sequences meeting the condition. If no green sequences exist, no changes are made.
relationships:
  - comparison: length of green pixel sequences within the row.
  - result: Identification of the maximum length and all sequences matching that length.
invariance:
  - Pixels not part of the longest green sequence(s) retain their original color.
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - The relative order of pixels remains unchanged, only colors are modified.
