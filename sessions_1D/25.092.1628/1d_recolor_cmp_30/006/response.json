            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code attempt failed due to a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This error typically occurs when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., in an `if` statement condition). Although the provided code explicitly converts input to standard Python lists and integers, the testing environment might still be passing NumPy arrays, or some comparison logic implicitly converts back or operates ambiguously on array-like structures.\n\nThe core logic identified (finding the longest contiguous sequence(s) of green pixels and changing them to azure) appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples, especially example 3 which shows multiple sequences being changed when they share the maximum length.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the sequence identification and length calculation for each example using code execution.\n2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to explicitly state the rule applies to *all* sequences sharing the maximum length.\n3.  Ensure the coder phase carefully handles potential NumPy array inputs, perhaps by explicitly converting the input grid and its elements to standard Python lists and integers at the very beginning of the `transform` function, or by using NumPy-native operations if sticking with NumPy arrays.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
