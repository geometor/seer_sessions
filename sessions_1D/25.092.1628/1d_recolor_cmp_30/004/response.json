            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement the logic derived from `train_1`, which involves finding the longest contiguous sequence of green pixels (3) in a single-row grid and changing its color to azure (8). The logic was partially correct but failed validation against all training examples, indicating either a flaw in the core logic when applied to other examples or an implementation issue. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" strongly suggests a problem related to how NumPy arrays are being handled, likely during a comparison operation where a boolean True/False is expected, but an array of booleans is produced.\n\nAnalysis of all three training examples reveals:\n1.  The core task is indeed identifying contiguous horizontal sequences of green pixels (3).\n2.  The criterion for transformation is the *length* of these sequences.\n3.  Crucially, *all* sequences that share the *maximum* length found in the input row must be transformed. Example `train_3` demonstrates this, where two sequences of length 4 are transformed.\n4.  The transformation changes the color of the identified sequence(s) from green (3) to azure (8).\n\nThe previous code correctly identifies the maximum length and filters for sequences matching that length. Therefore, the logical understanding seems consistent with all examples. The reported error is likely an implementation artifact, possibly arising from the testing environment passing NumPy arrays instead of pure Python lists, and the code (or the comparison logic within the test harness) mishandling boolean comparisons involving these arrays.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n1.  Confirm the logic accommodates all examples (which it appears to do).\n2.  Ensure the implementation is robust to potential input types (like NumPy arrays) by explicitly converting the relevant data (the input row pixels) to standard Python integers before performing comparisons or logical operations. The existing code attempts this with `[int(x) for x in input_grid[0]]`. If this isn't sufficient, further checks or conversions might be needed within the `find_contiguous_sequences` function or when comparing pixels.\n3.  Verify that the function returns data in the expected format (a list of lists of Python integers) to avoid issues during output validation.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
