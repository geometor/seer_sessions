task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: [1, 22] # All examples are 1x22
  output: [1, 22] # Output dimensions match input
grid_colors:
  input: [white (0), green (3)]
  output: [white (0), green (3), azure (8)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixel_sequence
    color: green (3)
    location: horizontal within the single row
    properties:
      - length: integer > 0
      - start_index: integer >= 0
actions:
  - type: identify_sequences
    target_color: green (3)
    result: list of all green sequences with their start index and length
  - type: find_maximum_property
    input: list of green sequences
    property: length
    result: maximum length found among sequences
  - type: filter_sequences
    input: list of green sequences
    condition: sequence length equals the maximum length
    result: list of longest green sequences (can be one or more)
  - type: conditional_color_change
    target_objects: all sequences identified in the filter_sequences step
    from_color: green (3)
    to_color: azure (8)
    scope: applies to all pixels within the target sequence(s)
relationships:
  - comparison: length of green pixel sequences
  - transformation_trigger: a green sequence's length must equal the maximum length found across all green sequences in the input row.
constraints:
  - operates only on the single row provided.
  - only green pixels are potentially changed.
  - only the longest green sequences (by length) are affected.
  - if no green sequences exist, the output is identical to the input.
