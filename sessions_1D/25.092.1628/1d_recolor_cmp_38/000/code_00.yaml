task_type: sequence_transformation
inputs:
  - data_type: 1D_array
    element_type: color_pixel
    colors_present: [white, maroon]
outputs:
  - data_type: 1D_array
    element_type: color_pixel
    colors_present: [white, maroon, azure]
    relationship_to_input: same_length
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: maroon (9)
    properties:
      - length: integer (number of pixels in the block)
actions:
  - name: identify_maroon_blocks
    description: Find all contiguous sequences of maroon (9) pixels in the input array.
    inputs: input_array
    outputs: list_of_maroon_blocks (with start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: find_max_length
    description: Determine the maximum length among all identified maroon blocks.
    inputs: list_of_maroon_blocks
    outputs: max_length (integer)
  - name: transform_blocks
    description: Iterate through the identified maroon blocks. If a block's length equals the max_length, change all pixels within that block in the output array to azure (8).
    inputs: input_array, list_of_maroon_blocks, max_length
    outputs: modified_output_array
  - name: copy_untransformed
    description: Pixels not part of a maximum-length maroon block (i.e., white pixels and maroon pixels in shorter blocks) retain their original color in the output array.
    inputs: input_array
    outputs: partially_filled_output_array
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    description: The length of each maroon block is compared to the maximum length found across all maroon blocks in the input.
transformation_rule:
  condition: A maroon (9) pixel belongs to a contiguous block of maroon pixels.
  trigger: The length of this block is equal to the maximum length found among *all* contiguous maroon blocks in the input sequence.
  action: Change the color of the pixel to azure (8).
  default_action: If the condition/trigger is not met, the pixel retains its original color.
