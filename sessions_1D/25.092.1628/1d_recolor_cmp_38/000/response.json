The lengths of the input and output sequences are identical in all examples.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors are white (0) and maroon (9) in the input. The output introduces azure (8) while retaining white (0) and maroon (9).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation specifically targets certain pixels with the value maroon (9), changing them to azure (8). White (0) pixels always remain unchanged. Not all maroon (9) pixels are transformed.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The key pattern involves identifying contiguous blocks (or \"objects\") of maroon (9) pixels within the sequence.\n5.  **Property Identification:** The crucial property of these maroon blocks seems to be their length (the number of consecutive maroon pixels).\n6.  **Rule Discernment:** By comparing the lengths of different maroon blocks within each input sequence and observing which blocks change color in the output, a pattern emerges: only the maroon blocks that have the *maximum length* among all maroon blocks in that specific input sequence are changed to azure (8). All other maroon blocks (with lengths less than the maximum) and all white blocks remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
