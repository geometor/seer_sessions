Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are both 1D sequences (arrays) of integers representing colors. The lengths of the input and output sequences are identical in all examples.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors are white (0) and maroon (9) in the input. The output introduces azure (8) while retaining white (0) and maroon (9).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation specifically targets certain pixels with the value maroon (9), changing them to azure (8). White (0) pixels always remain unchanged. Not all maroon (9) pixels are transformed.
4.  **Object Identification:** The key pattern involves identifying contiguous blocks (or "objects") of maroon (9) pixels within the sequence.
5.  **Property Identification:** The crucial property of these maroon blocks seems to be their length (the number of consecutive maroon pixels).
6.  **Rule Discernment:** By comparing the lengths of different maroon blocks within each input sequence and observing which blocks change color in the output, a pattern emerges: only the maroon blocks that have the *maximum length* among all maroon blocks in that specific input sequence are changed to azure (8). All other maroon blocks (with lengths less than the maximum) and all white blocks remain unchanged.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the basis for the output sequence.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous blocks of maroon (9) pixels in the input sequence. For each block, record its starting position, ending position, and length.
3.  If no maroon blocks are found, the output is identical to the input; stop.
4.  Determine the maximum length among all the identified maroon blocks.
5.  Iterate through the list of identified maroon blocks.
6.  For each maroon block, compare its length to the maximum length calculated in step 4.
7.  If a block's length is equal to the maximum length, change the color of all pixels within that block's start and end positions (inclusive) in the output sequence to azure (8).
8.  Leave all other pixels (white pixels and pixels in maroon blocks shorter than the maximum length) unchanged from their original input color.
9.  Return the modified output sequence.
