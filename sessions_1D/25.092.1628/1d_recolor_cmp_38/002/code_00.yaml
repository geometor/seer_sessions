task_type: grid_transformation
inputs:
  - data_type: 2D_grid
    element_type: color_pixel
    colors_present: [white, maroon]
    shape: variable (e.g., 5x6 in examples)
outputs:
  - data_type: 2D_grid
    element_type: color_pixel
    colors_present: [white, maroon, azure]
    relationship_to_input: same_shape
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block_2d
    color: maroon (9)
    connectivity: 4-neighbor (von Neumann)
    properties:
      - pixels: list_of_coordinates [(r1, c1), (r2, c2), ...]
      - size: integer (number of pixels in the block, i.e., area)
actions:
  - name: find_maroon_blocks_2d
    description: Identify all distinct contiguous blocks of maroon (9) pixels in the input grid using 4-connectivity.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_maroon_blocks (each with 'pixels' and 'size')
  - name: find_max_block_size
    description: Determine the maximum size (area) among all identified maroon blocks.
    inputs: list_of_maroon_blocks
    outputs: max_size (integer)
  - name: transform_pixels_in_max_blocks
    description: Iterate through the identified maroon blocks. If a block's size equals the max_size, change the color of all pixels belonging to that block in the output grid to azure (8).
    inputs: input_grid, list_of_maroon_blocks, max_size
    outputs: modified_output_grid
  - name: copy_untransformed
    description: Pixels not part of a maximum-sized maroon block (i.e., white pixels and pixels in smaller maroon blocks) retain their original color in the output grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: partially_filled_output_grid
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: size (area)
    description: The size (area) of each maroon block is compared to the maximum size found across all maroon blocks in the input grid.
transformation_rule:
  condition: A pixel has the color maroon (9).
  trigger: This pixel belongs to a contiguous 2D block (4-connectivity) of maroon pixels whose size (area) is equal to the maximum size found among *all* contiguous maroon blocks in the input grid.
  action: Change the color of the pixel to azure (8).
  default_action: If the condition/trigger is not met, the pixel retains its original color (white or maroon).
