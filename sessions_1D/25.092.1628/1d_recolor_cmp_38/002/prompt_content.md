Transformation Rule:
Identify all contiguous blocks of maroon (9) pixels in the input sequence. 
Determine the maximum length among these blocks. 
Change the color of all pixels within any maroon block whose length matches this maximum length to azure (8). 
All other pixels (white (0) and maroon pixels in blocks shorter than the maximum) remain unchanged.
