```python
"""
Identifies all contiguous horizontal segments of yellow (4) pixels within the single-row input grid.
Calculates the length of each segment.
Determines the maximum length found among these yellow segments.
Creates an output grid by copying the input grid.
Modifies the output grid by changing the color of all pixels belonging to yellow segments whose length equals the maximum length to orange (7).
All other pixels (non-yellow or yellow pixels in shorter segments) remain unchanged.
