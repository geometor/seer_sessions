Grid:
  - type: 2D NumPy array
  - shape: Primarily 1 row, variable columns (up to 30x30 allowed by ARC)
  - input_colors: white (0), yellow (4)
  - output_colors: white (0), yellow (4), orange (7)

Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segments (runs) of pixels
  - relevant_color: yellow (4)
  - property: length (number of contiguous yellow pixels)

Relationships:
  - Segments are separated by non-yellow pixels (typically white (0)).
  - The task focuses on the relationship between the lengths of different yellow segments within the *same row*.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all horizontal, contiguous segments of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid's row.
  - Measure: Calculate the length of each identified yellow segment.
  - Compare: Determine the maximum length among all yellow segments found.
  - Transform:
    - Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    - For every yellow segment whose length equals the calculated maximum length:
        - Change the color of all pixels within that segment in the *output grid* from yellow (4) to orange (7).
  - Preserve: Leave all other pixels (non-yellow pixels and yellow pixels in segments shorter than the maximum length) unchanged in the output grid.
