            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly suggests that the `input_grid` being passed to the `transform` function during testing is a NumPy array, not a standard Python list of lists as the code currently assumes in its checks (e.g., `if not output_grid`). Comparisons or boolean checks on multi-element NumPy arrays require explicit methods like `.any()` or `.all()`.\n\nThe core logic of identifying contiguous yellow segments, finding the maximum length, and changing those segments to orange seems correct based on the visual inspection of the examples. The failure occurs during execution due to data type incompatibility between the code's assumptions and the actual test environment.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Adapt to NumPy:** Modify the `transform` function to correctly handle NumPy arrays as input. This involves using NumPy indexing and avoiding ambiguous boolean checks on arrays. The `find_yellow_segments` helper function might also need minor adjustments if it relies on list-specific operations that differ in NumPy, although iterating through a 1D array should be similar.\n2.  **Verify Logic with Metrics:** Use code execution to confirm the segment lengths and maximum lengths for each training example, ensuring the core transformation rule holds.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the NumPy context and maintain clarity on the transformation steps.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n"
