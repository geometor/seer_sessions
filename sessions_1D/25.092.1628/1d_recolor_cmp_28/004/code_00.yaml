Input_Grid:
  - type: Single-row 2D array (List[List[int]])
  - colors_present: white (0), yellow (4)
  - structure: Contains horizontal segments of colors.

Output_Grid:
  - type: Single-row 2D array (List[List[int]])
  - derived_from: Input_Grid
  - colors_present: white (0), yellow (4), orange (7)
  - relation_to_input: Mostly identical, except specific yellow segments are recolored.

Objects:
  - type: Contiguous horizontal segment
  - primary_color: yellow (4)
  - defining_property: length (number of pixels)
  - location: Defined by start and end index within the row.
  - separation: Bounded by non-yellow pixels (white (0)) or grid boundaries.

Properties_Analysis:
  - all_yellow_segments: Identify all yellow segments in the input row.
  - segment_lengths: Calculate the length of each yellow segment.
  - max_yellow_length: Find the maximum length among all yellow segments.

Actions:
  - Copy: Create the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid.
  - Identify: Find all yellow (4) segments and their lengths in the input row.
  - Compare: Determine the maximum length (M) among these segments.
  - Filter: Select only those yellow segments whose length equals M.
  - Modify: For each selected segment, change the color of its constituent pixels in the output grid from yellow (4) to orange (7).
  - Preserve: All other pixels (white pixels, and yellow pixels in segments shorter than M) remain unchanged in the output grid.
