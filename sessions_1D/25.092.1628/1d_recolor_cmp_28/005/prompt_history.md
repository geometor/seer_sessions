## Perception

The input and output are single-row grids (or effectively 1D arrays) containing pixels of primarily white (0) and yellow (4). The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, with the key difference being that some yellow (4) pixels are changed to orange (7) pixels.

Observing the examples provided:
1.  **train_1:** The input has contiguous horizontal groups of yellow pixels with lengths [2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 2, 1]. The maximum length is 5. The group of 5 yellow pixels in the input is changed to orange in the output.
2.  **train_2:** The input has contiguous horizontal groups of yellow pixels with lengths [7, 5, 6]. The maximum length is 7. The group of 7 yellow pixels in the input is changed to orange in the output.
3.  **train_3:** The input has contiguous horizontal groups of yellow pixels with lengths [1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 4, 1]. The maximum length is 4. Both groups of 4 yellow pixels in the input are changed to orange in the output.

The core transformation involves identifying horizontal segments of yellow pixels, determining their lengths, finding the maximum length among these segments, and then changing the color of all yellow pixels that belong to segments of that maximum length to orange. Pixels not meeting this criterion (white pixels or yellow pixels in shorter segments) remain unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  - type: 1D array or single-row 2D array
  - colors_present: white (0), yellow (4) in input; white (0), yellow (4), orange (7) in output

Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segments
  - color: yellow (4)
  - property: length (number of pixels in the segment)

Relationships:
  - Segments are separated by white (0) pixels.
  - Multiple segments can exist within a single grid.

Actions:
  - Identify all yellow (4) segments.
  - Calculate the length of each segment.
  - Determine the maximum length among all identified segments.
  - For every segment whose length equals the maximum length:
    - Change the color of all pixels within that segment from yellow (4) to orange (7).
  - Pixels not part of a maximum-length yellow segment remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid horizontally to identify all contiguous segments composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels.
2.  For each identified yellow segment, calculate its length (the number of pixels it contains).
3.  Find the maximum length among all calculated segment lengths. If no yellow segments exist, the maximum length is 0.
4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5.  Iterate through the input grid again, identifying the yellow segments.
6.  If a yellow segment's length matches the maximum length found in step 3, change the color of all pixels corresponding to that segment in the output grid from yellow (4) to orange (7).
7.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their input values (white pixels remain white, yellow pixels in segments shorter than the maximum length remain yellow).

## General Assessment

The provided code implements the logic derived from the initial analysis: identify the longest contiguous horizontal segments of yellow pixels (4) in a single-row input grid and change their color to orange (7). The analysis of the three training examples confirms this pattern holds:

*   **train_1:** The longest yellow segment has length 5. This segment is changed to orange.
*   **train_2:** The longest yellow segment has length 7. This segment is changed to orange.
*   **train_3:** The longest yellow segments have length 4 (there are two). Both are changed to orange.

The reported error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") is unexpected given the Python code uses standard list operations. This error typically arises when a boolean check is performed on a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values (e.g., `if numpy_array == value:` where `numpy_array` has multiple elements). This suggests the error might stem from the testing environment's handling of the grid data (potentially converting lists to NumPy arrays) or how it compares the function's output to the expected output, rather than an error in the core transformation logic itself.

The strategy is to maintain the core logic, as it correctly describes the transformation observed in all examples, and ensure the implementation details are robust. The Natural Language Program and Facts will reflect this established logic.

*   Result: Error (Ambiguous truth value)

**train_3:**
*   Input: `[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]`

*   Max Length: 4
*   Segment(s) to Change: `(15, 19, 4), (24, 28, 4)`
*   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]`
*   Result: Error (Ambiguous truth value)

The logic holds for all training examples. The error prevents validation but doesn't invalidate the derived transformation rule.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments composed solely of yellow (4) pixels. Record the start index, end index, and length for each segment found.
3.  If no yellow segments are found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
4.  If yellow segments exist, determine the maximum length (M) among them.
5.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
6.  Iterate through the list of identified yellow segments. For every segment whose length is equal to the maximum length (M), change the color of the corresponding pixels in the output grid (from the segment's start index to its end index) from yellow (4) to orange (7).
7.  Pixels that are not part of a yellow segment, or are part of a yellow segment whose length is less than M, retain their original color in the output grid.
