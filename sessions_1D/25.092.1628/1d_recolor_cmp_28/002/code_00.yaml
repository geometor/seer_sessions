Grid:
  - type: Single-row 2D array (list of lists)
  - colors_present_input: white (0), yellow (4)
  - colors_present_output: white (0), yellow (4), orange (7)

Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segments
  - color: yellow (4)
  - property: length (number of pixels in the segment)
  - identification: segments are sequences of yellow pixels bounded by non-yellow pixels or grid edges.

Relationships:
  - Multiple yellow segments can exist in one grid.
  - Segments are compared based on their length property.

Actions:
  - Identify all distinct horizontal segments of yellow (4) pixels within the input row.
  - Calculate the length of each identified segment.
  - Determine the maximum length among all yellow segments found.
  - Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
  - Modify the output grid: For every yellow segment in the input grid whose length is equal to the calculated maximum length, change the color of all pixels within that segment's location in the output grid to orange (7).
  - Preserve all other pixels: Pixels that are not yellow, or yellow pixels belonging to segments shorter than the maximum length, remain unchanged in the output grid.
