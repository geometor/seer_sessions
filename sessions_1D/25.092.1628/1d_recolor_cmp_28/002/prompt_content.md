"""
Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid (which is a single row).
Calculate the length of each yellow segment.
Find the maximum length among all identified yellow segments.
Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
For every yellow segment whose length equals the maximum length, change the color of those pixels in the output grid to orange (7).
Leave all other pixels unchanged.
