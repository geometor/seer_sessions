The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, with the key difference being that some yellow (4) pixels are changed to orange (7) pixels.\n\nObserving the examples provided:\n1.  **train_1:** The input has contiguous horizontal groups of yellow pixels with lengths [2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 2, 1]. The maximum length is 5. The group of 5 yellow pixels in the input is changed to orange in the output.\n2.  **train_2:** The input has contiguous horizontal groups of yellow pixels with lengths [7, 5, 6]. The maximum length is 7. The group of 7 yellow pixels in the input is changed to orange in the output.\n3.  **train_3:** The input has contiguous horizontal groups of yellow pixels with lengths [1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 4, 1]. The maximum length is 4. Both groups of 4 yellow pixels in the input are changed to orange in the output.\n\nThe core transformation involves identifying horizontal segments of yellow pixels, determining their lengths, finding the maximum length among these segments, and then changing the color of all yellow pixels that belong to segments of that maximum length to orange. Pixels not meeting this criterion (white pixels or yellow pixels in shorter segments) remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
