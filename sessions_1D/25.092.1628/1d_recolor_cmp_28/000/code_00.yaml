Grid:
  - type: 1D array or single-row 2D array
  - colors_present: white (0), yellow (4) in input; white (0), yellow (4), orange (7) in output

Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segments
  - color: yellow (4)
  - property: length (number of pixels in the segment)

Relationships:
  - Segments are separated by white (0) pixels.
  - Multiple segments can exist within a single grid.

Actions:
  - Identify all yellow (4) segments.
  - Calculate the length of each segment.
  - Determine the maximum length among all identified segments.
  - For every segment whose length equals the maximum length:
    - Change the color of all pixels within that segment from yellow (4) to orange (7).
  - Pixels not part of a maximum-length yellow segment remain unchanged.
