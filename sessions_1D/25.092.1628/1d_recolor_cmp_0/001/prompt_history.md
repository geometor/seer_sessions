**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are single rows (1D grids) of pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0) and red (2) in the input, and white (0), red (2), and blue (1) in the output. The transformation appears to selectively change some red pixels to blue pixels while leaving others, and all white pixels, unchanged. The key factor seems to be the grouping or arrangement of the red pixels. Specifically, contiguous horizontal blocks of red pixels are the main objects of interest. The length of these blocks determines whether a transformation occurs.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1x24
  output: 1x24
colors_present:
  input: [white, red] # 0, 2
  output: [white, red, blue] # 0, 1, 2
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (white, red, blue)
      - position: (index)
  - type: contiguous_segment
    properties:
      - color: (red)
      - length: (integer > 0)
      - start_index: (integer >= 0)
      - end_index: (integer >= 0)
relationships:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    between: pixels_of_the_same_color
    defines: contiguous_segment
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input_grid
    target: contiguous_segment of red pixels
    output: list of segments with their properties (color, length, indices)
  - name: filter_segments
    input: list of red segments
    condition: length == 4
    output: list of red segments with length 4
  - name: transform_color
    input: list of red segments with length 4
    target_grid: output_grid (initially a copy of input)
    effect: change color of pixels within these segments from red (2) to blue (1)
invariance:
  - white pixels remain unchanged.
  - red pixels not part of a segment of length 4 remain unchanged.
  - grid dimensions remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally to identify all contiguous segments (blocks) consisting solely of red (2) pixels.
3.  For each identified segment of red pixels:
    a.  Calculate the length (number of pixels) of the segment.
    b.  If the length of the segment is exactly 4:
        i.  Modify the corresponding pixels in the output grid by changing their color from red (2) to blue (1).
4.  Leave all other pixels (white pixels, and red pixels belonging to segments not of length 4) unchanged in the output grid.
5.  The final modified grid is the result.
