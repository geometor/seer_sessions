task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1x24
  output: 1x24
colors_present:
  input: [white, red] # 0, 2
  output: [white, red, blue] # 0, 1, 2
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (white, red, blue)
      - position: (index)
  - type: contiguous_segment
    properties:
      - color: (red)
      - length: (integer > 0)
      - start_index: (integer >= 0)
      - end_index: (integer >= 0)
relationships:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    between: pixels_of_the_same_color
    defines: contiguous_segment
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input_grid
    target: contiguous_segment of red pixels
    output: list of segments with their properties (color, length, indices)
  - name: filter_segments
    input: list of red segments
    condition: length == 4
    output: list of red segments with length 4
  - name: transform_color
    input: list of red segments with length 4
    target_grid: output_grid (initially a copy of input)
    effect: change color of pixels within these segments from red (2) to blue (1)
invariance:
  - white pixels remain unchanged.
  - red pixels not part of a segment of length 4 remain unchanged.
  - grid dimensions remain unchanged.
