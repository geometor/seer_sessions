The primary colors involved are white (0) and red (2) in the input, and white (0), red (2), and blue (1) in the output. The transformation appears to selectively change some red pixels to blue pixels while leaving others, and all white pixels, unchanged. The key factor seems to be the grouping or arrangement of the red pixels. Specifically, contiguous horizontal blocks of red pixels are the main objects of interest. The length of these blocks determines whether a transformation occurs.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
