            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was a flat list, while the testing environment likely provides it as a list of lists (e.g., `[[0, 2, 0, ...]]`) or a NumPy array, even for a single row. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" arises from checks like `if not input_grid:` which don't work as intended on multi-element arrays/lists.\n\nThe core logic of identifying contiguous red segments of length 4 and changing them to blue appears correct based on the initial examples. The strategy is to adjust the code to correctly handle the 2D grid input format (specifically, a grid with one row) and re-verify the segment identification and transformation logic against all training examples.\n\n**Metrics and Verification:**\n"
