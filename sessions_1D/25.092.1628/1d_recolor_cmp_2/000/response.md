Okay, I will analyze the provided training examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are single rows (1D grids) of pixels. The length of the output row is identical to the length of the input row.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The input grids use white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grids use white (0), red (2), and gray (5) pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve selectively changing some red pixels (2) to gray pixels (5), while leaving white pixels (0) and some red pixels (2) untouched.
4.  **Pattern:** The change appears related to contiguous sequences of red pixels. By comparing the examples:
    *   In `train_1`, the longest sequences of red pixels have length 4. Both sequences of length 4 are changed to gray. Shorter sequences (length 2 and 3) remain red.
    *   In `train_2`, the longest sequence of red pixels has length 5. Only this sequence is changed to gray. Shorter sequences (length 3, 2, and 4) remain red.
    *   In `train_3`, the longest sequence of red pixels has length 7. Only this sequence is changed to gray. Shorter sequences (length 4 and 5) remain red.
5.  **Rule Inference:** The rule seems to be: identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of red pixels (2). Find the maximum length among these sequences. Change the color of all red pixels belonging *only* to sequences of that maximum length to gray (5). Leave all other pixels (white pixels and red pixels in shorter sequences) as they are.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input and output are single rows
colors:
  input: [white, red] # 0, 2
  output: [white, red, gray] # 0, 2, 5
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_sequence
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length
relationships:
  - comparison: lengths of red sequences
actions:
  - identify: all contiguous horizontal sequences of red pixels
  - calculate: the maximum length among these sequences
  - select: sequences matching the maximum length
  - modify: change color of pixels in selected sequences from red (2) to gray (5)
  - preserve: color of all other pixels (white and red pixels in non-maximal length sequences)
invariance:
  - grid_dimensions (length of the row)
  - position and color of white (0) pixels
  - position and color of red (2) pixels not part of a maximal-length sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept a single row input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input row to identify all contiguous horizontal sequences (runs) of red (2) pixels. Record the start index, end index, and length of each sequence.
3.  If no red sequences are found, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  Determine the maximum length among all identified red sequences.
5.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
6.  Iterate through the identified red sequences again.
7.  For each red sequence whose length equals the maximum length found in step 4, change the color of the corresponding pixels in the output grid (from the sequence's start index to its end index) from red (2) to gray (5).
8.  Return the modified output grid.
