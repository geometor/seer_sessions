task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input and output are single rows
colors:
  input: [white, red] # 0, 2
  output: [white, red, gray] # 0, 2, 5
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_sequence
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length
relationships:
  - comparison: lengths of red sequences
actions:
  - identify: all contiguous horizontal sequences of red pixels
  - calculate: the maximum length among these sequences
  - select: sequences matching the maximum length
  - modify: change color of pixels in selected sequences from red (2) to gray (5)
  - preserve: color of all other pixels (white and red pixels in non-maximal length sequences)
invariance:
  - grid_dimensions (length of the row)
  - position and color of white (0) pixels
  - position and color of red (2) pixels not part of a maximal-length sequence
