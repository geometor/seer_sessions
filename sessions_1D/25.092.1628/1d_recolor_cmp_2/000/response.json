            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided training examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are single rows (1D grids) of pixels. The length of the output row is identical to the length of the input row.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The input grids use white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grids use white (0), red (2), and gray (5) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve selectively changing some red pixels (2) to gray pixels (5), while leaving white pixels (0) and some red pixels (2) untouched.\n4.  **Pattern:** The change appears related to contiguous sequences of red pixels. By comparing the examples:\n    *   In `train_1`, the longest sequences of red pixels have length 4. Both sequences of length 4 are changed to gray. Shorter sequences (length 2 and 3) remain red.\n    *   In `train_2`, the longest sequence of red pixels has length 5. Only this sequence is changed to gray. Shorter sequences (length 3, 2, and 4) remain red.\n    *   In `train_3`, the longest sequence of red pixels has length 7. Only this sequence is changed to gray. Shorter sequences (length 4 and 5) remain red.\n5.  **Rule Inference:** The rule seems to be: identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of red pixels (2). Find the maximum length among these sequences. Change the color of all red pixels belonging *only* to sequences of that maximum length to gray (5). Leave all other pixels (white pixels and red pixels in shorter sequences) as they are.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
