Identifies all contiguous horizontal sequences of red (2) pixels in the input row.
Determines the maximum length among these sequences.
Changes the color of all red pixels belonging only to sequences of that maximum length to gray (5).
Leaves all other pixels (white pixels and red pixels in shorter sequences) as they are.
