## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output are 2D grids of pixels. The examples provided are single-row grids, but the general ARC context implies 2D grids. For these examples, they function as 1D arrays.
2.  **Colors**: The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and green (3). White seems to be the background color.
3.  **Input Features**: The input grids contain segments of blue pixels separated by white pixels. These segments are horizontal lines of varying lengths.
4.  **Output Features**: The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that one specific segment of blue pixels has been changed to green.
5.  **Transformation**: The transformation identifies the longest contiguous horizontal segment of blue pixels in the input grid and changes the color of those pixels to green in the output grid. All other pixels remain unchanged.
6.  **Object Identification**: The relevant objects are the contiguous horizontal segments (lines) of blue pixels.
7.  **Property Focus**: The key property of these blue segments is their length (number of contiguous blue pixels).
8.  **Rule**: Find the longest blue horizontal line segment. Recolor that segment green.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Change the color of the longest horizontal segment of blue pixels to green.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 2D (implicitly, though examples are 1xN)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - relevant_colors: [blue (1), green (3)]
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    color: blue (1)
    definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more blue pixels in the same row.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - location: Row index, start column index, end column index.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    criterion: maximum
    applies_to: horizontal_segment (color: blue)
actions:
  - type: recolor
    target:
      object_type: horizontal_segment
      color: blue (1)
      condition: has maximum length among all blue horizontal segments
    new_color: green (3)
  - type: copy
    target:
      object_type: pixel
      condition: not part of the longest blue horizontal segment
    result: pixel color remains unchanged from input to output
uncertainty:
  - How to handle ties: If multiple blue horizontal segments share the same maximum length, do all of them change color, or only the first one encountered (e.g., top-most, left-most)? The examples do not cover this case. Assumption: All segments tied for the maximum length are recolored.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of blue (1) pixels within the input grid. For each segment, record its location (row, start column, end column) and its length.
2.  Determine the maximum length among all identified blue segments.
3.  Create a new grid by copying the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the identified blue segments. If a segment's length matches the maximum length found in step 2, change the color of all pixels belonging to that segment in the new grid to green (3).
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
