task_description: Change the color of the longest horizontal segment of blue pixels to green.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 2D (implicitly, though examples are 1xN)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - relevant_colors: [blue (1), green (3)]
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    color: blue (1)
    definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more blue pixels in the same row.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - location: Row index, start column index, end column index.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    criterion: maximum
    applies_to: horizontal_segment (color: blue)
actions:
  - type: recolor
    target:
      object_type: horizontal_segment
      color: blue (1)
      condition: has maximum length among all blue horizontal segments
    new_color: green (3)
  - type: copy
    target:
      object_type: pixel
      condition: not part of the longest blue horizontal segment
    result: pixel color remains unchanged from input to output
uncertainty:
  - How to handle ties: If multiple blue horizontal segments share the same maximum length, do all of them change color, or only the first one encountered (e.g., top-most, left-most)? The examples do not cover this case. Assumption: All segments tied for the maximum length are recolored.
