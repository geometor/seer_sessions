For these examples, they function as 1D arrays.\n2.  **Colors**: The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and green (3). White seems to be the background color.\n3.  **Input Features**: The input grids contain segments of blue pixels separated by white pixels. These segments are horizontal lines of varying lengths.\n4.  **Output Features**: The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that one specific segment of blue pixels has been changed to green.\n5.  **Transformation**: The transformation identifies the longest contiguous horizontal segment of blue pixels in the input grid and changes the color of those pixels to green in the output grid. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n6.  **Object Identification**: The relevant objects are the contiguous horizontal segments (lines) of blue pixels.\n7.  **Property Focus**: The key property of these blue segments is their length (number of contiguous blue pixels).\n8.  **Rule**: Find the longest blue horizontal line segment. Recolor that segment green.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
