task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  colors_used:
    - white (0)
    - azure (8)
    - green (3)
  input_composition: Primarily sequences of azure pixels separated by white pixels.
  output_composition: Similar structure to input, but some azure sequences are replaced by green sequences.

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (white: 0, azure: 8, green: 3)
      - position: index in the row
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - pixels: list of contiguous pixels of the same color
      - length: number of pixels in the sequence
      - start_index: position of the first pixel
      - end_index: position of the last pixel
      - is_maximal_length: boolean indicating if its length equals the maximum length of all azure sequences in the row

actions_on_objects:
  - action: identify_sequences
    description: Find all contiguous horizontal sequences of azure (8) pixels in the input row.
    input: input row
    output: list of azure sequences with their properties (length, position)
  - action: find_max_length
    description: Determine the maximum length among all identified azure sequences.
    input: list of azure sequences
    output: maximum length value
  - action: filter_maximal_sequences
    description: Identify which sequences have a length equal to the maximum length.
    input: list of azure sequences, maximum length value
    output: list of maximal-length azure sequences
  - action: change_color
    description: Change the color of pixels within the identified maximal-length sequences from azure (8) to green (3).
    input: input row, list of maximal-length sequences
    output: modified output row

relationships:
  - type: contiguity
    description: Pixels of the same color adjacent horizontally form a sequence.
  - type: comparison
    description: The length of each azure sequence is compared to the maximum length found across all azure sequences in that specific input row.

invariants:
  - White (0) pixels remain unchanged in position and color.
  - Azure (8) sequences whose length is less than the maximum length for that input row remain unchanged.
  - The length and position of the modified sequences remain the same, only the color changes.
  - The overall length of the row remains unchanged.

transformation_goal: To highlight the longest contiguous sequence(s) of azure pixels by changing their color to green.
