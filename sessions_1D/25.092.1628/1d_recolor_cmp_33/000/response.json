            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are both single rows (1D grids) of pixels.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The colors present are white (0), azure (8), and green (3). White pixels appear as background/separators. Azure pixels are the primary objects being manipulated. Green pixels appear only in the output as a result of transformation.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* sequences of azure pixels (8) to green pixels (3). White pixels (0) always remain unchanged. Not all azure sequences are changed; some remain azure in the output.\n4.  **Identifying the Rule:** The key is determining *which* azure sequences are changed. Comparing the lengths of the azure sequences in the input and observing which ones change reveals a pattern:\n    *   In `train_1`, the longest azure sequences have length 5. Only sequences of length 5 are changed to green. Shorter sequences (lengths 2 and 3) remain azure.\n    *   In `train_2`, the longest azure sequences have length 7. Only sequences of length 7 are changed to green. Shorter sequences (lengths 3 and 4) remain azure.\n    *   In `train_3`, the longest azure sequences have length 4. Only sequences of length 4 are changed to green. Shorter sequences (length 3) remain azure.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The transformation rule seems to be: identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of azure pixels, find the maximum length among these sequences, and then change only those sequences that have this maximum length to green. All other pixels (white pixels and azure sequences shorter than the maximum length) remain unchanged.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
