task_type: color_transformation
scope: row-wise # Operation seems to apply independently to each row, based on examples.
input_colors: [white, red] # Colors present in input (0, 2)
output_colors: [white, red, magenta] # Colors present in output (0, 2, 6)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: red (2)
    properties: [length]
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    input: row
    color_filter: red (2)
    output: list of red blocks with their start/end indices and lengths
  - name: find_max_length
    input: list of red block lengths (per row)
    output: maximum length found in that row
  - name: recolor_blocks
    target_color: red (2)
    new_color: magenta (6)
    condition: block length equals the maximum length found for that row
relationships:
  - The transformation depends on comparing the lengths of all red blocks within the same row.
  - Only red blocks are candidates for transformation.
  - White pixels are invariant.
  - Red blocks whose length is less than the maximum length found in their row are invariant.
