Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input and output are single rows (or potentially 1D representations of grids) composed of white (0) and red (2) pixels in the input, and white (0), red (2), and magenta (6) pixels in the output. The transformation involves selectively changing some red pixels to magenta.

Observing the examples:
1.  **train_1:** The longest contiguous block of red pixels (length 7) is changed to magenta. A shorter block (length 6) and another (length 2) remain red.
2.  **train_2:** Two blocks of red pixels have the maximum length (length 4). Both of these longest blocks are changed to magenta. Shorter blocks (length 1) remain red.
3.  **train_3:** Two blocks of red pixels have the maximum length (length 5). Both of these longest blocks are changed to magenta. Shorter blocks (length 2) remain red.

The core pattern seems to be identifying the *longest* contiguous horizontal segment(s) of red pixels within the row. All segments matching this maximum length are then recolored to magenta. Other red segments and white pixels are left unchanged. If the input were a 2D grid, this operation likely applies independently to each row.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
scope: row-wise # Operation seems to apply independently to each row, based on examples.
input_colors: [white, red] # Colors present in input (0, 2)
output_colors: [white, red, magenta] # Colors present in output (0, 2, 6)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: red (2)
    properties: [length]
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    input: row
    color_filter: red (2)
    output: list of red blocks with their start/end indices and lengths
  - name: find_max_length
    input: list of red block lengths (per row)
    output: maximum length found in that row
  - name: recolor_blocks
    target_color: red (2)
    new_color: magenta (6)
    condition: block length equals the maximum length found for that row
relationships:
  - The transformation depends on comparing the lengths of all red blocks within the same row.
  - Only red blocks are candidates for transformation.
  - White pixels are invariant.
  - Red blocks whose length is less than the maximum length found in their row are invariant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  For each row in the input grid:
    a.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) composed entirely of red (2) pixels. Record the length of each identified block.
    b.  If no red blocks are found in the row, proceed to the next row.
    c.  Determine the maximum length among all red blocks found in this specific row.
    d.  Iterate through the identified red blocks again.
    e.  For each red block whose length is equal to the maximum length determined in step 2c, change the color of all pixels within that block in the *output* grid row to magenta (6).
3.  Return the modified output grid.
