The transformation involves selectively changing some red pixels to magenta.\n\nObserving the examples:\n1.  **train_1:** The longest contiguous block of red pixels (length 7) is changed to magenta. A shorter block (length 6) and another (length 2) remain red.\n2.  **train_2:** Two blocks of red pixels have the maximum length (length 4). Both of these longest blocks are changed to magenta. Shorter blocks (length 1) remain red.\n3.  **train_3:** Two blocks of red pixels have the maximum length (length 5). Both of these longest blocks are changed to magenta. Shorter blocks (length 2) remain red.\n\nThe core pattern seems to be identifying the *longest* contiguous horizontal segment(s) of red pixels within the row. All segments matching this maximum length are then recolored to magenta. Other red segments and white pixels are left unchanged. If the input were a 2D grid, this operation likely applies independently to each row.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
