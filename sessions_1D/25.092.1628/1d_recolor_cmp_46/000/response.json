The output grid introduces maroon (9) pixels.\nThe orange pixels in the input form several distinct horizontal rectangular blocks (objects), separated by white pixels.\nComparing the input and output grids, the transformation involves changing the color of *some* of the orange rectangles to maroon.\nBy examining the examples, it appears that the transformation targets the orange horizontal rectangle(s) with the greatest width (largest number of contiguous orange pixels in a row). If there are multiple rectangles tied for the maximum width, all of them change color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
