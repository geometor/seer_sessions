White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Horizontal Patterns:** The transformation seems related to horizontal arrangements of gray pixels. Specifically, contiguous horizontal segments (lines) of gray pixels are the key elements.\n5.  **Length Matters:** Comparing the examples, the length of the horizontal gray segments appears crucial. In train_1 and train_2, a single, grid-spanning gray line changes. In train_3, several shorter gray segments change, but not all gray segments present.\n6.  **Boundary Conditions:** The context around the gray segments (white pixels or grid edges) seems important, especially in train_3 where segments bounded by white/edges change.\n7.  **Conditional Change:** Not all gray pixels change. There's a condition that determines which gray segments are targeted. The condition appears to relate to the *longest* horizontal gray segments in the grid. If any of these longest segments meet specific boundary criteria (spanning the full grid width or being enclosed by white/edges), then *all* segments of that maximum length are recolored.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

If no gray segments exist, stop and return the input grid unchanged.\n3.  **Filter Longest Segments:** Create a list containing only the segments whose length equals `L`.\n4.  **Check Trigger Condition:** Iterate through the list of longest segments (length `L`).
