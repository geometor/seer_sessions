Grid:
  - type: 2D Array
  - cell_values: Integers 0-9 (representing colors)
  - colors_used:
    - 0: white (background)
    - 5: gray (input object element)
    - 9: maroon (output object element)
Objects:
  - type: Horizontal Segment
  - definition: Maximal contiguous sequence of gray (5) pixels in a single row.
  - properties:
    - length: number of pixels in the segment
    - position: row index, start column index, end column index
    - boundaries: pixels immediately to the left/right, or grid edges
    - is_full_width: boolean, true if segment spans the entire grid width
    - is_bounded: boolean, true if left boundary is grid edge or white(0) AND right boundary is grid edge or white(0)
Relationships:
  - Maximum Length: The transformation logic depends on finding the maximum length among all horizontal gray segments in the grid.
  - Trigger Condition: A change is triggered if at least one of the segments with the maximum length either spans the full grid width OR is bounded by white/edges.
Action:
  - type: Recolor
  - target: All horizontal gray segments that have the maximum length.
  - condition: The trigger condition must be met.
  - effect: Change pixel value from gray (5) to maroon (9).
