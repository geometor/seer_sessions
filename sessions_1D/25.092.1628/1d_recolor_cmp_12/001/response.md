"""
Identifies all contiguous horizontal segments of blue (1) pixels in the input sequence.
Finds the segment with the maximum length. If multiple segments share the maximum length, 
the first one encountered (from left to right) is chosen.
Changes the color of all pixels within this longest segment from blue (1) to red (2).
All other pixels retain their original color.
