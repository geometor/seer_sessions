Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data are presented as single strings of numbers. Given the consistent length (17) across all examples, and 17 being a prime number, it's highly probable that the grid represents a 1-dimensional array or a 1x17 (or 17x1) grid. We will assume it's a 1D sequence for simplicity.
2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses white (0) and blue (1). The output uses white (0), blue (1), and red (2).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* blue pixels to red. White pixels remain unchanged. Blue pixels that are not part of the changed group also remain unchanged.
4.  **Pattern Identification:**
    *   In `train_1`, the input has blue sequences of lengths 2, 5, and 4. The longest sequence (length 5) is changed to red.
    *   In `train_2`, the input has blue sequences of lengths 3 and 7. The longest sequence (length 7) is changed to red.
    *   In `train_3`, the input has blue sequences of lengths 1, 4, and 1. The longest sequence (length 4) is changed to red.
5.  **Rule Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies all contiguous horizontal sequences of blue (1) pixels in the input. It then finds the sequence with the maximum length. All pixels within this longest sequence are changed from blue (1) to red (2) in the output. All other pixels retain their original color. The examples provided do not show how ties (multiple sequences of the same maximum length) are handled, so we assume there is always a unique longest sequence or the rule applies to all sequences tied for the longest length. Based on simplicity, let's assume it applies to the first encountered longest sequence if there are ties, or potentially all tied sequences. However, the most straightforward interpretation from the examples is that there's a unique longest segment which gets recolored.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Recolor the longest horizontal segment of a specific color.

Input:
  - type: 1D array (or 1xN grid) of integers (pixels)
  - colors:
    - 0: white (background)
    - 1: blue (target color)

Output:
  - type: 1D array (or 1xN grid) of integers (pixels)
  - colors:
    - 0: white
    - 1: blue
    - 2: red (replacement color)
  - structure: Same dimensions as the input.

Objects:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (index in the 1D array)
  - name: segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color along the horizontal axis.
    properties:
      - color
      - length (number of pixels)
      - start_index
      - end_index

Relationships:
  - Pixels belonging to the same segment are adjacent horizontally.
  - Segments are compared based on their length.

Actions:
  - Identify all horizontal segments composed solely of blue (1) pixels.
  - Calculate the length of each blue segment.
  - Find the blue segment(s) with the maximum length.
  - For the uniquely longest blue segment identified:
    - Change the color of every pixel within that segment from blue (1) to red (2).
  - All other pixels (white pixels and pixels in shorter blue segments) retain their original color.

Assumptions:
  - The input grid is treated as a 1-dimensional sequence.
  - There is a unique longest segment of blue pixels in the provided training examples. The handling of ties for the longest segment is unspecified but presumed to affect the first occurrence or all occurrences equally. (Choosing the simplest: affect the first unique longest segment).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input sequence (1D array) from left to right.
2.  Identify all contiguous segments (runs) consisting entirely of blue (1) pixels. Record the start index, end index, and length of each blue segment.
3.  Determine the maximum length among all identified blue segments.
4.  Find the blue segment that corresponds to this maximum length. (If there are multiple segments with the same maximum length, select the first one encountered during the left-to-right scan).
5.  Create the output sequence, initially as a copy of the input sequence.
6.  Iterate through the pixel positions from the start index to the end index (inclusive) of the selected longest blue segment. For each position within this range, change the pixel value in the output sequence to red (2).
7.  Return the modified sequence as the output.
