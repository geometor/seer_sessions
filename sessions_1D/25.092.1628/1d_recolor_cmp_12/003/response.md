"""
Transforms the input NumPy grid by:
1. Flattening the grid into a 1D sequence.
2. Identifying all contiguous horizontal segments of blue (1) pixels.
3. Finding the segment with the maximum length. If multiple segments share the maximum length, the one starting at the earliest index (first encountered) is chosen.
4. Changing the color of all pixels within this longest segment from blue (1) to red (2).
5. Reshaping the modified sequence back to the original grid dimensions.
All other pixels retain their original color. If no blue segments are found, the original grid is returned.
