Task: Recolor the longest horizontal segment of a specific color.

Input:
  - type: 1D array (or 1xN grid) of integers (pixels)
  - colors:
    - 0: white (background)
    - 1: blue (target color)

Output:
  - type: 1D array (or 1xN grid) of integers (pixels)
  - colors:
    - 0: white
    - 1: blue
    - 2: red (replacement color)
  - structure: Same dimensions as the input.

Objects:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (index in the 1D array)
  - name: segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color along the horizontal axis.
    properties:
      - color
      - length (number of pixels)
      - start_index
      - end_index

Relationships:
  - Pixels belonging to the same segment are adjacent horizontally.
  - Segments are compared based on their length.

Actions:
  - Identify all horizontal segments composed solely of blue (1) pixels.
  - Calculate the length of each blue segment.
  - Find the blue segment(s) with the maximum length.
  - For the uniquely longest blue segment identified:
    - Change the color of every pixel within that segment from blue (1) to red (2).
  - All other pixels (white pixels and pixels in shorter blue segments) retain their original color.

Assumptions:
  - The input grid is treated as a 1-dimensional sequence.
  - There is a unique longest segment of blue pixels in the provided training examples. The handling of ties for the longest segment is unspecified but presumed to affect the first occurrence or all occurrences equally. (Choosing the simplest: affect the first unique longest segment).
