            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data are presented as single strings of numbers. Given the consistent length (17) across all examples, and 17 being a prime number, it's highly probable that the grid represents a 1-dimensional array or a 1x17 (or 17x1) grid. We will assume it's a 1D sequence for simplicity.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses white (0) and blue (1). The output uses white (0), blue (1), and red (2).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* blue pixels to red. White pixels remain unchanged. Blue pixels that are not part of the changed group also remain unchanged.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the input has blue sequences of lengths 2, 5, and 4. The longest sequence (length 5) is changed to red.\n    *   In `train_2`, the input has blue sequences of lengths 3 and 7. The longest sequence (length 7) is changed to red.\n    *   In `train_3`, the input has blue sequences of lengths 1, 4, and 1. The longest sequence (length 4) is changed to red.\n5.  **Rule Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies all contiguous horizontal sequences of blue (1) pixels in the input. It then finds the sequence with the maximum length. All pixels within this longest sequence are changed from blue (1) to red (2) in the output. All other pixels retain their original color. The examples provided do not show how ties (multiple sequences of the same maximum length) are handled, so we assume there is always a unique longest sequence or the rule applies to all sequences tied for the longest length. Based on simplicity, let's assume it applies to the first encountered longest sequence if there are ties, or potentially all tied sequences. However, the most straightforward interpretation from the examples is that there's a unique longest segment which gets recolored.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
