task_elements:
  - item: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions (height, width)
      - pixels
  - item: pixel
    description: A single cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (row, column)
  - item: color
    description: Integer value representing a specific color.
    relevant_colors:
      - white (0): Background color, generally static.
      - maroon (9): Forms patterns/segments in the input. Target for potential modification.
      - red (2): The color used to replace specific maroon pixels in the output. Does not appear in the input.
  - item: horizontal_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color within a single row.
    properties:
      - color
      - row_index
      - start_column
      - end_column
      - length
    relationship: Constituent pixels belong to a specific row in the grid.

transformation:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find all horizontal segments composed solely of maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_maroon_segments
  - action: find_longest_segment
    description: Determine the horizontal maroon segment with the greatest length from the identified list. Assumes a unique longest segment based on examples.
    input: list_of_maroon_segments
    output: longest_maroon_segment
  - action: recolor_segment
    description: Change the color of the pixels corresponding to the longest horizontal maroon segment from maroon (9) to red (2).
    input:
      - input_grid
      - longest_maroon_segment
    output: modified_grid
  - action: copy_unchanged
    description: Ensure all pixels not part of the longest horizontal maroon segment retain their original color from the input grid in the output grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: partially_filled_output_grid

output_generation:
  - rule: The output grid is a copy of the input grid, except for the pixels belonging to the longest horizontal segment of maroon (9) pixels found anywhere in the input grid; these specific pixels are changed to red (2).
