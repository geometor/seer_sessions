The output grid always maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors observed are white (0, likely background), maroon (9), and red (2). Red (2) only appears in the output grids.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* maroon (9) pixels to red (2). All other pixels (white background and other maroon pixels) remain unchanged between input and output.\n4.  **Identifying the Target Pixels:** The maroon pixels that are changed to red form a single, contiguous horizontal line segment in each example.\n5.  **Rule Discovery:** By comparing the horizontal segments of maroon (9) pixels within each input grid, it appears the transformation identifies the *longest* such horizontal segment across all rows. The pixels belonging to this uniquely longest horizontal maroon segment are then recolored to red (2) in the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
