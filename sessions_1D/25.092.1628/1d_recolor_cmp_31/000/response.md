**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on small rectangular grids (e.g., 3x10 or similar). The output grid always maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors observed are white (0, likely background), maroon (9), and red (2). Red (2) only appears in the output grids.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* maroon (9) pixels to red (2). All other pixels (white background and other maroon pixels) remain unchanged between input and output.
4.  **Identifying the Target Pixels:** The maroon pixels that are changed to red form a single, contiguous horizontal line segment in each example.
5.  **Rule Discovery:** By comparing the horizontal segments of maroon (9) pixels within each input grid, it appears the transformation identifies the *longest* such horizontal segment across all rows. The pixels belonging to this uniquely longest horizontal maroon segment are then recolored to red (2) in the output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions (height, width)
      - pixels
  - item: pixel
    description: A single cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (row, column)
  - item: color
    description: Integer value representing a specific color.
    relevant_colors:
      - white (0): Background color, generally static.
      - maroon (9): Forms patterns/segments in the input. Target for potential modification.
      - red (2): The color used to replace specific maroon pixels in the output. Does not appear in the input.
  - item: horizontal_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color within a single row.
    properties:
      - color
      - row_index
      - start_column
      - end_column
      - length
    relationship: Constituent pixels belong to a specific row in the grid.

transformation:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find all horizontal segments composed solely of maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_maroon_segments
  - action: find_longest_segment
    description: Determine the horizontal maroon segment with the greatest length from the identified list. Assumes a unique longest segment based on examples.
    input: list_of_maroon_segments
    output: longest_maroon_segment
  - action: recolor_segment
    description: Change the color of the pixels corresponding to the longest horizontal maroon segment from maroon (9) to red (2).
    input:
      - input_grid
      - longest_maroon_segment
    output: modified_grid
  - action: copy_unchanged
    description: Ensure all pixels not part of the longest horizontal maroon segment retain their original color from the input grid in the output grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: partially_filled_output_grid

output_generation:
  - rule: The output grid is a copy of the input grid, except for the pixels belonging to the longest horizontal segment of maroon (9) pixels found anywhere in the input grid; these specific pixels are changed to red (2).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid row by row to identify all contiguous horizontal segments (runs) of maroon (9) pixels. Record the row index, start column, end column, and length for each segment found.
3.  Compare the lengths of all identified horizontal maroon segments.
4.  Find the segment with the maximum length. (Based on the examples, assume there is only one segment with the maximum length).
5.  Identify the pixels in the output grid corresponding to the row index and column range (from start column to end column) of this longest segment.
6.  Change the color of these specific pixels in the output grid to red (2).
7.  All other pixels in the output grid retain their original color from the input grid.
