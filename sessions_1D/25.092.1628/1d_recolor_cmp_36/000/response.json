Based on the length of the flattened arrays (35 elements) and the visual structure suggested by the changes, the grid dimensions are likely 7 rows by 5 columns.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0 - background), red (2), and green (3). Red appears in the input, and green appears in the output as a replacement for some red pixels.\n3.  **Objects:** The key objects appear to be contiguous blocks/regions of red pixels (value 2) on the white background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* red pixels to green pixels.\n5.  **Pattern:** By comparing the input and output grids across the examples, it appears that the *largest* contiguous block of red pixels in the input grid is identified, and all pixels within that specific block are changed to green in the output grid. Other red pixels, belonging to smaller, separate blocks, remain unchanged. Contiguity seems to be defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency (not diagonal).\n\n## YAML Facts:\n\n"
