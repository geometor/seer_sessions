Grid:
  dimensions: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 7x5 for the provided examples).
  background_color: white (0)
Objects:
  - type: region
    color: red (2)
    definition: Contiguous block of red pixels (connected horizontally or vertically).
    properties:
      - size: Number of pixels in the block.
      - location: Coordinates of constituent pixels.
Relationships:
  - type: comparison
    basis: size
    between: different red regions
    goal: Identify the region(s) with the maximum size.
Action:
  - type: identification
    target: All contiguous red (2) regions.
  - type: calculation
    target: Size (pixel count) of each identified red region.
  - type: selection
    target: The red region with the largest size. (Handles potential ties implicitly if only one changes, or assumes a tie-breaking rule might exist if multiple could be largest).
  - type: modification (recoloring)
    target: Pixels belonging to the selected largest red region.
    from_color: red (2)
    to_color: green (3)
Output:
  relation_to_input: Input grid with the pixels of the largest red region changed to green.
