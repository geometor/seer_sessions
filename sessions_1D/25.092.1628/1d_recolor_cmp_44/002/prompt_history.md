Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as single lines of numbers. Given the length (31, a prime number) and the nature of ARC tasks, these likely represent 1x31 grids (single rows).
2.  **Colors:** The input grids primarily use white (0) and azure (8). The output grids introduce green (3) while retaining white and azure.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing inputs and outputs reveals that a specific contiguous block of azure (8) pixels in the input is replaced by a block of green (3) pixels of the same size and position in the output. All other pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Rule Identification:**
    *   In `train_1`, the input has azure sequences of lengths 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, and 4. The sequence of length 4 (`8 8 8 8`) is replaced by `3 3 3 3`. This is the *longest* sequence.
    *   In `train_2`, the input has azure sequences of lengths 1, 1, 5, 2, 4, and 4. The sequence of length 5 (`8 8 8 8 8`) is replaced by `3 3 3 3 3`. This is the *longest* sequence.
    *   In `train_3`, the input has azure sequences of lengths 5, 5, 7, and 1. The sequence of length 7 (`8 8 8 8 8 8 8`) is replaced by `3 3 3 3 3 3 3`. This is the *longest* sequence.
5.  **Conclusion:** The core operation is to find the longest contiguous horizontal sequence of azure (8) pixels and replace it entirely with green (3) pixels. The examples do not show ties in length, but imply that only *one* such sequence is replaced if it exists. If there were ties, a tie-breaking rule (like choosing the first occurring sequence) would be needed, but based *only* on these examples, we target the unique longest sequence.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify the single longest contiguous horizontal sequence of azure pixels and replace its pixels with green.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: Assumed 1xN (effectively 1D).
  colors_input: [white (0), azure (8)]
  colors_output: [white (0), azure (8), green (3)]
  transformation_scope: Localized replacement within a sequence.
objects:
  - type: horizontal_sequence
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - contiguity: yes
      - length: variable
      - position: (start_index, end_index)
actions:
  - name: find_azure_sequences
    description: Identify all maximal contiguous horizontal sequences of azure pixels.
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_sequences, each with {start_index, end_index, length}
  - name: find_longest_sequence
    description: Determine the sequence(s) with the maximum length from the list.
    input: list_of_sequences
    output: longest_sequence(s)
    assumptions:
      - Examples suggest a unique longest sequence exists.
      - If ties occurred, a rule like 'first encountered' might apply, but is not demonstrated.
  - name: replace_sequence
    description: Replace the pixels of the identified longest azure sequence with green pixels.
    input: input_grid, longest_sequence
    replacement_color: green (3)
    output: output_grid
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Pixels outside the identified longest azure sequence are unchanged between input and output.
  - The green sequence in the output occupies the exact same position and has the same length as the longest azure sequence it replaced from the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid (from left to right) to identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of azure (8) pixels. For each sequence, record its start index, end index, and length.
3.  Find the maximum length among all recorded azure sequences.
4.  Identify the azure sequence that has this maximum length. (Based on the examples, assume there is only one such sequence. If multiple sequences shared the maximum length, the examples don't specify a tie-breaker, but typically the first one encountered would be chosen).
5.  If a longest azure sequence was found, iterate from its start index to its end index in the *output* grid and change the color of each pixel in this range to green (3).
6.  Return the modified output grid. If no azure sequences were found in the input, the output grid will be identical to the input grid.
