task_description: Identify the single longest contiguous horizontal sequence of azure pixels (8) within the entire input grid and replace its pixels with green (3). If ties in length occur, the sequence encountered first (scanning rows top-to-bottom, then columns left-to-right) is chosen.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D (Input examples confirmed as 1x31, but generalize to MxN).
  colors_input: [white (0), azure (8)]
  colors_output: [white (0), azure (8), green (3)]
  transformation_scope: Localized replacement within one sequence in one row.
objects:
  - type: horizontal_sequence
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - contiguity: yes
      - length: variable
      - position: (row_index, start_column, end_column)
actions:
  - name: find_all_azure_sequences
    description: Iterate through each row of the grid. Within each row, identify all maximal contiguous horizontal sequences of azure pixels. Record each sequence's row index, start column, end column, and length.
    input: input_grid (2D NumPy array)
    output: list_of_sequences, each with {row, start, end, length}
  - name: find_overall_longest_sequence
    description: From the list of all azure sequences found across all rows, determine the sequence with the maximum length. If multiple sequences share the maximum length, select the one that appears first when scanning rows top-to-bottom, and then columns left-to-right within a row.
    input: list_of_sequences
    output: single_longest_sequence {row, start, end, length} or None if no azure sequences exist.
  - name: replace_sequence_in_grid
    description: If a longest azure sequence was found, modify the corresponding row in the output grid by replacing the pixels from the start column to the end column (inclusive) with green (3).
    input: output_grid (copy of input), single_longest_sequence
    replacement_color: green (3)
    output: modified_output_grid
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Pixels outside the identified single longest azure sequence are unchanged between input and output.
  - The green sequence in the output occupies the exact same position (row and columns) and has the same length as the longest azure sequence it replaced from the input.
