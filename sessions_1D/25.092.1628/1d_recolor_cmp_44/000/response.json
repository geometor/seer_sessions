            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as single lines of numbers. Given the length (31, a prime number) and the nature of ARC tasks, these likely represent 1x31 grids (single rows).\n2.  **Colors:** The input grids primarily use white (0) and azure (8). The output grids introduce green (3) while retaining white and azure.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing inputs and outputs reveals that a specific contiguous block of azure (8) pixels in the input is replaced by a block of green (3) pixels of the same size and position in the output. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Rule Identification:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the input has azure sequences of lengths 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, and 4. The sequence of length 4 (`8 8 8 8`) is replaced by `3 3 3 3`. This is the *longest* sequence.\n    *   In `train_2`, the input has azure sequences of lengths 1, 1, 5, 2, 4, and 4. The sequence of length 5 (`8 8 8 8 8`) is replaced by `3 3 3 3 3`. This is the *longest* sequence.\n    *   In `train_3`, the input has azure sequences of lengths 5, 5, 7, and 1. The sequence of length 7 (`8 8 8 8 8 8 8`) is replaced by `3 3 3 3 3 3 3`. This is the *longest* sequence.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The core operation is to find the longest contiguous horizontal sequence of azure (8) pixels and replace it entirely with green (3) pixels. The examples do not show ties in length, but imply that only *one* such sequence is replaced if it exists. If there were ties, a tie-breaking rule (like choosing the first occurring sequence) would be needed, but based *only* on these examples, we target the unique longest sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If a longest azure sequence was found, iterate from its start index to its end index in the *output* grid and change the color of each pixel in this range to green (3).\n6.  Return the modified output grid. If no azure sequences were found in the input, the output grid will be identical to the input grid."
