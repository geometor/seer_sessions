task_description: Identify the single longest contiguous horizontal sequence of azure pixels and replace its pixels with green.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: Assumed 1xN (effectively 1D).
  colors_input: [white (0), azure (8)]
  colors_output: [white (0), azure (8), green (3)]
  transformation_scope: Localized replacement within a sequence.
objects:
  - type: horizontal_sequence
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - contiguity: yes
      - length: variable
      - position: (start_index, end_index)
actions:
  - name: find_azure_sequences
    description: Identify all maximal contiguous horizontal sequences of azure pixels.
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_sequences, each with {start_index, end_index, length}
  - name: find_longest_sequence
    description: Determine the sequence(s) with the maximum length from the list.
    input: list_of_sequences
    output: longest_sequence(s)
    assumptions:
      - Examples suggest a unique longest sequence exists.
      - If ties occurred, a rule like 'first encountered' might apply, but is not demonstrated.
  - name: replace_sequence
    description: Replace the pixels of the identified longest azure sequence with green pixels.
    input: input_grid, longest_sequence
    replacement_color: green (3)
    output: output_grid
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Pixels outside the identified longest azure sequence are unchanged between input and output.
  - The green sequence in the output occupies the exact same position and has the same length as the longest azure sequence it replaced from the input.
