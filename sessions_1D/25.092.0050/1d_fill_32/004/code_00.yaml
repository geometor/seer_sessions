task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D # Input/Output are 2D numpy arrays
grid_properties:
  - all_examples_single_row: true # Verified input/output shapes are (1, N)
input_characteristics:
  - structure: a 2D grid (numpy array) with shape (1, N)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects: 
      - name: markers
      - count: exactly 2 per input grid
      - property: identical non-white color (e.g., azure (8), gray (5))
      - location: within the single row of the grid
      - function: define the start and end columns of a segment
output_characteristics:
  - structure: a 2D grid (numpy array) with the same shape as the input
  - transformation: fill_segment_in_row
  - target_row: 0 (the only row)
  - segment_definition: inclusive range between the columns of the two marker pixels found in the input row
  - fill_color: the color of the marker pixels from the input
  - outside_segment: pixels remain white (0) in the target row
