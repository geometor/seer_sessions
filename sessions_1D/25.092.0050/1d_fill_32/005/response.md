Identify the two non-white pixels within the single row of the input 2D grid. 
Determine their common color and their column indices. 
Create an output grid of the same shape, initialized to white (0). 
Fill the segment in the output grid's single row, between the identified column indices (inclusive), with the color of the non-white pixels.
