*   **Perception:** The input is a 1D array (represented linearly) primarily composed of white (0) pixels. Within this array, there are exactly two non-white pixels, and these two pixels always share the same color (e.g., azure (8) or gray (5)). The output is a modified version of the input array where the segment *between* and *including* the two non-white pixels is filled entirely with the color of those two non-white pixels. All pixels outside this defined segment remain white (0).

*   **Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the non-white pixels in the input 1D array. There will be exactly two.
    2.  Determine the color of these two non-white pixels (they will be the same). Let this be the `fill_color`.
    3.  Determine the indices (positions) of these two non-white pixels. Let the smaller index be `start_index` and the larger index be `end_index`.
    4.  Create a new 1D array of the same length as the input, initially filled with white (0).
    5.  Iterate from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the value in the new array to the `fill_color`.
    6.  The resulting array is the output.

**Assessment:**

The previous attempt correctly identified the core logic: find two identical non-white markers and fill the space between them (inclusive) with their color. However, it incorrectly assumed the input was a 1D list (`List[int]`) instead of the standard ARC format, which is a 2D NumPy array (`np.ndarray`). The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms that the code attempted boolean comparisons on NumPy arrays (likely rows), which is invalid.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge the input is a 2D NumPy array.
2.  Verify (using code execution) that the relevant examples consist of single-row grids.
3.  Adapt the marker-finding and filling logic to operate on the first (and only) row of the 2D grid.
4.  Ensure the output is also a 2D NumPy array with the same dimensions as the input.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 2D grid (NumPy array), which will have dimensions (1, N).
2.  Identify the non-white pixels within the first (and only) row of the input grid. There will be exactly two.
3.  Determine the color of these two non-white pixels (they will have the same color). Let this be the `fill_color`.
4.  Determine the column indices of these two non-white pixels in the row. Let the smaller column index be `start_col` and the larger column index be `end_col`.
5.  Create a new 2D grid of the same shape as the input, initially filled with white (0).
6.  Iterate through the columns from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive). For each column index `c` in this range, set the value in the output grid at row 0 and column `c` (i.e., `output_grid[0, c]`) to the `fill_color`.
7.  The resulting 2D grid is the output.
