*   **Perception:** The input is a 1D array (represented linearly) primarily composed of white (0) pixels. Within this array, there are exactly two non-white pixels, and these two pixels always share the same color (e.g., azure (8) or gray (5)). The output is a modified version of the input array where the segment *between* and *including* the two non-white pixels is filled entirely with the color of those two non-white pixels. All pixels outside this defined segment remain white (0).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_transformation
    dimensionality: 1D
    input_characteristics:
      - type: array
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: two non-white pixels (markers)
      - property: markers always have the same color
      - property: markers can be any non-white color (observed: azure (8), gray (5))
      - property: markers define a start and end point of a segment
    output_characteristics:
      - type: array
      - same_length_as_input: true
      - transformation: fill_segment
      - segment_definition: inclusive range between the two marker pixels found in the input
      - fill_color: the color of the marker pixels from the input
      - outside_segment: pixels remain white (0)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the non-white pixels in the input 1D array. There will be exactly two.
    2.  Determine the color of these two non-white pixels (they will be the same). Let this be the `fill_color`.
    3.  Determine the indices (positions) of these two non-white pixels. Let the smaller index be `start_index` and the larger index be `end_index`.
    4.  Create a new 1D array of the same length as the input, initially filled with white (0).
    5.  Iterate from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the value in the new array to the `fill_color`.
    6.  The resulting array is the output.
