Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are always single-row grids (1D arrays).
*   The input grids contain mostly white pixels (value 0) and exactly two non-white pixels.
*   These two non-white pixels always share the same color (e.g., yellow in example 1, azure in examples 2 and 3).
*   The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
*   In the output grid, the two original non-white pixels remain in their positions.
*   Crucially, all the white pixels located *between* the two original non-white pixels in the input are changed to the same color as the non-white pixels in the output.
*   Pixels outside the span of the two non-white pixels remain white.
*   Essentially, the transformation fills the gap between the two non-white 'boundary' pixels with the same color, forming a solid horizontal line segment.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row).
2.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Find the indices of the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Let the smaller index be `start_index` and the larger index be `end_index`.
4.  Determine the color of these non-white pixels. Let this be `fill_color`.
5.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index` up to and including `end_index`.
6.  For each index in this range, set the color of the pixel at that index in the *output* grid to `fill_color`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
