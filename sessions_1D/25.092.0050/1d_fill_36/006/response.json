            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed to produce the correct output for any of the training examples, returning the input grid unchanged in each case. The results indicate that while the code correctly identified the input and output sizes and the color palette, it failed to perform the core transformation \u2013 filling the gap between the non-white pixels. The natural language program and the intended logic appear sound based on visual inspection of the examples. The discrepancy likely lies in the implementation details, possibly related to how the input grid structure was handled or how the modifications were applied to the copied grid within the function's execution context during testing. The failure mode (returning the original input) suggests that either the conditions for transformation (`len(non_white_indices) == 2` and `color1 == color2`) were not met as expected by the code, or the modification step did not correctly update the grid that was eventually returned. Given the consistent failure across all examples, the issue might be related to the initial checks or the data manipulation logic.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-verify the conditions required for the transformation based *only* on the visual input-output pairs.\n2.  Confirm the core transformation: identifying the two identical non-white pixels and filling the horizontal segment between them (inclusive) with their color.\n3.  Ensure the YAML and Natural Language Program accurately and clearly describe this process, including input structure expectations (single row represented as a list containing one list).\n4.  The core logic described in the previous natural language program seems correct and sufficient to explain the examples. The implementation needs to strictly adhere to it, especially handling the list-of-lists format for the grid and ensuring modifications are made correctly to the output structure.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nNo code execution is needed to gather metrics, as the transformation is straightforward visually.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 1x13 grid. Non-white pixels: yellow (4) at index 4 and index 8.\n    *   Output: 1x13 grid. Pixels from index 4 to 8 (inclusive) are yellow (4). Others are white (0).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 1x13 grid. Non-white pixels: azure (8) at index 4 and index 9.\n    *   Output: 1x13 grid. Pixels from index 4 to 9 (inclusive) are azure (8). Others are white (0).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 1x13 grid. Non-white pixels: azure (8) at index 7 and index 10.\n    *   Output: 1x13 grid. Pixels from index 7 to 10 (inclusive) are azure (8). Others are white (0).\n\n**Commonalities:**\n*   All inputs are 1x13 grids.\n*   All inputs have exactly two non-white pixels.\n*   The two non-white pixels in each input have the same color.\n*   The transformation involves filling the segment *between* and *including* the original non-white pixels with their color.\n*   The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
