task_description: "Fill the horizontal segment between two identical non-white pixels found in a single-row input grid."
grid_properties:
  - type: "input"
    dimensionality: "2D (but always 1 row, N columns)"
    content: "Contains mostly white pixels (0) and exactly two non-white pixels."
    constraints:
      - "The two non-white pixels must have the same color value."
      - "Grid height must be 1."
  - type: "output"
    dimensionality: "2D (1 row, N columns)"
    size: "Same dimensions as input."
    content: "Contains a single horizontal segment of non-white color. Pixels outside this segment are white (0)."
objects:
  - name: "Boundary Pixels"
    type: "pair"
    count: 1 # per input grid if conditions met
    properties:
      - color: "non-white (value > 0)"
      - uniformity: "Both pixels in the pair must have the same color."
      - location: "Distinct column indices within the single row."
      - role: "Define the start and end columns of the segment to be filled."
  - name: "Filled Segment"
    type: "horizontal line segment"
    count: 1 # per output grid if transformation occurs
    properties:
      - color: "Same as the Boundary Pixels."
      - location: "Spans the column indices inclusively between the two Boundary Pixels in the single row."
      - composition: "Consists of the original Boundary Pixels plus any white pixels originally located between them, all changed to the Boundary Pixel color."
transformation:
  - action: "Identify"
    target: "Input Grid Structure"
    details: "Verify the input grid has exactly one row."
  - action: "Find"
    target: "Non-white Pixels"
    details: "Locate all pixels in the row with a color value greater than 0. Record their indices and colors."
  - action: "Check Conditions"
    details: "Verify that exactly two non-white pixels were found AND that they share the same color value."
  - action: "Conditional Fill"
    condition: "The 'Check Conditions' step must be successful."
    details:
      - "Determine the color of the Boundary Pixels (fill_color)."
      - "Determine the minimum (start_col) and maximum (end_col) column indices of the Boundary Pixels."
      - "Create a copy of the input grid."
      - "In the copied grid's single row, set the color of all pixels from start_col to end_col (inclusive) to fill_color."
      - "Return the modified grid."
  - action: "No Change"
    condition: "The 'Check Conditions' step failed OR the input grid structure was invalid."
    details: "Return the original input grid unchanged."
