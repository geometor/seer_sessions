Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are always single-row grids (1D arrays).
*   The input grids contain mostly white pixels (value 0) and exactly two non-white pixels.
*   These two non-white pixels always share the same color (e.g., yellow in example 1, azure in examples 2 and 3).
*   The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
*   In the output grid, the two original non-white pixels remain in their positions.
*   Crucially, all the white pixels located *between* the two original non-white pixels in the input are changed to the same color as the non-white pixels in the output.
*   Pixels outside the span of the two non-white pixels remain white.
*   Essentially, the transformation fills the gap between the two non-white 'boundary' pixels with the same color, forming a solid horizontal line segment.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Fill the horizontal gap between two identical non-white pixels in a single row."
grid_properties:
  - type: "input"

    content: "Mostly white (0) with exactly two non-white pixels of the same color."
  - type: "output"
    dimensionality: 1
    size: "Same as input"
    content: "Contains a horizontal segment of a single non-white color connecting the positions of the input non-white pixels."
objects:
  - name: "Boundary Pixels"
    type: "pair"
    count: 1 # per input grid
    properties:
      - color: "non-white (value > 0)"
      - uniformity: "Both pixels in the pair have the same color."
      - location: "Distinct indices within the row."
      - role: "Define the start and end points of the segment to be filled."
  - name: "Filled Segment"
    type: "horizontal line segment"
    count: 1 # per output grid
    properties:
      - color: "Same as the Boundary Pixels."
      - location: "Spans the indices inclusively between the two Boundary Pixels."
      - composition: "Consists of the original Boundary Pixels plus the pixels filled in between."
transformation:
  - action: "Identify"
    target: "Boundary Pixels"
    details: "Find their color and indices (index1, index2, assuming index1 < index2)."
  - action: "Fill"
    target: "Pixels between Boundary Pixels"
    details: "Change the color of pixels at indices from index1 to index2 (inclusive) to match the color of the Boundary Pixels."
  - action: "Preserve"
    target: "Other Pixels (white)"
    details: "Pixels outside the range [index1, index2] remain white (0)."

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row).
2.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Find the indices of the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Let the smaller index be `start_index` and the larger index be `end_index`.
4.  Determine the color of these non-white pixels. Let this be `fill_color`.
5.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index` up to and including `end_index`.
6.  For each index in this range, set the color of the pixel at that index in the *output* grid to `fill_color`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
