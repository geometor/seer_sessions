            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed to produce the correct output for all training examples. The transformed output was identical to the input, indicating that the core transformation logic (filling the gap between the two non-white pixels) was not executed or did not persist.\n\nMy simulation using `tool_code` showed that the Python/numpy logic for finding indices and slicing/assigning values is correct for both 1D and 1xN 2D inputs *if the two non-white pixels have the same color*. The simulation highlighted a case (Test Case 5) where the code incorrectly filled the gap between two *different* non-white colors, which contradicts the pattern observed in the successful training examples (where the two non-white pixels are always identical).\n\nThe discrepancy between the failed execution report (no change) and the simulation (correct change for identical colors, incorrect for different colors) suggests potential issues:\n\n1.  **Input Format:** The actual input format during testing might differ from the assumed 1D list or 1xN numpy array (though the examples look like single rows).\n2.  **Return Format:** The testing framework might expect a specific output format (e.g., standard Python list of lists) rather than a numpy array.\n3.  **Missing Condition:** The code lacked an explicit check to ensure the two non-white pixels have the *same* color before filling.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the understanding of the input: Assume it's a single row, potentially represented as a 1D list or a 1xN list of lists.\n2.  Update the transformation rule: Add an explicit condition requiring the two identified non-white pixels to have the *same* color. Only proceed with filling if this condition, along with the condition of finding exactly two non-white pixels, is met. Otherwise, return the input unchanged.\n3.  Standardize Output: Ensure the function returns the grid in the standard ARC format (list of lists).\n\n**Metrics (from failed execution report)**\n\n| Example | Input Grid (Row)                     | Expected Output (Row)                | Actual Output (Row)                  | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                |\n| :------ | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | `[0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0]`        | `[0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0]`        | `[0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0]`        | 3          | Failed to fill indices 5, 6, 7 with color 4 (Yellow).                |\n| 2       | `[0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0]`        | `[0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0]`        | `[0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0]`        | 4          | Failed to fill indices 5, 6, 7, 8 with color 8 (Azure).              |\n| 3       | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0]`        | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0]`        | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0]`        | 2          | Failed to fill indices 8, 9 with color 8 (Azure).                    |\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
