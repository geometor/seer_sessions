task_description: "Fill the horizontal gap between two identical non-white pixels in a single row grid."
grid_properties:
  - type: "input"
    dimensionality: 2 # Assumed format is NxM, but all examples are 1xM
    rows: 1
    content: "Contains exactly one row. The row is mostly white (0) pixels."
    constraints: "May contain exactly two non-white pixels."
  - type: "output"
    dimensionality: 2
    size: "Same as input (1xM)"
    content: "If the input row contained exactly two non-white pixels *of the same color*, the output row contains a horizontal segment of that color connecting the original positions. Otherwise, the output is identical to the input."
objects:
  - name: "Pixel Pair"
    type: "potential boundary markers"
    source: "Input grid row"
    properties:
      - color: "non-white (value > 0)"
      - count: "Exactly two such pixels must exist in the row."
      - uniformity: "The two pixels must have the same color value."
      - location: "Distinct column indices within the single row."
      - role: "If count and uniformity conditions met, they define the start and end points of the segment to be filled."
  - name: "Filled Segment"
    type: "horizontal line segment"
    destination: "Output grid row"
    conditions: "Created only if the 'Pixel Pair' conditions (count=2, same color) are met in the input."
    properties:
      - color: "Same as the Pixel Pair color."
      - location: "Spans the column indices inclusively between the two Pixel Pair locations."
      - composition: "Consists of the original Pixel Pair pixels plus any pixels between them, all set to the Pixel Pair color."
transformation:
  - action: "Analyze Input Row"
    details: "Examine the single row of the input grid."
  - action: "Identify Non-White Pixels"
    details: "Find the indices and colors of all non-white pixels in the row."
  - action: "Check Conditions"
    details: "Verify if exactly two non-white pixels were found AND if they have the same color."
  - action: "Conditional Fill"
    condition: "If exactly two non-white pixels of the same color are found:"
    steps:
      - "Determine the minimum (start_index) and maximum (end_index) of their indices."
      - "Determine their common color (fill_color)."
      - "Create the output grid row by copying the input row."
      - "Modify the output row: Set the color of all pixels from start_index to end_index (inclusive) to fill_color."
    alternative: "If conditions are not met:"
      - "The output grid is an identical copy of the input grid."
  - action: "Format Output"
    details: "Return the resulting grid row packaged as a list containing one list (list of lists format)."
