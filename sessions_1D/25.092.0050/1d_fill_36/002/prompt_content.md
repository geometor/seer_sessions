"""
Fill the horizontal gap between two identical non-white pixels in a single row.
Receive the input grid (a single row).
Find the indices of the two non-white pixels.
Determine the color of these non-white pixels (fill_color).
Determine the start and end indices of the segment to be filled (min and max of the non-white pixel indices).
Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
Change the color of all pixels in the output grid between the start and end indices (inclusive) to the fill_color.
Return the modified output grid.
