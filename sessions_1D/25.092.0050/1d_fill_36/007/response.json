Verify that the input grid consists of exactly one row. If not, return the input grid unchanged.\n2. Extract the single row from the input grid.\n3. Find the column indices and colors of all non-white pixels (value > 0) in the row.\n4. Check if precisely two non-white pixels were found.\n5. If two were found, check if they have the identical color value.\n6. If both conditions are met (exactly two non-white pixels found, and they have the same color):\n    a.  Identify the shared color of these two pixels (let this be `fill_color`).\n    b.  Determine the minimum column index (`start_index`) and the maximum column index (`end_index`) from the two non-white pixels.\n    c.  Create a copy of the original input grid to serve as the output grid.\n    d.  Access the single row within the output grid copy.\n    e.  Iterate through the column indices from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). For each index `i` in this range, set the pixel value at `output_grid[0][i]` to `fill_color`.\n    f.
