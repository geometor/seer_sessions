Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are always single-row grids (1D arrays).
*   The input grids contain mostly white pixels (value 0) and exactly two non-white pixels.
*   These two non-white pixels always share the same color (e.g., yellow in example 1, azure in examples 2 and 3).
*   The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
*   In the output grid, the two original non-white pixels remain in their positions.
*   Crucially, all the white pixels located *between* the two original non-white pixels in the input are changed to the same color as the non-white pixels in the output.
*   Pixels outside the span of the two non-white pixels remain white.
*   Essentially, the transformation fills the gap between the two non-white 'boundary' pixels with the same color, forming a solid horizontal line segment.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided training examples consistently demonstrate a "fill between" transformation rule. In each case, the input is a single row containing exactly two non-white pixels of the same color. The output is generated by filling the segment between these two pixels (inclusive) with their color.

The previous code attempt failed, returning the input unchanged for all examples. This suggests either a bug preventing the fill logic from executing (perhaps related to input format assumptions or conditional checks) or an issue in the testing environment. However, the core transformation logic identified ("fill between two identical boundary pixels") appears correct based on the visual evidence of the input/output pairs.

The strategy is to refine the description of the transformation (YAML and Natural Language Program) based on the consistent pattern observed in the examples, assuming the core logic is sound but needs precise articulation. We will re-verify the properties and actions based on all examples.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Verify that the input grid consists of exactly one row. If not, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  Extract the single row from the input grid.
3.  Find all non-white pixels (pixels with value > 0) in the row.
4.  Check if exactly two non-white pixels were found.
5.  If exactly two were found, check if they have the same color value.
6.  If both conditions (exactly two non-white pixels, same color) are met:
    a.  Identify the color of the non-white pixels (this is the `fill_color`).
    b.  Find the column indices of the two non-white pixels. Determine the minimum index (`start_index`) and the maximum index (`end_index`).
    c.  Create a copy of the original input grid to serve as the output grid.
    d.  Access the single row within the output grid.
    e.  Iterate through the column indices from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). For each index `i` in this range, set the pixel value at `output_grid[0][i]` to `fill_color`.
    f.  Return the modified output grid.
7.  If the conditions in steps 4 or 5 are not met (i.e., not exactly two non-white pixels, or their colors differ), return the original input grid unchanged.
