"""
Fill the horizontal segment between two identical non-white pixels in a single-row grid.

1. Verify that the input grid consists of exactly one row. If not, return the input grid unchanged.
2. Extract the single row from the input grid.
3. Find all non-white pixels (pixels with value > 0) in the row.
4. Check if exactly two non-white pixels were found.
5. If exactly two were found, check if they have the same color value.
6. If both conditions (exactly two non-white pixels, same color) are met:
    a. Identify the color of the non-white pixels (fill_color).
    b. Find the column indices of the two non-white pixels. Determine the minimum index (start_index) and the maximum index (end_index).
    c. Create a copy of the original input grid to serve as the output grid.
    d. Access the single row within the output grid.
    e. Iterate through the column indices from start_index to end_index (inclusive). For each index i in this range, set the pixel value at output_grid[0][i] to fill_color.
    f. Return the modified output grid.
7. If the conditions are not met, return the original input grid unchanged.
