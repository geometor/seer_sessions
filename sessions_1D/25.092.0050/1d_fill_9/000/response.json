In each example, the input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (magenta or gray) separated by white pixels. The remaining pixels are white. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. The transformation consists of filling the segment of white pixels located strictly between the two non-white pixels with that same non-white color. The original non-white pixels and the white pixels outside this segment remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
