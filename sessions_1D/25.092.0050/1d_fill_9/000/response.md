*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming a 1-dimensional grid (or a 1xN 2D grid). In each example, the input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (magenta or gray) separated by white pixels. The remaining pixels are white. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. The transformation consists of filling the segment of white pixels located strictly between the two non-white pixels with that same non-white color. The original non-white pixels and the white pixels outside this segment remain unchanged.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D)
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: (white, magenta, gray) represented by integers (0, 6, 5)
          - position: index in the 1D array
      - type: segment
        properties:
          - color: consists of pixels of a single color
          - boundary: defined by the positions of the two non-white pixels
    input_characteristics:
      - contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color
      - all other pixels are white
    output_characteristics:
      - same dimensions as input
      - the segment between the initial non-white pixels is filled with their color
    actions:
      - identify: find the non-white color present in the input
      - locate: find the indices of the two pixels with the non-white color
      - fill: change the color of the white pixels between the located indices to the non-white color
    relationships:
      - the two non-white pixels define the boundaries of the segment to be filled
      - the color used for filling is the same as the color of the boundary pixels
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the unique non-white color (`C`) present in the input grid.
    2.  Find the index of the first occurrence (`idx1`) and the last occurrence (`idx2`) of color `C` in the input grid.
    3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    4.  Iterate through the indices from `idx1 + 1` to `idx2 - 1`.
    5.  For each index in this range, set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to `C`.
    6.  Return the modified grid as the output.
