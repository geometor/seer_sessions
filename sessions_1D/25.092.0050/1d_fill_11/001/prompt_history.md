Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (single rows). The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged between input and output.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids primarily use white (0) as a background color. A single non-white color appears in each input (blue=1 in train\_1 and train\_3, gray=5 in train\_2).
3.  **Key Objects:** The significant objects are the non-white pixels within the row. In each input, there are exactly two non-white pixels of the same color, separated by one or more white pixels.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves "filling" the gap between the two non-white pixels. The output grid replaces all the white pixels located between the original two non-white pixels with the non-white color itself.
5.  **Boundary Identification:** The process requires identifying the locations (indices) of the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels in the input row.
6.  **Filling Action:** The action is to set the color of all pixels from the index of the leftmost non-white pixel to the index of the rightmost non-white pixel (inclusive) to match the color of those boundary pixels. Pixels outside this range retain their original color (which is white in these examples).

**Facts:**

task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  shape_preservation: True, input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  color_usage:

objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    attributes:
      description: Non-white pixels in the input grid.
      count: Exactly two per input example.
      color: Uniform within an example (e.g., both blue or both gray).
      spatial_relation: Separated by one or more white pixels along the row.
      role: Define the boundaries for the fill operation.
actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries

    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid and then changing the color of all pixels from the leftmost_non_white_index to the rightmost_non_white_index (inclusive) to the fill_color.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The transformation targets the segment of the row *between* (and including) the two initial non-white pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Scan the input row to find all non-white pixels.
3.  Identify the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel found.
4.  Identify the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel found.
5.  Determine the color of these non-white boundary pixels (they will have the same color).
6.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
7.  Iterate through the pixel columns from the leftmost index to the rightmost index (inclusive).
8.  For each column index in this range, set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the determined non-white color.
9.  Return the modified grid as the output.
