task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  shape_preservation: True, input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  color_usage:
    - Background: white (0)
    - Foreground: A single non-white color per example (e.g., blue=1, gray=5)
objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    attributes:
      description: Non-white pixels in the input grid.
      count: Exactly two per input example.
      color: Uniform within an example (e.g., both blue or both gray).
      spatial_relation: Separated by one or more white pixels along the row.
      role: Define the boundaries for the fill operation.
actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs:
      - leftmost_non_white_index
      - rightmost_non_white_index
      - fill_color (color of the boundary pixels)
    description: Find the column index of the first and last non-white pixels in the row and identify their color.
  - name: fill_segment
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - leftmost_non_white_index
      - rightmost_non_white_index
      - fill_color
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid and then changing the color of all pixels from the leftmost_non_white_index to the rightmost_non_white_index (inclusive) to the fill_color.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The transformation targets the segment of the row *between* (and including) the two initial non-white pixels.
