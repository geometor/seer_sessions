            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (single rows). The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged between input and output.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The grids primarily use white (0) as a background color. A single non-white color appears in each input (blue=1 in train\\_1 and train\\_3, gray=5 in train\\_2).\n3.  **Key Objects:** The significant objects are the non-white pixels within the row. In each input, there are exactly two non-white pixels of the same color, separated by one or more white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves \"filling\" the gap between the two non-white pixels. The output grid replaces all the white pixels located between the original two non-white pixels with the non-white color itself.\n5.  **Boundary Identification:** The process requires identifying the locations (indices) of the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels in the input row.\n6.  **Filling Action:** The action is to set the color of all pixels from the index of the leftmost non-white pixel to the index of the rightmost non-white pixel (inclusive) to match the color of those boundary pixels. Pixels outside this range retain their original color (which is white in these examples).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
