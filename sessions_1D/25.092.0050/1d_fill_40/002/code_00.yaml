task_type: fill_segment_1d
grid_dimensionality: 2D, but effectively 1D (shape 1xN)
input_object:
  - type: grid
  - shape: 1xN (N varies, e.g., 1x25)
  - content:
      - background_pixels: color white (0)
      - marker_pixels:
          - count: 2
          - color: C (non-white, consistent within an example, varies between examples: blue, green, orange)
          - arrangement: separated by one or more background pixels
output_object:
  - type: grid
  - shape: 1xN (same as input)
  - content:
      - background_pixels: color white (0)
      - filled_segment_pixels:
          - color: C (same as input marker color)
          - location: spans the columns from the first marker pixel to the second marker pixel (inclusive)
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: marker_pixels
    attributes: color (C) and column indices (index_1, index_2)
  - action: determine_range
    inputs: index_1, index_2
    outputs: start_col = min(index_1, index_2), end_col = max(index_1, index_2)
  - action: create
    target: output_grid
    properties: shape = input_shape, initial_color = white (0)
  - action: fill
    target: output_grid
    location: row 0, columns from start_col to end_col (inclusive)
    color: C
relationships:
  - output shape matches input shape.
  - fill color matches input marker color.
  - filled segment boundaries are determined by the column indices of the input marker pixels.
