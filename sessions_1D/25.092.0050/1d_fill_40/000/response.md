**Perception:**

The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (single rows). Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, with all other pixels being white (0). The specific non-white color varies between examples (blue, green, orange). The output grid is the same size as the input. The transformation involves filling the segment of the grid between the two non-white pixels (inclusive) with that same non-white color. The pixels outside this segment remain white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D
input_characteristics:
  - type: grid
  - shape: 1xN (N varies)
  - elements:
      - color: white (0) - background
      - color: non-white (C) - marker color (varies per example: blue, green, orange)
  - constraints:
      - exactly two pixels have the non-white color C
      - all other pixels are white (0)
output_characteristics:
  - type: grid
  - shape: same as input (1xN)
  - elements:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: non-white (C) - same as input marker color
transformation_rule:
  - identify the non-white color (C) present in the input.
  - find the indices (positions) of the two pixels with color C. Let these be index_start and index_end (where index_start < index_end).
  - create an output grid of the same size, initialized to white (0).
  - fill the output grid from index_start to index_end (inclusive) with color C.
relationships:
  - the output color C is determined by the input color C.
  - the filled segment in the output is defined by the positions of the two C-colored pixels in the input.
  - the size of the output grid matches the size of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the non-white color (`fill_color`) present in the input grid.
2.  Find the positions (indices) of all pixels that have the `fill_color`.
3.  Determine the minimum and maximum indices among these positions (`start_index` and `end_index`, respectively).
4.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the white color (0).
5.  Iterate from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). For each position within this range, set the corresponding pixel in the new grid to the `fill_color`.
6.  The resulting grid is the output.
