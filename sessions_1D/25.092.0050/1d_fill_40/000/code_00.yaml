task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D
input_characteristics:
  - type: grid
  - shape: 1xN (N varies)
  - elements:
      - color: white (0) - background
      - color: non-white (C) - marker color (varies per example: blue, green, orange)
  - constraints:
      - exactly two pixels have the non-white color C
      - all other pixels are white (0)
output_characteristics:
  - type: grid
  - shape: same as input (1xN)
  - elements:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: non-white (C) - same as input marker color
transformation_rule:
  - identify the non-white color (C) present in the input.
  - find the indices (positions) of the two pixels with color C. Let these be index_start and index_end (where index_start < index_end).
  - create an output grid of the same size, initialized to white (0).
  - fill the output grid from index_start to index_end (inclusive) with color C.
relationships:
  - the output color C is determined by the input color C.
  - the filled segment in the output is defined by the positions of the two C-colored pixels in the input.
  - the size of the output grid matches the size of the input grid.
