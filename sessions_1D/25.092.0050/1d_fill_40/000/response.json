Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, with all other pixels being white (0). The specific non-white color varies between examples (blue, green, orange). The output grid is the same size as the input. The transformation involves filling the segment of the grid between the two non-white pixels (inclusive) with that same non-white color. The pixels outside this segment remain white.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
