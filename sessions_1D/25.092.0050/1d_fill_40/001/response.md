"""
Identify the non-white color (fill_color) present in the input grid.
Find the positions (indices) of all pixels that have the fill_color.
Determine the minimum and maximum indices among these positions (start_index and end_index).
Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
Iterate from start_index to end_index (inclusive). For each position within this range,
set the corresponding pixel in the new grid to the fill_color.
The resulting grid is the output.
