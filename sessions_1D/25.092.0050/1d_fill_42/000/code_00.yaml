task_type: fill_between
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1xN
  output: 1xN
objects:
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: non_white (e.g., gray '5', yellow '4')
    count_in_input: 2
    relationship: define the start and end points of a segment
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white '0'
transformation:
  - action: identify_markers
    description: Find the positions (indices) of the two non-white pixels in the input row.
  - action: identify_fill_color
    description: Determine the color of the non-white marker pixels.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Change the color of all pixels between the leftmost and rightmost marker pixels (inclusive) to the identified fill color.
  - action: preserve_background
    description: Ensure pixels outside the filled segment remain white ('0').
constraints:
  - Input grid always contains exactly two non-white pixels.
  - The two non-white pixels in the input are always the same color.
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - The operation is performed row-wise (though only one row is present in examples).
