Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by one or more white pixels (`0`). The remaining pixels are white. The output grid is the same size as the input grid. The transformation involves filling the gap between the two non-white pixels with the same non-white color. The pixels outside this filled range remain white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
