**Perception of Elements:**

The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by one or more white pixels (`0`). The remaining pixels are white. The output grid is the same size as the input grid. The transformation involves filling the gap between the two non-white pixels with the same non-white color. The pixels outside this filled range remain white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_between
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1xN
  output: 1xN
objects:
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: non_white (e.g., gray '5', yellow '4')
    count_in_input: 2
    relationship: define the start and end points of a segment
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white '0'
transformation:
  - action: identify_markers
    description: Find the positions (indices) of the two non-white pixels in the input row.
  - action: identify_fill_color
    description: Determine the color of the non-white marker pixels.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Change the color of all pixels between the leftmost and rightmost marker pixels (inclusive) to the identified fill color.
  - action: preserve_background
    description: Ensure pixels outside the filled segment remain white ('0').
constraints:
  - Input grid always contains exactly two non-white pixels.
  - The two non-white pixels in the input are always the same color.
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - The operation is performed row-wise (though only one row is present in examples).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the non-white color present in the input grid. Let this be the `fill_color`.
2.  Find the index (column position) of the leftmost pixel with the `fill_color`. Let this be `start_index`.
3.  Find the index (column position) of the rightmost pixel with the `fill_color`. Let this be `end_index`.
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (`0`).
5.  Iterate from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the `fill_color`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
