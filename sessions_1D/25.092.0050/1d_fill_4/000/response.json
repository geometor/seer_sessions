The length of the row is the same for the input and output in each example.\n2.  **Color Focus**: The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other color per example (red (2), yellow (4), green (3)).\n3.  **Input Pattern**: Each input row contains exactly two pixels of the non-white color, with all other pixels being white.\n4.  **Transformation Logic**: The transformation appears to involve filling the space *between* the two non-white pixels found in the input. The fill color used is the same as the color of the two non-white pixels. The pixels outside this filled segment remain white.\n5.  **Boundary Definition**: The two non-white pixels in the input act as boundaries for the fill operation. The fill includes the boundary pixels themselves.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
