Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format**: Both input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels. The length of the row is the same for the input and output in each example.
2.  **Color Focus**: The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other color per example (red (2), yellow (4), green (3)).
3.  **Input Pattern**: Each input row contains exactly two pixels of the non-white color, with all other pixels being white.
4.  **Transformation Logic**: The transformation appears to involve filling the space *between* the two non-white pixels found in the input. The fill color used is the same as the color of the two non-white pixels. The pixels outside this filled segment remain white.
5.  **Boundary Definition**: The two non-white pixels in the input act as boundaries for the fill operation. The fill includes the boundary pixels themselves.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the color and the indices of the two non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Determine the minimum and maximum of these two indices.
3.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
4.  Iterate through the indices from the minimum index to the maximum index (inclusive).
5.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output row to the color identified in step 1.
6.  Return the modified row as the output.
