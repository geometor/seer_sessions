Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a single row (a 1D grid or array) of pixels.
2.  **Output Structure:** Each output is also a single row of pixels, the same length as the input.
3.  **Key Elements:** The inputs contain exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by one or more white pixels (color 0). All other pixels are white.
4.  **Transformation Observation:** In the output, the pixels located *between* the two original non-white pixels have been changed from white to the same non-white color found in the input. The original non-white pixels and all other white pixels remain unchanged. The effect is like "drawing a line" or "filling the gap" between the two non-white pixels using their color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap between two identical non-white pixels in a row.
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1D array (row) of pixels.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0 to 9.
      - position: Index within the row.
  - element: non_white_pixel_pair
    description: Two pixels in the same row with the same color C (where C is not 0).
    properties:
      - color: C
      - positions: [index1, index2] where index1 < index2.
  - element: gap_pixels
    description: All pixels located between the non_white_pixel_pair.
    condition: All pixels in the gap must initially be white (color 0).
    properties:
      - positions: All indices `i` such that index1 < i < index2.
      - initial_color: 0 (white)
action:
  - type: fill
    target: gap_pixels
    parameters:
      - fill_color: The color C of the non_white_pixel_pair.
    effect: Changes the color of all gap_pixels from white (0) to C.
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The concept of "betweenness" defines the gap_pixels relative to the non_white_pixel_pair within the row.
invariants:
  - The grid dimensions remain the same.
  - The positions and colors of the original non_white_pixel_pair remain the same.
  - The positions and colors of pixels outside the range [index1, index2] remain the same.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input row. Let this color be `C`.
2.  Find the indices (positions) of the first and the last pixel with color `C` in the row. Let these be `start_index` and `end_index`.
3.  For every pixel located at an index `i` such that `start_index < i < end_index`, change its color to `C`.
4.  Leave all other pixels (at indices less than or equal to `start_index` or greater than or equal to `end_index`) unchanged.
5.  The resulting row is the output.
