All other pixels are white.\n4.  **Transformation Observation:** In the output, the pixels located *between* the two original non-white pixels have been changed from white to the same non-white color found in the input. The original non-white pixels and all other white pixels remain unchanged. The effect is like \"drawing a line\" or \"filling the gap\" between the two non-white pixels using their color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
