task_description: Fill the gap between two identical non-white pixels in a row.
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1D array (row) of pixels.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0 to 9.
      - position: Index within the row.
  - element: non_white_pixel_pair
    description: Two pixels in the same row with the same color C (where C is not 0).
    properties:
      - color: C
      - positions: [index1, index2] where index1 < index2.
  - element: gap_pixels
    description: All pixels located between the non_white_pixel_pair.
    condition: All pixels in the gap must initially be white (color 0).
    properties:
      - positions: All indices `i` such that index1 < i < index2.
      - initial_color: 0 (white)
action:
  - type: fill
    target: gap_pixels
    parameters:
      - fill_color: The color C of the non_white_pixel_pair.
    effect: Changes the color of all gap_pixels from white (0) to C.
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The concept of "betweenness" defines the gap_pixels relative to the non_white_pixel_pair within the row.
invariants:
  - The grid dimensions remain the same.
  - The positions and colors of the original non_white_pixel_pair remain the same.
  - The positions and colors of pixels outside the range [index1, index2] remain the same.
