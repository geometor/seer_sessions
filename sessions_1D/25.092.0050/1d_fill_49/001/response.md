"""
Transforms an input row by finding the two pixels of the same non-white color 
and filling the gap between them with that same color.

1. Identify the single non-white color present in the input row. Let this color be C.
2. Find the indices (positions) of the first and the last pixel with color C in the row. Let these be start_index and end_index.
3. For every pixel located at an index i such that start_index < i < end_index, change its color to C.
4. Leave all other pixels (at indices less than or equal to start_index or greater than or equal to end_index) unchanged.
5. The resulting row is the output.
