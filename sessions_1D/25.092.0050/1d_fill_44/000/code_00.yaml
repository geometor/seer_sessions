task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D rows
input_elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background
  - type: pixel
    color: non-white (e.g., red=2, yellow=4, orange=7)
    role: marker
input_structure:
  - Markers appear in pairs within the row.
  - Markers are separated by one or more background pixels.
output_structure:
  - A contiguous segment of the marker color spans the area from the first marker to the last marker found in the input.
  - Pixels outside this segment remain background pixels.
transformation: fill_segment
parameters:
  - fill_color: determined by the marker color in the input
  - start_index: column index of the first marker pixel
  - end_index: column index of the last marker pixel
relationships:
  - The output segment's color is identical to the input marker color.
  - The output segment's boundaries are defined by the minimum and maximum column indices of the input markers.
