Okay, analyzing the provided example:

**Perception**

*   The input and output are both 1x10 grids (single rows).
*   The input contains two non-white pixels (red, value 2) separated by white pixels (value 0).
*   The output grid shows the two original red pixels plus the white pixels between them have also become red.
*   The non-white color (red) is preserved from input to output.
*   The transformation appears to identify the extent (start and end points) of the non-white pixels in the input row and fill that entire range with the non-white color in the output row. Pixels outside this range remain white.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D rows
input_elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background
  - type: pixel
    color: non-white (e.g., red=2, yellow=4, orange=7)
    role: marker
input_structure:
  - Markers appear in pairs within the row.
  - Markers are separated by one or more background pixels.
output_structure:
  - A contiguous segment of the marker color spans the area from the first marker to the last marker found in the input.
  - Pixels outside this segment remain background pixels.
transformation: fill_segment
parameters:
  - fill_color: determined by the marker color in the input
  - start_index: column index of the first marker pixel
  - end_index: column index of the last marker pixel
relationships:
  - The output segment's color is identical to the input marker color.
  - The output segment's boundaries are defined by the minimum and maximum column indices of the input markers.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the non-white color present in the input row.
2.  Find the column indices of all pixels matching this non-white color.
3.  Determine the minimum and maximum column indices from the found locations.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input, initially filled entirely with white (0).
5.  Fill the cells in the output row from the minimum index to the maximum index (inclusive) with the identified non-white color.
