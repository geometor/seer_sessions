*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is always a single row (1D grid).
    *   The input row contains mostly white pixels (0) and exactly two non-white pixels.
    *   The two non-white pixels in the input always have the same color (e.g., blue in train_1, red in train_2, orange in train_3).
    *   The output is also a single row of the same length as the input.
    *   In the output, the segment starting from the first non-white pixel and ending at the second non-white pixel (inclusive) is filled entirely with that non-white color.
    *   All pixels outside this filled segment in the output are white (0).
    *   The transformation essentially "draws a line" or fills a horizontal segment between the two given non-white points using their color.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the non-white color present in the input row.
    2.  Find the indices (positions) of the two pixels that have this non-white color.
    3.  Determine the minimum and maximum of these two indices; these define the start and end of the target segment.
    4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
    5.  Fill the pixels in the output row from the minimum index to the maximum index (inclusive) with the identified non-white color.
    6.  Return the modified output row.
