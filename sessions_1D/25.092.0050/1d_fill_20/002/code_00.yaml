task_type: fill_segment_1d
dimensionality: 1D (represented potentially as 1xN grid)
input_elements:
  - type: grid
    shape: 1 row, variable columns (N)
    content:
      - element_type: background
        color: white (0)
        count: N - 2
      - element_type: markers
        color: non-white (consistent within a single input, varies between examples: orange, green, gray)
        count: 2
        properties:
          - indices: locations within the row (column indices)
          - relationship: define the start and end points of a segment
output_elements:
  - type: grid
    shape: same as input (1xN)
    content:
      - element_type: background
        color: white (0)
        location: column indices outside the segment defined by input markers
      - element_type: filled_segment
        color: same as the input markers
        location: spans column indices from the minimum marker index to the maximum marker index (inclusive), within the single row.
transformation:
  - action: prepare_grid
    inputs: input grid (potentially list of lists)
    outputs: 1D representation of the grid data
  - action: identify_markers
    inputs: 1D grid data
    outputs: indices and color of the two non-white pixels
  - action: determine_range
    inputs: marker indices
    outputs: minimum index (start) and maximum index (end) of the segment
  - action: create_output_data
    inputs: 1D grid data
    outputs: copy of 1D grid data
  - action: fill_range
    inputs: output data, start index, end index, marker color
    outputs: modified output data (1D) with the segment filled
  - action: format_output
    inputs: modified output data (1D), original input grid format
    outputs: output grid in the same format as the input (e.g., list of lists if input was 1xN)
