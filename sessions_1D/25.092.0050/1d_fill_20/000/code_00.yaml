task_type: fill_segment
dimensionality: 1D
input_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: markers
    count: 2
    color: non-white (varies per example: orange, green, gray)
    properties:
      - location: index within the row
      - relationship: define the start and end points of a segment
output_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - location: outside the segment defined by input markers
  - type: filled_segment
    color: same as the input markers
    properties:
      - location: spans from the index of the first marker to the index of the second marker (inclusive)
transformation:
  - action: identify_markers
    inputs: input grid
    outputs: indices and color of the two non-white pixels
  - action: determine_range
    inputs: indices of the markers
    outputs: minimum and maximum index (start and end of the segment)
  - action: fill_range
    inputs: input grid, start index, end index, marker color
    outputs: output grid (copy of input with the range filled)
