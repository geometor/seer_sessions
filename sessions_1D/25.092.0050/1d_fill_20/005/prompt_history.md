## Perception
The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays).
Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, with all other pixels being white (0).
The output grid is formed by filling the space *between* these two non-white pixels (inclusive) with the same non-white color.
The pixels outside this filled range remain white.

## Facts

input_elements:

    color: non-white (varies per example: orange, green, gray)
    properties:
      - location: index within the row

    color: same as the input markers
    properties:

  - action: fill_range
    inputs: input grid, start index, end index, marker color
    outputs: output grid (copy of input with the range filled)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the non-white color present in the input grid.
2.  Find the indices of the two pixels that have this non-white color.
3.  Determine the minimum and maximum of these two indices. Let these be `start_index` and `end_index`.
4.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
5.  Iterate from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the pixel value in the output grid to the identified non-white color.
6.  Return the modified output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed because it returned the original input grid instead of the transformed one for all training examples. The transformed output being identical to the input suggests that the function exited prematurely, likely due to one of the conditional checks intended for handling unexpected inputs (e.g., wrong number of markers, multiple non-white colors) or potentially an issue with input format detection.

However, the core logic described in the initial perception and natural language program—identifying two markers of the same color and filling the segment between them—appears correct based on the visual examples. The examples consistently show a single non-white color used twice as markers in a 1D grid, and the output fills the space between (and including) these markers with that color.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Assume Standard Input Format:** Assume the input grid will always be provided in the standard ARC format, which is `list[list[int]]`. For this specific task, it will be a list containing a single inner list representing the row (e.g., `[[0, 0, 7, ..., 7, 0]]`). This simplifies format handling.
2.  **Verify Assumptions:** Use code execution to confirm key properties like the number of markers and their color for each example.
3.  **Refine Implementation:** Rewrite the transformation logic focusing solely on the core task, removing complex format detection or error handling that might return the input prematurely when the standard case applies. Stick closely to the refined natural language program.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Update the facts (YAML) and the natural language program based on verified observations.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a grid with a single row. Extract this row for processing.
2.  Identify the unique non-white color present in the row. This is the `marker_color`.
3.  Find the indices (column positions) where the `marker_color` appears. There will be exactly two such indices.
4.  Determine the minimum (`start_index`) and maximum (`end_index`) of these two indices.
5.  Create a new row that is initially a copy of the input row.
6.  Modify the new row: For every index from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive), set the pixel value to the `marker_color`.
7.  Return the modified row, formatted as a single-row grid (list containing the row list).
