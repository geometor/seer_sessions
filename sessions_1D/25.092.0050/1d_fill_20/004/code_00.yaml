task_type: segment_filling
dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN 2D grid)
input_description: A single row grid (1xN).
output_description: A single row grid (1xN) of the same dimensions as the input.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    scope: input_output
  - type: marker
    count: 2
    color: a single non-white color (varies: orange, green, gray)
    attributes:
      - same_color: The two markers always share the same non-white color.
      - location: Their indices define the boundaries of a segment.
    scope: input
  - type: filled_segment
    color: same color as the input markers
    location: Spans the grid indices from the minimum marker index to the maximum marker index (inclusive).
    scope: output
transformation_steps:
  - step: 1_identify_markers
    action: Find the single non-white color present in the input row.
    output: marker_color
  - step: 2_locate_markers
    action: Find the indices of the two pixels matching the marker_color.
    input: input_row, marker_color
    output: marker_indices (a list/array of two indices)
  - step: 3_define_segment
    action: Determine the minimum and maximum index from marker_indices.
    input: marker_indices
    output: start_index, end_index
  - step: 4_create_output
    action: Create a copy of the input row.
    input: input_row
    output: output_row
  - step: 5_fill_segment
    action: Set the color of all pixels in the output_row from start_index to end_index (inclusive) to marker_color.
    input: output_row, start_index, end_index, marker_color
    output: final_output_row
assumptions:
  - Each input grid contains exactly one non-white color.
  - This non-white color appears exactly twice.
  - The input grid has exactly one row.
