task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D, though represented as 1xN grid
input_elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (value 0-9)
      - position (index)
  - type: segment
    defined_by: two non-white pixels of the same color
    properties:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - color (of the defining pixels)
      - interior_pixels (pixels between start and end)
output_elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (value 0-9)
      - position (index)
transformation:
  action: fill
  target: white pixels within the segment defined by the two non-white pixels
  fill_color: the color of the non-white pixels defining the segment
constraints:
  - input contains exactly two non-white pixels
  - the two non-white pixels have the same color
relationships:
  - adjacency: pixels are arranged linearly
  - betweenness: identifying pixels located spatially between two other pixels
