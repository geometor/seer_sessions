Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).
*   Each input grid contains exactly two non-white pixels.
*   These two non-white pixels always share the same color in a given input grid.
*   The transformation involves filling the white pixels located *between* the two non-white pixels.
*   The filling color used is the same as the color of the two original non-white pixels.
*   The original non-white pixels and any white pixels outside the segment defined by the two non-white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D, though represented as 1xN grid
input_elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (value 0-9)
      - position (index)
  - type: segment
    defined_by: two non-white pixels of the same color
    properties:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - color (of the defining pixels)
      - interior_pixels (pixels between start and end)
output_elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (value 0-9)
      - position (index)
transformation:
  action: fill
  target: white pixels within the segment defined by the two non-white pixels
  fill_color: the color of the non-white pixels defining the segment
constraints:
  - input contains exactly two non-white pixels
  - the two non-white pixels have the same color
relationships:
  - adjacency: pixels are arranged linearly
  - betweenness: identifying pixels located spatially between two other pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the positions (indices) of the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Let these indices be `index1` and `index2`, ensuring `index1 < index2`.
2.  Identify the color of these two non-white pixels (they will have the same color). Let this color be `fill_color`.
3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
4.  Iterate through the indices from `index1 + 1` up to (but not including) `index2`.
5.  For each index in this range, change the color of the pixel at that index in the output grid to `fill_color`.
6.  Return the modified grid as the output.
