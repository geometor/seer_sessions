task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  input_composition:
    - Contains predominantly white (0) pixels.
    - Contains exactly two non-white pixels.
    - The two non-white pixels always share the same color (C).
  output_composition:
    - Derived from the input row.
    - Contains a contiguous segment of color C.
    - Pixels outside this segment retain their original color (white).

transformation_details:
  actions:
    - Identify the non-white color (C) present in the input row.
    - Locate the start index (idx1) and end index (idx2) of the two pixels with color C. Assume idx1 < idx2.
    - Modify the input row: Set the color of all pixels from index idx1 to idx2 (inclusive) to C.
  relationship:
    - The output segment of color C spans the range originally defined by the two non-white pixels in the input.
