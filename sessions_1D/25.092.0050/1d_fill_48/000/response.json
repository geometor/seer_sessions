The width varies across examples but is consistent between the input and output of a single example.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (red=2, azure=8, orange=7).\n3.  **Key Objects:** The significant objects in the input are the two pixels that are *not* white. These two pixels always share the same non-white color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves \"filling\" the space between the two non-white pixels. All pixels (including the original non-white pixels and the white pixels between them) from the position of the first non-white pixel to the position of the second non-white pixel adopt the non-white color. Pixels outside this range remain unchanged (in these examples, they stay white).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Store these indices as `start_index` and `end_index`, ensuring `start_index` is the smaller index.\n3.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial output row.\n4.
