Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are single rows (1xN dimension). The width varies across examples but is consistent between the input and output of a single example.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (red=2, azure=8, orange=7).
3.  **Key Objects:** The significant objects in the input are the two pixels that are *not* white. These two pixels always share the same non-white color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves "filling" the space between the two non-white pixels. All pixels (including the original non-white pixels and the white pixels between them) from the position of the first non-white pixel to the position of the second non-white pixel adopt the non-white color. Pixels outside this range remain unchanged (in these examples, they stay white).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  input_composition:
    - Contains predominantly white (0) pixels.
    - Contains exactly two non-white pixels.
    - The two non-white pixels always share the same color (C).
  output_composition:
    - Derived from the input row.
    - Contains a contiguous segment of color C.
    - Pixels outside this segment retain their original color (white).

transformation_details:
  actions:
    - Identify the non-white color (C) present in the input row.
    - Locate the start index (idx1) and end index (idx2) of the two pixels with color C. Assume idx1 < idx2.
    - Modify the input row: Set the color of all pixels from index idx1 to idx2 (inclusive) to C.
  relationship:
    - The output segment of color C spans the range originally defined by the two non-white pixels in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input row.
2.  Iterate through the input row to find the non-white color (let's call it `marker_color`) and the indices of the two pixels that have this `marker_color`. Store these indices as `start_index` and `end_index`, ensuring `start_index` is the smaller index.
3.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial output row.
4.  Iterate through the output row from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
5.  For each position in this range, set the pixel color to `marker_color`.
6.  Return the modified output row.
