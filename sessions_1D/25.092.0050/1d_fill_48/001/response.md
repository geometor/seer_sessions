"""
Given a 1D input grid (a single row) containing mostly white (0) pixels and exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (C), the transformation fills the segment between these two non-white pixels (inclusive) with color C. Pixels outside this segment remain unchanged (white).

1. Identify the non-white color (marker_color) present in the input row.
2. Locate the start index (idx1) and end index (idx2) of the two pixels with marker_color. Assume idx1 < idx2.
3. Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial output row.
4. Iterate through the output row from index idx1 to index idx2 (inclusive).
5. For each position in this range, set the pixel color to marker_color.
6. Return the modified output row.
