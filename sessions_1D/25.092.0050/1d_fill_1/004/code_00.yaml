task_type: fill_segment_1d
input_features:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row grid)
  grid_size: Variable width (e.g., 1x24 shown)
  background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: marker_pair
      count: 1 (pair)
      definition: Exactly two pixels with the same non-white color.
      properties:
        color: Consistent non-white color (e.g., red, blue)
        indices: Two distinct column indices (pos1, pos2)
output_features:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row grid)
  grid_size: Same as input
  background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: filled_segment
      definition: A contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
      properties:
        color: Same as the input marker_pair color.
        start_index: min(pos1, pos2) from input marker_pair.
        end_index: max(pos1, pos2) from input marker_pair.
        content: All pixels from start_index to end_index (inclusive) have the marker color.
  unmodified_pixels: Pixels outside the filled_segment remain white (0).
transformation:
  action: Define segment and fill
  steps:
    1. Scan the input 1D grid to find all non-white pixels.
    2. Identify the two non-white pixels (markers) and their shared color (C).
    3. Determine the column indices of these two markers (idx1, idx2).
    4. Calculate the minimum index (min_idx) and maximum index (max_idx).
    5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
    6. Fill the output grid from column min_idx to max_idx (inclusive) with color C.
constraints:
  - Input must contain exactly two non-white pixels.
  - The two non-white pixels must have the same color.
  - Input is always a single row.
