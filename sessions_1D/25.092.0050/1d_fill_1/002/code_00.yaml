task_type: segment_filling_1d
input_grid:
  dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN, effectively 1D)
  height: 1
  width: variable (e.g., 24 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: marker_pixels
      count: 2
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., red(2), blue(1))
      color_consistency: True (both markers share the same color)
      arrangement: Located at different column indices within the single row.
      role: Define the start and end points of a segment.
output_grid:
  dimensionality: 2D (same shape as input, 1xN)
  background_color: white (0)
  content:
    - type: filled_segment
      location: Spans the columns from the minimum index to the maximum index (inclusive) of the input marker_pixels.
      color: Same color as the input marker_pixels.
    - type: background_pixels
      location: All columns outside the filled_segment.
      color: white (0)
transformation:
  action: fill_segment
  input_elements: marker_pixels (identifies color and indices)
  output_elements: filled_segment
  rule: Find the two non-white pixels in the input row. Determine their color (C) and their column indices (min_idx, max_idx). Create an output grid of the same size, initialized to white (0). Fill the cells from column min_idx to max_idx (inclusive) with color C.
invariants:
  - Grid height is always 1.
  - Grid width remains the same.
  - There are always exactly two non-white pixels in the input.
  - The two non-white pixels always have the same color.
  - Pixels outside the identified segment remain white (0).
