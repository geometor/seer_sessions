"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (represented as a single-row 2D list) by finding 
the two non-white pixels, which act as markers. It identifies the shared color 
of these markers and their column indices. An output grid of the same size is 
created, initially filled with white (0). The segment in the output grid 
between the minimum and maximum marker indices (inclusive) is then filled 
with the markers' color.
