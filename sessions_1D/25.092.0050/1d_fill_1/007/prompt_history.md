*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output are both 1D grids (represented as single rows).
    *   Each input grid contains exactly two non-white pixels. These two pixels always share the same color.
    *   The non-white pixels act as markers or endpoints.
    *   The output grid is formed by filling the segment between these two marker pixels (inclusive) with the color of the markers.
    *   All pixels outside the segment defined by the two markers remain white (0).

*   **Facts**:

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. There will be exactly two such pixels, and they will have the same color.
    2.  Determine the color (let's call it `C`) and the indices (positions) of these two non-white pixels (let's call them `index1` and `index2`, assuming `index1 < index2`).
    3.  Create a new grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
    4.  Fill the cells in the new grid from `index1` to `index2` (inclusive) with the color `C`.
    5.  The resulting grid is the output.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code aims to solve the task by identifying two marker pixels of the same color in a 1D input grid and filling the segment between them (inclusive) with that color in the output grid. The logic described in the natural language program and implemented in the code appears to correctly match the transformation shown in the three training examples.

However, the code fails execution on all training examples with the error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This specific NumPy error indicates that a boolean array is being used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if array_of_bools:`).

A review of the provided Python code (`transform` and `_find_marker_pixels` functions) does not reveal an obvious location where this error should occur based on the described logic and standard NumPy usage. Comparisons (`!=`) and conditional checks (`if len(...)`, `if value != color`, `if list:`) seem to operate on scalars or check list properties correctly.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Logic:** The core logic (find two same-colored markers, get their color C and indices i1, i2, fill output from min(i1, i2) to max(i1, i2) with C) perfectly matches the examples. We will proceed with this understanding.
2.  **Address Error:** The error likely stems from an implementation detail or execution environment issue rather than a flaw in the core transformation logic. Possible causes include:
    *   Unexpected data types being passed or generated (though the code attempts type casting and uses integer constants).
    *   An unforeseen interaction with NumPy's array handling in conditional statements, despite appearances.
    *   An issue in the testing harness providing the data or calling the function.
3.  **Refine Implementation (if possible):** Without the exact line number, it's hard to pinpoint the error. However, we can ensure all conditional checks are explicitly scalar where intended. The current code seems to do this already. The `except ValueError` block currently uses `pass`, which might hide issues during testing; changing this to re-raise the error could provide more specific feedback if the `ValueError` itself is the source of confusion (unlikely for this specific error message).
4.  **Maintain Core Description:** The YAML facts and Natural Language Program accurately describe the *intended* transformation based on the visual examples, and should be maintained as the target logic.

**Metrics**

*Observations from Metrics:*
*   Input and output grids are consistently 1x24.
*   Each input reliably contains exactly two non-white pixels.
*   These two pixels always share the same color.
*   The output correctly fills the span between these markers (inclusive) with their color.
*   The code fails consistently across all examples, suggesting the error is systematic within the code or its execution, not data-dependent among these examples.

  steps:
    1. Locate the two non-white pixels in the input row.
    2. Verify they have the same color (C) and record their indices (idx1, idx2).
    3. Determine the segment boundaries: min_idx = min(idx1, idx2), max_idx = max(idx1, idx2).
    4. Create an output row of the same size, initialized to white (0).
    5. Fill the output row from min_idx to max_idx (inclusive) with color C.
assumptions:
  - Input grid always contains exactly one row.
  - Input row always contains exactly two non-white pixels.
  - The two non-white pixels always have the same color.

1.  Accept the input grid, which consists of a single row.
2.  Scan the input row to find the column indices of all non-white (non-zero) pixels. There will be exactly two such indices; let them be `idx1` and `idx2`.
3.  Identify the color `C` of these two pixels (they will share the same color).
4.  Determine the start index `min_idx = min(idx1, idx2)` and the end index `max_idx = max(idx1, idx2)` of the segment defined by these markers.
5.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with the white color (0).
6.  In the output row, change the color of all pixels from index `min_idx` up to and including index `max_idx` to the marker color `C`.
7.  Return the modified output row as a single-row grid.
