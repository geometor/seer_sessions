*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output are both 1D grids (represented as single rows).
    *   Each input grid contains exactly two non-white pixels. These two pixels always share the same color.
    *   The non-white pixels act as markers or endpoints.
    *   The output grid is formed by filling the segment between these two marker pixels (inclusive) with the color of the markers.
    *   All pixels outside the segment defined by the two markers remain white (0).

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: fill_segment
    input_features:
      dimensionality: 1D
      background_color: white (0)
      marker_pixels:
        count: 2
        color_consistency: True (always the same non-white color)
        role: Define endpoints of a segment
    output_features:
      dimensionality: 1D
      background_color: white (0)
      filled_segment:
        location: Between the input marker pixels (inclusive)
        color: Same as the input marker pixels
      unmodified_pixels: Pixels outside the filled segment remain white (0)
    transformation:
      action: Fill
      target: The 1D segment between the two marker pixels
      fill_value: The color of the marker pixels
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. There will be exactly two such pixels, and they will have the same color.
    2.  Determine the color (let's call it `C`) and the indices (positions) of these two non-white pixels (let's call them `index1` and `index2`, assuming `index1 < index2`).
    3.  Create a new grid of the same size as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
    4.  Fill the cells in the new grid from `index1` to `index2` (inclusive) with the color `C`.
    5.  The resulting grid is the output.
