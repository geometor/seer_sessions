task_type: fill_1d_segment_between_markers
input_features:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single-row 2D grid)
  grid_size: Constant (1x24 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: marker_pair
      count: 1 per grid
      definition: Exactly two pixels with the same non-white color.
      properties:
        color: Any non-white color (consistent within the pair)
        indices: Two distinct column indices (e.g., idx1, idx2)
      role: Define the endpoints and color of the segment to be filled.
output_features:
  dimensionality: 1D (same as input)
  grid_size: Same as input
  background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: filled_segment
      definition: A contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      properties:
        color: Same as the input marker_pair color.
        start_index: min(idx1, idx2) from the input marker_pair.
        end_index: max(idx1, idx2) from the input marker_pair.
        length: (max_index - min_index) + 1
  unmodified_pixels: All pixels outside the filled_segment remain white (0).
transformation:
  action: identify_and_fill
  steps:
    1. Locate the two non-white pixels in the input row.
    2. Verify they have the same color (C) and record their indices (idx1, idx2).
    3. Determine the segment boundaries: min_idx = min(idx1, idx2), max_idx = max(idx1, idx2).
    4. Create an output row of the same size, initialized to white (0).
    5. Fill the output row from min_idx to max_idx (inclusive) with color C.
assumptions:
  - Input grid always contains exactly one row.
  - Input row always contains exactly two non-white pixels.
  - The two non-white pixels always have the same color.
