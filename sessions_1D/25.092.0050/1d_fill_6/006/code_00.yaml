task_description: Fill a segment within a 1D array defined by the first and last occurrences of a non-white color.
representation: 1D array (list) of integers (colors).
elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0 to 9 (0=white, 1-9=non-white).
      - position: Index within the 1D array.
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - defining_pixels: The non-white pixels present in the input array. Assumed to be of a single color type per input.
      - fill_color: The color of the defining_pixels.
      - start_index: The minimum index among the defining_pixels.
      - end_index: The maximum index among the defining_pixels.
input_characteristics:
  - structure: 1D array.
  - background_color: Predominantly white (0).
  - foreground_elements: Contains at least one non-white pixel. All non-white pixels share the same color.
transformation:
  - action: find_non_white_pixels
    description: Identify all pixels in the input array that are not white (color != 0).
  - action: check_for_non_white
    description: If no non-white pixels are found, return the input array unchanged.
  - action: determine_fill_properties
    description: If non-white pixels exist, determine their color (fill_color) and find the minimum (start_index) and maximum (end_index) of their indices.
  - action: create_output_buffer
    description: Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Modify the output array by setting the color of all pixels from start_index to end_index (inclusive) to the fill_color.
  - action: return_result
    description: Return the modified output array.
output_characteristics:
  - structure: 1D array of the same size as the input.
  - content: Contains a contiguous segment filled with the non-white color found in the input. This segment spans from the original first occurrence index to the original last occurrence index. Pixels outside this segment retain their original color from the input.
