task_description: Fill the segment between the first and last occurrence of a non-white color in a 1D array, preserving pixels outside the segment.
representation: 1D array (list) of integers (colors).
elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0 to 9. White (0) is the background.
      - position: Index within the 1D array.
  - type: colored_pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is not white (0).
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first colored_pixel in the input array.
      - end_index: The index of the last colored_pixel in the input array.
      - fill_color: The color of the colored_pixels (assumed to be unique in the input).
input_characteristics:
  - structure: 1D array.
  - background_color: White (0).
  - foreground_elements: Contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color. All other pixels are white.
transformation:
  - action: copy_input
    description: Create the output array as an exact copy of the input array.
  - action: find_colored_pixels
    description: Identify all pixels in the input array that are not white (0).
  - action: check_for_colored_pixels
    description: If no colored pixels are found, return the copied input array directly.
  - action: determine_fill_color
    description: Identify the color of the colored pixels (assuming it's unique). Store this as fill_color.
  - action: find_segment_boundaries
    description: Find the minimum index (start_index) and maximum index (end_index) among the positions of the colored pixels.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Iterate through the indices of the output array from start_index to end_index (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the pixel's color to fill_color.
output_characteristics:
  - structure: 1D array of the same size as the input.
  - content: The array segment from start_index to end_index (inclusive) is filled with fill_color. All pixels outside this segment retain their original color from the input array.
