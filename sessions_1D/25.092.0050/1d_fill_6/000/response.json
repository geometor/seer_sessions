Given the length (27), they could represent 1D arrays or flattened 2D grids (e.g., 3x9 or 9x3). The transformation logic seems consistent with a 1D array interpretation.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), gray (5), magenta (6), and green (3).\n3.  **Key Feature:** In each input, there is exactly one non-white color present, and it appears exactly twice. All other cells are white (0).\n4.  **Transformation:** The output seems to be formed by \"filling\" the segment of the array between the first and the last occurrence of the non-white color with that same color. The fill includes both the start and end positions identified in the input. Pixels outside this range remain unchanged (they are white in these examples).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
