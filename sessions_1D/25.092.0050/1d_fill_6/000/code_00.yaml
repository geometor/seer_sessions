task_description: Fill the segment between the first and last occurrence of a non-white color.
representation: 1D array of integers (colors).
elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0 to 9.
      - position: Index within the 1D array.
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first non-white pixel.
      - end_index: The index of the last non-white pixel.
      - fill_color: The color of the non-white pixels.
input_characteristics:
  - structure: 1D array.
  - background_color: White (0).
  - foreground_elements: Exactly two pixels of the same non-white color.
transformation:
  - action: identify_fill_color
    description: Find the unique non-white color in the input array.
  - action: find_indices
    description: Locate the first and last index of the fill_color.
  - action: create_output
    description: Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Iterate from the first index to the last index (inclusive). Set the color of each pixel in the output array within this range to the fill_color.
output_characteristics:
  - structure: 1D array of the same size as the input.
  - content: The array segment between the original start and end indices of the non-white color is filled with that color. Pixels outside this segment retain their original color (white).
