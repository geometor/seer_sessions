task_description: Fill the segment of a 1D array between the first and last occurrences of a non-white color with that color.
representation: 1D array of integers (colors).
elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0 to 9. White (0) is background.
      - position: Index within the 1D array.
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - identified_by: The two non-white pixels in the input.
      - start_index: The index of the first non-white pixel.
      - end_index: The index of the last non-white pixel.
      - fill_color: The color of the non-white pixels.
input_characteristics:
  - structure: 1D array.
  - size: Constant length (27 in examples).
  - background_color: White (0).
  - foreground_elements: Exactly two pixels of the same non-white color. All other pixels are white.
transformation:
  - action: identify_parameters
    description: Find the unique non-white color (`fill_color`) and the indices of its first (`start_index`) and last (`end_index`) occurrences in the input array.
  - action: create_output_buffer
    description: Initialize the output array as a direct copy of the input array.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Modify the output array by setting the color of all pixels from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) to the `fill_color`. Pixels outside this range remain unchanged from the input.
output_characteristics:
  - structure: 1D array of the same size as the input.
  - content: The array segment between the original `start_index` and `end_index` (inclusive) is uniformly filled with the `fill_color`. Pixels outside this segment retain their original color from the input (which is white in the examples).
edge_cases:
  - If the input contains no non-white pixels (all white), the output should be identical to the input. (Covered by logic if `indices` is empty).
