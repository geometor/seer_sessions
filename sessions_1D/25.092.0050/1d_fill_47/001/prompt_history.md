**Perception**

The input and output are 1D grids (or 1xN arrays) of pixels.
Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., green or azure), with the rest being white (0).
The output grid is generated by filling the segment between the two non-white pixels (inclusive) with that same non-white color.
Pixels outside this segment remain unchanged (white).
The size of the grid remains constant.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the segment between two identical non-white pixels with their color.
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1-dimensional array of pixels.
    properties:
      - size: The length of the array. Remains constant between input and output.
      - pixels: Each element in the array, representing a color.
  - element: non_white_pixel
    description: A pixel with a color other than white (0).
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., green, azure). In each input, there are exactly two such pixels, and they always share the same color.
      - index: The position of the pixel within the grid.
relationships:
  - relationship: bounding_segment
    description: The segment of the grid defined by the first and last occurrence of the non-white pixel color.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first non-white pixel.
      - end_index: The index of the last non-white pixel.
      - fill_color: The color of the non-white pixels found in the input.
actions:
  - action: fill
    description: Modify the grid by changing the color of pixels within a specified range.
    details:
      - Identify the non-white color present in the input grid.
      - Find the minimum and maximum indices of pixels with this non-white color.
      - In the output grid, set all pixels from the minimum index to the maximum index (inclusive) to this non-white color.
      - Pixels outside this range retain their original color from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid.
2.  Find the indices (positions) of all pixels having this non-white color.
3.  Determine the minimum index (`min_idx`) and the maximum index (`max_idx`) from these found indices.
4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
5.  Iterate through the indices from `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive).
6.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the identified non-white color.
7.  Return the modified grid as the output.
