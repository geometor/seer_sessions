    Draws a horizontal line between the two non-white pixels found in a single input row.

    The transformation rule is as follows:
    1. Identify the two non-white pixels in the input grid (which is always a single row).
    2. Note their color (which is the same for both) and their column indices.
    3. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with white (0).
    4. Determine the leftmost (minimum index) and rightmost (maximum index) positions of the two non-white pixels.
    5. Fill the segment of the output grid row from the leftmost index to the rightmost index (inclusive) with the identified non-white color.
    6. Return the resulting grid.
