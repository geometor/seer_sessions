Task: Draw a horizontal line between two points of the same color in a 1D grid.

Input_Characteristics:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 1xN (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - content: contains exactly two non-white pixels
  - non_white_pixel_property: the two non-white pixels always share the same color value

Output_Characteristics:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: same as input (1xN)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - content: contains a horizontal line segment connecting the positions of the input non-white pixels
  - line_color: same as the color of the non-white pixels in the input

Transformation:
  - action: identify_pixels
    target: non-white pixels in the input grid
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color
      - column_index (position)
  - action: determine_range
    start_index: column index of the first non-white pixel
    end_index: column index of the second non-white pixel
    color: color of the non-white pixels
  - action: fill_range
    target: output grid
    range: from start_index to end_index (inclusive)
    color: color determined in the previous step
  - action: copy_background
    source: input grid background pixels (white)
    target: output grid pixels outside the filled range

Relationships:
  - The color of the line in the output is determined by the color of the two non-white pixels in the input.
  - The start and end points of the line in the output are determined by the column indices of the two non-white pixels in the input.
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
