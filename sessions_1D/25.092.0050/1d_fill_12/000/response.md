Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input is always a single row (a 1xN grid).
This row contains mostly white pixels (value 0).
There are exactly two pixels in the input row that are not white.
These two non-white pixels always have the same color (value).
The output is also a single row of the same dimensions as the input.
In the output row, the pixels between the positions of the two non-white pixels from the input (inclusive) are filled with the same non-white color.
All other pixels in the output row are white (value 0).
The task essentially draws a horizontal line connecting the two non-white pixels found in the input.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Draw a horizontal line between two points of the same color in a 1D grid.

Input_Characteristics:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 1xN (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - content: contains exactly two non-white pixels
  - non_white_pixel_property: the two non-white pixels always share the same color value

Output_Characteristics:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: same as input (1xN)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - content: contains a horizontal line segment connecting the positions of the input non-white pixels
  - line_color: same as the color of the non-white pixels in the input

Transformation:
  - action: identify_pixels
    target: non-white pixels in the input grid
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color
      - column_index (position)
  - action: determine_range
    start_index: column index of the first non-white pixel
    end_index: column index of the second non-white pixel
    color: color of the non-white pixels
  - action: fill_range
    target: output grid
    range: from start_index to end_index (inclusive)
    color: color determined in the previous step
  - action: copy_background
    source: input grid background pixels (white)
    target: output grid pixels outside the filled range

Relationships:
  - The color of the line in the output is determined by the color of the two non-white pixels in the input.
  - The start and end points of the line in the output are determined by the column indices of the two non-white pixels in the input.
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid, which will be a single row.
2.  Iterate through the row to find the two pixels that are not white (value 0).
3.  Record the color (value) of these two non-white pixels (they will be the same).
4.  Record the column indices (positions) of these two non-white pixels. Let these be `index1` and `index2`.
5.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
6.  Determine the minimum index (`start_index = min(index1, index2)`) and the maximum index (`end_index = max(index1, index2)`).
7.  Fill the pixels in the output grid from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) with the non-white color identified in step 3.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
