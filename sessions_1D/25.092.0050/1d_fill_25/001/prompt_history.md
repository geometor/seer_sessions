**input:**

**Perception:**

The input is always a 1-dimensional array (a single row) of pixels. Each input array contains exactly two pixels of a non-white color (orange, magenta), with the remaining pixels being white (0). The output array is identical to the input array, except that all the white pixels located *between* the two non-white pixels have been changed to that same non-white color. The non-white pixels themselves and the white pixels outside the range defined by the two non-white pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_gap_1d
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  height: 1
  width: variable
objects:
  - type: background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
  - type: marker
    color_name: variable (orange, magenta in examples)
    color_value: non-zero
    count: 2 # Exactly two marker pixels exist in the input
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two marker pixels define a segment within the 1D grid.
actions:
  - name: find_markers
    input: input_grid
    output: color_of_markers, index1_of_marker, index2_of_marker
  - name: fill_segment
    input: input_grid, color_of_markers, index1_of_marker, index2_of_marker
    output: output_grid
    rule: Change the color of all pixels between index1 (exclusive) and index2 (exclusive) to the color_of_markers.
constraints:
  - The input grid always contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.
  - The transformation only affects pixels strictly between the two non-white marker pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the non-white color present in the input grid.
2.  Locate the indices (positions) of the two pixels that have this non-white color. Let the smaller index be `start_index` and the larger index be `end_index`.
3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
4.  Iterate through the indices of the output grid from `start_index + 1` up to, but not including, `end_index`.
5.  For each index in this range, set the pixel value in the output grid to the identified non-white color.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
