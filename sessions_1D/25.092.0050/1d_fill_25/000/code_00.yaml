task_type: fill_gap_1d
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  height: 1
  width: variable
objects:
  - type: background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
  - type: marker
    color_name: variable (orange, magenta in examples)
    color_value: non-zero
    count: 2 # Exactly two marker pixels exist in the input
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two marker pixels define a segment within the 1D grid.
actions:
  - name: find_markers
    input: input_grid
    output: color_of_markers, index1_of_marker, index2_of_marker
  - name: fill_segment
    input: input_grid, color_of_markers, index1_of_marker, index2_of_marker
    output: output_grid
    rule: Change the color of all pixels between index1 (exclusive) and index2 (exclusive) to the color_of_markers.
constraints:
  - The input grid always contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.
  - The transformation only affects pixels strictly between the two non-white marker pixels.
