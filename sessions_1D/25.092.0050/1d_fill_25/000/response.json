Each input array contains exactly two pixels of a non-white color (orange, magenta), with the remaining pixels being white (0). The output array is identical to the input array, except that all the white pixels located *between* the two non-white pixels have been changed to that same non-white color. The non-white pixels themselves and the white pixels outside the range defined by the two non-white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
