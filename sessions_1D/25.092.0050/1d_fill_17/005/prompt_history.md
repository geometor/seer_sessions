*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids).
    *   Each input row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., green, red, gray), separated by one or more white pixels. The rest of the row consists of white pixels.
    *   The output row is identical to the input row, except that the white pixels located *between* the two non-white pixels are changed to match the color of those non-white pixels.
    *   The non-white pixels act as boundary markers.
    *   The transformation fills the horizontal segment defined by these markers.

*   **Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The previous code failed on all training examples with the same error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous." This error typically occurs in Python when attempting to use a NumPy array in a boolean context (e.g., `if my_array:`). Although the provided code doesn't explicitly use NumPy, the testing environment likely uses NumPy arrays to represent the grids. The error suggests that the input `input_grid` was treated in a way that triggered this ambiguity, possibly during the validation or comparison phase within the testing harness, or if an intermediate step inadvertently created an array used in a boolean check.
    *   The core logic of identifying the two markers and filling the segment between them seems correct based on the examples. The primary issue likely lies in how the input/output data structures (lists vs. NumPy arrays) are handled, potentially at the interface between the `transform` function and the testing environment, or within the `find_non_white_pixels` validation logic if it encountered unexpected array comparisons.
    *   **Strategy:**
        1.  Re-confirm the input/output structure. The examples show 1D sequences. Assume the function will receive a structure representing a single row (e.g., a Python list or a 1D NumPy array) and should return the same structure type.
        2.  Simplify the `transform` function to directly operate on this 1D structure, removing the list-of-lists handling (`input_grid[0]`, `[output_row]`).
        3.  Review the `find_non_white_pixels` function for any operations that might be problematic with NumPy arrays if the input list gets converted (e.g., direct comparison `==` might yield boolean arrays). Although standard list operations were used, it's worth double-checking the error's origin. Ensure error handling returns consistent types.
        4.  Update the documentation (YAML, Natural Language Program) to clearly state the 1D input/output assumption.
