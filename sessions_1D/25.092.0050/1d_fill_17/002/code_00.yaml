task_type: fill_segment_1d
grid_representation: 2D_grid_single_row # Input is technically 2D but represents a 1D sequence.
input_grid_properties:
  height: 1
  width: variable (e.g., 16 in examples)
output_grid_properties:
  height: 1
  width: Same as input width
objects:
  - object: marker
    description: Two pixels of the same non-white color within the single row of the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Identical non-white color (value > 0).
      count: 2
      location: Within the first (and only) row.
      role: Define the start and end points (boundaries) of a segment to be filled.
  - object: segment
    description: The sequence of pixels located strictly between the two marker pixels within the row.
    properties_input:
      color: White (value = 0).
    properties_output:
      color: Same as the marker pixels.
  - object: background
    description: White pixels outside the segment defined by the markers, including those before the first marker and after the second marker.
    properties:
      color: White (value = 0).
      unchanged: True
actions:
  - action: extract_row
    description: Get the first (and only) row from the input grid.
  - action: identify_markers
    description: Find the color and column indices of the two non-white pixels within the extracted row.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Create a copy of the extracted row. Change the color of the pixels between the identified marker column indices (exclusive start, exclusive end) in the copied row to the marker color.
  - action: reconstruct_grid
    description: Place the modified row back into a 2D grid structure (list containing the single modified row).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The segment pixels lie horizontally between the marker pixels within the row.
  - type: color_propagation
    description: The segment pixels adopt the color of the marker pixels in the output row.
  - type: format_preservation
    description: The output grid retains the 1xN shape of the input grid.
