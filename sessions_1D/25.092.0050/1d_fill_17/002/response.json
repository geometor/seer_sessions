            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D list (e.g., `[0, 0, 3, ...]`), while the ARC framework likely provides inputs as 2D grids (list of lists), even if they visually represent a single row (e.g., `[[0, 0, 3, ...]]`). The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" confirms this, as attempting a boolean comparison like `list != 0` can cause this issue if the list is treated like an array element-wise comparison.\n\nThe core logic of identifying the two non-white markers and filling the segment between them appears correct based on the examples. The strategy is to modify the code to handle the 2D grid input format by extracting the single row, applying the existing logic to that row, and then returning the result in the correct 2D grid format.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nLet's verify the input structure and the logic's behavior with the assumed correct structure.\n\n"

This suggests the error reported previously (`The truth value of an array...`) might stem from the specific testing environment used, perhaps involving implicit NumPy array conversion or a different way of handling comparisons.\n\nHowever, the simulation *did* confirm:\n1.  The input is indeed a list of lists (e.g., `[[...]]`).\n2.  The core logic of finding markers and filling the segment works correctly *if* applied to the extracted single row (`input_grid[0]`).\n3.  The original `transform_v1` function, when run in this `tool_code` environment, surprisingly did *not* error out, but it would produce incorrect results because it tries to modify the outer list structure instead of the inner row pixels. The loop `for i in range(start_fill_index, end_fill_index): output_grid_row[i] = marker_color` would try to access `output_grid_row[1]`, `output_grid_row[2]`, etc., which don't exist in a `[[...]]` structure, leading to an `IndexError` if the indices went beyond 0, or incorrect modification if the indices happened to be 0.\n\nTherefore, the plan remains valid: adapt the `transform` function to explicitly handle the `[[...]]` structure by extracting the row, processing it, and placing the modified row back into a list.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
