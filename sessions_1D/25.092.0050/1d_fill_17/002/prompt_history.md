*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids).
    *   Each input row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., green, red, gray), separated by one or more white pixels. The rest of the row consists of white pixels.
    *   The output row is identical to the input row, except that the white pixels located *between* the two non-white pixels are changed to match the color of those non-white pixels.
    *   The non-white pixels act as boundary markers.
    *   The transformation fills the horizontal segment defined by these markers.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the non-white color present in the input row.
    2.  Find the index (position) of the first pixel with this non-white color.
    3.  Find the index (position) of the second (last) pixel with this non-white color.
    4.  Create the output row by copying the input row.
    5.  For every position between the first index (exclusive) and the second index (exclusive), change the pixel color in the output row to the identified non-white color.
    6.  Return the modified output row.
