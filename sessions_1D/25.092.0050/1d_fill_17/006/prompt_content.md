"""
Transforms a single-row input grid by identifying two 'marker' pixels of the 
same non-white color. It then fills the segment of pixels strictly between 
these two markers with the marker color. All other pixels remain unchanged. 
The input is assumed to be a grid containing exactly one row, and this row 
contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, with all other pixels 
being white (0).
