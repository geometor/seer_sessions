task_type: fill_horizontal_segment_1d
grid_representation: single_row_array # Input can be list[list[int]] or numpy.ndarray, processing assumes list[list[int]]
grid_dimensions:
  rows: 1
  columns: variable (N) # Examples show N=16
objects:
  - object: marker
    description: Two pixels of the same non-white color in the input row.
    count: 2
    properties:
      color: Identical non-white color (value > 0).
      position: Defines the start and end points (indices) of a segment. Must be the only non-white pixels present.
  - object: segment
    description: The sequence of pixels located strictly between the two marker pixels.
    properties_input:
      color: White (value = 0).
    properties_output:
      color: Same non-white color as the marker pixels.
  - object: background
    description: Pixels outside the segment, including the markers themselves.
    properties:
      color: Original color (white=0, or marker color for markers).
      unchanged: True
actions:
  - action: standardize_input
    description: Convert the input grid (potentially NumPy array) to a list of lists format.
  - action: identify_markers
    description: Find the color and the column indices of the two identical non-white pixels in the single row. Verify they are the only non-white pixels.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Modify a copy of the input row. Change the color of the pixels strictly between the identified marker indices to the marker color.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The segment pixels lie horizontally between the marker pixels (index_marker1 < index_segment < index_marker2).
  - type: color_propagation
    description: The segment pixels adopt the color of the marker pixels in the output.
assumptions:
  - Input grid always contains exactly one row.
  - Input row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color.
  - All other pixels in the input row are white (0).
