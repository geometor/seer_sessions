*   **Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The previous code failed on all training examples with the same error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous." This error typically occurs in Python when attempting to use a NumPy array in a boolean context (e.g., `if my_array:`). Although the provided code doesn't explicitly use NumPy, the testing environment likely uses NumPy arrays to represent the grids. The error suggests that the input `input_grid` was treated in a way that triggered this ambiguity, possibly during the validation or comparison phase within the testing harness, or if an intermediate step inadvertently created an array used in a boolean check.
    *   The core logic of identifying the two markers and filling the segment between them seems correct based on the examples. The primary issue likely lies in how the input/output data structures (lists vs. NumPy arrays) are handled, potentially at the interface between the `transform` function and the testing environment, or within the `find_non_white_pixels` validation logic if it encountered unexpected array comparisons.
    *   **Strategy:**
        1.  Re-confirm the input/output structure. The examples show 1D sequences. Assume the function will receive a structure representing a single row (e.g., a Python list or a 1D NumPy array) and should return the same structure type.
        2.  Simplify the `transform` function to directly operate on this 1D structure, removing the list-of-lists handling (`input_grid[0]`, `[output_row]`).
        3.  Review the `find_non_white_pixels` function for any operations that might be problematic with NumPy arrays if the input list gets converted (e.g., direct comparison `==` might yield boolean arrays). Although standard list operations were used, it's worth double-checking the error's origin. Ensure error handling returns consistent types.
        4.  Update the documentation (YAML, Natural Language Program) to clearly state the 1D input/output assumption.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a single 1D array (list) of pixel values.
    2.  Identify the non-white color (C) present in the input array.
    3.  Find the index (position) of the first occurrence of color C (let this be `index1`).
    4.  Find the index (position) of the second (last) occurrence of color C (let this be `index2`). Ensure `index1 < index2`.
    5.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output array.
    6.  Iterate through the indices `i` from `index1 + 1` up to (but not including) `index2`.
    7.  For each index `i` in this range, set the value of the output array at index `i` to the color C.
    8.  Return the modified output array.
