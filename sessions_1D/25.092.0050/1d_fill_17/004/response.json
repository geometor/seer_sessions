            "text": "*   **Assessment and Strategy:**\n    *   The previous code failed on all training examples with the same error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.\" This error typically occurs in Python when attempting to use a NumPy array in a boolean context (e.g., `if my_array:`). Although the provided code doesn't explicitly use NumPy, the testing environment likely uses NumPy arrays to represent the grids. The error suggests that the input `input_grid` was treated in a way that triggered this ambiguity, possibly during the validation or comparison phase within the testing harness, or if an intermediate step inadvertently created an array used in a boolean check.\n    *   The core logic of identifying the two markers and filling the segment between them seems correct based on the examples. The primary issue likely lies in how the input/output data structures (lists vs. NumPy arrays) are handled, potentially at the interface between the `transform` function and the testing environment, or within the `find_non_white_pixels` validation logic if it encountered unexpected array comparisons.\n    *   **Strategy:**\n        1.  Re-confirm the input/output structure. The examples show 1D sequences. Assume the function will receive a structure representing a single row (e.g., a Python list or a 1D NumPy array) and should return the same structure type.\n        2.  Simplify the `transform` function to directly operate on this 1D structure, removing the list-of-lists handling (`input_grid[0]`, `[output_row]`).\n        3.  Review the `find_non_white_pixels` function for any operations that might be problematic with NumPy arrays if the input list gets converted (e.g., direct comparison `==` might yield boolean arrays). Although standard list operations were used, it's worth double-checking the error's origin. Ensure error handling returns consistent types.\n        4.  Update the documentation (YAML, Natural Language Program) to clearly state the 1D input/output assumption.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n\n    *   **Example 1 (train_1):**\n        *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]` (1x16)\n        *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]` (1x16)\n        *   Marker Color: 3 (green)\n        *   Marker Indices: 3, 13\n        *   Segment to fill: Indices 4 to 12 (inclusive)\n        *   Result: Error (Ambiguous truth value)\n\n    *   **Example 2 (train_2):**\n        *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]` (1x16)\n        *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]` (1x16)\n        *   Marker Color: 2 (red)\n        *   Marker Indices: 3, 13\n        *   Segment to fill: Indices 4 to 12 (inclusive)\n        *   Result: Error (Ambiguous truth value)\n\n    *   **Example 3 (train_3):**\n        *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (1x16)\n        *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (1x16)\n        *   Marker Color: 5 (gray)\n        *   Marker Indices: 5, 10\n        *   Segment to fill: Indices 6 to 9 (inclusive)\n        *   Result: Error (Ambiguous truth value)\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
