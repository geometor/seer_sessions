*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids).
    *   Each input row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., green, red, gray), separated by one or more white pixels. The rest of the row consists of white pixels.
    *   The output row is identical to the input row, except that the white pixels located *between* the two non-white pixels are changed to match the color of those non-white pixels.
    *   The non-white pixels act as boundary markers.
    *   The transformation fills the horizontal segment defined by these markers.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous code failed due to a `ValueError` related to evaluating the truthiness of a NumPy array in a boolean context (e.g., `if not array:`). This strongly suggests that the test environment passes input grids as NumPy arrays, while the code's initial validation block assumed Python lists. The core transformation logic (identifying two markers of the same color and filling the segment between them) appears correct based on the examples, but the input handling needs adjustment.

**Strategy:**
The primary strategy is to make the `transform` function robust to the input type. This will be achieved by converting the input grid (whether it's a list of lists or a NumPy array) into a standard Python `list[list[int]]` format at the beginning of the function. The rest of the logic, which correctly implements the fill operation, can then proceed assuming this standard format.

## Metrics

Based on the analysis of the training examples:

*   **Common Input Characteristics:**
    *   Grid Dimensions: All input grids are 1 row high (1xN). The width (N) is 16 in all examples.
    *   Grid Content: Each input grid contains exactly one row.
    *   Pixel Colors: Contain predominantly white (0) pixels.
    *   Markers: Exactly two pixels share the same non-white color (Green=3, Red=2, Gray=5). All other pixels are white.
    *   Marker Separation: The two non-white markers are separated by one or more white pixels.

*   **Common Output Characteristics:**
    *   Grid Dimensions: Same as the input (1xN).
    *   Pixel Colors: The pixels *between* the original non-white markers are changed to the marker color.
    *   Unchanged Pixels: The marker pixels themselves, and all pixels outside the segment defined by the markers, remain unchanged.

*   **Transformation:**
    *   Type: Horizontal segment filling.
    *   Trigger: Presence of two identical non-white pixels in the single row.
    *   Action: Identify the indices `idx1` and `idx2` of the two markers (`idx1 < idx2`). Change the color of all pixels at indices `i` where `idx1 < i < idx2` to the marker color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which might be a list of lists or a NumPy array, representing a single row of pixels.
2.  Convert the input grid into a standard Python list of lists format. Let the single row be `input_row`.
3.  Create a copy of `input_row` called `output_row`.
4.  Initialize `marker_color` to `None` and `marker_indices` to an empty list.
5.  Iterate through `input_row` with index `idx` and pixel color `color`:
    a.  If `color` is not white (0):
        i.  If `marker_color` is `None` (this is the first non-white pixel found), set `marker_color` to `color` and add `idx` to `marker_indices`.
        ii. Else if `color` matches `marker_color` (this is a subsequent pixel of the same color), add `idx` to `marker_indices`.
        iii. Else (found a non-white pixel of a *different* color), stop processing and return the original `input_row` wrapped in a list (as the input format is invalid according to the pattern).
6.  After iterating, check if exactly two `marker_indices` were found.
7.  If exactly two indices (`idx1`, `idx2` with `idx1 < idx2`) were found:
    a.  Iterate through the indices `i` from `idx1 + 1` up to (but not including) `idx2`.
    b.  Set the pixel at index `i` in `output_row` to `marker_color`.
8.  Return the `output_row` wrapped in a list (to maintain the grid structure `[[...]]`). If the marker conditions (exactly two of the same non-white color, no other non-white colors) were not met at steps 5.iii or 6, the unchanged copy `output_row` (identical to `input_row`) is returned, wrapped in a list.
