*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids).
    *   Each input row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., green, red, gray), separated by one or more white pixels. The rest of the row consists of white pixels.
    *   The output row is identical to the input row, except that the white pixels located *between* the two non-white pixels are changed to match the color of those non-white pixels.
    *   The non-white pixels act as boundary markers.
    *   The transformation fills the horizontal segment defined by these markers.

## Example 3:

**General Assessment**

The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D list (e.g., `[0, 0, 3, ...]`), while the ARC framework likely provides inputs as 2D grids (list of lists), even if they visually represent a single row (e.g., `[[0, 0, 3, ...]]`). The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms this, as attempting a boolean comparison like `list != 0` can cause this issue if the list is treated like an array element-wise comparison.

The core logic of identifying the two non-white markers and filling the segment between them appears correct based on the examples. The strategy is to modify the code to handle the 2D grid input format by extracting the single row, applying the existing logic to that row, and then returning the result in the correct 2D grid format.

**Metrics and Verification**

Let's verify the input structure and the logic's behavior with the assumed correct structure.

**Revised Assessment based on Metrics:**

The `tool_code` execution did *not* reproduce the original error. This suggests the error reported previously (`The truth value of an array...`) might stem from the specific testing environment used, perhaps involving implicit NumPy array conversion or a different way of handling comparisons.

However, the simulation *did* confirm:
1.  The input is indeed a list of lists (e.g., `[[...]]`).
2.  The core logic of finding markers and filling the segment works correctly *if* applied to the extracted single row (`input_grid[0]`).
3.  The original `transform_v1` function, when run in this `tool_code` environment, surprisingly did *not* error out, but it would produce incorrect results because it tries to modify the outer list structure instead of the inner row pixels. The loop `for i in range(start_fill_index, end_fill_index): output_grid_row[i] = marker_color` would try to access `output_grid_row[1]`, `output_grid_row[2]`, etc., which don't exist in a `[[...]]` structure, leading to an `IndexError` if the indices went beyond 0, or incorrect modification if the indices happened to be 0.

Therefore, the plan remains valid: adapt the `transform` function to explicitly handle the `[[...]]` structure by extracting the row, processing it, and placing the modified row back into a list.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to have exactly one row.
2.  Extract this single row for processing.
3.  Identify the non-white color present in the extracted row. There will be exactly two pixels of this color.
4.  Find the column index (position) of the first pixel (leftmost) with this non-white color in the row.
5.  Find the column index (position) of the second pixel (rightmost) with this non-white color in the row.
6.  Create a new row as a copy of the extracted input row.
7.  Iterate through the column indices starting from the index *after* the first marker up to (but *not including*) the index of the second marker.
8.  For each index in this range, set the color of the pixel in the new row to the identified non-white marker color.
9.  Construct the output grid by placing the modified new row inside a list (to maintain the 2D grid structure `[[...]]`).
10. Return the output grid.
