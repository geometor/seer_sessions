**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a single row (1D grid) input into a single row output of the same width. Each input row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, with all other pixels being white (0). The output row is generated by filling the segment between (and including) the two non-white pixels from the input with that same non-white color. All pixels outside this segment remain white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_properties:
  - contains exactly one non-white color
  - contains exactly two pixels of the non-white color
  - remaining pixels are white (0)
output_properties:
  - same width as the input row
  - contains a single contiguous segment of the non-white color found in the input
  - segment boundaries correspond to the positions of the non-white pixels in the input
  - pixels outside the segment are white (0)
transformation:
  - identify the non-white color (C) in the input row
  - find the indices (positions) of the two pixels with color C in the input row
  - determine the minimum index (min_idx) and maximum index (max_idx) of these two positions
  - create an output row of the same width as the input, initially all white (0)
  - fill the pixels in the output row from min_idx to max_idx (inclusive) with color C
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input row.
2.  Identify the non-white color present in the input row. Call this color `C`.
3.  Find the column indices (positions) of the two pixels that have the color `C`.
4.  Determine the leftmost index (`start_index`) and the rightmost index (`end_index`) among these two positions.
5.  Create a new output row with the same width as the input row, initially filled entirely with the white color (0).
6.  For each position from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) in the output row, set the pixel color to `C`.
7.  Return the modified output row.
