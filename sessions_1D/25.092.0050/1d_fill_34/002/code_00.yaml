task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN)
input_properties:
  - grid shape is 1 row by N columns (N varies)
  - contains exactly one non-white color (C)
  - contains exactly two pixels of color C within the single row
  - all other pixels are white (0)
objects:
  - input grid (1xN)
  - output grid (1xN)
  - two boundary pixels (color C) in the input row
  - the segment between boundary pixels in the output row (color C)
actions:
  - identify the non-white color (C) from the input row
  - locate the column indices of the two pixels with color C
  - determine the minimum (start_col) and maximum (end_col) of these indices
  - create an output grid of the same size as the input, initialized to white (0)
  - fill the segment in the output row from start_col to end_col (inclusive) with color C
