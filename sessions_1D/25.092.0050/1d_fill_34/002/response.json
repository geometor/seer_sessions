            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input `input_grid` could be directly converted to a 1D list representing the row using `list(input_grid)`. In ARC tasks, inputs are typically NumPy arrays, even for single rows (represented as 1xN arrays). Attempting `list()` on a 1xN NumPy array results in a list containing one element: the NumPy row array itself. Subsequent comparisons like `pixel_color != 0` then compare a NumPy array to a scalar `0`, leading to the \"ambiguous truth value\" error.\n\nThe strategy is to correctly access the single row from the 2D input NumPy array before processing it. The core logic of finding the non-white color, its indices, and filling the output segment seems correct based on the examples and should be preserved, but applied to the properly extracted row.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's simulate the input handling that likely caused the error:\n"
