task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_properties:
  - contains exactly one non-white color
  - contains exactly two pixels of the non-white color
  - remaining pixels are white (0)
output_properties:
  - same width as the input row
  - contains a single contiguous segment of the non-white color found in the input
  - segment boundaries correspond to the positions of the non-white pixels in the input
  - pixels outside the segment are white (0)
transformation:
  - identify the non-white color (C) in the input row
  - find the indices (positions) of the two pixels with color C in the input row
  - determine the minimum index (min_idx) and maximum index (max_idx) of these two positions
  - create an output row of the same width as the input, initially all white (0)
  - fill the pixels in the output row from min_idx to max_idx (inclusive) with color C
