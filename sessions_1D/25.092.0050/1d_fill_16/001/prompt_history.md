## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1xN grids (row vectors). The width (N) is 24 in all provided examples.
2.  **Input Content:** Each input grid contains mostly white (0) pixels and exactly two non-white pixels.
3.  **Non-White Pixels:** In each example, the two non-white pixels have the same color (magenta (6) in example 1, orange (7) in example 2, azure (8) in example 3).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the segment of the row that lies between and includes the two non-white pixels.
5.  **Output Content:** The output grid fills this identified segment entirely with the color of the two non-white pixels found in the input. All pixels outside this segment remain white (0).
6.  **Consistency:** The grid dimensions remain unchanged between input and output. The color used for filling is determined by the color of the pair of pixels in the input.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: boundary_pixels
    count: 2
    properties:
      - type: non-white pixel
      - color: identical for both pixels (variable across examples: magenta, orange, azure)
      - location: distinct indices within the row
    relationship: Define the start and end points of a segment.
action:
  - name: identify_segment
    inputs: boundary_pixels
    outputs: segment (range of indices)
    description: Determine the range of indices from the first boundary pixel to the second boundary pixel, inclusive.
  - name: fill_segment
    inputs:
      - segment
      - color (from boundary_pixels)
    outputs: modified grid
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the identified segment to the color of the boundary pixels.
result:
  - A contiguous block of a single non-white color, bounded by white pixels (or grid edges if the segment reaches them).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input grid (a 1xN row).
2.  Identify the locations (indices) and color of all non-white pixels.
3.  Verify that there are exactly two non-white pixels and that they share the same color. Let this color be `C` and their indices be `idx1` and `idx2`, assuming `idx1 < idx2`.
4.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
5.  Fill the segment of the output grid from index `idx1` to `idx2` (inclusive) with the color `C`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
