task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: boundary_pixels
    count: 2
    properties:
      - type: non-white pixel
      - color: identical for both pixels (variable across examples: magenta, orange, azure)
      - location: distinct indices within the row
    relationship: Define the start and end points of a segment.
action:
  - name: identify_segment
    inputs: boundary_pixels
    outputs: segment (range of indices)
    description: Determine the range of indices from the first boundary pixel to the second boundary pixel, inclusive.
  - name: fill_segment
    inputs:
      - segment
      - color (from boundary_pixels)
    outputs: modified grid
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the identified segment to the color of the boundary pixels.
result:
  - A contiguous block of a single non-white color, bounded by white pixels (or grid edges if the segment reaches them).
