The width (N) is 24 in all provided examples.\n2.  **Input Content:** Each input grid contains mostly white (0) pixels and exactly two non-white pixels.\n3.  **Non-White Pixels:** In each example, the two non-white pixels have the same color (magenta (6) in example 1, orange (7) in example 2, azure (8) in example 3).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the segment of the row that lies between and includes the two non-white pixels.\n5.  **Output Content:** The output grid fills this identified segment entirely with the color of the two non-white pixels found in the input. All pixels outside this segment remain white (0).\n6.  **Consistency:** The grid dimensions remain unchanged between input and output. The color used for filling is determined by the color of the pair of pixels in the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
