task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: row
    structure: 1D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      - length
      - contains_pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (index within the row)
objects_in_input:
  - description: A single row containing pixels.
  - properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - marker_pixels: Exactly two pixels of the same non-white color.
relationships:
  - description: The two non-white pixels define the start and end points of a segment.
    properties:
      - start_index: index of the leftmost non-white pixel
      - end_index: index of the rightmost non-white pixel
      - fill_color: the color of the non-white marker pixels
action:
  - type: fill_segment
    description: Creates the output row by filling a segment defined by the marker pixels.
    steps:
      - Identify the two non-white pixels in the input row.
      - Determine their color (fill_color).
      - Determine the minimum index (start_index) and maximum index (end_index) of these two pixels.
      - Create an output row of the same length as the input, initially filled with white (0).
      - Set the pixels in the output row from start_index to end_index (inclusive) to fill_color.
output_object:
  - description: A single row where the segment between the input marker pixels is filled with their color, and the rest is white.
