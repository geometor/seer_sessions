Identify the two non-white pixels in the input row. Determine their color (C) and their column indices (index1, index2). Find the minimum (start_index) and maximum (end_index) of these indices. Create a copy of the input row. Fill the segment of the copied row from start_index to end_index (inclusive) with the color C.
