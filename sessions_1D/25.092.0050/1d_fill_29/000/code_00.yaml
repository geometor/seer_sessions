task_type: fill_segment
components:
  - role: background
    element_type: pixel
    property:
      color: white (0)
  - role: marker
    element_type: pixel
    count: 2
    property:
      color: non-white (any color from 1-9)
      constraint: both markers have the same color in a given input
  - role: segment
    element_type: contiguous_pixels
    definition: the pixels located inclusively between the two marker pixels
    initial_state: may contain white pixels
    final_state: all pixels within the segment adopt the color of the marker pixels
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 (single row)
  size: constant between input and output
transformation:
  operation: fill
  target: the segment defined by the two marker pixels
  fill_color: the color of the marker pixels
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The transformation depends on the relative positions (indices) of the two marker pixels.
