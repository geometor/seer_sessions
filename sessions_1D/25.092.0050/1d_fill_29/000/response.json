These two non-white pixels always share the same color.\nThe output is also a single row of the same dimensions as the input.\nThe output row retains the two original non-white pixels from the input.\nThe key transformation is that all the white pixels located *between* the two non-white pixels in the input are changed to the color of those non-white pixels in the output.\nPixels outside the range defined by the two non-white pixels remain white.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
