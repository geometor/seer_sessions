Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

Each task example consists of a single row (a 1D grid). The input row contains mostly white (0) pixels and exactly two pixels of the same non-white color. The output row modifies the input by filling the segment *between* these two non-white pixels (inclusive) with that same non-white color. The pixels outside this segment remain white. The specific non-white color changes between examples (red, green, azure), but the filling logic remains consistent.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
input_characteristics:
  - Contains predominantly white (0) pixels.
  - Contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (C).
output_characteristics:
  - Same dimensions as the input.
  - Pixels between the original non-white pixels (inclusive) are filled with color C.
  - Pixels outside this segment retain their original color (white).
transformation_rule:
  - Identify the non-white color (C) present in the input.
  - Find the indices (min_index, max_index) of the two pixels with color C.
  - Fill all pixels from min_index to max_index (inclusive) in the output with color C.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the non-white color present in the input row; let this color be `C`.
2.  Find the index of the first occurrence (`start_index`) and the last occurrence (`end_index`) of color `C` in the input row.
3.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
4.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
5.  For each index in this range, set the color of the pixel at that index in the output row to `C`.
6.  Return the modified row as the output.
