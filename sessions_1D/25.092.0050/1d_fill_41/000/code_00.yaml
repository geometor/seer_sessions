task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
input_characteristics:
  - Contains predominantly white (0) pixels.
  - Contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (C).
output_characteristics:
  - Same dimensions as the input.
  - Pixels between the original non-white pixels (inclusive) are filled with color C.
  - Pixels outside this segment retain their original color (white).
transformation_rule:
  - Identify the non-white color (C) present in the input.
  - Find the indices (min_index, max_index) of the two pixels with color C.
  - Fill all pixels from min_index to max_index (inclusive) in the output with color C.
