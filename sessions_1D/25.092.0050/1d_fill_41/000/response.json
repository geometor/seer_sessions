The input row contains mostly white (0) pixels and exactly two pixels of the same non-white color. The output row modifies the input by filling the segment *between* these two non-white pixels (inclusive) with that same non-white color. The pixels outside this segment remain white. The specific non-white color changes between examples (red, green, azure), but the filling logic remains consistent.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
