task_description: Fill the segment between two identical non-white pixels in a row.

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 1-dimensional array (row) of pixels.
    properties:
      - height: 1
      - width: variable (consistent between input/output pair)
      - pixels: cells with integer color values (0-9)

  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: A pixel with a color value other than 0 (white).
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-zero color value (e.g., 1, 2, 6).
      - position: The index within the grid row.
    relationships:
      - In the input grid, there are exactly two non_white_pixels.
      - These two non_white_pixels always share the same color value.

  - object: segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels within the grid row.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first non_white_pixel.
      - end_index: The index of the second non_white_pixel.
      - fill_color: The color of the non_white_pixels.

actions:
  - action: find_markers
    description: Identify the two non-white pixels in the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - color: The color of the non-white pixels.
      - index1: The position (index) of the first non-white pixel.
      - index2: The position (index) of the second non-white pixel.

  - action: fill_segment
    description: Create the output grid by filling the segment between the identified markers.
    inputs:
      - input_grid_dimensions
      - color: The fill color (from find_markers).
      - start_index: The index of the first marker (from find_markers).
      - end_index: The index of the second marker (from find_markers).
    outputs:
      - output_grid: A new grid where pixels from start_index to end_index (inclusive) are set to 'color', and all other pixels are white (0).

example_invariants:
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - There are always exactly two non-white pixels in the input.
  - The two non-white pixels in the input always have the same color.
  - The output contains a single contiguous segment of non-white color.
