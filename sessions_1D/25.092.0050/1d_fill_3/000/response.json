The length of the row remains consistent between input and output in all examples (length 31).\n2.  **Key Features in Input**: Each input row contains exactly two non-white pixels. These two pixels are always the same color (red in example 1, magenta in example 2, blue in example 3). All other pixels in the input are white (color 0).\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves the segment of the row *between* the two non-white pixels found in the input.\n4.  **Output Generation**: The output row is generated by taking the input row and filling all the pixels from the position of the *first* non-white pixel to the position of the *second* non-white pixel (inclusive) with the color of those two non-white pixels. Pixels outside this range remain white.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
