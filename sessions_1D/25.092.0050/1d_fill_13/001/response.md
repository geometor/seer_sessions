"""
Fill the horizontal segment between two identical non-white pixels in a single row input grid.
The input grid is always a single row (1xN). It contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (C) and the rest are the background color (white, 0).
The transformation identifies the color C and the minimum (min_idx) and maximum (max_idx) indices where it appears.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. All pixels from min_idx to max_idx (inclusive) are set to color C, while the rest remain the background color.
