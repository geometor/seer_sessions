They contain predominantly the background color (white, 0) and exactly two pixels of another, identical color (e.g., orange (7) in the first two examples, azure (8) in the third).\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They also contain mostly the background color (white, 0). However, instead of two isolated pixels of the non-white color, there is a continuous horizontal segment of that same non-white color.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to identify the two pixels of the non-white color in the input row. It then fills the gap between these two pixels (inclusive) with that same non-white color in the output row. The positions outside this filled segment remain the background color (white). The color used for filling is determined by the color of the two initial non-white pixels.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
