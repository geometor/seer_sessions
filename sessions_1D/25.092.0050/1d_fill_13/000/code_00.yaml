task_description: Fill the gap between two identical non-white pixels in a single row.
grid_properties:
  - dimension: All grids are 1xN (single row).
  - background_color: white (0).
objects:
  - type: pixel_pair
    description: Two pixels of the same non-white color within the input row.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (e.g., orange, azure), but is consistent within a pair.
      - count: Always 2 in the input.
      - position: Define the start and end points of the transformation range.
relationships:
  - type: positional_boundary
    description: The indices of the two non-white pixels mark the minimum and maximum extent of the region to be filled.
actions:
  - name: identify_color_and_indices
    description: Find the non-white color (C) present and determine the minimum (min_idx) and maximum (max_idx) indices where it appears in the input row.
  - name: fill_segment
    description: Create an output row of the same size, initially filled with the background color (white). Then, set all pixels from min_idx to max_idx (inclusive) to color C.
result:
  - description: A single row where the segment between the original positions of the two non-white pixels is filled with their color.
