Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids are consistently single rows (1xN). They contain predominantly the background color (white, 0) and exactly two pixels of another, identical color (e.g., orange (7) in the first two examples, azure (8) in the third).
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They also contain mostly the background color (white, 0). However, instead of two isolated pixels of the non-white color, there is a continuous horizontal segment of that same non-white color.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to identify the two pixels of the non-white color in the input row. It then fills the gap between these two pixels (inclusive) with that same non-white color in the output row. The positions outside this filled segment remain the background color (white). The color used for filling is determined by the color of the two initial non-white pixels.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap between two identical non-white pixels in a single row.
grid_properties:
  - dimension: All grids are 1xN (single row).
  - background_color: white (0).
objects:
  - type: pixel_pair
    description: Two pixels of the same non-white color within the input row.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (e.g., orange, azure), but is consistent within a pair.
      - count: Always 2 in the input.
      - position: Define the start and end points of the transformation range.
relationships:
  - type: positional_boundary
    description: The indices of the two non-white pixels mark the minimum and maximum extent of the region to be filled.
actions:
  - name: identify_color_and_indices
    description: Find the non-white color (C) present and determine the minimum (min_idx) and maximum (max_idx) indices where it appears in the input row.
  - name: fill_segment
    description: Create an output row of the same size, initially filled with the background color (white). Then, set all pixels from min_idx to max_idx (inclusive) to color C.
result:
  - description: A single row where the segment between the original positions of the two non-white pixels is filled with their color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to identify the non-white color present (let's call it `fill_color`).
3.  Find all indices where `fill_color` appears in the input grid.
4.  Determine the minimum index (`start_index`) and the maximum index (`end_index`) from the found indices.
5.  Iterate from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to `fill_color`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
