In all provided examples, these two non-white pixels share the same color (azure=8 in train_1 and train_3, red=2 in train_2).\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a single row of the same length as the input.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the segment *between* the two non-white pixels identified in the input.\n6.  **Filling Action:** The output grid fills the pixels starting from the position of the first non-white pixel up to and including the position of the second non-white pixel. The color used for filling is the color of the original two non-white pixels.\n7.  **Background Preservation:** All pixels outside the segment defined by the two non-white pixels retain their original color (which is always white=0 in the examples).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
