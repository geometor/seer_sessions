Task: Fill Segment Between Markers

Input_Features:
  - GridType: 1D array (single row)
  - BackgroundColor: white (0)
  - MarkerPixels:
      Count: 2
      Property: Non-white color
      Constraint: Both markers have the same color in observed examples.
      Role: Define the start and end points of a segment.

Output_Features:
  - GridType: 1D array (single row)
  - SameDimensions: Output dimensions match input dimensions.
  - BackgroundColor: white (0), preserved from input outside the filled segment.
  - FilledSegment:
      Start: Position of the leftmost marker pixel from the input.
      End: Position of the rightmost marker pixel from the input.
      Color: The color of the marker pixels from the input.
      Content: All pixels within this segment (inclusive) are set to the marker color.

Relationships:
  - The positions of the two non-white pixels in the input determine the boundaries of the segment to be filled in the output.
  - The color of the non-white pixels in the input determines the color used for filling the segment in the output.

Transformation:
  - Identification: Locate the two non-white pixels in the input row.
  - Boundary Determination: Identify the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (start_col) and the rightmost non-white pixel (end_col).
  - Color Determination: Note the color of these non-white pixels.
  - Filling: Create the output row by copying the input row. Then, change the color of all pixels from start_col to end_col (inclusive) to the identified marker color.
