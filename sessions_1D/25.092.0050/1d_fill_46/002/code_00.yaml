Task: Fill Segment Between Markers in a NumPy Array Row

Input_Features:
  - GridType: 2D NumPy array
  - GridShape: Always (1, N) representing a single row.
  - BackgroundColor: white (0)
  - MarkerPixels:
      Count: Exactly 2 per input row in observed examples.
      Property: Non-white color (value != 0).
      Constraint: Both markers have the same color in observed examples.
      Role: Define the start and end points of a segment. Identified using `np.nonzero`.

Output_Features:
  - GridType: 2D NumPy array
  - SameDimensions: Output dimensions match input dimensions.
  - BackgroundColor: white (0), preserved from input outside the filled segment.
  - FilledSegment:
      StartColumn: Index of the leftmost marker pixel (minimum non-zero column index).
      EndColumn: Index of the rightmost marker pixel (maximum non-zero column index).
      Color: The color of the marker pixels from the input.
      Content: All pixels within the row between StartColumn and EndColumn (inclusive) are set to the marker color.

Relationships:
  - The column indices of the two non-zero pixels in the input NumPy array determine the boundaries of the segment to be filled.
  - The value (color) of the non-zero pixels determines the fill color.

Transformation:
  - Environment: Assumes input is a NumPy array.
  - Identification: Use `np.nonzero(input_array)` to find the indices of non-white pixels. Since the array is 1xN, the relevant indices are the column indices (second element of the tuple returned by `np.nonzero`).
  - Validation: Check if exactly two non-white pixels were found. If not, return the input array unchanged.
  - Boundary Determination: Calculate the minimum (`start_col`) and maximum (`end_col`) of the identified column indices.
  - Color Determination: Get the color from one of the marker pixels (e.g., `input_array[0, start_col]`).
  - Copying: Create a copy of the input array using `np.copy(input_array)`.
  - Filling: Use NumPy slicing on the copied array to set the values from `start_col` to `end_col` (inclusive) in the first row to the determined `marker_color`: `output_array[0, start_col : end_col + 1] = marker_color`.
  - Return: Return the modified NumPy array.
