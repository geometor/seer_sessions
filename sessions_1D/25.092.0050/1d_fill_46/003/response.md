import numpy as np

"""
Identifies the two non-white pixels in a single-row NumPy input array.
Determines the leftmost (start_col) and rightmost (end_col) column indices of these pixels.
Notes the color of these pixels (marker_color).
Creates a copy of the input array.
Fills the segment in the copied array's row from start_col to end_col (inclusive) with the marker_color.
Returns the modified NumPy array. If exactly two non-white markers are not found, returns an unmodified copy of the input.
