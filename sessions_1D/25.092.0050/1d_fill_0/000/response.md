Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

The input and output are both single rows (or 1D arrays) of pixels.
Each input row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by one or more white (0) pixels. All other pixels are white.
The output row retains the two original non-white pixels. Additionally, all the white pixels located *between* the original two non-white pixels are changed to the same non-white color.
Essentially, the transformation fills the gap between the two non-white pixels with their own color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D # or 1xN 2D grid
input_elements:
  - element: row
    properties:
      - contains two identical non-white pixels
      - contains white pixels (0)
      - the two non-white pixels define the start and end of a segment
      - all other pixels are white
  - element: non_white_pixel
    properties:
      - color (C): varies across examples (orange, yellow, gray)
      - position (index): two distinct positions mark segment boundaries
  - element: white_pixel
    properties:
      - color: 0
      - position: some are between the non_white_pixels, others are outside
output_elements:
  - element: row
    properties:
      - derived from input row
      - contains a contiguous segment of non_white_pixels
      - the segment spans from the start index to the end index of the non_white_pixels in the input
      - pixels outside this segment remain white
actions:
  - identify the non_white color (C) in the input
  - find the indices (start_index, end_index) of the two pixels with color C
  - create the output row by copying the input row
  - fill the pixels in the output row from start_index to end_index (inclusive) with color C
relationships:
  - the two non-white pixels in the input define the segment to be filled
  - the color of the non-white pixels in the input determines the fill color
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row).
2.  Identify the non-white color present in the input row. Let this color be `C`.
3.  Find the positions (indices) of the two pixels that have the color `C`. Let these be `index1` and `index2`.
4.  Determine the minimum and maximum of these two indices: `start_index = min(index1, index2)` and `end_index = max(index1, index2)`.
5.  Create a new row identical to the input row (this will become the output).
6.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
7.  For each index in this range, set the color of the pixel at that index in the new row to `C`.
8.  Return the modified row as the output.
