task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D # or 1xN 2D grid
input_elements:
  - element: row
    properties:
      - contains two identical non-white pixels
      - contains white pixels (0)
      - the two non-white pixels define the start and end of a segment
      - all other pixels are white
  - element: non_white_pixel
    properties:
      - color (C): varies across examples (orange, yellow, gray)
      - position (index): two distinct positions mark segment boundaries
  - element: white_pixel
    properties:
      - color: 0
      - position: some are between the non_white_pixels, others are outside
output_elements:
  - element: row
    properties:
      - derived from input row
      - contains a contiguous segment of non_white_pixels
      - the segment spans from the start index to the end index of the non_white_pixels in the input
      - pixels outside this segment remain white
actions:
  - identify the non_white color (C) in the input
  - find the indices (start_index, end_index) of the two pixels with color C
  - create the output row by copying the input row
  - fill the pixels in the output row from start_index to end_index (inclusive) with color C
relationships:
  - the two non-white pixels in the input define the segment to be filled
  - the color of the non-white pixels in the input determines the fill color
