All other pixels are white.\nThe output row retains the two original non-white pixels. Additionally, all the white pixels located *between* the original two non-white pixels are changed to the same non-white color.\nEssentially, the transformation fills the gap between the two non-white pixels with their own color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
