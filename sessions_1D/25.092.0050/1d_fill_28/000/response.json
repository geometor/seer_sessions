Scan the input grid to find the non-white color (let's call it `C`) and the column indices (`idx1` and `idx2`, assuming `idx1 < idx2`) of the two pixels having color `C`.\n2.  Iterate through the columns from `idx1 + 1` up to `idx2 - 1`.\n3.  For each column index `j` in this range, change the color of the pixel at `(0, j)` to `C`.\n4.
