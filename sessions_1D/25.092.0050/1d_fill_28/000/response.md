## Perception

The input is always a 1-dimensional grid (or a grid with a height of 1).
Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by one or more white pixels. All other pixels are white.
The output grid is the same size as the input grid.
The transformation involves filling the gap between the two non-white pixels with the same non-white color. The original two non-white pixels remain unchanged, as do the white pixels outside the range defined by the two non-white pixels.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
objects:
  - type: segment_endpoints
    count: 2
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., gray, green, magenta)
    properties:
      - same_color
      - separated_by_white_pixels
  - type: fill_region
    color: white (0)
    location: between the two segment_endpoints
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The fill_region is located horizontally between the two segment_endpoints.
actions:
  - name: identify_endpoints
    input: input_grid
    output:
      - color: C (the non-white color)
      - indices: idx1, idx2 (positions of the two pixels with color C)
  - name: fill_segment
    input:
      - input_grid
      - color: C
      - indices: idx1, idx2
    output: output_grid
    description: Change the color of all pixels between index idx1 and idx2 (exclusive) to color C.
constraints:
  - Exactly two non-white pixels exist in the input.
  - The two non-white pixels have the same color.
  - The pixels between the two non-white pixels are all white.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to find the non-white color (let's call it `C`) and the column indices (`idx1` and `idx2`, assuming `idx1 < idx2`) of the two pixels having color `C`.
2.  Iterate through the columns from `idx1 + 1` up to `idx2 - 1`.
3.  For each column index `j` in this range, change the color of the pixel at `(0, j)` to `C`.
4.  Keep all other pixels (those at indices less than or equal to `idx1`, and greater than or equal to `idx2`) the same as they were in the input grid.
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
