task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
objects:
  - type: segment_endpoints
    count: 2
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., gray, green, magenta)
    properties:
      - same_color
      - separated_by_white_pixels
  - type: fill_region
    color: white (0)
    location: between the two segment_endpoints
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The fill_region is located horizontally between the two segment_endpoints.
actions:
  - name: identify_endpoints
    input: input_grid
    output:
      - color: C (the non-white color)
      - indices: idx1, idx2 (positions of the two pixels with color C)
  - name: fill_segment
    input:
      - input_grid
      - color: C
      - indices: idx1, idx2
    output: output_grid
    description: Change the color of all pixels between index idx1 and idx2 (exclusive) to color C.
constraints:
  - Exactly two non-white pixels exist in the input.
  - The two non-white pixels have the same color.
  - The pixels between the two non-white pixels are all white.
