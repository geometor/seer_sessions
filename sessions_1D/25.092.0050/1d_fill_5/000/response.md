Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for the task `train_1`, `train_2`, and `train_3`.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids). The size is consistent within each example pair (input 1x15, output 1x15).
2.  **Colors:** The inputs contain primarily white (0) pixels and exactly two pixels of another single color (yellow=4, magenta=6, or azure=8).
3.  **Transformation:** The key transformation appears to be filling the gap between the two non-white pixels. In the output, the original two non-white pixels remain, and all the white pixels located strictly between them are changed to the same non-white color.
4.  **Object Identification:** The significant "objects" are the two isolated non-white pixels in the input. Their color and positions are crucial.
5.  **Action:** The action performed is "filling" or "connecting" these two identified pixels by changing the color of the pixels between them.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap between two identical non-white pixels in a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN)
  input_size: Constant within examples (e.g., 1x15)
  output_size: Same as input size.
objects:
  - type: Marker Pixel
    count_per_input: 2
    properties:
      - color: Non-white (value > 0)
      - constraint: Both marker pixels have the same color within a single input.
      - location: Variable positions along the 1D grid.
  - type: Gap Pixel
    properties:
      - color: White (value = 0)
      - location: Positioned between the two Marker Pixels.
transformation:
  action: Fill Gap
  input_elements:
    - Two Marker Pixels (same color C, positions P1 and P2, with P1 < P2)
    - Gap Pixels (white pixels at positions P such that P1 < P < P2)
  output_changes:
    - Marker Pixels at P1 and P2 retain color C.
    - All Gap Pixels between P1 and P2 change color from white (0) to C.
    - All other pixels remain unchanged.
relationship: The output represents a continuous segment of color C connecting the positions of the two input Marker Pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid (1D array) to find the positions (indices) of the two non-white pixels.
2.  Identify the color (let's call it `fill_color`) of these two non-white pixels. Note that both pixels will have the same `fill_color`.
3.  Determine the starting index (`start_index`) and ending index (`end_index`) corresponding to the positions of these two non-white pixels. Assume `start_index` is the smaller index and `end_index` is the larger index.
4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
5.  Iterate through all indices `i` from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
6.  For each index `i` in this range, change the color of the pixel at that index in the output grid to `fill_color`.
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
