task_description: Fill the gap between two identical non-white pixels in a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN)
  input_size: Constant within examples (e.g., 1x15)
  output_size: Same as input size.
objects:
  - type: Marker Pixel
    count_per_input: 2
    properties:
      - color: Non-white (value > 0)
      - constraint: Both marker pixels have the same color within a single input.
      - location: Variable positions along the 1D grid.
  - type: Gap Pixel
    properties:
      - color: White (value = 0)
      - location: Positioned between the two Marker Pixels.
transformation:
  action: Fill Gap
  input_elements:
    - Two Marker Pixels (same color C, positions P1 and P2, with P1 < P2)
    - Gap Pixels (white pixels at positions P such that P1 < P < P2)
  output_changes:
    - Marker Pixels at P1 and P2 retain color C.
    - All Gap Pixels between P1 and P2 change color from white (0) to C.
    - All other pixels remain unchanged.
relationship: The output represents a continuous segment of color C connecting the positions of the two input Marker Pixels.
