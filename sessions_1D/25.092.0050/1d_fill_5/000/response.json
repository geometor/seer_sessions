The size is consistent within each example pair (input 1x15, output 1x15).\n2.  **Colors:** The inputs contain primarily white (0) pixels and exactly two pixels of another single color (yellow=4, magenta=6, or azure=8).\n3.  **Transformation:** The key transformation appears to be filling the gap between the two non-white pixels. In the output, the original two non-white pixels remain, and all the white pixels located strictly between them are changed to the same non-white color.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The significant \"objects\" are the two isolated non-white pixels in the input. Their color and positions are crucial.\n5.  **Action:** The action performed is \"filling\" or \"connecting\" these two identified pixels by changing the color of the pixels between them.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the color (let's call it `fill_color`) of these two non-white pixels. Note that both pixels will have the same `fill_color`.\n3.  Determine the starting index (`start_index`) and ending index (`end_index`) corresponding to the positions of these two non-white pixels. Assume `start_index` is the smaller index and `end_index` is the larger index.\n4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.\n5.  Iterate through all indices `i` from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.\n6.  For each index `i` in this range, change the color of the pixel at that index in the output grid to `fill_color`.\n7.  The resulting grid is the final output."
