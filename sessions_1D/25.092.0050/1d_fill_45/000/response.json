The transformation involves filling the gap between these two non-white pixels, including the positions of the original non-white pixels, with the same non-white color. The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid. The non-white color used varies between examples (gray, azure, green).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
