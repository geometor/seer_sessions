**Perception:**

The task operates on single-row grids. Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by one or more white (0) pixels. The remaining pixels are white. The transformation involves filling the gap between these two non-white pixels, including the positions of the original non-white pixels, with the same non-white color. The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid. The non-white color used varies between examples (gray, azure, green).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - grid_dimensions:
      input: 1xN (single row)
      output: 1xN (same as input)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - significant_pixels:
      count: 2
      properties:
        - same_color
        - non_white
        - separated_by_background
      location: variable
  - transformation:
      type: fill_segment
      description: Fills the segment between the two non-white pixels.
      segment_definition:
        start: index of the first non-white pixel
        end: index of the last non-white pixel
        inclusive: yes
      fill_color: the color of the significant pixels found in the input
  - unchanged_pixels: Pixels outside the filled segment remain white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Determine the color of these non-white pixels (they will all share the same color).
3.  Find the column index of the leftmost non-white pixel (`min_col`).
4.  Find the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (`max_col`).
5.  Create an output row of the same length as the input row, initialized with white (0) pixels.
6.  Fill the pixels in the output row from column index `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) with the color identified in step 2.
