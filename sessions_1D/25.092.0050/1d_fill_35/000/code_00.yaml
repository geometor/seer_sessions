task_description: Fill the segment between the first and last non-white pixels in a 1D grid with the color of the first non-white pixel.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1xN grid)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: non-white_pixel
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than 0 (white)
      - position: Column index
relationships:
  - type: segment
    definition: The range of columns starting from the index of the leftmost non-white pixel and ending at the index of the rightmost non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - start_index: Index of the leftmost non-white pixel.
      - end_index: Index of the rightmost non-white pixel.
      - fill_color: The color of the pixel at the start_index in the input.
actions:
  - action: find_boundary_pixels
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - leftmost_non_white_pixel_index
      - rightmost_non_white_pixel_index
      - fill_color (color of the leftmost non-white pixel)
  - action: fill_segment
    inputs:
      - input_grid_dimensions
      - leftmost_non_white_pixel_index
      - rightmost_non_white_pixel_index
      - fill_color
    outputs:
      - output_grid
    description: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with white (0). Then, set the color of pixels from the leftmost index to the rightmost index (inclusive) to the fill_color.
