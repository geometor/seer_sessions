*   **Perception:** The input is always a 1D grid (a single row). The background color is white (0). Within this row, there are exactly two pixels of the same non-white color. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. The transformation involves identifying the two non-white pixels and filling the segment between them (inclusive of the endpoints) with their color. All other pixels remain white.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: fill_segment_1d
    grid_dimensionality: 1
    background_color: 0 # white
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        count: 2
        color: non-white # e.g., 5 (gray), 1 (blue), 7 (orange)
        properties:
          - same_color # The two pixels always share the same non-white color.
          - locations: identified by their indices in the row.
    action:
      - type: fill
        target: pixels between the two non-white pixels
        parameters:
          - fill_color: the color of the two non-white pixels
          - range: inclusive of the start and end indices of the two non-white pixels.
    relationships:
      - The two non-white pixels define the start and end points of the segment to be filled.
    output_preservation:
      - Grid dimensions remain the same.
      - Pixels outside the filled segment remain white (0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the input grid, which is a single row of pixels.
    2.  Scan the row to find the indices (positions) of the two pixels that are not white (color 0). Note their color. These two pixels will always have the same color.
    3.  Determine the starting index and the ending index from the positions found in step 2 (let the smaller index be `start_index` and the larger index be `end_index`).
    4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    5.  Modify the output grid: Change the color of all pixels from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) to the color identified in step 2.
    6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
