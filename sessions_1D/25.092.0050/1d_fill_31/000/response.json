This color is maintained in the output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the locations of the two non-white pixels in the input row. The segment of the row *between* these two pixels (exclusive of the first, inclusive of the second, or perhaps inclusive of both endpoints and filling between them) is then filled with the same non-white color. Pixels outside this segment remain white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
