task_type: fill_segment
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: markers
    count: 2
    color: variable (magenta, green, yellow in examples)
    property: non-white
    location: defines the start and end of a segment in the row
relationships:
  - description: The two markers have the same color.
  - description: The segment of the row between the two markers (inclusive of the second marker, exclusive of the first based on how fill works) is targeted for transformation.
action:
  - type: fill
    target: white pixels between the markers
    color: use the color of the markers
    result: the segment between the markers is filled with the marker color
invariance:
  - The positions of the original markers remain unchanged.
  - The color of the markers determines the fill color.
  - Pixels outside the segment defined by the markers remain white.
