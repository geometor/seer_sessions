Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the two non-white pixels in the input row.
2. Determine the color of these non-white pixels (they will have the same color).
3. Create an output row by copying the input row.
4. Fill the segment of the output row starting from the position immediately after the first non-white pixel up to and including the position of the second non-white pixel. Use the color identified in step 2 for filling.
5. Pixels outside this filled segment retain their original color from the input.
