task_description: "Fill the horizontal segment between two marker pixels of the same color in a 1D grid, represented as a single row."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 (represented as a 1xN grid)
  width: variable (16 in examples)
  height: 1
  input_type: Can be list of lists (e.g., [[0, 8, 0, 8]]) or numpy.ndarray.
input_elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    count: variable
  - object: marker_pixels
    count: 2
    properties:
      color: identical, non-white (varies: azure, yellow, gray)
      spatial_relationship: define the start and end points of a horizontal segment
output_elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    count: variable (pixels outside the filled segment)
  - object: filled_segment
    color: same as input marker_pixels
    location: spans horizontally and inclusively between the column indices of the input marker_pixels
transformation:
  - action: ensure_list_format
    input: input grid (potentially numpy.ndarray)
    output: input grid as list of lists
  - action: extract_row
    input: input grid (list of lists)
    output: the single row list
  - action: identify_marker_pixels
    input: grid row
    criteria: color is not white (0)
    output: indices and color of the two marker pixels
  - action: determine_segment_boundaries
    input: indices of marker pixels
    output: minimum_column_index, maximum_column_index
  - action: create_output_row
    properties:
        width: same as input row width
        initial_color: white (0)
  - action: fill_segment_in_row
    target: output row
    range: from minimum_column_index to maximum_column_index (inclusive)
    fill_color: color of marker pixels
  - action: format_output
    input: filled output row
    output: list containing the single output row (e.g., [[0, 8, 8, 8]])
relationship_input_output:
  - The non-white color in the input determines the fill color in the output.
  - The column positions of the two non-white pixels in the input determine the start and end columns of the filled segment in the output.
  - The dimensions (height=1, width=N) of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
