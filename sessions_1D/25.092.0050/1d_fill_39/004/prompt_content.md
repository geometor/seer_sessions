"""
Identifies the non-white color and the indices of the two pixels containing this 
color in the input 1D grid (single row). Determines the minimum and maximum of 
these two indices. Creates an output grid of the same size, initially all 
white (0). Fills the segment in the output grid from the minimum index to the 
maximum index (inclusive) with the identified non-white color. The final 
output is formatted as a list containing the single row list.
