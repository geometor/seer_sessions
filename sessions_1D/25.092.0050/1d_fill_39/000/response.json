The output uses the same two colors as the corresponding input.\n3.  **Key Elements:** In each input grid, there are exactly two pixels of the non-white color. All other pixels are white.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to \"fill\" the gap between the two non-white pixels. The output grid has a contiguous segment of the non-white color that starts at the position of the first non-white pixel in the input and ends at the position of the second non-white pixel in the input. Pixels outside this segment remain white.\n5.  **Inclusivity:** The original positions of the two non-white pixels are included in the filled segment in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
