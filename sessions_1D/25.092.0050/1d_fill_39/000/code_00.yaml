task_description: "Fill the segment between two marker pixels of the same color in a 1D grid."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1
input_elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    count: variable
  - object: marker_pixels
    count: 2
    color: non-white (varies: azure, yellow, gray)
    spatial_relationship: define the start and end points of a segment
output_elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    count: variable (potentially less than input if markers were far apart)
  - object: filled_segment
    color: same as input marker_pixels
    location: spans inclusively between the indices of the input marker_pixels
transformation:
  - action: identify_marker_pixels
    input: input grid
    criteria: color is not white (0)
    output: indices and color of the two marker pixels
  - action: determine_segment_boundaries
    input: indices of marker pixels
    output: minimum_index, maximum_index
  - action: fill_segment
    target: output grid (initially a copy of input or all white)
    range: from minimum_index to maximum_index (inclusive)
    fill_color: color of marker pixels
  - action: preserve_background
    target: output grid
    range: indices less than minimum_index and greater than maximum_index
    fill_color: white (0)
relationship_input_output:
  - The non-white color in the input determines the fill color in the output.
  - The positions of the two non-white pixels in the input determine the start and end positions of the filled segment in the output.
  - The dimensions of the output grid are the same as the input grid.
