**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed on all training examples with the error: `Input grid must be a list containing a single list (1D row)`. This indicates a mismatch between the expected input format in the `transform` function and the actual format provided during testing. The function was designed to accept input like `[[0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]`, assuming a standard ARC grid format (list of lists). However, the error suggests the input might have been passed as a simple 1D list like `[0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]` or a 1D NumPy array.

The strategy is to modify the input handling part of the `transform` function to correctly interpret the input as a single row, regardless of whether it's passed as `[row]` or just `row`. The core logic of finding the non-white pixels, determining the boundaries, and filling the segment appears sound based on the initial analysis and should remain unchanged.

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   All inputs and outputs are indeed 1D arrays (or lists) of the same length.
*   Each input contains exactly two non-white pixels of the same color.
*   The output correctly fills the segment between (and including) the indices of these two pixels with their color.
*   All pixels outside this segment in the output are white (0).
*   The core logic identified previously (find markers, find bounds, fill segment) is confirmed by the metrics.

relationship_input_output:
  - The non-white color in the input row determines the fill color in the output row.
  - The positions (indices) of the two non-white pixels in the input row determine the start and end positions of the filled segment in the output row.
  - The length of the output row is the same as the input row.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid. Determine if it represents a single row directly (e.g., `[0, 8, 0, 8]`) or is nested (e.g., `[[0, 8, 0, 8]]`). Extract the single list representing the input row.
2.  Record the length of the input row.
3.  Identify the color that is not white (0) within the input row; this is the 'fill color'.
4.  Find the indices (positions) of the two pixels in the input row that have the 'fill color'.
5.  Determine the minimum index and the maximum index from these two positions.
6.  Create a new list (the output row) of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white (0).
7.  Iterate through the indices from the minimum index to the maximum index (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the value at that position in the output row to the 'fill color'.
8.  Format the final output row into the standard ARC format (a list containing the single output row, e.g., `[[0, 8, 8, 8]]`).
9.  Return the formatted output grid.
