task_description: "Fill the segment between two marker pixels of the same color in a 1D grid (single row)."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  format: Single list or 1D NumPy array representing one row.
input_elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    count: variable
  - object: marker_pixels
    count: 2
    color: non-white (varies: azure-8, yellow-4, gray-5)
    spatial_relationship: Define the start and end points of a segment within the single row.
output_elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    count: variable (input length - segment length)
  - object: filled_segment
    color: same as input marker_pixels
    location: Spans inclusively between the indices of the input marker_pixels in the single row.
transformation:
  - action: identify_input_row
    description: Extract the single row data from the input structure. Handles potential variations like list-of-lists vs. simple list.
    input: input grid (potentially `[[row]]` or `[row]`)
    output: a single list or 1D array representing the row (`[row]`)
  - action: identify_marker_pixels
    input: input row (1D list or array)
    criteria: color is not white (0)
    output: indices and color of the two marker pixels
  - action: determine_segment_boundaries
    input: indices of marker pixels
    output: minimum_index, maximum_index
  - action: create_output_row
    input: length of input row
    description: Create a new list/array of the same length, initialized to white (0).
    output: output row (1D list or array)
  - action: fill_segment
    target: output row
    range: from minimum_index to maximum_index (inclusive)
    fill_color: color of marker pixels
  - action: format_output
    description: Ensure the final output matches the expected ARC format (likely list of lists, even for 1D).
    input: filled output row (1D list or array)
    output: list containing the single output row (`[[row]]`)
relationship_input_output:
  - The non-white color in the input row determines the fill color in the output row.
  - The positions (indices) of the two non-white pixels in the input row determine the start and end positions of the filled segment in the output row.
  - The length of the output row is the same as the input row.
