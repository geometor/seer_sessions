"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (represented as a single row within a list or numpy array) 
by finding the two pixels that are not white (0). It then fills the segment 
between these two pixels (inclusive) with their color, leaving the rest of the grid white (0). 
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and is returned in the 
standard list-of-lists format. Handles potential numpy array input.
