*   **Perception:**
    The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or single-row grids). Each input grid contains predominantly 'white' pixels (0) and exactly two pixels of another single color (e.g., green '3' or orange '7'). The transformation involves filling the segment of 'white' pixels located strictly between the two non-white pixels with the same non-white color. The original two non-white pixels remain unchanged, effectively creating a solid line or segment of that color connecting the original two points.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # or 1xN 2D grid
    input_characteristics:
      - contains_predominantly: white pixels (0)
      - contains_exactly: 2 pixels of a single non-white color (C)
      - non_white_pixels_define: endpoints of a segment
    output_characteristics:
      - same_dimensions_as_input: true
      - transformation_area: pixels between the two non-white input pixels
      - transformation_action: fill the segment between the endpoints with color C
      - result: a contiguous segment of color C connecting the original endpoints
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: represented by integers 0-9
          - position: index within the 1D array
      - type: segment
        defined_by: two pixels of the same non-white color (endpoints)
        properties:
          - start_index: position of the first endpoint
          - end_index: position of the second endpoint
          - interior_pixels: white pixels between start_index and end_index
    actions:
      - name: find_endpoints
        input: input grid
        output: indices and color (C) of the two non-white pixels
      - name: fill_segment
        input: input grid, start_index, end_index, color C
        output: modified grid where pixels from start_index to end_index are set to color C
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the non-white color (let's call it `C`) present in the input grid.
    2.  Find the indices (positions) of the two pixels that have the color `C`. Let these indices be `index1` and `index2`. Assume `index1` is the smaller index and `index2` is the larger index.
    3.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    4.  Iterate through all indices `i` starting from `index1` up to `index2` (inclusive).
    5.  For each index `i` in this range, set the color of the pixel at that index in the output grid to `C`.
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
