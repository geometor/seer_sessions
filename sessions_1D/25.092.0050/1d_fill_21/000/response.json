Each input grid contains predominantly 'white' pixels (0) and exactly two pixels of another single color (e.g., green '3' or orange '7'). The transformation involves filling the segment of 'white' pixels located strictly between the two non-white pixels with the same non-white color. The original two non-white pixels remain unchanged, effectively creating a solid line or segment of that color connecting the original two points.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
