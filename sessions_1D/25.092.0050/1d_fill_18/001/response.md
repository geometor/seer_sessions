"""
Transforms a 1D input grid by finding the two pixels of the same non-white color and filling the segment between them (inclusive) with that color. All other pixels remain white (0).

1. Identify the non-white color present in the input row.
2. Find the column indices of the two pixels that have this non-white color.
3. Determine the minimum (start) and maximum (end) of these indices.
4. Create an output row of the same size as the input, initialized with white (0).
5. Fill the segment in the output row from the start index to the end index (inclusive) with the identified non-white color.
