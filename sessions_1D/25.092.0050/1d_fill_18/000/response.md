Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are all single-row grids (1D arrays).
*   The background color is consistently white (0).
*   Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (azure, blue, orange in the examples).
*   All other pixels in the input are white.
*   The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input.
*   The transformation involves filling the segment *between* the two non-white pixels (inclusive) with the same non-white color.
*   The pixels outside this filled segment remain white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: marker_pixels
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color: non-white # Can be azure (8), blue (1), orange (7), etc.
      - constraint: both markers must have the same color
    location: distinct indices within the single row
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two marker pixels define the start and end points of a segment.
action:
  - type: fill
    target: segment between marker pixels (inclusive)
    fill_color: same color as the marker_pixels
    preserve: pixels outside the segment remain background_color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input row to identify the non-white color present.
2.  Locate the column indices of the two pixels matching this non-white color.
3.  Identify the leftmost (minimum index) and rightmost (maximum index) of these two positions.
4.  Create an output row of the same size, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Fill the segment in the output row from the leftmost index to the rightmost index (inclusive) with the identified non-white color.
