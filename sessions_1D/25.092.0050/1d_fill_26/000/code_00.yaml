task_type: fill_segment
input_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
output_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_characteristics:
  - Contains mostly white pixels (0).
  - Contains exactly two non-white pixels.
  - The two non-white pixels always have the same color.
output_characteristics:
  - Matches input dimensions.
  - The two original non-white pixels are preserved.
  - The segment of pixels strictly between the original two non-white pixels is filled with their color.
  - All other pixels remain white (0).
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (0-9)
      - position: (index)
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - start_pixel: (one of the non-white pixels)
      - end_pixel: (the other non-white pixel)
      - fill_color: (the color of the start/end pixels)
transformation:
  - action: find_endpoints
    input: input_grid
    criteria: pixel color is not white (0)
    output: coordinates of the two non-white pixels, non-white_color
  - action: fill_between
    input: input_grid, start_coordinate, end_coordinate, non-white_color
    output: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid, then changing the color of all pixels between the start and end coordinates (exclusive of start, inclusive of end, or vice versa depending on order) to the non-white_color. More precisely, fill all indices `i` such that `min(start_index, end_index) < i < max(start_index, end_index)`.
