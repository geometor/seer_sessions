This row contains predominantly white pixels (color 0) and exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., red, green, blue). The output is also a single row of the same dimensions. The transformation involves identifying the two non-white pixels in the input and filling the segment of the row *between* these two pixels with the same non-white color. The original two non-white pixels remain in their positions in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
