Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception:**

The input consists of a single row (or effectively a 1D array) of pixels. The background is white (0). In each example, there are exactly two pixels of the same non-white color. The output is identical to the input except that all the white pixels located *between* the two non-white pixels have been changed to match the color of those two non-white pixels. The pixels outside the segment defined by the two non-white pixels remain unchanged. The core operation is identifying a segment bounded by two identical colored pixels and filling that segment with the bounding color.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the segment between two identical non-white pixels with their color.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: colored_pixel
    count: 2 (per non-white color in examples)
    properties:
      - color: non-white (value > 0)
      - position: index in the row
relationships:
  - type: spatial_boundary
    description: Two pixels of the same non-white color define the start and end of a segment.
  - type: containment
    description: White pixels located spatially between the boundary pixels.
actions:
  - action: find_boundary_pixels
    input: input grid
    output: indices and color of the two identical non-white pixels
  - action: fill_segment
    input: input grid, boundary pixel indices, boundary pixel color
    output: output grid
    process: Iterate from the first boundary index to the second boundary index (inclusive), setting each pixel's color to the boundary color.
constraints:
  - Appears to operate on exactly two instances of a single non-white color per input grid.
  - Only white pixels between the boundary pixels are changed (though the boundary pixels themselves are effectively 're-colored' to their own color).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the non-white color present in the input row.
2.  Find the positions (indices) of the first and second occurrences of this non-white color. Let these be `start_index` and `end_index`.
3.  Create a new row, initially identical to the input row.
4.  Iterate through the positions from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
5.  For each position in this range, set the pixel color in the new row to the identified non-white color.
6.  The resulting row is the output.
