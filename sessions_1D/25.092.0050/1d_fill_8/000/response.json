The background is white (0). In each example, there are exactly two pixels of the same non-white color. The output is identical to the input except that all the white pixels located *between* the two non-white pixels have been changed to match the color of those two non-white pixels. The pixels outside the segment defined by the two non-white pixels remain unchanged. The core operation is identifying a segment bounded by two identical colored pixels and filling that segment with the bounding color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
