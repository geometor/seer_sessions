task_description: Fill the segment between two identical non-white pixels with their color.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: colored_pixel
    count: 2 (per non-white color in examples)
    properties:
      - color: non-white (value > 0)
      - position: index in the row
relationships:
  - type: spatial_boundary
    description: Two pixels of the same non-white color define the start and end of a segment.
  - type: containment
    description: White pixels located spatially between the boundary pixels.
actions:
  - action: find_boundary_pixels
    input: input grid
    output: indices and color of the two identical non-white pixels
  - action: fill_segment
    input: input grid, boundary pixel indices, boundary pixel color
    output: output grid
    process: Iterate from the first boundary index to the second boundary index (inclusive), setting each pixel's color to the boundary color.
constraints:
  - Appears to operate on exactly two instances of a single non-white color per input grid.
  - Only white pixels between the boundary pixels are changed (though the boundary pixels themselves are effectively 're-colored' to their own color).
