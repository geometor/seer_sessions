The transformation preserves the colors present in the input, potentially increasing the count of non-white pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve \"filling\" gaps between pixels of the same non-white color. Specifically, if two pixels in the row have the same non-white color, and all the pixels strictly between them are white (0), then those white pixels are changed to the non-white color.\n4.  **Scope:** This filling action seems to happen between the first and last occurrence of a given non-white color within the row, provided the intervening pixels are all white.\n5.  **No Change Cases:** If there's only one pixel of a specific non-white color, or if the pixels between two same-colored non-white pixels are not all white, no filling occurs for that color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
