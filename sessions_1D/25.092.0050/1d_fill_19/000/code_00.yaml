task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively, as operations occur row-wise independently
input_features:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: [white, green, gray] # Colors observed in examples: 0, 3, 5
      - position: column_index
  - element: segment
    defined_by: sequence of pixels between two endpoints
    properties:
      - endpoint_pixels: two pixels of the same non-white color in the same row
      - interior_pixels: pixels strictly between the endpoint pixels
      - endpoint_color: the non-white color of the endpoint pixels
conditions_for_action:
  - for a given non-white color 'C':
    - find the index of the first occurrence (leftmost) of 'C'
    - find the index of the last occurrence (rightmost) of 'C'
    - if first and last indices are different:
      - check if all pixels strictly between the first and last occurrence are white (0)
action:
  - if the conditions are met for color 'C':
    - change the color of all pixels strictly between the first and last occurrence of 'C' to 'C'.
  - apply this process for each distinct non-white color present in the row.
output_features:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: potentially changed based on the filling action
      - position: same as input
relationship:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by conditionally filling horizontal segments defined by pairs of same-colored pixels with white pixels in between.
