Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (1D arrays) of varying lengths.
2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use white (0), green (3), and gray (5). The transformation preserves the colors present in the input, potentially increasing the count of non-white pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve "filling" gaps between pixels of the same non-white color. Specifically, if two pixels in the row have the same non-white color, and all the pixels strictly between them are white (0), then those white pixels are changed to the non-white color.
4.  **Scope:** This filling action seems to happen between the first and last occurrence of a given non-white color within the row, provided the intervening pixels are all white.
5.  **No Change Cases:** If there's only one pixel of a specific non-white color, or if the pixels between two same-colored non-white pixels are not all white, no filling occurs for that color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: fill_segment
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively, as operations occur row-wise independently
input_features:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: [white, green, gray] # Colors observed in examples: 0, 3, 5
      - position: column_index
  - element: segment
    defined_by: sequence of pixels between two endpoints
    properties:
      - endpoint_pixels: two pixels of the same non-white color in the same row
      - interior_pixels: pixels strictly between the endpoint pixels
      - endpoint_color: the non-white color of the endpoint pixels
conditions_for_action:
  - for a given non-white color 'C':
    - find the index of the first occurrence (leftmost) of 'C'
    - find the index of the last occurrence (rightmost) of 'C'
    - if first and last indices are different:
      - check if all pixels strictly between the first and last occurrence are white (0)
action:
  - if the conditions are met for color 'C':
    - change the color of all pixels strictly between the first and last occurrence of 'C' to 'C'.
  - apply this process for each distinct non-white color present in the row.
output_features:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: potentially changed based on the filling action
      - position: same as input
relationship:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by conditionally filling horizontal segments defined by pairs of same-colored pixels with white pixels in between.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid (although all examples are single-row).
3.  For the current row, identify all unique non-white colors present.
4.  For each unique non-white color `C` found in the row:
    a.  Find the index of the first (leftmost) occurrence of `C` in the row, let it be `first_idx`.
    b.  Find the index of the last (rightmost) occurrence of `C` in the row, let it be `last_idx`.
    c.  If `first_idx` is not equal to `last_idx` (i.e., there are at least two pixels of color `C`):
        i.  Check if all pixels in the row at indices strictly between `first_idx` and `last_idx` (i.e., from `first_idx + 1` to `last_idx - 1`) have the color white (0).
        ii. If all intervening pixels are white, then for each index `j` from `first_idx + 1` to `last_idx - 1`, change the color of the pixel at index `j` in the *output* grid to `C`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
