task_type: fill_gap_1d
grid_dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN, effectively 1D)
input_characteristics:
  - grid_shape: (1, N) where N varies
  - contains exactly two non-white pixels (markers)
  - the two markers have the same color (C)
  - markers are separated by one or more white (0) pixels
output_characteristics:
  - same shape as input (1, N)
  - identical to input except for the filled gap
transformation_rule:
  - locate the column indices (col1, col2, with col1 < col2) of the two markers
  - identify the marker color (C)
  - fill the segment of the grid at row 0, from column `col1 + 1` up to (but not including) `col2`, with color C
objects:
  - marker_pixels: two non-white pixels of identical color (C)
  - gap_pixels: sequence of white pixels located between marker_pixels
properties:
  - marker_pixels: color (C), column_indices (col1, col2)
  - gap_pixels: color (0 - white)
action:
  - identify: marker_pixels and their properties (col1, col2, C)
  - modify: change the color of gap_pixels (at indices col1+1 through col2-1) to C
constraints:
  - exactly two non-white pixels must exist in the input
  - the two non-white pixels must have the same color
  - if constraints are not met, no transformation occurs (output equals input)
