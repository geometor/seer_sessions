**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves processing 1-dimensional grids (rows). Each input grid contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by one or more white (0) pixels. All other pixels in the input grid are white. The transformation involves filling the gap between these two non-white pixels with the same non-white color. The size and shape of the grid remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_gap
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
input_characteristics:
  - contains exactly two non-white pixels
  - the two non-white pixels have the same color (let's call it C)
  - the two non-white pixels are separated by one or more white (0) pixels
output_characteristics:
  - same dimensions as input
  - identical to input, except for the gap filling
transformation:
  - identify the color (C) and positions (col1, col2, assuming col1 < col2) of the two non-white pixels
  - fill all pixels between col1 and col2 (exclusive of col1, inclusive of col2-1) with color C
objects:
  - two non-white pixels acting as markers/boundaries
  - a segment of white pixels between the markers
relationships:
  - the two non-white pixels define an interval
action:
  - fill the interval defined by the markers with the marker color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Scan the grid to find the locations (column indices) of the two non-white pixels. Let these indices be `index1` and `index2`. Assume `index1 < index2`.
3.  Identify the color (C) of these two non-white pixels.
4.  Create a copy of the input grid.
5.  Iterate through the column indices from `index1 + 1` up to `index2 - 1`.
6.  For each index in this range, change the color of the pixel at that index in the copied grid to color C.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.
