task_type: fill_interval_1d
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a list or 1-row array)
input_characteristics:
  - grid: A single row of pixels.
  - markers: Contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color (C).
  - background: All other pixels are white (0).
  - gap: The two marker pixels are separated by one or more white pixels.
output_characteristics:
  - grid: Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - content: Identical to the input grid, except the gap between the markers is filled.
transformation:
  - identify_markers: Find the color (C) and column indices (col1, col2, with col1 < col2) of the two non-white pixels.
  - fill_gap: Change the color of all pixels strictly between col1 and col2 (i.e., from index col1 + 1 to col2 - 1) to color C.
objects:
  - marker_pixel: The two non-white pixels defining the interval.
  - gap_segment: The contiguous sequence of white pixels between the markers.
relationships:
  - spatial: The markers define the start and end points of the gap segment.
action:
  - fill: Replace the white pixels within the gap segment with the color of the marker pixels.
assumptions:
  - Input is always a 1D sequence.
  - Exactly two non-white pixels exist.
  - The two non-white pixels are always the same color.
