task_type: fill_gap
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
input_characteristics:
  - contains exactly two non-white pixels
  - the two non-white pixels have the same color (let's call it C)
  - the two non-white pixels are separated by one or more white (0) pixels
output_characteristics:
  - same dimensions as input
  - identical to input, except for the gap filling
transformation:
  - identify the color (C) and positions (col1, col2, assuming col1 < col2) of the two non-white pixels
  - fill all pixels between col1 and col2 (exclusive of col1, inclusive of col2-1) with color C
objects:
  - two non-white pixels acting as markers/boundaries
  - a segment of white pixels between the markers
relationships:
  - the two non-white pixels define an interval
action:
  - fill the interval defined by the markers with the marker color
