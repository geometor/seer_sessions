task_type: fill_segment
data_dimensionality: 1D # Input and output are single rows
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - name: non_white_pixel_pair
    description: Two pixels of the same non-white color present in the input row.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., azure, red, yellow).
      - count: Always 2 in the input.
      - separation: Separated by one or more white pixels.
  - name: fill_segment
    description: The segment of the row between and including the non_white_pixel_pair.
    properties:
      - start_index: Index of the first pixel in the non_white_pixel_pair.
      - end_index: Index of the second pixel in the non_white_pixel_pair.
      - fill_color: The color of the non_white_pixel_pair.
action:
  - name: fill_between
    description: Changes the color of pixels within the fill_segment to the fill_color.
    inputs:
      - original_row
      - non_white_pixel_pair
    outputs:
      - modified_row
    details: All pixels from the start_index to the end_index (inclusive) in the output row are set to the fill_color. Pixels outside this range retain their original color (which is always white in the examples).
relationship:
  - The output row is derived from the input row by applying the fill_between action based on the properties of the non_white_pixel_pair.
