The background color is white (0). Each input row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color, separated by one or more white pixels. The output row is generated by filling the white pixels located *between* these two non-white pixels with the same non-white color. The positions of the original non-white pixels remain unchanged, and their color is maintained. The rest of the row (pixels outside the segment defined by the two initial non-white pixels) remains white.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
