"""
Identify the non-white color present in the input row.
Find the indices (positions) of the two pixels that have this non-white color. 
Let these indices be start_index and end_index, where start_index is the smaller index.
Create a copy of the input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
Iterate through the indices from start_index to end_index (inclusive).
For each index in this range, set the color of the pixel at that index in the output row to the identified non-white color.
Return the modified row as the output.
