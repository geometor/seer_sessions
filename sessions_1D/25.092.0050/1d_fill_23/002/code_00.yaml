task_type: horizontal_segment_fill
data_dimensionality: 2D # Input and output are grids, specifically 1xN
background_color: white (0)
input_grid_properties:
  - property: height
    value: 1
  - property: width
    value: variable (e.g., 12 in examples)
  - property: pixel_composition
    description: Contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color and the rest are white (0).
objects:
  - name: marker_pixel_pair
    description: The two pixels in the input row having the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., azure, red, yellow).
      - row_index: Always 0 (since grid height is 1).
      - column_indices: The column indices of the two pixels (e.g., 1 and 7 for example 1). Let these be c1 and c2.
  - name: fill_segment
    description: The horizontal segment of the single row defined by the marker_pixel_pair.
    properties:
      - row_index: 0
      - start_column: min(c1, c2)
      - end_column: max(c1, c2)
      - fill_color: The color of the marker_pixel_pair.
action:
  - name: fill_horizontal_segment
    description: Changes the color of pixels within the fill_segment to the fill_color.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - marker_pixel_pair
    outputs:
      - output_grid
    details: Create a copy of the input grid. Identify the row (always the first row), the fill color, and the start/end column indices from the marker_pixel_pair. Iterate from the start_column to the end_column (inclusive) and set the pixel color at (row_index, column_index) in the copied grid to the fill_color.
relationship:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by applying the fill_horizontal_segment action based on the properties of the marker_pixel_pair found in the input grid's single row.
