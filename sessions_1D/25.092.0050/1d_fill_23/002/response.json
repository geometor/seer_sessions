            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: finding two identical non-white pixels in a single row and filling the segment between them with that same color. However, the Python implementation failed due to an apparent mismatch between the expected input data structure (List of Lists) and the actual structure used during testing (likely a NumPy array), causing a boolean ambiguity error.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the understanding and implementation to handle the input as a grid (specifically, a 1xN grid represented possibly as a NumPy array or a list containing one list) and ensure the logic correctly identifies and modifies the relevant segment within that single row.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nBased on the provided examples, assuming they represent 1xN grids:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Grid Shape: (1, 12)\n    *   Non-white Pixels: Value 8 (azure) at indices (0, 1) and (0, 7).\n    *   Output Grid Shape: (1, 12)\n    *   Transformation: Pixels from index (0, 1) to (0, 7) inclusive are set to 8.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Grid Shape: (1, 12)\n    *   Non-white Pixels: Value 2 (red) at indices (0, 1) and (0, 4).\n    *   Output Grid Shape: (1, 12)\n    *   Transformation: Pixels from index (0, 1) to (0, 4) inclusive are set to 2.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Grid Shape: (1, 12)\n    *   Non-white Pixels: Value 4 (yellow) at indices (0, 3) and (0, 5).\n    *   Output Grid Shape: (1, 12)\n    *   Transformation: Pixels from index (0, 3) to (0, 5) inclusive are set to 4.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n*   All inputs are single-row grids.\n*   Each input row contains exactly two pixels of the same non-white color.\n*   All other pixels in the input row are white (0).\n*   The transformation fills the horizontal segment *between* and *including* the two non-white pixels with their color.\n*   Pixels outside this segment remain unchanged (white).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
