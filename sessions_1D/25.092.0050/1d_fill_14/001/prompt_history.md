Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is always a single row (1D array or 1xN grid). It primarily consists of the background color white (0).
2.  **Key Elements:** Within the input row, there are exactly two pixels that have the same non-white color. The position of these two pixels varies across examples.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a single row of the same dimensions as the input. It also primarily consists of the background color white (0).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the two non-white pixels from the input. The output creates a contiguous horizontal line or segment using the *same* non-white color found in the input. This segment starts at the column index of the first non-white pixel in the input and ends at the column index of the second non-white pixel in the input (inclusive). All pixels within this range (inclusive) in the output row are set to this non-white color. Pixels outside this range remain white (0).
5.  **Color Preservation:** The specific non-white color used in the input is preserved and used for the filled segment in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap between two identical non-white pixels in a single row grid.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Fixed at 1 row, variable columns (20 in examples).
  - background_color: white (0).

input_elements:
  - object_type: marker_pixels
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color: Must be identical and non-white (e.g., magenta, green, yellow).
      - distribution: Located at different column indices within the single row.
  - object_type: background_pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - distribution: All pixels other than the two marker_pixels.

output_elements:
  - object_type: filled_segment
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: Same non-white color as the input marker_pixels.
      - shape: Horizontal contiguous line segment.
      - position: Spans inclusively from the column index of the first input marker_pixel to the column index of the second input marker_pixel.
  - object_type: background_pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - distribution: All pixels outside the filled_segment.

transformation:
  - action: identify_markers
    input: input_grid
    criteria: Find the two pixels with the same non-white color.
    output: color_value, first_marker_index, second_marker_index
  - action: determine_range
    input: first_marker_index, second_marker_index
    output: start_index (min of indices), end_index (max of indices)
  - action: create_output_grid
    properties: Same dimensions as input_grid, initialized with background_color (white).
  - action: fill_segment
    target: output_grid
    range: From start_index to end_index (inclusive) along the single row.
    color: Use the identified color_value.

relationship:
  - The start and end points of the filled segment in the output correspond directly to the column indices of the two non-white marker pixels in the input.
  - The color of the filled segment is identical to the color of the marker pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid, which consists of a single row.
2.  Identify the two pixels that are not the background color (white, 0). Note their color (let's call it `fill_color`) and their column indices.
3.  Determine the minimum and maximum of these two column indices. Let the minimum index be `start_index` and the maximum index be `end_index`.
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  In the output grid's single row, change the color of all pixels from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) to the `fill_color` identified in step 2.
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
