It primarily consists of the background color white (0).\n2.  **Key Elements:** Within the input row, there are exactly two pixels that have the same non-white color. The position of these two pixels varies across examples.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a single row of the same dimensions as the input. It also primarily consists of the background color white (0).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the two non-white pixels from the input. The output creates a contiguous horizontal line or segment using the *same* non-white color found in the input. This segment starts at the column index of the first non-white pixel in the input and ends at the column index of the second non-white pixel in the input (inclusive). All pixels within this range (inclusive) in the output row are set to this non-white color. Pixels outside this range remain white (0).\n5.  **Color Preservation:** The specific non-white color used in the input is preserved and used for the filled segment in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
