task_description: Fill the gap between two identical non-white pixels in a single row grid.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Fixed at 1 row, variable columns (20 in examples).
  - background_color: white (0).

input_elements:
  - object_type: marker_pixels
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color: Must be identical and non-white (e.g., magenta, green, yellow).
      - distribution: Located at different column indices within the single row.
  - object_type: background_pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - distribution: All pixels other than the two marker_pixels.

output_elements:
  - object_type: filled_segment
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: Same non-white color as the input marker_pixels.
      - shape: Horizontal contiguous line segment.
      - position: Spans inclusively from the column index of the first input marker_pixel to the column index of the second input marker_pixel.
  - object_type: background_pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - distribution: All pixels outside the filled_segment.

transformation:
  - action: identify_markers
    input: input_grid
    criteria: Find the two pixels with the same non-white color.
    output: color_value, first_marker_index, second_marker_index
  - action: determine_range
    input: first_marker_index, second_marker_index
    output: start_index (min of indices), end_index (max of indices)
  - action: create_output_grid
    properties: Same dimensions as input_grid, initialized with background_color (white).
  - action: fill_segment
    target: output_grid
    range: From start_index to end_index (inclusive) along the single row.
    color: Use the identified color_value.

relationship:
  - The start and end points of the filled segment in the output correspond directly to the column indices of the two non-white marker pixels in the input.
  - The color of the filled segment is identical to the color of the marker pixels.
