task_type: segment_fill_1D
components:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    structure: list containing a single list of integers (e.g., [[p1, p2, ...]])
    pixels:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        role: occupies space outside the defined segment
      - type: marker
        color: variable (non-white, e.g., gray(5), magenta(6))
        count: 2 # Exactly two per input grid row
        role: define the boundaries of a segment
        property: both markers share the same color
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Two marker pixels exist within the row at different column indices.
  - type: segment_definition
    description: The segment to be modified is the contiguous sequence of pixels starting at the minimum column index of the two markers and ending at the maximum column index of the two markers, inclusive.
actions:
  - type: identification
    description: Scan the input row to find the column indices of the two non-white pixels. Determine their color (the "fill color").
  - type: validation
    description: Confirm exactly two non-white pixels of the same color were found. If not, the transformation cannot proceed as defined (handle appropriately, e.g., return input copy).
  - type: fill
    description: Create a copy of the input row. Modify the copy by setting the color of all pixels within the identified segment (from the minimum marker index to the maximum marker index, inclusive) to the fill color.
  - type: preservation
    description: Pixels in the copied row outside the identified segment retain their original color (white).
output_specification:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    structure: list containing a single list of integers, same dimensions as input.
    content: Contains the modified row with the segment filled.
constraints:
  - Input is always a single row (1xN grid).
  - Input row always contains exactly two non-white pixels.
  - The two non-white pixels in the input always share the same color.
