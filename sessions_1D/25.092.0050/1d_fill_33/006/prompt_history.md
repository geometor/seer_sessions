## Perception
The input consists of a single row of pixels. Within this row, there are typically two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., gray or magenta), acting as markers. The remaining pixels are white (0).

The transformation involves identifying the locations of these two marker pixels. The output is generated by filling all the pixels located between the first marker pixel and the second marker pixel (inclusive) with the color of the marker pixels. Pixels outside this range (before the first marker and after the second marker) retain their original color (white).

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: line_transformation
components:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D # Essentially a row
    pixels:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: marker
        color: variable (non-white, e.g., gray(5), magenta(6))
        count: 2 # Per example
        property: define a segment boundary
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Two marker pixels of the same color exist within the row.
  - type: segment_definition
    description: The segment to be modified is defined by the indices of the first and second marker pixels, inclusive.
actions:
  - type: identification
    description: Locate the indices of the two non-white marker pixels. Determine their color.
  - type: fill
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the identified segment (from the first marker's index to the second marker's index, inclusive) to the color of the marker pixels.
  - type: copy
    description: Pixels outside the identified segment remain unchanged from the input.
constraints:
  - The input is always a single row.
  - There are exactly two non-white pixels in the input, and they share the same color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input row. Note their color (this will be the "fill color") and their positions (indices).
2.  Determine the index of the first non-white pixel (let's call it `start_index`).
3.  Determine the index of the second (and last) non-white pixel (let's call it `end_index`).
4.  Create a new row identical to the input row.
5.  Iterate through the pixels in the new row from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
6.  For each pixel within this range, set its color to the "fill color" identified in step 1.
7.  The resulting row is the output.

    The function identifies two non-white pixels in the single row of the input grid.
