            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code aims to solve the task by identifying two 'marker' pixels of the same non-white color in a single-row input grid and filling the segment between them (inclusive) with that marker color. The previous execution results show that the transform function consistently returned the original input grid, indicating that the core transformation logic (the fill operation) was never reached or executed correctly.\n\nThe most probable reasons for this failure are:\n1.  **Premature Exit:** The code exited early due to failing an input validation check (e.g., the input wasn't structured as `[[row_data]]`) or the marker constraint check (`len(marker_indices) != 2`).\n2.  **Execution Environment Issue:** An anomaly in how the code was tested or integrated might have prevented the correct execution path.\n\nThe natural language program and the implementation logic appear fundamentally sound based on the task description and examples. The strategy is to re-verify the core assumptions about the input data using code execution and refine the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to ensure absolute clarity for the coder phase. We will assume the underlying logic is correct but ensure the description is precise.\n\n## Gather Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the provided training examples to confirm the structure and properties.\n\n"
