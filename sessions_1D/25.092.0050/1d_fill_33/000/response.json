Within this row, there are typically two pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., gray or magenta), acting as markers. The remaining pixels are white (0).\n\nThe transformation involves identifying the locations of these two marker pixels. The output is generated by filling all the pixels located between the first marker pixel and the second marker pixel (inclusive) with the color of the marker pixels. Pixels outside this range (before the first marker and after the second marker) retain their original color (white).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
