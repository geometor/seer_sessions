task_type: line_transformation
components:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D # Essentially a row
    pixels:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: marker
        color: variable (non-white, e.g., gray(5), magenta(6))
        count: 2 # Per example
        property: define a segment boundary
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Two marker pixels of the same color exist within the row.
  - type: segment_definition
    description: The segment to be modified is defined by the indices of the first and second marker pixels, inclusive.
actions:
  - type: identification
    description: Locate the indices of the two non-white marker pixels. Determine their color.
  - type: fill
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the identified segment (from the first marker's index to the second marker's index, inclusive) to the color of the marker pixels.
  - type: copy
    description: Pixels outside the identified segment remain unchanged from the input.
constraints:
  - The input is always a single row.
  - There are exactly two non-white pixels in the input, and they share the same color.
