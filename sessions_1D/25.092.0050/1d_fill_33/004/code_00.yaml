task_type: segment_fill
components:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D # A single row
    pixels:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        role: fills space outside the target segment
      - type: marker
        color: variable (non-white, e.g., gray(5), magenta(6))
        count: 2
        property: same_color # Both markers have the same color in a given input
        role: define the start and end boundaries of a segment
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Two marker pixels are present within the row.
  - type: segment_definition
    description: The segment to be modified includes the column index of the first marker, the column index of the second marker, and all column indices between them.
actions:
  - type: identification
    description: Find the column indices of the two non-white marker pixels.
  - type: identification
    description: Determine the color of the marker pixels.
  - type: range_determination
    description: Identify the minimum and maximum index among the two marker indices found. These define the start and end of the target segment.
  - type: fill
    description: Set the color of all pixels within the target segment (from the minimum index to the maximum index, inclusive) to the marker color.
  - type: copy
    description: Preserve the color (white) of all pixels outside the target segment.
constraints:
  - The input grid always consists of a single row.
  - There are always exactly two non-white pixels in the input row.
  - The two non-white pixels always share the same color.
