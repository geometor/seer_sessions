```python
"""
Transforms a single-row grid by finding two non-white 'marker' pixels and filling
the segment between them (inclusive) with the marker color. Pixels outside this
segment remain unchanged.
"""

import copy

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Applies the fill transformation to the input grid row.

    The function identifies two non-white pixels in the single row of the input grid.
    It then fills the portion of the row between these two markers (inclusive)
    with the color of the markers. Pixels outside this range are left unchanged.

    Args:
        input_grid: A list containing a single list (the row) of integers (pixels).
                    It's expected that the input row contains exactly two
                    non-white pixels, and they share the same color.

    Returns:
        A list containing a single list (the transformed row) of integers.
        Returns a deep copy of the input if the expected two markers are not found.
