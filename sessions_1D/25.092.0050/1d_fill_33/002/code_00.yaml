task_type: line_segment_fill
components:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 2D # Standard ARC format, but examples only use 1 row.
    shape: 1xN # Height is always 1.
    pixels:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: marker
        color: variable (non-white, e.g., gray(5), magenta(6))
        count: 2 # Confirmed per example.
        property: Same color for both markers. Define endpoints of a segment.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Two marker pixels of the same non-white color exist within the single row.
  - type: segment_definition
    description: The segment to be modified is defined inclusively by the column indices of the first (leftmost) and second (rightmost) marker pixels.
actions:
  - type: identification
    description: Locate the column indices of the two non-white marker pixels. Determine their shared color.
  - type: fill
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. In the copied grid's row, change the color of all pixels from the first marker's index to the second marker's index (inclusive) to the identified marker color.
  - type: copy_unmodified
    description: Pixels outside the identified segment (before the first marker and after the second marker) retain their original color (white) in the output.
constraints:
  - The input grid always has exactly one row.
  - There are exactly two non-white pixels in the input row.
  - The two non-white pixels always have the same color.
