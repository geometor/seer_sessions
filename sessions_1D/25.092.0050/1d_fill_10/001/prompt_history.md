## Perception

The input grids in all examples are 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids). Each input contains exactly two non-white (non-zero) pixels, and these two pixels always share the same color. The remaining pixels are white (zero).

The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input. The transformation involves identifying the locations (indices) of the two non-white pixels in the input. Let the color of these pixels be C and their indices be `idx1` and `idx2`, assuming `idx1 <= idx2`. The output grid is then constructed by filling all pixels from index `idx1` to `idx2` (inclusive) with color C. All pixels outside this range (indices less than `idx1` or greater than `idx2`) remain white (zero).

Essentially, the task is to draw a horizontal line segment between the two given colored points, using their color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. There will be exactly two such pixels, and they will have the same color. Note this color.
2.  Determine the indices (positions) of these two non-white pixels.
3.  Find the minimum index (`min_idx`) and the maximum index (`max_idx`) among these two positions.
4.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
5.  Iterate from `min_idx` to `max_idx` (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the color identified in step 1.
6.  The pixels in the output grid outside the range [`min_idx`, `max_idx`] remain white (0).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
