task_type: drawing
grid_dimensionality: 1D # or 1xN 2D
input_features:
  - property: grid_elements
    value:
      - element_type: pixel
        attributes:
          - color: non-white (e.g., green, orange, red)
            count: 2
            relationship: same_color
          - color: white (0)
            count: N-2 (where N is the total number of pixels)
output_features:
  - property: grid_elements
    value:
      - element_type: contiguous_segment
        attributes:
          - color: determined by the non-white input pixels
          - start_position: index of the first non-white input pixel
          - end_position: index of the second non-white input pixel
          - length: (index of second pixel) - (index of first pixel) + 1
      - element_type: pixel
        attributes:
          - color: white (0)
          - location: outside the contiguous segment
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: non-white pixels
    attributes:
      - color
      - position (index)
  - action: determine_bounds
    inputs: positions of non-white pixels
    outputs:
      - minimum_index
      - maximum_index
  - action: fill_segment
    target: output grid
    parameters:
      - start_index: minimum_index
      - end_index: maximum_index
      - color: color of non-white input pixels
  - action: preserve_background
    target: output grid
    parameters:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: pixels outside the filled segment
relationship:
  - type: positional_definition
    description: The start and end points of the filled segment in the output are defined by the positions of the two non-white pixels in the input.
  - type: color_propagation
    description: The color of the filled segment in the output is determined by the color of the two non-white pixels in the input.
