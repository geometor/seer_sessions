Each input contains exactly two non-white (non-zero) pixels, and these two pixels always share the same color. The remaining pixels are white (zero).\n\nThe output grid retains the same dimensions as the input. The transformation involves identifying the locations (indices) of the two non-white pixels in the input. Let the color of these pixels be C and their indices be `idx1` and `idx2`, assuming `idx1 <= idx2`. The output grid is then constructed by filling all pixels from index `idx1` to `idx2` (inclusive) with color C. All pixels outside this range (indices less than `idx1` or greater than `idx2`) remain white (zero).\n\nEssentially, the task is to draw a horizontal line segment between the two given colored points, using their color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
