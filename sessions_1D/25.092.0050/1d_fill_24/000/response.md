**Perception:**

The input and output are single-row grids (effectively 1D arrays). The input contains mostly white (0) pixels with a few isolated non-white pixels. The transformation identifies pairs of identical non-white pixels within the row. If exactly two pixels of the same non-white color exist, the transformation fills the segment of the row between these two pixels (inclusive) with that color. If there isn't exactly one pair of a specific non-white color, the row remains unchanged (although examples only show cases where a pair *is* found).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
color_focus: non-white pixels (1-9)
objects:
  - type: pixel_pair
    properties:
      - color: non-white (same for both pixels in the pair)
      - count: exactly two occurrences of this color in the input row
      - location: defined by the indices of the two pixels
actions:
  - name: find_color_pairs
    description: Identify if any non-white color appears exactly twice in the input row.
  - name: fill_segment
    condition: A color pair is found.
    description: Change the color of all pixels between the start and end index of the identified pair (inclusive) to the pair's color.
    input: start_index, end_index, fill_color
    output: modified row
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The transformation operates on the segment *between* the two identified pixels of the same color.
output_rule: If a color pair is found, the output is the input row with the segment between the pair filled with their color. Otherwise, the output is identical to the input (implied).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input row.
2.  For each non-white color (1 through 9):
    a.  Count the number of pixels with this color in the row.
    b.  If the count is exactly 2:
        i.  Find the indices (positions) of these two pixels. Let them be `index1` and `index2`.
        ii. Determine the minimum and maximum of these indices (`start_index = min(index1, index2)`, `end_index = max(index1, index2)`).
        iii. Create a copy of the input row.
        iv. For every position from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) in the copied row, set the pixel's color to the color found in step 2.
        v.  Return the modified row.
3.  If no non-white color appears exactly twice, return the original input row unchanged.
