task_type: array_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
color_focus: non-white pixels (1-9)
objects:
  - type: pixel_pair
    properties:
      - color: non-white (same for both pixels in the pair)
      - count: exactly two occurrences of this color in the input row
      - location: defined by the indices of the two pixels
actions:
  - name: find_color_pairs
    description: Identify if any non-white color appears exactly twice in the input row.
  - name: fill_segment
    condition: A color pair is found.
    description: Change the color of all pixels between the start and end index of the identified pair (inclusive) to the pair's color.
    input: start_index, end_index, fill_color
    output: modified row
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The transformation operates on the segment *between* the two identified pixels of the same color.
output_rule: If a color pair is found, the output is the input row with the segment between the pair filled with their color. Otherwise, the output is identical to the input (implied).
