"""
Identify the color and column indices of the two non-white pixels in the input grid. 
Let the indices be col1 and col2, and the color be C. Assume col1 < col2.
Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
Iterate through the column indices from col1 + 1 up to col2 - 1.
For each index in this range, set the pixel color in the output grid to C.
Return the modified grid.
