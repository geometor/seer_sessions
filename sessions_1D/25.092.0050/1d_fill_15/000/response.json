These two pixels are always the same color within a given input.\n3.  **Output Objects:** The output grid contains a single contiguous horizontal line segment of the same color as the input pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to fill the gap between the two non-white pixels in the input with the same color. The original non-white pixels remain in place, and the pixels between them change from white (0) to the color of the non-white pixels. Pixels outside the range defined by the two initial non-white pixels remain unchanged (white).\n5.  **Color Invariance:** The color used for filling is determined by the color of the two non-white pixels in the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
