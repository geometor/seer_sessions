task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between two identical non-white pixels.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  size: Variable width, height 1.
input_features:
  objects:
    - count: 2
    - type: Non-white pixels
    - property: Always have the same color within a single input.
    - property: Separated by one or more white pixels.
  background: White pixels (0)
output_features:
  objects:
    - count: 1
    - type: Contiguous horizontal line segment
    - color: Same as the non-white pixels in the input.
    - location: Spans the original positions of the two input pixels and the gap between them.
  background: White pixels (0) outside the generated line segment.
transformation:
  action: Fill
  target: White pixels located horizontally between the two non-white input pixels.
  fill_value: The color of the non-white input pixels.
  preservation: The original positions of the two non-white pixels and all pixels outside their span remain unchanged.
relationships:
  - The positions of the two non-white pixels in the input define the start and end points (inclusive) of the colored segment in the output.
  - The color of the non-white pixels in the input determines the color of the segment in the output.
