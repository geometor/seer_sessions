The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly suggests iterating over a 2D array treated as 1D, leading to comparisons between whole rows (arrays) and scalars (like 0).\n\nThe strategy is to revise the approach to explicitly handle a 2D input grid, extract the single relevant row, apply the filling logic to that row, and then reconstruct the 2D output grid structure.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
