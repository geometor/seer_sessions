task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between two identical non-white pixels within a single-row grid.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D, but functionally 1D (always 1 row).
  input_shape: (1, N) where N is variable.
  output_shape: Same as input shape (1, N).
input_features:
  grid_structure: Contains exactly one row.
  row_content:
    - objects: Exactly two non-white pixels.
    - object_property: Both non-white pixels have the identical color (C).
    - object_location: Separated by one or more white pixels (0).
    - background: All other pixels in the row are white (0).
output_features:
  grid_structure: Contains exactly one row.
  row_content:
    - objects: One contiguous horizontal line segment of color C.
    - segment_location: Spans the column indices from the first non-white input pixel to the second non-white input pixel (inclusive).
    - segment_color: All pixels within the segment have color C.
    - background: Pixels outside the span of the segment remain white (0).
transformation:
  scope: Operates solely on the single row of the grid.
  input_identification: Locate the two non-white pixels and determine their color (C) and column indices (col1, col2).
  action: Fill.
  target: The pixels in the row between col1 and col2 (exclusive of col1, exclusive of col2).
  fill_value: Color C.
  preservation:
    - The original two non-white pixels at col1 and col2 retain their color C.
    - All pixels outside the range [col1, col2] (i.e., columns < col1 or > col2) remain unchanged (white).
  output_structure: The modified row is placed back into a 1-row, 2D grid structure.
