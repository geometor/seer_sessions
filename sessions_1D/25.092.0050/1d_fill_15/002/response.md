**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because it likely assumed the input was a 1D list, while the execution environment probably passed it as a 2D structure (e.g., a NumPy array or a list of lists) even for single-row grids. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests iterating over a 2D array treated as 1D, leading to comparisons between whole rows (arrays) and scalars (like 0).

The strategy is to revise the approach to explicitly handle a 2D input grid, extract the single relevant row, apply the filling logic to that row, and then reconstruct the 2D output grid structure.

```yaml
task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between two identical non-white pixels within a single-row grid.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D, but functionally 1D (always 1 row).
  input_shape: (1, N) where N is variable.
  output_shape: Same as input shape (1, N).
input_features:
  grid_structure: Contains exactly one row.
  row_content:
    - objects: Exactly two non-white pixels.
    - object_property: Both non-white pixels have the identical color (C).
    - object_location: Separated by one or more white pixels (0).
    - background: All other pixels in the row are white (0).
output_features:
  grid_structure: Contains exactly one row.
  row_content:
    - objects: One contiguous horizontal line segment of color C.
    - segment_location: Spans the column indices from the first non-white input pixel to the second non-white input pixel (inclusive).
    - segment_color: All pixels within the segment have color C.
    - background: Pixels outside the span of the segment remain white (0).
transformation:
  scope: Operates solely on the single row of the grid.
  input_identification: Locate the two non-white pixels and determine their color (C) and column indices (col1, col2).
  action: Fill.
  target: The pixels in the row between col1 and col2 (exclusive of col1, exclusive of col2).
  fill_value: Color C.
  preservation:
    - The original two non-white pixels at col1 and col2 retain their color C.
    - All pixels outside the range [col1, col2] (i.e., columns < col1 or > col2) remain unchanged (white).
  output_structure: The modified row is placed back into a 1-row, 2D grid structure.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Verify the input grid has exactly one row. If not, handle as an error or return input unchanged.
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
3.  Find the column indices of all non-white pixels in the extracted row.
4.  Verify that exactly two non-white pixels were found. If not, return the original input grid unchanged.
5.  Let the indices be `idx1` and `idx2`. Determine the color `C` of these pixels (they should be identical). If they are not identical, return the original input grid unchanged (or handle as error).
6.  Determine the start column `col_start = min(idx1, idx2)` and end column `col_end = max(idx1, idx2)`.
7.  Create a copy of the extracted row to serve as the output row.
8.  Iterate through the column indices `i` from `col_start` to `col_end` (inclusive).
9.  For each index `i` in this range, set the pixel color in the output row at column `i` to `C`.
10. Construct the final 2D output grid containing only the modified output row.
11. Return the output grid.
