Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples all involve 1-dimensional grids (single rows).
2.  **Input Objects:** Each input grid contains exactly two non-white pixels. These two pixels are always the same color within a given input.
3.  **Output Objects:** The output grid contains a single contiguous horizontal line segment of the same color as the input pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to fill the gap between the two non-white pixels in the input with the same color. The original non-white pixels remain in place, and the pixels between them change from white (0) to the color of the non-white pixels. Pixels outside the range defined by the two initial non-white pixels remain unchanged (white).
5.  **Color Invariance:** The color used for filling is determined by the color of the two non-white pixels in the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between two identical non-white pixels.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  size: Variable width, height 1.
input_features:
  objects:
    - count: 2
    - type: Non-white pixels
    - property: Always have the same color within a single input.
    - property: Separated by one or more white pixels.
  background: White pixels (0)
output_features:
  objects:
    - count: 1
    - type: Contiguous horizontal line segment
    - color: Same as the non-white pixels in the input.
    - location: Spans the original positions of the two input pixels and the gap between them.
  background: White pixels (0) outside the generated line segment.
transformation:
  action: Fill
  target: White pixels located horizontally between the two non-white input pixels.
  fill_value: The color of the non-white input pixels.
  preservation: The original positions of the two non-white pixels and all pixels outside their span remain unchanged.
relationships:
  - The positions of the two non-white pixels in the input define the start and end points (inclusive) of the colored segment in the output.
  - The color of the non-white pixels in the input determines the color of the segment in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the color and column indices of the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Let the indices be `col1` and `col2`, and the color be `C`. Assume `col1 < col2`.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Iterate through the column indices from `col1 + 1` up to `col2 - 1`.
4.  For each index in this range, set the pixel color in the output grid to `C`.
5.  Return the modified grid.
