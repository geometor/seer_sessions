The key change is the region between the two non-background pixels found in the input.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation appears to be filling the gap between the two non-background pixels. The segment starting from the first non-background pixel and ending at the second non-background pixel (inclusive) is filled entirely with that same non-background color in the output. Pixels outside this segment retain their original background color.\n5.  **Color Consistency**: The color used for filling is always the same as the color of the two non-background pixels in the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Let these be `start_index` and `end_index`.\n3.  **Initialize Output**: Create a copy of the input array to serve as the initial output array.\n4.  **Fill the gap**: Iterate through the output array from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
