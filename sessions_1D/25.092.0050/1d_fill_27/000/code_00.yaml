Task: Fill the gap between two markers.

Input_Features:
  - type: 1D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - composition: Primarily background color (0) with exactly two pixels of a single non-background color.
  - non_background_color: Varies per example (blue=1, orange=7).
  - marker_pixels: The two non-background pixels.
  - size: Constant length for input and output within each example.

Output_Features:
  - type: 1D array of pixels, same length as input.
  - transformation: Fills the segment between the marker pixels.
  - filled_segment: Includes the start and end marker pixels and all pixels between them.
  - filled_color: Matches the color of the marker pixels from the input.
  - background: Pixels outside the filled segment retain the background color (0).

Relationships:
  - The positions of the two non-background pixels in the input define the start and end indices of the filled segment in the output.
  - The color of the non-background pixels in the input determines the color used for filling in the output.
