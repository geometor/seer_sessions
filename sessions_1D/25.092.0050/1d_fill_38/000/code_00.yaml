task_type: fill_segment
input_characteristics:
  - format: 1D array (or 1xN grid)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - number_of_foreground_objects: 1 (a pair of pixels defining a segment)
  - foreground_object_properties:
    - composed_of: two identical non-white pixels
    - function: define endpoints of a segment
output_characteristics:
  - format: 1D array (or 1xN grid) matching input dimensions
  - content: derived from input by filling a segment
transformation:
  - action: identify_endpoints
    - description: Find the indices of the two non-white pixels in the input.
    - inputs: input_array
    - outputs: index1, index2, fill_color
  - action: fill_segment
    - description: Create the output array by setting all pixels between index1 and index2 (inclusive) to the fill_color. Pixels outside this range retain the background color (white).
    - inputs: input_array_dimensions, index1, index2, fill_color, background_color
    - outputs: output_array
relationship:
  - The two non-white pixels in the input define the boundaries (inclusive) of the filled segment in the output.
  - The color of the filled segment in the output is the same as the color of the two non-white pixels in the input.
  - The size of the output array is identical to the size of the input array.
