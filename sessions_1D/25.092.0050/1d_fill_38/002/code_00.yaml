task_type: fill_horizontal_segment
input_characteristics:
  - format: 2D grid (specifically 1xN dimension)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - number_of_foreground_objects: 1 (a pair of pixels defining a segment)
  - foreground_object_properties:
    - composed_of: two identical non-white pixels in the same row (row 0)
    - function: define endpoints (column indices) of a horizontal segment
output_characteristics:
  - format: 2D grid matching input dimensions (1xN)
  - content: derived from input by filling a horizontal segment
transformation:
  - action: identify_endpoints_and_color
    - description: Find the row and column coordinates and the color of the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Confirm exactly two such pixels exist.
    - inputs: input_grid
    - outputs: col_index1, col_index2, fill_color (row index is implicitly 0)
  - action: determine_segment_boundaries
    - description: Find the minimum and maximum column index from the two identified endpoints.
    - inputs: col_index1, col_index2
    - outputs: start_col, end_col
  - action: fill_segment
    - description: Create the output grid (initialized to white) with the same dimensions as the input. Fill the pixels in the first row (row 0) from start_col to end_col (inclusive) with the fill_color.
    - inputs: input_grid_dimensions, start_col, end_col, fill_color, background_color
    - outputs: output_grid
relationship:
  - The two non-white pixels in the input grid define the column boundaries (inclusive) of the filled horizontal segment in the output grid.
  - The color of the filled segment in the output grid is the same as the color of the two non-white pixels in the input.
  - The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the dimensions of the input grid.
