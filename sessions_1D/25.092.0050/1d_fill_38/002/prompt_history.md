**Perception:**

The input and output are both 1D arrays (or grids with a height of 1). The background color is white (0). Each input array contains exactly two non-white pixels, which are always of the same color (e.g., both magenta (6) or both gray (5)). These two non-white pixels define the endpoints of a segment. The transformation involves filling the segment between these two endpoints (inclusive) with the color of the endpoints. Pixels outside this segment remain white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_segment
input_characteristics:
  - format: 1D array (or 1xN grid)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - number_of_foreground_objects: 1 (a pair of pixels defining a segment)
  - foreground_object_properties:
    - composed_of: two identical non-white pixels
    - function: define endpoints of a segment
output_characteristics:
  - format: 1D array (or 1xN grid) matching input dimensions
  - content: derived from input by filling a segment
transformation:
  - action: identify_endpoints
    - description: Find the indices of the two non-white pixels in the input.
    - inputs: input_array
    - outputs: index1, index2, fill_color
  - action: fill_segment
    - description: Create the output array by setting all pixels between index1 and index2 (inclusive) to the fill_color. Pixels outside this range retain the background color (white).
    - inputs: input_array_dimensions, index1, index2, fill_color, background_color
    - outputs: output_array
relationship:
  - The two non-white pixels in the input define the boundaries (inclusive) of the filled segment in the output.
  - The color of the filled segment in the output is the same as the color of the two non-white pixels in the input.
  - The size of the output array is identical to the size of the input array.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array, or as an array of the same dimensions filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input array to find the indices and the color of the two non-white pixels. Let the indices be `index1` and `index2` (where `index1 <= index2`), and let their color be `fill_color`.
3.  Iterate from `index1` to `index2` (inclusive).
4.  For each index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output array to `fill_color`.
5.  Ensure all pixels in the output array with indices less than `index1` or greater than `index2` are set to the background color (white, 0). (This step might be redundant if the output was initialized with the background color).
6.  Return the modified output array.
