```python
import numpy as np # Although not strictly necessary for 1D lists, numpy is common in ARC tasks

"""
Transforms a 1D input array based on contiguous segments of orange (7) pixels.
If a contiguous segment of orange pixels has an odd length, all pixels in that segment are changed to blue (1).
If a contiguous segment of orange pixels has an even length, all pixels in that segment are changed to maroon (9).
All other pixels (e.g., white (0)) remain unchanged.

    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid (represented as a 1D list).

    Args:
        input_grid (list[int]): A 1D list representing the input state.

    Returns:
