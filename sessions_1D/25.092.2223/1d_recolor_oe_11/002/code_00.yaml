    color: maroon (9)
    role: output_color
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    description: contiguous sequence of orange (7) pixels within the single row
    properties:
      - length: number of pixels in the segment
      - parity: whether the length is odd or even
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: pixels are adjacent horizontally within the row
transformation:
  action: color_replacement
  scope: applies only to pixels within identified orange segments
  input_color: orange (7)
  condition: based on the parity of the length of the contiguous horizontal orange segment containing the pixel
  output_mapping:
    - condition: segment length is odd
      output_color: blue (1)
    - condition: segment length is even
      output_color: maroon (9)
