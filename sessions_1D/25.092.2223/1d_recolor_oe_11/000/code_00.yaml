dimensionality: 1D
elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background
    behavior: static (remains unchanged)
  - type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    role: target
    behavior: transforms based on context

    role: output_color
  - type: pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    role: output_color
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: contiguous sequence of orange (7) pixels
    properties:
      - length: number of pixels in the segment
      - parity: whether the length is odd or even
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: pixels are adjacent horizontally in the 1D array
transformation:
  action: color_replacement
  input_color: orange (7)
  condition: based on the parity of the length of the contiguous orange segment containing the pixel
  output_mapping:
    - condition: odd length segment
      output_color: blue (1)
    - condition: even length segment
      output_color: maroon (9)
