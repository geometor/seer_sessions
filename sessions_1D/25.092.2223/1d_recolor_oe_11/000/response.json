Based on the ARC context, these could also be interpreted as 1xN grids.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors involved are white (0), orange (7), blue (1), and maroon (9).\n3.  **Background:** White pixels (0) appear to act as a background or separator and remain unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects the orange (7) pixels.\n5.  **Grouping:** The orange pixels appear in contiguous segments of varying lengths.\n6.  **Pattern Recognition:** Comparing the input and output segments:\n    *   `7 7 7` (length 3) -> `1 1 1`\n    *   `7 7 7 7` (length 4) -> `9 9 9 9`\n    *   `7 7` (length 2) -> `9 9`\n    *   `7` (length 1) -> `1`\n    *   `7 7 7 7 7` (length 5) -> `1 1 1 1 1`\n7.  **Rule Hypothesis:** It seems the transformation rule depends on the *length* of the contiguous segment of orange pixels. Specifically:\n    *   If the length of an orange segment is **odd**, all pixels in that segment become blue (1).\n    *   If the length of an orange segment is **even**, all pixels in that segment become maroon (9).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
