Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Data Format:** The input and output are presented as 1D arrays (or lists) of integers, representing colors. Based on the ARC context, these could also be interpreted as 1xN grids.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors involved are white (0), orange (7), blue (1), and maroon (9).
3.  **Background:** White pixels (0) appear to act as a background or separator and remain unchanged in the output.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects the orange (7) pixels.
5.  **Grouping:** The orange pixels appear in contiguous segments of varying lengths.
6.  **Pattern Recognition:** Comparing the input and output segments:
    *   `7 7 7` (length 3) -> `1 1 1`
    *   `7 7 7 7` (length 4) -> `9 9 9 9`
    *   `7 7` (length 2) -> `9 9`
    *   `7` (length 1) -> `1`
    *   `7 7 7 7 7` (length 5) -> `1 1 1 1 1`
7.  **Rule Hypothesis:** It seems the transformation rule depends on the *length* of the contiguous segment of orange pixels. Specifically:
    *   If the length of an orange segment is **odd**, all pixels in that segment become blue (1).
    *   If the length of an orange segment is **even**, all pixels in that segment become maroon (9).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output array identical to the input array.
2.  Scan the input array from left to right.
3.  When an orange (7) pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet:
    a.  Identify the entire contiguous segment of orange (7) pixels it belongs to (find its start and end indices).
    b.  Calculate the length of this segment.
    c.  Determine if the length is odd or even.
    d.  If the length is **odd**, replace all pixels within this segment's range in the *output* array with blue (1).
    e.  If the length is **even**, replace all pixels within this segment's range in the *output* array with maroon (9).
    f.  Mark all pixels in this segment as processed (e.g., by advancing the scan index past the end of the segment).
4.  If the pixel encountered is not orange (7), keep its value unchanged in the output array and continue scanning.
5.  Return the final output array.
