Grid:
  Dimensions: Consistent across examples (likely 2x13 based on data length 26).
  Background: Color 0 (white), remains unchanged.
Objects:
  Type: Connected components of non-background pixels.
  Input Color: 7 (orange).
  Connectivity: Orthogonal (pixels sharing a side belong to the same object).
  Properties:
    - Size: Number of pixels in the object. This is the key determinant for transformation.
    - Position: Unchanged between input and output.
    - Shape: Unchanged between input and output.
Transformation:
  Action: Recolor input objects based on their size.
  Input Condition: Pixel color is 7 (orange).
  Rule:
    - If object size is odd: Change color to 6 (magenta).
    - If object size is even: Change color to 8 (azure).
  Other Pixels: Pixels not part of an orange object remain unchanged.
