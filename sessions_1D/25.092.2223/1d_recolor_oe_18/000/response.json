            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input and output are grids represented as flattened strings of numbers (colors). The length of the string is 26 for all provided examples, suggesting a consistent grid dimension, likely 2x13 or 13x2. Based on the visual grouping in the raw data, 2x13 seems plausible.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) as the background, orange (7) as the input object color, and magenta (6) and azure (8) as the output object colors.\n3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct contiguous regions (objects) of orange pixels against a white background. Connectivity appears to be orthogonal (sharing sides), not diagonal.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the orange objects. The background remains unchanged. The shape and position of the objects also remain unchanged. The specific output color (magenta or azure) seems to depend on a property of the original orange object.\n5.  **Pattern Identification:** By analyzing the examples (assuming 2x13 grid dimensions), we can identify the orange objects, calculate their sizes (number of pixels), and observe the corresponding output color:\n    *   **Example 1 (2x13):** Objects of size 3 (orange) become magenta (6), objects of size 2 and 6 (orange) become azure (8).\n    *   **Example 2 (2x13):** Objects of size 1, 3, 5 (orange) become magenta (6), objects of size 2, 4 (orange) become azure (8).\n    *   **Example 3 (2x13):** Objects of size 1, 5 (orange) become magenta (6), objects of size 2, 4, 4 (orange) become azure (8).\n6.  **Rule Derivation:** Combining these observations reveals a consistent rule:\n    *   Orange objects with an *odd* number of pixels are changed to magenta (6).\n    *   Orange objects with an *even* number of pixels are changed to azure (8).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
