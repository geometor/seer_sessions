"""
Identify contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels in the input grid using 4-way adjacency (horizontal/vertical).
For each identified region, count the number of pixels it contains.
If the count (size) of the region is even, replace all blue pixels belonging to that region with magenta (6) in the output grid.
If the count (size) of the region is odd, replace all blue pixels belonging to that region with azure (8) in the output grid.
All white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
