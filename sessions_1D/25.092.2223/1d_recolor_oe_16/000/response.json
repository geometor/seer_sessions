Analyzing the single provided example (`train_1`):\n        *   There are four distinct contiguous regions of blue pixels.\n        *   Region 1 (top left) has 2 pixels and becomes magenta (6).\n        *   Region 2 (top right) has 5 pixels and becomes azure (8).\n        *   Region 3 (middle left) has 1 pixel and becomes azure (8).\n        *   Region 4 (bottom left/middle) has 8 pixels and becomes magenta (6).\n    *   This suggests a rule based on the number of pixels (size) in each blue region: if the size is even, the color becomes magenta (6); if the size is odd, the color becomes azure (8).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
