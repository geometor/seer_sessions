*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input grid consists of white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
    *   The output grid consists of white (0), magenta (6), and azure (8) pixels.
    *   The white background pixels remain unchanged between input and output.
    *   The blue pixels in the input are replaced by either magenta or azure pixels in the output, maintaining their original positions.
    *   The blue pixels in the input form distinct contiguous regions (connected horizontally and vertically).
    *   The replacement color (magenta or azure) appears to be uniform within each original blue region.
    *   The choice between magenta (6) and azure (8) seems to depend on a property of the contiguous blue region it replaces. Analyzing the single provided example (`train_1`):
        *   There are four distinct contiguous regions of blue pixels.
        *   Region 1 (top left) has 2 pixels and becomes magenta (6).
        *   Region 2 (top right) has 5 pixels and becomes azure (8).
        *   Region 3 (middle left) has 1 pixel and becomes azure (8).
        *   Region 4 (bottom left/middle) has 8 pixels and becomes magenta (6).
    *   This suggests a rule based on the number of pixels (size) in each blue region: if the size is even, the color becomes magenta (6); if the size is odd, the color becomes azure (8).

*   **YAML Facts:**

        properties:
          - connectivity: Defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency.
          - size: Number of pixels in the region.
        output_color_determinant: parity of size
        output_mapping:

    actions:
      - action_name: identify_regions
        input: input grid
        target: blue (1) pixels
        method: Find connected components using 4-connectivity (horizontal/vertical).
        output: Sets of coordinates for each blue region.
      - action_name: count_region_size
        input: each identified blue region
        output: integer count of pixels for the region.
      - action_name: determine_output_color
        input: region size
        method: Check parity (even or odd).
        output: target color (magenta (6) for even, azure (8) for odd).
      - action_name: generate_output_grid
        input: input grid, identified regions, region sizes, determined output colors
        method: Create a new grid of the same dimensions. Copy white pixels. For each blue pixel's coordinate, replace it with the determined output color corresponding to the region it belongs to.
        output: output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a blue (1) pixel is found that has not yet been assigned to a region:
        a.  Start a search (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) from this pixel to find all connected blue (1) pixels (using horizontal and vertical adjacency only). This collection of connected pixels forms a single "blue region". Mark all pixels in this region as visited or assigned.
        b.  Count the total number of pixels (`size`) in this identified blue region.
        c.  Determine the target color for this region: If `size` is an even number, the target color is magenta (6). If `size` is an odd number, the target color is azure (8).
        d.  For every pixel coordinate belonging to this blue region, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the determined target color.
    3.  If an input pixel is white (0), copy its value directly to the corresponding position in the output grid.
    4.  After iterating through all pixels and processing all blue regions, the output grid is complete. Return the output grid.
