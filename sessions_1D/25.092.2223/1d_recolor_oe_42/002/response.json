            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" clearly indicates that the `transform` function was treating the input as a 1D list, while it was actually receiving a 2D array (a list of lists), even if those lists contained only one row. The comparison `if input_row[i] == 5:` failed because `input_row[i]` was itself a list (a row) when `input_row` was the entire grid, not a single pixel value.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the function to correctly handle 2D grids. This involves:\n1.  Iterating through each `row` in the input `grid`.\n2.  Applying the existing logic (finding contiguous `gray` blocks and changing their color based on length) *within each row*.\n3.  Building the output grid row by row.\n\nThe core transformation logic observed previously (changing `gray` blocks to `red` if length <= 3, and to `azure` if length > 3) appears sound based on the examples; the implementation just failed to handle the data structure correctly.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe provided examples are single-row grids. Let's represent them explicitly as 2D lists:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (1 row, 14 columns)\n    *   Gray Blocks: One block of length 6 at index 3.\n    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Length 6 > 3, change to azure)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]]` (1 row, 14 columns)\n    *   Gray Blocks: One block of length 6 at index 2, one block of length 1 at index 11.\n    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]` (Length 6 > 3 -> azure; Length 1 <= 3 -> red)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]` (1 row, 14 columns)\n    *   Gray Blocks: One block of length 3 at index 3, one block of length 6 at index 8.\n    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]` (Length 3 <= 3 -> red; Length 6 > 3 -> azure)\n\nThe previous code failed because it didn't iterate through the outer list (rows) before accessing pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
