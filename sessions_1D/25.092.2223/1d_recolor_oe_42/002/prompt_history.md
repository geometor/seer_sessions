Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The examples provided seem to be 1-dimensional arrays or single rows from a 2D grid.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved are `white` (0), `gray` (5), `red` (2), and `azure` (8).
3.  **Background:** `white` (0) pixels appear to serve as a background and remain unchanged in the output.
4.  **Objects:** The core elements being transformed are contiguous horizontal blocks (sequences) of `gray` (5) pixels.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation applied to a `gray` block depends on its length (number of contiguous pixels).
    *   Blocks of length 1, 2, or 3 are transformed into blocks of the same length, but with the color `red` (2). (Seen in train\_2 and train\_3)
    *   Blocks of length 4, 5, or 6 are transformed into blocks of the same length, but with the color `azure` (8). (Seen in train\_1, train\_2, and train\_3)
6.  **Consistency:** The length and position of the transformed blocks remain the same as the original `gray` blocks. Only the color changes based on the length rule.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Change the color of contiguous horizontal blocks of gray pixels based on their length.
elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: Remains unchanged.
  - element_type: object
    identifier: gray_block
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: contiguous horizontal sequence
      - property: length (number of pixels)
    actions:
      - name: change_color
        conditions:
          - property: length
            comparison: less_than_or_equal_to
            value: 3
            new_color: red (2)
          - property: length
            comparison: greater_than
            value: 3
            new_color: azure (8)
    relationships: The output color depends directly on the length of the input gray block.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: Assumed 1D or treating rows independently.
  - transformation_scope: Pixel-wise based on block membership and block length.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through the input grid (or each row if it's 2D).
2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks (sequences) composed entirely of `gray` (5) pixels.
3.  For each identified `gray` block:
    a.  Determine its length (number of pixels in the block).
    b.  If the length is 3 or less, replace all `gray` (5) pixels within that block with `red` (2) pixels in the output grid at the corresponding positions.
    c.  If the length is greater than 3, replace all `gray` (5) pixels within that block with `azure` (8) pixels in the output grid at the corresponding positions.
4.  Copy all pixels that are not part of a `gray` block (e.g., `white` (0) pixels) directly from the input grid to the output grid at the corresponding positions.
5.  The final output grid contains the modified blocks and the unchanged background pixels.
```python
import copy

"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal blocks of gray (5) pixels in the input grid (treated as a single row or processing each row independently).
Calculates the length of each gray block.
If a gray block's length is 3 or less, all its pixels are changed to red (2) in the output.
If a gray block's length is greater than 3, all its pixels are changed to azure (8) in the output.
All other pixels (non-gray) are copied directly to the output.
