task_description: Iterate through each row of the grid independently. Within each row, change the color of contiguous horizontal blocks of gray pixels based on their length.
elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: Remains unchanged.
  - element_type: object
    identifier: gray_horizontal_block
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: contiguous horizontal sequence within a single row
      - property: length (number of pixels in the sequence)
    actions:
      - name: change_color_based_on_length
        conditions:
          - property: length
            comparison: less_than_or_equal_to
            value: 3
            new_color: red (2)
          - property: length
            comparison: greater_than
            value: 3
            new_color: azure (8)
    relationships: The output color of a block depends only on its length and its original color being gray. Blocks in different rows are processed independently.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 2D (list of lists)
  - transformation_scope: Row-wise. Operations within one row do not affect other rows. Pixel transformations depend on horizontal adjacency within the same row.
