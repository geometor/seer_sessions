```python
import copy

"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal blocks of gray (5) pixels in the input grid (treated as a single row or processing each row independently).
Calculates the length of each gray block.
If a gray block's length is 3 or less, all its pixels are changed to red (2) in the output.
If a gray block's length is greater than 3, all its pixels are changed to azure (8) in the output.
All other pixels (non-gray) are copied directly to the output.

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on the length of contiguous gray blocks.

    Args:
        input_grid (list): A list representing a single row of pixel values. 
                           Although ARC grids are 2D, the examples provided are 1D.
                           If a 2D grid is passed, this function will raise an error

                           Let's assume for now it processes a single list (row).
