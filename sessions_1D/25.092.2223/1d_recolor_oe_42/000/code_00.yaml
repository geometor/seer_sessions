task_description: Change the color of contiguous horizontal blocks of gray pixels based on their length.
elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: Remains unchanged.
  - element_type: object
    identifier: gray_block
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: contiguous horizontal sequence
      - property: length (number of pixels)
    actions:
      - name: change_color
        conditions:
          - property: length
            comparison: less_than_or_equal_to
            value: 3
            new_color: red (2)
          - property: length
            comparison: greater_than
            value: 3
            new_color: azure (8)
    relationships: The output color depends directly on the length of the input gray block.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: Assumed 1D or treating rows independently.
  - transformation_scope: Pixel-wise based on block membership and block length.
