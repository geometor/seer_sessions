(Seen in train\\_2 and train\\_3)\n    *   Blocks of length 4, 5, or 6 are transformed into blocks of the same length, but with the color `azure` (8). (Seen in train\\_1, train\\_2, and train\\_3)\n6.  **Consistency:** The length and position of the transformed blocks remain the same as the original `gray` blocks. Only the color changes based on the length rule.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
