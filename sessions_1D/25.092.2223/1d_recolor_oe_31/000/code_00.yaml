task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1 # Presented as 1D arrays
  colors_present_input: [white, gray]
  colors_present_output: [white, yellow, orange]
  background_color: white
  objects_of_interest: contiguous_segments_of_gray_pixels

objects:
  - id: gray_segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal run of one or more gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - parity: Whether the length is odd or even.
    actions_observed:
      - recoloring: The color of the pixels in the segment changes in the output.

transformation_rules:
  - condition: Object is a gray_segment with odd length.
    action: Recolor all pixels in the segment to yellow (4).
  - condition: Object is a gray_segment with even length.
    action: Recolor all pixels in the segment to orange (7).
  - condition: Pixel is white (0).
    action: Keep the pixel color unchanged.

relationships:
  - The output color of a former gray pixel depends solely on the length of the contiguous gray segment it belonged to in the input.
  - White pixels act as separators and are static.
