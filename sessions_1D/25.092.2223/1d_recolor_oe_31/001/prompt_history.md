## Perception

The input and output are presented as one-dimensional arrays or grids.
The input grid contains only two colors: white (0) and gray (5).
The gray pixels appear in contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of varying lengths, separated by one or more white pixels.
The output grid preserves the positions of the white pixels.
The gray pixels in the input are replaced by either yellow (4) or orange (7) pixels in the output.
The color used for replacement seems to depend on the length of the contiguous segment of gray pixels in the input.
By observing the examples:
- **train_1:**
    - `5 5 5` (length 3, odd) -> `4 4 4` (yellow)
    - `5 5 5 5` (length 4, even) -> `7 7 7 7` (orange)
    - `5 5` (length 2, even) -> `7 7` (orange)
    - `5` (length 1, odd) -> `4` (yellow)
- **train_2:**
    - `5 5 5 5 5` (length 5, odd) -> `4 4 4 4 4` (yellow)
    - `5 5 5 5 5 5` (length 6, even) -> `7 7 7 7 7 7` (orange)
    - `5 5` (length 2, even) -> `7 7` (orange)
    - `5 5 5` (length 3, odd) -> `4 4 4` (yellow)
- **train_3:**
    - `5 5 5` (length 3, odd) -> `4 4 4` (yellow)
    - `5 5 5 5 5 5` (length 6, even) -> `7 7 7 7 7 7` (orange)
    - `5 5 5 5 5` (length 5, odd) -> `4 4 4 4 4` (yellow)

The rule appears to be: identify contiguous segments of gray (5) pixels. If the length of the segment is odd, replace the gray pixels with yellow (4). If the length of the segment is even, replace the gray pixels with orange (7). White (0) pixels remain unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1 # Presented as 1D arrays
  colors_present_input: [white, gray]
  colors_present_output: [white, yellow, orange]
  background_color: white
  objects_of_interest: contiguous_segments_of_gray_pixels

objects:
  - id: gray_segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal run of one or more gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - parity: Whether the length is odd or even.
    actions_observed:
      - recoloring: The color of the pixels in the segment changes in the output.

transformation_rules:
  - condition: Object is a gray_segment with odd length.
    action: Recolor all pixels in the segment to yellow (4).
  - condition: Object is a gray_segment with even length.
    action: Recolor all pixels in the segment to orange (7).
  - condition: Pixel is white (0).
    action: Keep the pixel color unchanged.

relationships:
  - The output color of a former gray pixel depends solely on the length of the contiguous gray segment it belonged to in the input.
  - White pixels act as separators and are static.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right (or top to bottom if considered 1xN).
3.  Identify the start and end indices of each contiguous segment of gray (5) pixels.
4.  For each identified gray segment:
    a.  Calculate its length.
    b.  Determine if the length is odd or even.
    c.  If the length is odd, replace all gray pixels within that segment in the output grid with yellow (4).
    d.  If the length is even, replace all gray pixels within that segment in the output grid with orange (7).
5.  Leave all white (0) pixels unchanged in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
