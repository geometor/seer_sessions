task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2 # Inputs are 2D grids (though examples are 1xN)
  colors_present_input: [white, gray]
  colors_present_output: [white, yellow, orange]
  background_color: white
  objects_of_interest: contiguous_horizontal_segments_of_gray_pixels

objects:
  - id: gray_horizontal_segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal run of one or more gray (5) pixels within a single row.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - parity: Whether the length is odd or even.
    actions_observed:
      - recoloring: The color of the pixels in the segment changes in the output based on parity.

transformation_rules:
  - description: Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  - description: Within each row, identify contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels.
  - condition: For a gray segment, if its length is odd.
    action: Recolor all pixels in that segment to yellow (4) in the corresponding output grid location.
  - condition: For a gray segment, if its length is even.
    action: Recolor all pixels in that segment to orange (7) in the corresponding output grid location.
  - condition: Pixel is white (0).
    action: Keep the pixel color unchanged in the output grid.

relationships:
  - The output color of a former gray pixel depends solely on the length of the contiguous horizontal gray segment it belonged to in the input grid row.
  - White pixels act as separators within rows and are static.
  - Transformations are applied independently to each row.
