The output replaces the orange pixels with either azure (8) or gray (5), keeping the white background pixels unchanged.\n3.  **Objects:** The orange pixels in the input form contiguous horizontal segments or \"blocks\" separated by one or more white pixels. These orange blocks are the primary objects of interest.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the orange blocks. The specific color change (to azure or gray) appears dependent on a property of the original orange block.\n5.  **Pattern Identification:** Comparing the input and output blocks across the examples reveals a pattern related to the *length* (number of pixels) of each contiguous orange block.\n    *   In `train_1`: Blocks of length 4 and 2 become azure (8); blocks of length 3 become gray (5).\n    *   In `train_2`: Blocks of length 4 and 2 become azure (8); blocks of length 5 and 3 become gray (5).\n    *   In `train_3`: Block of length 6 becomes azure (8); blocks of length 3 and 5 become gray (5).\n6.  **Rule Hypothesis:** The rule seems to be based on the *parity* of the length of the orange block:\n    *   If an orange block has an *even* length, its pixels are changed to azure (8).\n    *   If an orange block has an *odd* length, its pixels are changed to gray (5).\n7.  **Background Invariance:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged throughout the transformation.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
