task_description: Change the color of contiguous horizontal blocks of orange pixels based on the parity of their length.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
  foreground_color_input: orange (7)
  foreground_colors_output: [azure (8), gray (5)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color_input: orange (7)
    properties:
      - length: integer (number of pixels in the block)
      - parity: derived from length (even or odd)
    relationship: Separated by one or more white (0) pixels.
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    input: input_grid
    output: list of orange blocks (with start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: recolor_block
    input: orange_block
    output: recolored_block (same size and position)
    rule:
      - if: block.length is even
        then: change color to azure (8)
      - if: block.length is odd
        then: change color to gray (5)
invariance:
  - element: pixels
    property: color
    value: white (0)
    rule: Remain unchanged in the output.
