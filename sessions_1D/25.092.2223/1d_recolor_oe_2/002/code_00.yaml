task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of orange pixels based on the parity of their length.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 (interpreted as a single row)
  colors_present_input: [white (0), orange (7)]
  colors_present_output: [white (0), gray (5), azure (8)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color_input: orange (7)
    properties:
      - length: integer (number of pixels in the block)
      - parity: derived from length (even or odd)
    relationship: Separated by one or more white (0) pixels.
actions:
  - name: identify_orange_blocks
    input: input_grid (single row)
    output: list of orange blocks, each defined by start_index, end_index, and length.
  - name: recolor_blocks
    input: input_grid, list_of_orange_blocks
    output: output_grid (single row)
    rule:
      - for each block:
        - if: block.length is even
          then: change color of pixels in block range to azure (8)
        - if: block.length is odd
          then: change color of pixels in block range to gray (5)
invariance:
  - element: pixels
    property: color
    value: white (0)
    rule: Remain unchanged in the output.
data_handling_note: Execution errors suggest potential type mismatch (e.g., list vs. NumPy array) in the testing environment; implementation should be robust to this.
