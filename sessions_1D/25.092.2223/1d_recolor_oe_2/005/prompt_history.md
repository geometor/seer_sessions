**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are one-dimensional arrays (or single rows).
2.  **Colors:** The input primarily uses white (0) as a background and orange (7) for foreground elements. The output replaces the orange pixels with either azure (8) or gray (5), keeping the white background pixels unchanged.
3.  **Objects:** The orange pixels in the input form contiguous horizontal segments or "blocks" separated by one or more white pixels. These orange blocks are the primary objects of interest.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the orange blocks. The specific color change (to azure or gray) appears dependent on a property of the original orange block.
5.  **Pattern Identification:** Comparing the input and output blocks across the examples reveals a pattern related to the *length* (number of pixels) of each contiguous orange block.
    *   In `train_1`: Blocks of length 4 and 2 become azure (8); blocks of length 3 become gray (5).
    *   In `train_2`: Blocks of length 4 and 2 become azure (8); blocks of length 5 and 3 become gray (5).
    *   In `train_3`: Block of length 6 becomes azure (8); blocks of length 3 and 5 become gray (5).
6.  **Rule Hypothesis:** The rule seems to be based on the *parity* of the length of the orange block:
    *   If an orange block has an *even* length, its pixels are changed to azure (8).
    *   If an orange block has an *odd* length, its pixels are changed to gray (5).
7.  **Background Invariance:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged throughout the transformation.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous horizontal blocks of orange (7) pixels. For each block, record its starting position, ending position, and length.
3.  For each identified orange block:
    a.  Calculate the length of the block.
    b.  Determine if the length is even or odd (check its parity).
    c.  If the length is even, change the color of all pixels within that block's position in the output grid to azure (8).
    d.  If the length is odd, change the color of all pixels within that block's position in the output grid to gray (5).
4.  Leave all white (0) pixels unchanged.
5.  Return the modified output grid.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that the `transform` function, when tested, received a 2D NumPy array (e.g., shape `(1, N)` or `(H, W)`) as `input_grid`, while the helper function `find_orange_blocks` was designed to process only a 1D list or array (a single row). The core logic of identifying orange blocks and recoloring based on length parity appears correct based on the provided examples, but the implementation failed due to this likely dimensionality mismatch during testing.

The strategy is to adapt the `transform` function to handle 2D NumPy array inputs, process the grid row by row, applying the existing block-finding and recoloring logic to each row independently.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

Using code execution to verify assumptions about the input data format and the core logic:

**Findings:**
1.  The inputs are consistently treated as 2D NumPy arrays of shape `(1, N)`, confirming the hypothesis about the source of the error.
2.  The `find_orange_blocks` function works correctly when given a 1D NumPy array (a single row).
3.  The core logic (even length -> azure (8), odd length -> gray (5)) correctly transforms the input to the output for all training examples when applied row-wise (in this case, to the single row present).

    rule: Remain unchanged in the output.
  - element: grid structure
    property: dimensions (shape)
    rule: Output grid shape is identical to input grid shape.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid as a 2D NumPy array.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid using its row index.
4.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) composed entirely of orange (7) pixels. Record the starting column index, ending column index, and length for each block found in this row.
    b.  For each identified orange block in the current row:
        i.  Determine the length of the block.
        ii. Check if the length is even or odd.
        iii. If the length is even, set the color of the pixels in the output grid corresponding to this block's row index and column range (from start index to end index, inclusive) to azure (8).
        iv. If the length is odd, set the color of the pixels in the output grid corresponding to this block's row index and column range to gray (5).
5.  Pixels that were not part of an orange block remain unchanged in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
