task_description: Change the color of contiguous horizontal blocks of orange pixels within each row of the grid based on the parity of their length.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2 (potentially HxW, examples are 1xN)
  background_color: white (0)
  foreground_color_input: orange (7)
  foreground_colors_output: [azure (8), gray (5)]
objects:
  - type: horizontal_contiguous_block
    color_input: orange (7)
    scope: within a single row
    properties:
      - length: integer (number of pixels in the block)
      - parity: derived from length (even or odd)
    relationship: Separated horizontally by one or more non-orange pixels.
actions:
  - name: process_grid_by_row
    input: input_grid (2D numpy array)
    output: output_grid (2D numpy array)
    steps:
      - Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
      - For each row in input_grid:
        - Identify horizontal orange blocks in the current row.
        - For each identified block:
          - Calculate block length.
          - Determine new color based on length parity (even -> 8, odd -> 5).
          - Update the corresponding segment in the current row of output_grid with the new color.
invariance:
  - element: pixels
    property: color
    value: not orange (7) # Primarily white (0) in examples
    rule: Remain unchanged in the output.
  - element: grid structure
    property: dimensions (shape)
    rule: Output grid shape is identical to input grid shape.
