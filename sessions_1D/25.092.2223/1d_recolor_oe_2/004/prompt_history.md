**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are one-dimensional arrays (or single rows).
2.  **Colors:** The input primarily uses white (0) as a background and orange (7) for foreground elements. The output replaces the orange pixels with either azure (8) or gray (5), keeping the white background pixels unchanged.
3.  **Objects:** The orange pixels in the input form contiguous horizontal segments or "blocks" separated by one or more white pixels. These orange blocks are the primary objects of interest.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the orange blocks. The specific color change (to azure or gray) appears dependent on a property of the original orange block.
5.  **Pattern Identification:** Comparing the input and output blocks across the examples reveals a pattern related to the *length* (number of pixels) of each contiguous orange block.
    *   In `train_1`: Blocks of length 4 and 2 become azure (8); blocks of length 3 become gray (5).
    *   In `train_2`: Blocks of length 4 and 2 become azure (8); blocks of length 5 and 3 become gray (5).
    *   In `train_3`: Block of length 6 becomes azure (8); blocks of length 3 and 5 become gray (5).
6.  **Rule Hypothesis:** The rule seems to be based on the *parity* of the length of the orange block:
    *   If an orange block has an *even* length, its pixels are changed to azure (8).
    *   If an orange block has an *odd* length, its pixels are changed to gray (5).
7.  **Background Invariance:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged throughout the transformation.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Change the color of contiguous horizontal blocks of orange pixels based on the parity of their length.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
  foreground_color_input: orange (7)
  foreground_colors_output: [azure (8), gray (5)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color_input: orange (7)
    properties:
      - length: integer (number of pixels in the block)
      - parity: derived from length (even or odd)
    relationship: Separated by one or more white (0) pixels.
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    input: input_grid
    output: list of orange blocks (with start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: recolor_block
    input: orange_block
    output: recolored_block (same size and position)
    rule:
      - if: block.length is even
        then: change color to azure (8)
      - if: block.length is odd
        then: change color to gray (5)
invariance:
  - element: pixels
    property: color
    value: white (0)
    rule: Remain unchanged in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous horizontal blocks of orange (7) pixels. For each block, record its starting position, ending position, and length.
3.  For each identified orange block:
    a.  Calculate the length of the block.
    b.  Determine if the length is even or odd (check its parity).
    c.  If the length is even, change the color of all pixels within that block's position in the output grid to azure (8).
    d.  If the length is odd, change the color of all pixels within that block's position in the output grid to gray (5).
4.  Leave all white (0) pixels unchanged.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
