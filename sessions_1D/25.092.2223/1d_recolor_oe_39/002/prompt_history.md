**Perception:**

The input and output are represented as single rows (or 1D arrays) of pixels. Both have the same length. The transformation modifies the colors of certain pixels while keeping others the same. Specifically, the background color (white, 0) remains unchanged. The non-background color (azure, 8) in the input is transformed into either blue (1) or gray (5) in the output.

Observing the pattern, the input contains several contiguous segments (objects) of azure pixels separated by white pixels. The transformation rule appears to depend on the order of these azure objects. The first encountered azure object (reading from left to right) changes its color to blue (1). All subsequent azure objects change their color to gray (5). The size and position of these objects remain the same; only their color changes based on their order of appearance.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Color transformation based on object order.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
  size_preservation: Input and output have the same length.
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous segments of non-background pixels
  - input_color: 8 (azure)
  - output_colors: 1 (blue), 5 (gray)
transformation_rule:
  - Preserve background pixels (color 0).
  - Identify contiguous segments (objects) of azure (color 8) pixels.
  - Change the color of the first azure object encountered (left-to-right) to blue (color 1).
  - Change the color of all subsequent azure objects to gray (color 5).
  - The shape and position of the objects are maintained.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output array with the same dimensions as the input array.
2.  Initialize a flag, `first_object_found`, to `false`.
3.  Iterate through the input array from left to right.
4.  If the current pixel is the background color (white, 0), copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output array.
5.  If the current pixel is the non-background color (azure, 8):
    a.  Check if this pixel is the start of a new contiguous segment (object) of azure pixels (i.e., it's the first pixel or the previous pixel was white).
    b.  If it is the start of a new object:
        i.  If `first_object_found` is `false`, set the target color for this object to blue (1) and set `first_object_found` to `true`.
        ii. If `first_object_found` is `true`, set the target color for this object to gray (5).
    c.  Copy the determined target color (either blue or gray) to the corresponding position in the output array for all pixels belonging to the current contiguous azure object. Continue iterating from the end of the current object.
6.  Return the completed output array.
```python
"""
Color transformation based on object order.

This transformation operates on a 1D array of pixels.
It identifies contiguous segments (objects) of azure (color 8) pixels against a white (color 0) background.
The background pixels remain unchanged.
The first contiguous segment of azure pixels encountered when scanning from left to right is changed to blue (color 1).
All subsequent contiguous segments of azure pixels are changed to gray (color 5).
The length of the array and the positions of the segments are preserved.
