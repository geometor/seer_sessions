task_description: Color transformation of azure objects based on sequence and separation.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
  size_preservation: Input and output have the same length.
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous segments of non-background pixels
  - input_color: 8 (azure)
  - output_colors: 1 (blue), 5 (gray)
transformation_rule:
  - Preserve background pixels (color 0).
  - Identify contiguous segments (objects) of azure (color 8) pixels, scanning left-to-right.
  - Count the number of consecutive white (color 0) pixels forming the gap between adjacent azure objects.
  - Color the first azure object blue (1).
  - If a second azure object exists, color it gray (5).
  - For the third and subsequent azure objects:
    - If the gap immediately preceding the object consists of 3 or more white pixels, color the object blue (1).
    - Otherwise (if the gap has 0, 1, or 2 white pixels), color the object gray (5).
  - The shape and position of the objects are maintained.
