            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core elements: 1D grids, background preservation, and transformation of azure (8) objects. However, the initial rule (\"first object blue, rest gray\") was too simplistic and failed on Example 2. The Python code failed due to a `ValueError` likely caused by mishandling the input grid's dimensionality (assuming 1D when it might be 2D with shape `(1, N)`), leading to an attempt to use a boolean array in a scalar `if` condition.\n\nThe refined analysis, triggered by the failure on Example 2, revealed a more complex rule involving the gaps between objects. Hypothesis 4 successfully accounts for all three training examples: the first object is always blue (1), the second is always gray (5), and subsequent objects are blue (1) if the preceding gap of white (0) pixels is 3 or more, otherwise they are gray (5).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Correct the input handling in the Python code to reliably flatten the input grid to 1D, regardless of whether it's passed as a 1D list, a 2D list `[[...]]`, or a 2D NumPy array `(1, N)` or `(N, 1)`.\n2.  Implement the logic derived from Hypothesis 4. This involves iterating through the grid, identifying azure objects and the white gaps between them, and applying the specific coloring rule based on the object's sequence number (1st, 2nd, or 3rd+) and the preceding gap length.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nUsing the provided tool code to analyze the examples:\n\n"
