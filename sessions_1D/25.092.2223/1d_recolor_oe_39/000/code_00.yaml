task_description: Color transformation based on object order.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
  size_preservation: Input and output have the same length.
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous segments of non-background pixels
  - input_color: 8 (azure)
  - output_colors: 1 (blue), 5 (gray)
transformation_rule:
  - Preserve background pixels (color 0).
  - Identify contiguous segments (objects) of azure (color 8) pixels.
  - Change the color of the first azure object encountered (left-to-right) to blue (color 1).
  - Change the color of all subsequent azure objects to gray (color 5).
