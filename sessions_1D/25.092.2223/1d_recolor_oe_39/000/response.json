The transformation modifies the colors of certain pixels while keeping others the same. Specifically, the background color (white, 0) remains unchanged. The non-background color (azure, 8) in the input is transformed into either blue (1) or gray (5) in the output.\n\nObserving the pattern, the input contains several contiguous segments (objects) of azure pixels separated by white pixels. The transformation rule appears to depend on the order of these azure objects. The first encountered azure object (reading from left to right) changes its color to blue (1). All subsequent azure objects change their color to gray (5). The size and position of these objects remain the same; only their color changes based on their order of appearance.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
