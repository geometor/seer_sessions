The first azure object is always colored blue (1).\n2. The second azure object is always colored gray (5).\n3. For the third and subsequent azure objects:\n    - If the gap of white pixels immediately preceding the object has a length of 3 or more, the object is colored blue (1).\n    - Otherwise (gap length 0, 1, or 2), the object is colored gray (5).\nThe length of the array and the positions/shapes of the segments are preserved.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the described color transformation to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list or np.array): A list, list of lists (with one inner list), \n                                       or numpy array representing the input pixels.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A 1D list representing the transformed pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a flattened 1D numpy array\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int).flatten()\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    # This preserves background (0) pixels automatically.\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n\n    # Initialize state variables\n    object_index = 0       # Counter for azure objects found\n    prev_object_end = -1   # Index immediately after the end of the previous azure object\n    n = len(grid)          # Length of the grid\n    i = 0                  # Current position in the grid\n\n    # Iterate through the grid\n    while i < n:\n        # Check if the current pixel is azure (8)\n        if grid[i] == 8:\n            # Found the start of a potential azure object\n            current_object_start = i\n            \n            # Check if it's *actually* the start of a new object \n            # (i.e., not a continuation of the previous one we might have iterated over)\n            # This check simplifies because we jump 'i' forward after processing an object.\n            # If grid[i] is 8, it must be the start of a new segment to process.\n            \n            object_index += 1\n            \n            # Determine the target color based on the object index and preceding gap\n            target_color = -1 # Default/error value\n            if object_index == 1:\n                target_color = 1  # First object is blue\n            elif object_index == 2:\n                target_color = 5  # Second object is gray\n            else: # Third object or later\n                # Calculate the gap length before this object\n                # Gap starts right after the previous object ends (prev_object_end)\n                # Gap ends right before this object starts (current_object_start)\n                gap_length = current_object_start - prev_object_end\n                \n                if gap_length >= 3:\n                    target_color = 1  # Blue if gap is 3 or more\n                else:\n                    target_color = 5  # Gray if gap is less than 3\n\n            # Find the end of the current contiguous azure object\n            # Move 'j' to find where the sequence of 8s ends\n            j = current_object_start\n            while j < n and grid[j] == 8:\n                j += 1\n            current_object_end = j # j is now the index *after* the last 8\n\n            # Color the entire object in the output grid with the target color\n            output_grid[current_object_start:current_object_end] = target_color\n            \n            # Update the end position of the 'previous' object for the next iteration\n            prev_object_end = current_object_end\n            \n            # Move the main loop index 'i' past the object we just processed\n            i = current_object_end \n        \n        else:\n            # If the current pixel is not azure (it's white), just move to the next pixel\n            i += 1\n\n    # Return the modified grid as a standard Python list\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
