**Perception:**

The input and output are represented as single rows (or 1D arrays) of pixels. Both have the same length. The transformation modifies the colors of certain pixels while keeping others the same. Specifically, the background color (white, 0) remains unchanged. The non-background color (azure, 8) in the input is transformed into either blue (1) or gray (5) in the output.

Observing the pattern, the input contains several contiguous segments (objects) of azure pixels separated by white pixels. The transformation rule appears to depend on the order of these azure objects. The first encountered azure object (reading from left to right) changes its color to blue (1). All subsequent azure objects change their color to gray (5). The size and position of these objects remain the same; only their color changes based on their order of appearance.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Color transformation based on object order.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
  size_preservation: Input and output have the same length.
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous segments of non-background pixels
  - input_color: 8 (azure)
  - output_colors: 1 (blue), 5 (gray)
transformation_rule:
  - Preserve background pixels (color 0).
  - Identify contiguous segments (objects) of azure (color 8) pixels.
  - Change the color of the first azure object encountered (left-to-right) to blue (color 1).
  - Change the color of all subsequent azure objects to gray (color 5).
  - The shape and position of the objects are maintained.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output array with the same dimensions as the input array.
2.  Initialize a flag, `first_object_found`, to `false`.
3.  Iterate through the input array from left to right.
4.  If the current pixel is the background color (white, 0), copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output array.
5.  If the current pixel is the non-background color (azure, 8):
    a.  Check if this pixel is the start of a new contiguous segment (object) of azure pixels (i.e., it's the first pixel or the previous pixel was white).
    b.  If it is the start of a new object:
        i.  If `first_object_found` is `false`, set the target color for this object to blue (1) and set `first_object_found` to `true`.
        ii. If `first_object_found` is `true`, set the target color for this object to gray (5).
    c.  Copy the determined target color (either blue or gray) to the corresponding position in the output array for all pixels belonging to the current contiguous azure object. Continue iterating from the end of the current object.
6.  Return the completed output array.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core elements: 1D grids, background preservation, and transformation of azure (8) objects. However, the initial rule ("first object blue, rest gray") was too simplistic and failed on Example 2. The Python code failed due to a `ValueError` likely caused by mishandling the input grid's dimensionality (assuming 1D when it might be 2D with shape `(1, N)`), leading to an attempt to use a boolean array in a scalar `if` condition.

The refined analysis, triggered by the failure on Example 2, revealed a more complex rule involving the gaps between objects. Hypothesis 4 successfully accounts for all three training examples: the first object is always blue (1), the second is always gray (5), and subsequent objects are blue (1) if the preceding gap of white (0) pixels is 3 or more, otherwise they are gray (5).

**Strategy:**

1.  Correct the input handling in the Python code to reliably flatten the input grid to 1D, regardless of whether it's passed as a 1D list, a 2D list `[[...]]`, or a 2D NumPy array `(1, N)` or `(N, 1)`.
2.  Implement the logic derived from Hypothesis 4. This involves iterating through the grid, identifying azure objects and the white gaps between them, and applying the specific coloring rule based on the object's sequence number (1st, 2nd, or 3rd+) and the preceding gap length.

**Metrics:**

Using the provided tool code to analyze the examples:


```
Example 1:
  Input:    [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
  Output:   [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]
  Objects:  [{'start': 2, 'end': 8}, {'start': 9, 'end': 10}, {'start': 11, 'end': 14}, {'start': 15, 'end': 18}] (Count: 4)
  Gaps:     [{'length': 1}, {'length': 1}, {'length': 1}] (Lengths between objects 2&3, 3&4)
  Rule App: Obj1 -> 1. Obj2 -> 5. Obj3 (Gap 1 < 3) -> 5. Obj4 (Gap 1 < 3) -> 5. (Matches Output)

Example 2:
  Input:    [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  Output:   [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  Objects:  [{'start': 2, 'end': 4}, {'start': 5, 'end': 10}, {'start': 13, 'end': 17}] (Count: 3)
  Gaps:     [{'length': 1}, {'length': 3}] (Length between objects 2&3)
  Rule App: Obj1 -> 1. Obj2 -> 5. Obj3 (Gap 3 >= 3) -> 1. (Matches Output)

Example 3:
  Input:    [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Output:   [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Objects:  [{'start': 2, 'end': 8}, {'start': 11, 'end': 14}] (Count: 2)
  Gaps:     [{'length': 3}] (Length between objects 1&2)
  Rule App: Obj1 -> 1. Obj2 -> 5. (Matches Output)
```


The metrics confirm that Hypothesis 4 holds for all training examples.

  - Preserve background pixels (color 0).
  - Identify contiguous segments (objects) of azure (color 8) pixels, scanning left-to-right.
  - Count the number of consecutive white (color 0) pixels forming the gap between adjacent azure objects.
  - Color the first azure object blue (1).
  - If a second azure object exists, color it gray (5).
  - For the third and subsequent azure objects:
    - If the gap immediately preceding the object consists of 3 or more white pixels, color the object blue (1).
    - Otherwise (if the gap has 0, 1, or 2 white pixels), color the object gray (5).
  - The shape and position of the objects are maintained.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output array with the same dimensions as the input array.
2.  Flatten the input grid into a 1D array if it isn't already. Copy the input to the output array.
3.  Initialize an object counter `object_index` to 0.
4.  Initialize the start index of the previous object `prev_object_end` to -1.
5.  Iterate through the flattened input array using an index `i`.
6.  If the current pixel `input[i]` is azure (8) and it marks the beginning of a new object (i.e., `i == 0` or `input[i-1]` is not 8):
    a.  Increment `object_index`.
    b.  Determine the start index `current_object_start` as `i`.
    c.  Determine the target color for this object:
        i.   If `object_index` is 1, set `target_color` to blue (1).
        ii.  If `object_index` is 2, set `target_color` to gray (5).
        iii. If `object_index` is greater than 2:
             - Calculate the gap length: `gap_length = current_object_start - prev_object_end`. (Note: `prev_object_end` was the index *after* the last pixel of the previous object).
             - If `gap_length >= 3`, set `target_color` to blue (1).
             - Otherwise (`gap_length < 3`), set `target_color` to gray (5).
    d.  Find the end of the current object: Iterate `j` from `i` while `input[j]` is 8. Let `current_object_end` be the index *after* the last 8.
    e.  Fill the corresponding segment (`current_object_start` to `current_object_end`) in the output array with `target_color`.
    f.  Update `prev_object_end` to `current_object_end`.
    g.  Set the main loop index `i` to `current_object_end` to continue scanning after the current object.
7.  If the current pixel `input[i]` is not the start of an azure object, simply increment `i`.
8.  Return the completed output array.
