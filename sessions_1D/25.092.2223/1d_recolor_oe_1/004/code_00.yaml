task_description: Recolor distinct red objects based on scanning order.
elements:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white(0), red(2) in input; white(0), maroon(9), orange(7) in output.
      - position: Defined by row and column index.
  - element: object
    properties:
      - color: red(2) in input grid.
      - contiguity: Defined by 8-way adjacency (including diagonals). Pixels of the same color touching sides or corners form a single object.
      - pixels: A set of coordinates belonging to the object.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Adjacency (8-way) between pixels of the same color defines objects.
  - type: temporal/ordinal
    description: The order in which red pixels (and thus objects) are encountered when scanning the grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
transformation:
  - type: object_identification
    input_color: red(2)
    algorithm: Find all distinct contiguous groups (objects) of red(2) pixels using 8-way adjacency.
  - type: object_selection
    criteria: Identify the specific red(2) object that contains the first red(2) pixel encountered during a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of the input grid.
  - type: conditional_recoloring_by_object
    target_objects: all red(2) objects
    rules:
      - if: The object is the selected "first" object (containing the first red pixel encountered in scan order).
        action: Recolor all pixels belonging to this object to maroon(9).
      - if: The object is *not* the selected "first" object.
        action: Recolor all pixels belonging to this object to orange(7).
  - type: identity
    input_color: white(0)
    output_color: white(0)
    condition: Always applied to white pixels.
grid_properties:
  - size: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
