            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code attempt failed because it misinterpreted the condition for changing red (2) pixels to maroon (9) versus orange (7). The initial simple rule about pixels below was incorrect, and the subsequent attempt based on the \"top-most segment\" was also flawed or incorrectly implemented, resulting in all red pixels being changed to maroon (9).\n\nThe analysis of all three examples reveals a more complex rule: the transformation depends on identifying distinct contiguous red \"objects\" (where connectivity includes diagonals). Only the object containing the *very first* red pixel encountered during a standard top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan is recolored to maroon (9). All other red objects are recolored to orange (7). White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Implement an algorithm to find all contiguous objects of a given color (red=2 in this case), considering 8-way adjacency (including diagonals). A Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from unvisited red pixels is suitable.\n2.  While iterating through the grid (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to find starting points for the object search, identify the coordinates of the first red pixel encountered.\n3.  Perform the object search (e.g., BFS) starting from this first red pixel to find all coordinates belonging to the \"first\" object.\n4.  Perform searches for all remaining red objects.\n5.  Create the output grid:\n    *   Copy white pixels.\n    *   Color pixels belonging to the \"first\" red object as maroon (9).\n    *   Color pixels belonging to all *other* red objects as orange (7).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nMetrics based on the failed results provided for the \"Previous Code\":\n"
