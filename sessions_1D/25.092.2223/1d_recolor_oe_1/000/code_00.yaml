task_description: Recolor red pixels based on vertical adjacency.
elements:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white(0), red(2) in input; white(0), maroon(9), orange(7) in output.
      - position: Defined by row and column index.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Vertical adjacency between pixels. Specifically, whether a pixel has another pixel of the same color directly below it.
transformation:
  - type: conditional_recoloring
    input_color: red(2)
    output_colors: [maroon(9), orange(7)]
    condition:
      - based_on: pixel below
      - rule: If the pixel directly below a red(2) pixel is also red(2), the original pixel becomes maroon(9).
      - rule: Otherwise (if the pixel below is not red(2) or if it's the last row), the red(2) pixel becomes orange(7).
  - type: identity
    input_color: white(0)
    output_color: white(0)
    condition: Always applied to white pixels.
grid_properties:
  - size: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
