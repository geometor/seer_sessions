Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples.
2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), maroon (9), and orange (7) pixels.
3.  **Static Pixels:** White pixels (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output at the same locations.
4.  **Dynamic Pixels:** Red pixels (2) in the input are transformed into either maroon (9) or orange (7) in the output.
5.  **Transformation Clue:** The color change for red pixels seems to depend on their vertical relationship with other red pixels. Specifically, if a red pixel has another red pixel directly below it, it transforms differently than if it doesn't.
    *   In `train_1`, the top row of `2`s becomes `9`s because they have `2`s below them (in the next row, same column implicitly, as part of the larger red shape). The middle row of `2`s becomes `7`s as they have white `0`s below them. The isolated bottom `2`s also become `7`s as they have white `0`s below them.
    *   This pattern holds for `train_2` and `train_3` as well. Red pixels with a red pixel directly underneath become maroon (9). All other red pixels become orange (7).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor red pixels based on vertical adjacency.
elements:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white(0), red(2) in input; white(0), maroon(9), orange(7) in output.
      - position: Defined by row and column index.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Vertical adjacency between pixels. Specifically, whether a pixel has another pixel of the same color directly below it.
transformation:
  - type: conditional_recoloring
    input_color: red(2)
    output_colors: [maroon(9), orange(7)]
    condition:
      - based_on: pixel below
      - rule: If the pixel directly below a red(2) pixel is also red(2), the original pixel becomes maroon(9).
      - rule: Otherwise (if the pixel below is not red(2) or if it's the last row), the red(2) pixel becomes orange(7).
  - type: identity
    input_color: white(0)
    output_color: white(0)
    condition: Always applied to white pixels.
grid_properties:
  - size: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  For the current cell at `(row, col)`:
    a.  If the color of the input cell is white (0), set the color of the corresponding cell `(row, col)` in the new grid to white (0).
    b.  If the color of the input cell is red (2):
        i.  Check if there is a cell directly below it (i.e., if `row + 1` is a valid row index within the grid).
        ii. If there is a cell below AND the color of the input cell at `(row + 1, col)` is also red (2), set the color of the cell `(row, col)` in the new grid to maroon (9).
        iii. Otherwise (if there is no cell below or the cell below is not red), set the color of the cell `(row, col)` in the new grid to orange (7).
4.  Return the new grid as the output.
