The output grids contain white (0), maroon (9), and orange (7) pixels.\n3.  **Static Pixels:** White pixels (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output at the same locations.\n4.  **Dynamic Pixels:** Red pixels (2) in the input are transformed into either maroon (9) or orange (7) in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Clue:** The color change for red pixels seems to depend on their vertical relationship with other red pixels. Specifically, if a red pixel has another red pixel directly below it, it transforms differently than if it doesn't.\n    *   In `train_1`, the top row of `2`s becomes `9`s because they have `2`s below them (in the next row, same column implicitly, as part of the larger red shape). The middle row of `2`s becomes `7`s as they have white `0`s below them. The isolated bottom `2`s also become `7`s as they have white `0`s below them.\n    *   This pattern holds for `train_2` and `train_3` as well. Red pixels with a red pixel directly underneath become maroon (9). All other red pixels become orange (7).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
