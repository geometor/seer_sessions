task_description: Recolor vertical segments of red pixels based on whether they are the first segment encountered.
elements:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white(0), red(2) in input; white(0), maroon(9), orange(7) in output.
      - position: Defined by row and column index. Assumed grid shape is Nx1.
  - element: vertical_segment
    properties:
      - color: Consists only of red(2) pixels in the input.
      - contiguity: Pixels are vertically adjacent (same column, consecutive rows).
      - start_row: The minimum row index of any pixel in the segment.
      - pixels: A list of coordinates belonging to the segment.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Vertical adjacency defines segments.
  - type: ordering
    description: Segments can be ordered by their start_row.
transformation:
  - type: identity
    input_color: white(0)
    output_color: white(0)
    condition: Always applied to white pixels.
  - type: segment_recoloring
    input_color: red(2)
    output_colors: [maroon(9), orange(7)]
    condition:
      - based_on: Identifying all vertical red(2) segments and their start_row.
      - rule: Find the segment with the minimum start_row (the "first" segment). Recolor all pixels in this segment to maroon(9).
      - rule: Recolor all pixels in all other red(2) segments to orange(7).
grid_properties:
  - size: Input and output grids have identical dimensions. Believed to be Nx1 (specifically 23x1 for examples).
