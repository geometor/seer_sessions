They maintain the same dimensions.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Input uses white (0) and maroon (9).\n    *   Output uses white (0), green (3), and magenta (6).\n3.  **Pixel Transformation:**\n    *   White (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) in the output.\n    *   Maroon (9) pixels in the input are transformed into either green (3) or magenta (6) in the output.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The relevant objects appear to be contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of maroon (9) pixels. These blocks are separated by one or more white (0) pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation of a maroon pixel depends on which block it belongs to.\n    *   The *first* block of maroon pixels (reading from left to right) is entirely converted to green (3).\n    *   *All subsequent* blocks of maroon pixels are entirely converted to magenta (6).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
