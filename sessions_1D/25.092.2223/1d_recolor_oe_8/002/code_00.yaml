task_type: color_transformation
grid_properties:
  - input_output_shape: identical
  - all_examples_shape: (1, 18) # Single row grid
  - transformation_scope: row-independent (verified by single row examples)
input_colors:
  - white (0)
  - maroon (9)
output_colors:
  - white (0)
  - green (3)
  - magenta (6)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: maroon (9)
    scope: within_each_row
    separation: by one or more white (0) pixels within the row
transformation_rule:
  - iterate: through each row of the input grid
  - within_each_row:
      - initialize: 'first_maroon_block_processed' flag to false
      - iterate: through pixels from left to right
      - identify: contiguous horizontal blocks of maroon (9) pixels
      - apply_transformation:
          - for pixels in the first identified maroon block: change color to green (3)
          - for pixels in all subsequent identified maroon blocks: change color to magenta (6)
          - for white (0) pixels: keep color as white (0)
  - output: a new grid with the transformed pixels
