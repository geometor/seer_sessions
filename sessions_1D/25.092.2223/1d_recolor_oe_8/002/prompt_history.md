Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are single-row grids (or potentially multi-row, but presented linearly). They maintain the same dimensions.
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Input uses white (0) and maroon (9).
    *   Output uses white (0), green (3), and magenta (6).
3.  **Pixel Transformation:**
    *   White (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) in the output.
    *   Maroon (9) pixels in the input are transformed into either green (3) or magenta (6) in the output.
4.  **Object Identification:** The relevant objects appear to be contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of maroon (9) pixels. These blocks are separated by one or more white (0) pixels.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation of a maroon pixel depends on which block it belongs to.
    *   The *first* block of maroon pixels (reading from left to right) is entirely converted to green (3).
    *   *All subsequent* blocks of maroon pixels are entirely converted to magenta (6).

**Facts:**

task_type: color_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: unchanged_between_input_output
input_colors:
  - white (0)
  - maroon (9)
output_colors:
  - white (0)
  - green (3)
  - magenta (6)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: maroon (9)
    separation: by white (0) pixels
transformation_rule:
  - target: maroon (9) pixels
  - condition: depends on the block's order of appearance (left-to-right)
  - outcomes:
      - if pixel belongs to the first block: change to green (3)
      - if pixel belongs to any subsequent block: change to magenta (6)
  - target: white (0) pixels
  - outcomes:
      - remain white (0)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid, identifying contiguous horizontal blocks of maroon (9) pixels. Keep track of the order in which these blocks appear (from left to right).
3.  For each pixel in the input grid:
    a.  If the pixel is white (0), copy its value to the corresponding position in the output grid.
    b.  If the pixel is maroon (9):
        i.  Determine which contiguous block of maroon pixels it belongs to.
        ii. If this block is the *first* block encountered (reading left-to-right), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (3).
        iii. If this block is *not* the first block encountered, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to magenta (6).
4.  Return the completed output grid.
