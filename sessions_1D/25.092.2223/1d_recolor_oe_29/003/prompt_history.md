**Perception:**

The input and output are single-row grids (1-dimensional arrays). The primary color in the input is orange (7), interspersed with the background color white (0). The output transforms the orange pixels into either azure (8) or magenta (6), while leaving the white pixels unchanged. The transformation appears to depend on the properties of contiguous blocks of orange pixels. Specifically, the length of each contiguous orange block determines the output color for that block.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1-dimensional array
Input_Colors:
  - 0: white (background)
  - 7: orange (object color)
Output_Colors:
  - 0: white (background)
  - 6: magenta
  - 8: azure
Objects:
  Definition: Contiguous sequences (blocks) of orange (7) pixels.
  Properties:
    - Length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
    - Parity: Whether the length is even or odd.
Transformation:
  Action: Recolor orange blocks based on their length parity.
  Mapping:
    - If orange block length is even: Recolor pixels to azure (8).
    - If orange block length is odd: Recolor pixels to magenta (6).
  Unaffected: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Defines the contiguous blocks of orange pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous blocks of orange (7) pixels in the input grid. A block is defined as one or more adjacent orange pixels.
2.  For each identified orange block:
    a.  Calculate the length (number of pixels) of the block.
    b.  Check if the length is even or odd.
    c.  If the length is even, change the color of all pixels within that block to azure (8) in the output grid.
    d.  If the length is odd, change the color of all pixels within that block to magenta (6) in the output grid.
3.  Keep all white (0) pixels in their original positions in the output grid.
4.  Construct the final output grid based on these transformations.

## Example 3:

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: identify contiguous blocks of orange (7), determine their length, and recolor them based on whether the length is even (azure, 8) or odd (magenta, 6). The background white (0) pixels remain unchanged.

The provided Python code attempts to implement this logic but fails on all training examples with the error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a boolean context where a single True/False value is expected (e.g., `if my_numpy_array:`). This strongly suggests that the `input_grid` is being passed or treated as a NumPy array, not a standard Python list of lists, and the code's handling of this structure (particularly the check `if not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):`) is causing the issue.

The strategy is to refine the understanding of the input data structure (likely a 2D NumPy array, even if it visually appears 1D) and adjust the implementation accordingly, ensuring compatibility with NumPy array operations. The core logic of finding blocks and checking parity remains valid.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the blocks in each training example to confirm the transformation rule. We'll use the `find_contiguous_blocks` function defined previously, assuming the input is the first row of the grid.

The metric gathering confirms that the transformation rule (recoloring orange blocks based on length parity) correctly predicts the output for all three training examples. The issue lies solely within the previous code's implementation, likely its handling of the input data format (expecting NumPy arrays).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2-dimensional array (likely NumPy array), observed as 1xN in examples.
  Dimensions: All examples show a height of 1. Width varies.
Input_Colors:
  - 0: white (background)
  - 7: orange (object color)
Output_Colors:
  - 0: white (background, preserved)
  - 6: magenta
  - 8: azure
Objects:
  Definition: Contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of orange (7) pixels within the single row.
  Properties:
    - Start_Index: The column index where the block begins.
    - Length: The number of orange pixels in the sequence.
    - Parity: Whether the length is even or odd.
Transformation:
  Action: Recolor orange blocks based on the parity of their length.
  Mapping:
    - If an orange block has an even length: Recolor all pixels in that block to azure (8).
    - If an orange block has an odd length: Recolor all pixels in that block to magenta (6).
  Unaffected: White (0) pixels remain unchanged in their original positions.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Horizontal adjacency defines the contiguous blocks of orange pixels.
Assumptions:
  - Input grids in this task always have a height of 1.
  - Input data structure within the execution environment is likely a NumPy array.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid (assumed to be a 2D structure, likely a NumPy array, with a height of 1).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the extracted row to identify all contiguous blocks of orange (7) pixels. For each block, record its starting column index and its length (number of pixels).
5.  For each identified orange block:
    a.  Determine if the block's length is even or odd (check the parity).
    b.  If the length is even, set the color of the corresponding pixels (from the start index for the calculated length) in the first row of the *output* grid to azure (8).
    c.  If the length is odd, set the color of the corresponding pixels in the first row of the *output* grid to magenta (6).
6.  Ensure all pixels that were originally white (0) remain white (0) in the output grid (this is handled by modifying a copy and only changing orange blocks).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
