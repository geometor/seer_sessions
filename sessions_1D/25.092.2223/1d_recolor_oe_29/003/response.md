"""
Transforms the input grid based on the parity of the length of contiguous orange blocks.
Identifies contiguous horizontal blocks of orange (7) pixels in the input grid (which is always 1xN).
Calculates the length of each orange block.
If the block length is even, recolors the pixels in that block to azure (8) in the output.
If the block length is odd, recolors the pixels in that block to magenta (6) in the output.
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
