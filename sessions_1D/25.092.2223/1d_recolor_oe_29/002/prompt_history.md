**Perception:**

The input and output are single-row grids (1-dimensional arrays). The primary color in the input is orange (7), interspersed with the background color white (0). The output transforms the orange pixels into either azure (8) or magenta (6), while leaving the white pixels unchanged. The transformation appears to depend on the properties of contiguous blocks of orange pixels. Specifically, the length of each contiguous orange block determines the output color for that block.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 1-dimensional array
Input_Colors:
  - 0: white (background)
  - 7: orange (object color)
Output_Colors:
  - 0: white (background)
  - 6: magenta
  - 8: azure
Objects:
  Definition: Contiguous sequences (blocks) of orange (7) pixels.
  Properties:
    - Length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
    - Parity: Whether the length is even or odd.
Transformation:
  Action: Recolor orange blocks based on their length parity.
  Mapping:
    - If orange block length is even: Recolor pixels to azure (8).
    - If orange block length is odd: Recolor pixels to magenta (6).
  Unaffected: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Defines the contiguous blocks of orange pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous blocks of orange (7) pixels in the input grid. A block is defined as one or more adjacent orange pixels.
2.  For each identified orange block:
    a.  Calculate the length (number of pixels) of the block.
    b.  Check if the length is even or odd.
    c.  If the length is even, change the color of all pixels within that block to azure (8) in the output grid.
    d.  If the length is odd, change the color of all pixels within that block to magenta (6) in the output grid.
3.  Keep all white (0) pixels in their original positions in the output grid.
4.  Construct the final output grid based on these transformations.
