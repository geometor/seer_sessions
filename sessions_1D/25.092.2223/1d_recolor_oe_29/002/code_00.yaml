Grid:
  Type: 2-dimensional array (likely NumPy array), observed as 1xN in examples.
  Dimensions: All examples show a height of 1. Width varies.
Input_Colors:
  - 0: white (background)
  - 7: orange (object color)
Output_Colors:
  - 0: white (background, preserved)
  - 6: magenta
  - 8: azure
Objects:
  Definition: Contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of orange (7) pixels within the single row.
  Properties:
    - Start_Index: The column index where the block begins.
    - Length: The number of orange pixels in the sequence.
    - Parity: Whether the length is even or odd.
Transformation:
  Action: Recolor orange blocks based on the parity of their length.
  Mapping:
    - If an orange block has an even length: Recolor all pixels in that block to azure (8).
    - If an orange block has an odd length: Recolor all pixels in that block to magenta (6).
  Unaffected: White (0) pixels remain unchanged in their original positions.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Horizontal adjacency defines the contiguous blocks of orange pixels.
Assumptions:
  - Input grids in this task always have a height of 1.
  - Input data structure within the execution environment is likely a NumPy array.
