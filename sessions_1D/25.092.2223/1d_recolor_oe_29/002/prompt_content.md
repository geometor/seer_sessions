"""
Identifies contiguous blocks of orange (7) pixels in the input grid (a single row).
Calculates the length of each orange block.
If the block length is even, recolors the pixels in that block to azure (8).
If the block length is odd, recolors the pixels in that block to magenta (6).
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
