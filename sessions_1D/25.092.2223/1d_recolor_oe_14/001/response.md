Iterate through the input sequence, identifying contiguous runs of pixels with the same color.
If a run consists of white pixels (0), keep them white in the output.
If a run consists of maroon pixels (9), change the color based on the length of the run:
- If the run length is even, change the pixels to blue (1).
- If the run length is odd, change the pixels to azure (8).
