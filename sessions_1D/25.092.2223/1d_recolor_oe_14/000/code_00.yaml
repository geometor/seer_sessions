elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: 1-dimensional array of pixels.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value from 0-9

objects:
  - type: run
    description: A contiguous subsequence of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the run.
      - length: The number of pixels in the run.

transformations:
  - type: color_change
    input_objects:
      - type: run
        properties:
          - color: 9 (maroon)
    output_objects:
      - type: run
        properties:
          - color: depends on input run length
          - length: same as input run length
    condition: The color of the output run depends on the parity of the length of the input run.
      - if length is even: output color is 1 (blue)
      - if length is odd: output color is 8 (azure)
  - type: color_preservation
    input_objects:
      - type: run
        properties:
          - color: 0 (white)
    output_objects:
      - type: run
        properties:
          - color: 0 (white)
          - length: same as input run length
    condition: Runs of white pixels remain unchanged.

relationships:
  - type: sequence_mapping
    description: Each pixel in the input sequence maps to a corresponding pixel in the output sequence.
  - type: run_mapping
    description: Each contiguous run of pixels in the input maps to a contiguous run of pixels of the same length in the output. The color mapping depends on the input run's color and length.
