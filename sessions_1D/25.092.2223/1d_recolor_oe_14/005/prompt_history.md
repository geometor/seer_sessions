## Perception

The input and output are 1-dimensional sequences of pixels.
The input contains only white (0) and maroon (9) pixels.
The output contains white (0), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels.
White pixels in the input remain white in the output.
Maroon pixels in the input change color in the output.
The transformation appears to operate on contiguous sequences (runs) of maroon pixels.
The color a run of maroon pixels transforms into depends on the length of that run.
Observing the examples:
- Runs of length 2 (even) become blue (1).
- Runs of length 3 (odd) become azure (8).
- Runs of length 4 (even) become blue (1).
- Runs of length 5 (odd) become azure (8).
- Runs of length 6 (even) become blue (1).
The rule seems to be: change runs of maroon pixels with even length to blue, and runs of maroon pixels with odd length to azure.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence, identifying contiguous runs of pixels with the same color.
3.  For each identified run:
    a.  Get the starting index, ending index, color, and length of the run.
    b.  If the color of the run is white (0), fill the corresponding positions (from start index to end index) in the output sequence with white (0).
    c.  If the color of the run is maroon (9):
        i.  Check the length of the run.
        ii. If the length is even, fill the corresponding positions in the output sequence with blue (1).
        iii. If the length is odd, fill the corresponding positions in the output sequence with azure (8).
4.  Return the completed output sequence.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests that the input `input_grid` being passed to the `transform` function is not a 1D list or tuple as assumed, but rather a 2D NumPy array (likely with dimensions 1xN or Nx1, based on the visual representation). Operations like `list(input_grid)` on a 2D NumPy array create a list of rows (each row being a NumPy array), leading to errors when comparing elements or using array slices in boolean contexts.

The core transformation logic identified (replacing maroon runs based on length parity) appears consistent with the examples. The strategy to resolve the error is to:
1.  Recognize the input is a 2D NumPy array.
2.  Flatten the input array into a 1D sequence at the beginning of the function.
3.  Apply the existing run-finding and color transformation logic to this 1D sequence.
4.  Reshape the resulting 1D sequence back into the original 2D shape for the output.

The metrics confirm:
*   Inputs and outputs are 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, N).
*   Input and output shapes always match for a given example.
*   Input colors are white (0) and maroon (9).
*   Output colors are white (0), blue (1), and azure (8).
*   The run analysis on the flattened input matches the perception: maroon runs change color based on length parity (even -> blue (1), odd -> azure (8)), while white runs remain white.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array (e.g., shape 1xN). Record its original shape.
2.  Flatten the input grid into a 1-dimensional sequence of pixels.
3.  Initialize an empty 1-dimensional output sequence of the same length.
4.  Iterate through the flattened input sequence, identifying contiguous runs of pixels with the same color.
5.  For each identified run:
    a.  Determine the starting index, ending index, color, and length of the run.
    b.  If the run's color is white (0), copy the white pixels to the corresponding positions (from start index to end index) in the output sequence.
    c.  If the run's color is maroon (9):
        i.  Check if the length of the run is even or odd.
        ii. If the length is even, fill the corresponding positions in the output sequence with blue (1).
        iii. If the length is odd, fill the corresponding positions in the output sequence with azure (8).
6.  Once all runs are processed, reshape the completed 1-dimensional output sequence back into the original 2D shape recorded in step 1.
7.  Return the transformed 2D output grid.
