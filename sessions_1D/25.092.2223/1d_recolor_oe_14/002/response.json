            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt failed due to an `ImportError: No module named 'skimage'`. This indicates an unnecessary dependency was included in the code. The core logic identified in the Dreamer phase appears sound based on the initial perception: the transformation operates on contiguous runs of maroon pixels, changing their color based on the parity of the run length (even length -> blue, odd length -> azure), while white pixels remain unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-analyze the examples to confirm the run-length parity rule without relying on external libraries for analysis.\n2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on this confirmation.\n3.  Prepare for the Coder phase by ensuring the next code generation avoids unnecessary imports like `skimage`, `numpy`, and `math`.\n\n## Gather Metrics\n\nLet's manually verify the run lengths and transformations for each training example.\n\n**Train 1:**\nInput: `0 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9`\nOutput: `0 1 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 1 1 1 1`\n\nRuns in Input:\n- `0` (len 1) -> `0`\n- `9 9` (len 2, even) -> `1 1` (blue)\n- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`\n- `9 9 9` (len 3, odd) -> `8 8 8` (azure)\n- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`\n- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)\n- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`\n- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)\n- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`\n- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)\n\n**Train 2:**\nInput: `0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0`\nOutput: `0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0`\n\nRuns in Input:\n- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`\n- `9 9 9 9 9 9` (len 6, even) -> `1 1 1 1 1 1` (blue)\n- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`\n- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)\n- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`\n- `9 9 9` (len 3, odd) -> `8 8 8` (azure)\n- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`\n- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)\n- `0` (len 1) -> `0`\n\n**Train 3:**\nInput: `0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0`\nOutput: `0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 8 8 0`\n\nRuns in Input:\n- `0` (len 1) -> `0`\n- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)\n- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`\n- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)\n- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`\n- `9 9` (len 2, even) -> `1 1` (blue)\n- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`\n- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)\n- `0` (len 1) -> `0`\n- `9 9 9` (len 3, odd) -> `8 8 8` (azure)\n- `0` (len 1) -> `0`\n\n**Summary:**\nThe analysis confirms the initial perception across all training examples:\n- White (0) runs remain white (0).\n- Maroon (9) runs of even length become blue (1).\n- Maroon (9) runs of odd length become azure (8).\nThe length of the runs is preserved.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
