elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: 1-dimensional array of pixels. Input and output sequences have the same length.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value from 0-9. Input uses 0 (white) and 9 (maroon). Output uses 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 8 (azure).

objects:
  - type: run
    description: A contiguous subsequence of pixels of the same color within the sequence.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the run.
      - length: The number of pixels in the run.
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel in the run.
      - end_index: The index of the last pixel in the run.

transformations:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    description: Modifies the color of runs based on their original color and length.
    input_objects:
      - type: run
        properties:
          - color: 9 (maroon)
    output_objects:
      - type: run
        properties:
          - color: 1 (blue) if input run length is even, 8 (azure) if input run length is odd.
          - length: same as input run length.
          - start_index: same as input run start_index.
          - end_index: same as input run end_index.
    condition: Applies only to runs where the input color is maroon (9). The output color depends on the parity of the input run's length.

  - type: color_preservation
    description: Preserves the color and properties of runs of a specific color.
    input_objects:
      - type: run
        properties:
          - color: 0 (white)
    output_objects:
      - type: run
        properties:
          - color: 0 (white)
          - length: same as input run length.
          - start_index: same as input run start_index.
          - end_index: same as input run end_index.
    condition: Applies only to runs where the input color is white (0).

relationships:
  - type: sequence_partition
    description: The input sequence is partitioned into a series of non-overlapping, contiguous runs.
  - type: run_mapping
    description: Each run in the input sequence maps directly to a run in the output sequence at the same position (start/end indices) and with the same length. The color of the output run is determined by the transformation rules applied to the input run.
