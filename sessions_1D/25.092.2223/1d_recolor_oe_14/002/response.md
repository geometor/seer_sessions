## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed due to an `ImportError: No module named 'skimage'`. This indicates an unnecessary dependency was included in the code. The core logic identified in the Dreamer phase appears sound based on the initial perception: the transformation operates on contiguous runs of maroon pixels, changing their color based on the parity of the run length (even length -> blue, odd length -> azure), while white pixels remain unchanged.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-analyze the examples to confirm the run-length parity rule without relying on external libraries for analysis.
2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on this confirmation.
3.  Prepare for the Coder phase by ensuring the next code generation avoids unnecessary imports like `skimage`, `numpy`, and `math`.

## Gather Metrics

Let's manually verify the run lengths and transformations for each training example.

**Train 1:**
Input: `0 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9`
Output: `0 1 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 1 1 1 1`

Runs in Input:
- `0` (len 1) -> `0`
- `9 9` (len 2, even) -> `1 1` (blue)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9` (len 3, odd) -> `8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`
- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)

**Train 2:**
Input: `0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0`
Output: `0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0`

Runs in Input:
- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`
- `9 9 9 9 9 9` (len 6, even) -> `1 1 1 1 1 1` (blue)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9` (len 3, odd) -> `8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`
- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)
- `0` (len 1) -> `0`

**Train 3:**
Input: `0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0`
Output: `0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 8 8 0`

Runs in Input:
- `0` (len 1) -> `0`
- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)
- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`
- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`
- `9 9` (len 2, even) -> `1 1` (blue)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)
- `0` (len 1) -> `0`
- `9 9 9` (len 3, odd) -> `8 8 8` (azure)
- `0` (len 1) -> `0`

**Summary:**
The analysis confirms the initial perception across all training examples:
- White (0) runs remain white (0).
- Maroon (9) runs of even length become blue (1).
- Maroon (9) runs of odd length become azure (8).
The length of the runs is preserved.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: 1-dimensional array of pixels. Input and output sequences have the same length.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value from 0-9. Input uses 0 (white) and 9 (maroon). Output uses 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 8 (azure).

    description: A contiguous subsequence of pixels of the same color within the sequence.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the run.

    description: The input sequence is partitioned into a series of non-overlapping, contiguous runs.
  - type: run_mapping
    description: Each run in the input sequence maps directly to a run in the output sequence at the same position (start/end indices) and with the same length. The color of the output run is determined by the transformation rules applied to the input run.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
2.  Initialize a pointer `current_index` to 0.
3.  While `current_index` is less than the length of the input sequence:
    a.  Identify the color (`run_color`) of the pixel at `current_index`.
    b.  Find the length (`run_length`) of the contiguous run of `run_color` starting at `current_index`.
    c.  If `run_color` is maroon (9):
        i.  Determine the target color: blue (1) if `run_length` is even, azure (8) if `run_length` is odd.
        ii. Iterate from `current_index` up to (`current_index + run_length - 1`). For each index in this range, set the value in the output sequence to the target color.
    d.  If `run_color` is white (0), no change is needed as the output sequence was initialized as a copy.
    e.  Advance `current_index` by `run_length` to move to the start of the next run.
4.  Return the modified output sequence.
