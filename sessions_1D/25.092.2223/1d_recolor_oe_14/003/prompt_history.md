## Perception

The input and output are 1-dimensional sequences of pixels.
The input contains only white (0) and maroon (9) pixels.
The output contains white (0), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels.
White pixels in the input remain white in the output.
Maroon pixels in the input change color in the output.
The transformation appears to operate on contiguous sequences (runs) of maroon pixels.
The color a run of maroon pixels transforms into depends on the length of that run.
Observing the examples:
- Runs of length 2 (even) become blue (1).
- Runs of length 3 (odd) become azure (8).
- Runs of length 4 (even) become blue (1).
- Runs of length 5 (odd) become azure (8).
- Runs of length 6 (even) become blue (1).
The rule seems to be: change runs of maroon pixels with even length to blue, and runs of maroon pixels with odd length to azure.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence, identifying contiguous runs of pixels with the same color.
3.  For each identified run:
    a.  Get the starting index, ending index, color, and length of the run.
    b.  If the color of the run is white (0), fill the corresponding positions (from start index to end index) in the output sequence with white (0).
    c.  If the color of the run is maroon (9):
        i.  Check the length of the run.
        ii. If the length is even, fill the corresponding positions in the output sequence with blue (1).
        iii. If the length is odd, fill the corresponding positions in the output sequence with azure (8).
4.  Return the completed output sequence.

## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed due to an `ImportError: No module named 'skimage'`. This indicates an unnecessary dependency was included in the code. The core logic identified in the Dreamer phase appears sound based on the initial perception: the transformation operates on contiguous runs of maroon pixels, changing their color based on the parity of the run length (even length -> blue, odd length -> azure), while white pixels remain unchanged.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-analyze the examples to confirm the run-length parity rule without relying on external libraries for analysis.
2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on this confirmation.
3.  Prepare for the Coder phase by ensuring the next code generation avoids unnecessary imports like `skimage`, `numpy`, and `math`.

## Gather Metrics

Let's manually verify the run lengths and transformations for each training example.

**Train 1:**
Input: `0 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9`
Output: `0 1 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 1 1 1 1`

Runs in Input:
- `0` (len 1) -> `0`
- `9 9` (len 2, even) -> `1 1` (blue)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9` (len 3, odd) -> `8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`
- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)

**Train 2:**
Input: `0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0`
Output: `0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0`

Runs in Input:
- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`
- `9 9 9 9 9 9` (len 6, even) -> `1 1 1 1 1 1` (blue)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9` (len 3, odd) -> `8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`
- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)
- `0` (len 1) -> `0`

**Train 3:**
Input: `0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0`
Output: `0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 8 8 0`

Runs in Input:
- `0` (len 1) -> `0`
- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)
- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`
- `9 9 9 9 9` (len 5, odd) -> `8 8 8 8 8` (azure)
- `0 0 0` (len 3) -> `0 0 0`
- `9 9` (len 2, even) -> `1 1` (blue)
- `0 0` (len 2) -> `0 0`
- `9 9 9 9` (len 4, even) -> `1 1 1 1` (blue)
- `0` (len 1) -> `0`
- `9 9 9` (len 3, odd) -> `8 8 8` (azure)
- `0` (len 1) -> `0`

**Summary:**
The analysis confirms the initial perception across all training examples:
- White (0) runs remain white (0).
- Maroon (9) runs of even length become blue (1).
- Maroon (9) runs of odd length become azure (8).
The length of the runs is preserved.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
2.  Initialize a pointer `current_index` to 0.
3.  While `current_index` is less than the length of the input sequence:
    a.  Identify the color (`run_color`) of the pixel at `current_index`.
    b.  Find the length (`run_length`) of the contiguous run of `run_color` starting at `current_index`.
    c.  If `run_color` is maroon (9):
        i.  Determine the target color: blue (1) if `run_length` is even, azure (8) if `run_length` is odd.
        ii. Iterate from `current_index` up to (`current_index + run_length - 1`). For each index in this range, set the value in the output sequence to the target color.
    d.  If `run_color` is white (0), no change is needed as the output sequence was initialized as a copy.
    e.  Advance `current_index` by `run_length` to move to the start of the next run.
4.  Return the modified output sequence.
