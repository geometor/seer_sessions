## Perception

The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN arrays) of pixels.
The input grid consists of white (0) background pixels and orange (7) foreground pixels.
The orange pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (objects).
The output grid retains the white background pixels in the same positions.
The orange segments in the input are replaced by segments of the same size and position but with different colors in the output.
The color of the output segment depends on the length of the corresponding orange segment in the input.

Specifically:
- An orange segment of length 3 is replaced by a green (3) segment.
- An orange segment of length 2 is replaced by a maroon (9) segment.
- An orange segment of length 4 is replaced by a maroon (9) segment.

This suggests a rule based on the length of the orange segments: segments with odd length (3) become green (3), while segments with even length (2, 4) become maroon (9).

## Facts

task_type: object_color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
background_color: white (0)
input_object_color: orange (7)
output_object_colors: [green (3), maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    input_color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - length: determines the output color
transformation_rule:
  - condition: input pixel is orange (7)
    action: identify the contiguous horizontal segment it belongs to
  - condition: length of the orange segment is odd (e.g., 3)
    action: replace the segment with green (3) pixels
  - condition: length of the orange segment is even (e.g., 2, 4)
    action: replace the segment with maroon (9) pixels
  - condition: input pixel is white (0)
    action: keep the pixel white (0)
invariants:
  - grid dimensions
  - position of background (white) pixels
  - position and size of object segments
variables:
  - color of object segments (dependent on length)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally to identify contiguous segments of orange (7) pixels.
3.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  If the length of the segment is odd, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with green (3) pixels.
    c.  If the length of the segment is even, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with maroon (9) pixels.
4.  Leave all positions corresponding to white (0) pixels in the input as white (0) in the output grid. (This is handled by the initialization and selective overwriting).
5.  Return the completed output grid.

## General Assessment

The provided `transform` function aims to solve the task by identifying horizontal segments of orange pixels (7), determining their length, and replacing them with green (3) if the length is odd or maroon (9) if the length is even. The background white pixels (0) are preserved.

The reported `list index out of range` errors across all training examples strongly suggest an issue occurred *outside* the provided `transform` function logic, likely during the parsing or handling of the input data before it was passed to the function. The input format described in the prompt (flat strings like `"0 0 0 7 7 7 ..."`) is non-standard for ARC, which typically uses nested lists (e.g., `[[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, ...]]`). If the test harness failed to correctly parse these strings into the expected `list[list[int]]` format (specifically `[[...]]` for a 1xN grid) before calling `transform`, accessing `input_grid[0]` or indices within the processed row could easily lead to such errors.

Assuming the core logic (odd length -> green, even length -> maroon) derived from `train_1` is correct, the strategy is:
1.  Verify the input parsing ensures the `transform` function receives a `list[list[int]]` argument, specifically `[[...]]` for these 1xN examples.
2.  Confirm the segment finding and length calculation logic is robust.
3.  Confirm the color replacement logic based on parity is correctly implemented.
4.  Use metrics gathered from all examples to ensure the odd/even rule holds universally for this task.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid (which is expected to be a single row, 1xN).
2.  Scan the input row horizontally to find all contiguous segments (sequences of one or more identical pixels) consisting solely of orange (7) pixels. Record the start and end index for each segment found.
3.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Calculate its length (number of pixels = end_index - start_index + 1).
    b.  Determine the target output color based on the length: use green (3) if the length is odd, and use maroon (9) if the length is even.
    c.  Modify the output grid by replacing all pixels within the segment's range (from start_index to end_index, inclusive) with the determined target output color.
4.  Pixels in the input grid that were not part of an orange segment (i.e., the white (0) background pixels) remain unchanged in the output grid because of the initial copy and selective overwriting.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
