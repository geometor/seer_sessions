## Perception

The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN arrays) of pixels.
The input grid consists of white (0) background pixels and orange (7) foreground pixels.
The orange pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (objects).
The output grid retains the white background pixels in the same positions.
The orange segments in the input are replaced by segments of the same size and position but with different colors in the output.
The color of the output segment depends on the length of the corresponding orange segment in the input.

Specifically:
- An orange segment of length 3 is replaced by a green (3) segment.
- An orange segment of length 2 is replaced by a maroon (9) segment.
- An orange segment of length 4 is replaced by a maroon (9) segment.

This suggests a rule based on the length of the orange segments: segments with odd length (3) become green (3), while segments with even length (2, 4) become maroon (9).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally to identify contiguous segments of orange (7) pixels.
3.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  If the length of the segment is odd, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with green (3) pixels.
    c.  If the length of the segment is even, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with maroon (9) pixels.
4.  Leave all positions corresponding to white (0) pixels in the input as white (0) in the output grid. (This is handled by the initialization and selective overwriting).
5.  Return the completed output grid.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: list index out of range

## Example 2:
Error: list index out of range

## Example 3:
Error: list index out of range
## General Assessment

The previous code failed with a `list index out of range` error across all training examples. The analysis suggests the error originates not in the core transformation logic (identifying orange segments and changing color based on length parity) but in how the input grid structure is handled. The `transform` function expects a list of lists (e.g., `[[0, 7, 7, 0]]`) but likely received input in a format that caused the initial validation or row extraction (`input_row = list(input_grid[0])`) to fail, possibly returning an empty list `[]` due to the validation check, which the testing framework then reported as an error (perhaps comparing `[]` to the expected output grid).

The underlying logic – finding contiguous segments of orange (7), checking if their length is odd (replace with green 3) or even (replace with maroon 9) – appears correct based on the examples.

The strategy is to refine the input handling in the `transform` function to correctly process the 1xN grid format as provided by the ARC testing environment (which is typically a list containing a single list/row), while keeping the segment identification and color replacement logic intact.

```
The metrics confirm the transformation logic is correct for all examples. The segments are identified correctly, and applying the odd/even length rule produces the expected output. The failure reported previously must be due to the function's interaction with the testing environment, specifically input format handling.

1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a list containing a single list representing the 1xN row (e.g., `[[0, 7, 7, ...]]`).
2.  Extract the single row list from the input grid.
3.  Create a copy of this row to serve as the basis for the output row. This preserves background pixels initially.
4.  Iterate through the input row to identify all contiguous horizontal segments composed solely of orange (7) pixels. Record the start index, end index, and length for each segment found.
5.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Check the parity of its length.
    b.  If the length is odd, set the target color for replacement to green (3).
    c.  If the length is even, set the target color for replacement to maroon (9).
    d.  Iterate from the segment's start index to its end index (inclusive) in the output row copy, changing the value of each pixel within this range to the determined target color (green or maroon).
6.  Once all orange segments have been processed and the corresponding sections of the output row copy have been updated, wrap the modified output row in a list to match the required 1xN grid output format (list of lists).
7.  Return the resulting grid.
