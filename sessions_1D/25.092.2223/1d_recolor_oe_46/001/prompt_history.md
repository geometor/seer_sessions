## Perception

The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN arrays) of pixels.
The input grid consists of white (0) background pixels and orange (7) foreground pixels.
The orange pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (objects).
The output grid retains the white background pixels in the same positions.
The orange segments in the input are replaced by segments of the same size and position but with different colors in the output.
The color of the output segment depends on the length of the corresponding orange segment in the input.

Specifically:
- An orange segment of length 3 is replaced by a green (3) segment.
- An orange segment of length 2 is replaced by a maroon (9) segment.
- An orange segment of length 4 is replaced by a maroon (9) segment.

This suggests a rule based on the length of the orange segments: segments with odd length (3) become green (3), while segments with even length (2, 4) become maroon (9).

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
background_color: white (0)
input_object_color: orange (7)
output_object_colors: [green (3), maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    input_color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - length: determines the output color
transformation_rule:
  - condition: input pixel is orange (7)
    action: identify the contiguous horizontal segment it belongs to
  - condition: length of the orange segment is odd (e.g., 3)
    action: replace the segment with green (3) pixels
  - condition: length of the orange segment is even (e.g., 2, 4)
    action: replace the segment with maroon (9) pixels
  - condition: input pixel is white (0)
    action: keep the pixel white (0)
invariants:
  - grid dimensions
  - position of background (white) pixels
  - position and size of object segments
variables:
  - color of object segments (dependent on length)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally to identify contiguous segments of orange (7) pixels.
3.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  If the length of the segment is odd, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with green (3) pixels.
    c.  If the length of the segment is even, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with maroon (9) pixels.
4.  Leave all positions corresponding to white (0) pixels in the input as white (0) in the output grid. (This is handled by the initialization and selective overwriting).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
