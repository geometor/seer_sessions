task_type: object_color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1xN grid, typically a list containing one list)
background_color: white (0)
input_object_color: orange (7)
output_object_colors: [green (3), maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    input_color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - length: determines the output color (odd length -> green (3), even length -> maroon (9))
transformation_rule:
  - input: 1xN grid containing white (0) and orange (7) pixels.
  - process:
    - Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of orange (7) pixels within the single row.
    - For each orange segment:
      - Calculate its length.
      - If the length is odd, replace the segment's pixels with green (3).
      - If the length is even, replace the segment's pixels with maroon (9).
    - Pixels that were originally white (0) remain white (0).
  - output: 1xN grid with transformed segments.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions (1xN).
  - Position of background (white) pixels.
  - Position and extent (start/end indices) of the original segments.
variables:
  - Color of the segments corresponding to the original orange segments, determined by the length of the original orange segment.
