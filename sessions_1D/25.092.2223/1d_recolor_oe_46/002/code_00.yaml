task_type: object_color_transformation_by_property
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN list of lists or array)
background_color: white (0)
input_object_color: orange (7)
output_object_colors: [green (3), maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    input_color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - length: determines the output color based on parity (odd/even)
transformation_rule:
  - scope: iterate through the single row of the input grid
  - action: identify contiguous horizontal segments of orange (7) pixels
  - for_each: identified orange segment
    - calculate: length of the segment
    - condition: if length is odd
      - action: replace the segment pixels with green (3) in the output grid
    - condition: if length is even
      - action: replace the segment pixels with maroon (9) in the output grid
  - default_action: pixels not part of an orange segment (i.e., white background) remain unchanged in the output grid
invariants:
  - grid dimensions (1xN)
  - position of background (white) pixels
  - position and length of segments (only color changes)
variables:
  - color of the former orange segments (changes based on length parity)
