task_type: object_color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
background_color: white (0)
input_object_color: orange (7)
output_object_colors: [green (3), maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    input_color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - length: determines the output color
transformation_rule:
  - condition: input pixel is orange (7)
    action: identify the contiguous horizontal segment it belongs to
  - condition: length of the orange segment is odd (e.g., 3)
    action: replace the segment with green (3) pixels
  - condition: length of the orange segment is even (e.g., 2, 4)
    action: replace the segment with maroon (9) pixels
  - condition: input pixel is white (0)
    action: keep the pixel white (0)
invariants:
  - grid dimensions
  - position of background (white) pixels
  - position and size of object segments
variables:
  - color of object segments (dependent on length)
