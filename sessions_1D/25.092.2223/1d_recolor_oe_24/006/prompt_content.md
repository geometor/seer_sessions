"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by identifying contiguous horizontal segments of 
blue (1) pixels in the single row. Each blue segment found, scanning from 
left to right, is recolored sequentially starting with magenta (6), then 
orange (7), and potentially subsequent colors if more segments exist. 
White (0) pixels remain unchanged. The input and output are 2D lists 
representing 1xN grids.
