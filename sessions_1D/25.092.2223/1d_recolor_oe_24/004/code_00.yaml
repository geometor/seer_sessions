task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN)
input_colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
output_colors: [0, 6, 7] # white, magenta, orange
background:
  - color: 0 # white
    transformation: remains unchanged
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    input_color: 1 # blue
    location: exists only within the single row of the grid
    properties:
      - start_index (column)
      - end_index (column)
      - length
      - order_of_appearance (left-to-right within the row)
    output_color_rule: assigned sequentially based on order, starting from 6 (magenta)
relationships:
  - The position (start/end indices) and extent (length) of the blue segments in the input row directly determine the position and extent of the colored segments (6 or 7) in the output row.
  - The specific output color (6 or 7) depends solely on the left-to-right discovery order of the blue segment in the input. The first blue segment becomes 6, the second becomes 7.
actions:
  - Iterate through the single row of the input grid from left to right (column index 0 to N-1).
  - Identify the start and end indices of each contiguous segment of blue (1) pixels.
  - Maintain a counter or sequence for the output colors, starting at 6.
  - For each blue segment found:
    - Replace the corresponding pixels in the output grid's row with the current output color.
    - Increment the output color counter (6 becomes 7, 7 would become 8 if needed, etc.).
  - Ensure white (0) pixels are copied directly from input to output without modification.
