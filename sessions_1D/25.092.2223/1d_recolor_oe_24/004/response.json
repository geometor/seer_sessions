            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: identify contiguous segments of blue (1) pixels and recolor them sequentially starting with magenta (6), then orange (7). However, the provided code failed during testing, returning the original input unchanged for all examples. This suggests an issue with how the code handles the input data structure or applies the modifications, rather than a flaw in the core transformation logic itself.\n\nThe most likely cause, given the code structure and the failure mode, is a mismatch between the expected input format (a 2D list `list[list[int]]` representing a grid) and the format possibly used during testing (potentially a 1D list `list[int]` representing the single row directly). The type check `isinstance(input_grid[0], list)` in the code would fail for a 1D list input, causing the function to return an unmodified copy of the input.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Input/Output Structure:** Use `tool_code` to verify the dimensions and structure of the example inputs and outputs as provided.\n2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the Python code to correctly handle the input structure, whether it's consistently 1D `list[int]` or 1xN `list[list[int]]`. The logic for finding and recoloring segments remains the same, but accessing and modifying the data needs to align with the actual structure. Assuming the examples strongly suggest a 1D or 1xN structure, the code should be robust to either representation if possible, or standardized to the most likely one (1xN `list[list[int]]` being the ARC standard, despite the simpler appearance here). We will proceed assuming the ARC standard `list[list[int]]` representation for a 1xN grid is intended, but acknowledge the previous failure indicates a potential discrepancy needing correction in implementation.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the confirmed structure and the sequential recoloring process.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the first training example's input and output.\n"
