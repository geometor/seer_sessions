            "text": "**Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was a 1D list, while ARC grids are typically represented as 2D lists (lists of lists), even for single-row examples. The error \"Input grid must be a list\" occurred because the function received a list containing another list (e.g., `[[0, 1, 1, 0]]`) instead of the expected flat list (e.g., `[0, 1, 1, 0]`).\n\nThe strategy is to modify the code and the natural language program to correctly handle the 2D list format, specifically by accessing the single row within the input list (i.e., `input_grid[0]`). The core logic of identifying contiguous blue segments and assigning sequential colors (magenta, orange, etc.) based on their left-to-right order appears sound based on the examples provided.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's examine the structure of the first training example's input and output.\n"
