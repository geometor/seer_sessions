import copy

"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal segments of blue (1) pixels in the input grid (assumed 1D).
Assigns a color to each identified segment based on its left-to-right sequence, starting with magenta (6) and incrementing for subsequent segments (7, 8, ...).
Replaces the blue pixels of each segment with its assigned color in the output grid.
Keeps white (0) pixels unchanged.

    Args:

    Returns:
