task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN)
input_colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
output_colors: [0, 6, 7] # white, magenta, orange
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    defined_in: row 0 of the grid
    input_color: 1 # blue
    properties:
      - start_column_index
      - end_column_index
      - length
      - order_of_appearance (left-to-right within the row)
    output_color_rule: assigned sequentially starting from 6 (magenta), incrementing by 1 for each subsequent segment.
background:
  - color: 0 # white
    location: any cell in row 0
    transformation: remains unchanged
relationships:
  - The position and extent of blue segments in the input row determine the position and extent of colored segments (6 or 7) in the output row.
  - The color assigned to an output segment depends on the left-to-right order of the corresponding blue segment in the input row.
actions:
  - Access the first (and only) row of the input grid.
  - Identify contiguous segments of blue (1) pixels within this row.
  - Assign a color to each identified segment based on its sequence (1st -> 6, 2nd -> 7, etc.).
  - Create a copy of the input grid.
  - Replace the blue pixels of each segment in the copied row with its assigned color.
  - Keep white (0) pixels unchanged.
