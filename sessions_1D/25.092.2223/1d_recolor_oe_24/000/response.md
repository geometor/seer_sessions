Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

*   The input and output grids appear to be 1-dimensional arrays or single rows.
*   The input grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
*   The output grids contain white (0), magenta (6), and orange (7) pixels.
*   The white (0) pixels in the input seem to map directly to white (0) pixels in the output in the same positions.
*   The blue (1) pixels in the input are transformed into either magenta (6) or orange (7) in the output.
*   Contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels in the input are transformed into contiguous blocks of a single color (either 6 or 7) in the output.
*   In `train_1` and `train_3`, there are two distinct blocks of blue pixels. The first block (from left to right) becomes magenta (6), and the second block becomes orange (7).
*   In `train_2`, there is only one block of blue pixels, and it becomes magenta (6).
*   The transformation seems to involve identifying contiguous horizontal segments of blue pixels and assigning them a new color based on their order of appearance.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D)
input_colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
output_colors: [0, 6, 7] # white, magenta, orange
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    input_color: 1 # blue
    properties:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - length
      - order_of_appearance (left-to-right)
    output_color_rule: assigned sequentially starting from 6 (magenta)
background:
  - color: 0 # white
    transformation: remains unchanged
relationships:
  - The position and extent of the blue segments in the input directly determine the position and extent of the colored segments (6 or 7) in the output.
  - The color assigned to an output segment depends on the left-to-right order of the corresponding blue segment in the input.
actions:
  - Identify contiguous segments of blue (1) pixels.
  - Assign a color to each identified segment based on its sequence.
    - First segment -> magenta (6)
    - Second segment -> orange (7)
  - Replace the blue pixels of each segment with its assigned color in the output grid.
  - Keep white (0) pixels unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Initialize a color variable with the value 6 (magenta).
3.  Scan the input grid from left to right.
4.  When the start of a contiguous segment of blue (1) pixels is encountered that has not yet been processed:
    a.  Determine the full extent (start and end indices) of this blue segment.
    b.  Change the color of all pixels within this segment's range in the output grid to the current value of the color variable.
    c.  Mark the pixels in this segment as processed (to avoid reprocessing parts of the same segment).
    d.  Increment the color variable (change 6 to 7 for the next segment).
5.  Continue scanning until the end of the grid is reached.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
