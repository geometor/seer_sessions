The first block (from left to right) becomes magenta (6), and the second block becomes orange (7).\n*   In `train_2`, there is only one block of blue pixels, and it becomes magenta (6).\n*   The transformation seems to involve identifying contiguous horizontal segments of blue pixels and assigning them a new color based on their order of appearance.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
