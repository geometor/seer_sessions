task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D)
input_colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
output_colors: [0, 6, 7] # white, magenta, orange
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    input_color: 1 # blue
    properties:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - length
      - order_of_appearance (left-to-right)
    output_color_rule: assigned sequentially starting from 6 (magenta)
background:
  - color: 0 # white
    transformation: remains unchanged
relationships:
  - The position and extent of the blue segments in the input directly determine the position and extent of the colored segments (6 or 7) in the output.
  - The color assigned to an output segment depends on the left-to-right order of the corresponding blue segment in the input.
actions:
  - Identify contiguous segments of blue (1) pixels.
  - Assign a color to each identified segment based on its sequence.
    - First segment -> magenta (6)
    - Second segment -> orange (7)
  - Replace the blue pixels of each segment with its assigned color in the output grid.
  - Keep white (0) pixels unchanged.
