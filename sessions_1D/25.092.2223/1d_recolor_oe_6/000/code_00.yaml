Task:
  description: Change the color of pixels within an object based on their local neighborhood and position.
Grid:
  size: 5x5
Colors:
  input: [White (0), Orange (7)]
  output: [White (0), Yellow (4), Magenta (6)]
Objects:
  - description: A single contiguous object composed of Orange (7) pixels exists in the input.
    shape_preservation: The spatial arrangement (shape) of the object's pixels is preserved in the output.
Pixel Transformation:
  - type: Color change based on local context.
  - target: Only Orange (7) pixels are transformed.
  - source: White (0) pixels remain White (0).
Rule:
  - For each Orange (7) pixel at position (row, col) in the input:
    1. Count its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are also Orange (7).
    2. Check if the pixel is fully surrounded (neighbor count == 4).
    3. Check if the pixel is in the first row (row == 0).
  - Color Mapping:
    - If neighbor_count == 4: Output color is Magenta (6).
    - If neighbor_count < 4 AND row == 0: Output color is Yellow (4).
    - If neighbor_count < 4 AND row != 0: Output color is Magenta (6).
