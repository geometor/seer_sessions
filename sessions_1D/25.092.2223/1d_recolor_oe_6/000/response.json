This strongly suggests they represent 5x5 grids.\n2.  **Colors:**\n    *   Input uses White (0) and Orange (7).\n    *   Output uses White (0), Yellow (4), and Magenta (6).\n3.  **Object Preservation:** The locations of non-white pixels in the output grid exactly match the locations of the Orange (7) pixels in the input grid. The background White (0) pixels remain unchanged. This indicates the transformation operates specifically on the Orange pixels, changing their color based on some rule, while preserving the overall shape.\n4.  **Color Transformation Rule:** The core task is to determine why some Orange (7) input pixels become Yellow (4) and others become Magenta (6).\n    *   Let's visualize the input Orange (7) pixels and their corresponding output colors:\n        "
