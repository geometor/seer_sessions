Okay, I will analyze the provided example pair to understand the transformation logic.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are presented as 1D arrays of 25 integers. This strongly suggests they represent 5x5 grids.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Input uses White (0) and Orange (7).
    *   Output uses White (0), Yellow (4), and Magenta (6).
3.  **Object Preservation:** The locations of non-white pixels in the output grid exactly match the locations of the Orange (7) pixels in the input grid. The background White (0) pixels remain unchanged. This indicates the transformation operates specifically on the Orange pixels, changing their color based on some rule, while preserving the overall shape.
4.  **Color Transformation Rule:** The core task is to determine why some Orange (7) input pixels become Yellow (4) and others become Magenta (6).
    *   Let's visualize the input Orange (7) pixels and their corresponding output colors:
        
```
        Input (7)    Output (4 or 6)
        . . 7 7 .    . . 4 4 .  <- Row 0
        . . 7 . 7    . . 6 . 6  <- Row 1
        7 7 7 7 7    6 6 6 6 6  <- Row 2
        . . 7 7 7    . . 6 6 6  <- Row 3
        . 7 7 . .    . 6 6 . .  <- Row 4
        ```

    *   Comparing the input neighborhoods and output colors suggests a pattern based on local context.
    *   **Inner vs. Edge Pixels:** Orange pixels completely surrounded by other Orange pixels (orthogonally) might be treated differently from those adjacent to White pixels or the grid boundary.
        *   Pixels (2,2) and (2,3) in the input are surrounded by four Orange neighbors. Both become Magenta (6) in the output.
    *   **Edge Pixel Differentiation:** All other Orange pixels are "edge" pixels (fewer than 4 orthogonal Orange neighbors). Some edge pixels become Yellow (4), others Magenta (6).
        *   The edge pixels becoming Yellow (4) are (0,2) and (0,3). These are the only Orange pixels in the top row (row 0).
        *   All other edge pixels, located in rows 1 through 4, become Magenta (6).
    *   **Hypothesized Rule:** An Orange (7) pixel becomes:
        *   Magenta (6) if it has 4 orthogonal Orange neighbors.
        *   Yellow (4) if it has fewer than 4 orthogonal Orange neighbors AND is in the first row (row index 0).
        *   Magenta (6) if it has fewer than 4 orthogonal Orange neighbors AND is NOT in the first row.

## Facts


```yaml
Task:
  description: Change the color of pixels within an object based on their local neighborhood and position.
Grid:
  size: 5x5
Colors:
  input: [White (0), Orange (7)]
  output: [White (0), Yellow (4), Magenta (6)]
Objects:
  - description: A single contiguous object composed of Orange (7) pixels exists in the input.
    shape_preservation: The spatial arrangement (shape) of the object's pixels is preserved in the output.
Pixel Transformation:
  - type: Color change based on local context.
  - target: Only Orange (7) pixels are transformed.
  - source: White (0) pixels remain White (0).
Rule:
  - For each Orange (7) pixel at position (row, col) in the input:
    1. Count its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are also Orange (7).
    2. Check if the pixel is fully surrounded (neighbor count == 4).
    3. Check if the pixel is in the first row (row == 0).
  - Color Mapping:
    - If neighbor_count == 4: Output color is Magenta (6).
    - If neighbor_count < 4 AND row == 0: Output color is Yellow (4).
    - If neighbor_count < 4 AND row != 0: Output color is Magenta (6).

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying all pixel values from the input.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, identifying its row index `r`, column index `c`, and color `input_color`.
3.  If the `input_color` is Orange (7):
    a.  Calculate the number of `orange_neighbors` by checking the color of the four orthogonal neighbors (at `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`), ensuring checks stay within grid bounds. Count how many of these neighbors are Orange (7).
    b.  If `orange_neighbors` equals 4:
        i.  Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the new grid to Magenta (6).
    c.  Else (if `orange_neighbors` is less than 4):
        i.  If the row index `r` is 0:
            Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the new grid to Yellow (4).
        ii. Else (if the row index `r` is not 0):
            Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the new grid to Magenta (6).
4.  If the `input_color` is not Orange (7) (i.e., it is White (0)), the corresponding pixel in the new grid retains its copied White (0) value.
5.  Return the modified new grid as the output.
