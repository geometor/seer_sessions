If an Orange (7) pixel has exactly four orthogonal Orange (7) neighbors, change its color to Magenta (6).\n2. If an Orange (7) pixel has fewer than four orthogonal Orange (7) neighbors AND is located in the first row (row index 0), change its color to Yellow (4).\n3. If an Orange (7) pixel has fewer than four orthogonal Orange (7) neighbors AND is NOT located in the first row, change its color to Magenta (6).\n4.
