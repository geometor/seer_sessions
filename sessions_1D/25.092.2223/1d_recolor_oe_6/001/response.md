"""
Change the color of Orange (7) pixels based on their local neighborhood and row position.
Specifically:
1. If an Orange (7) pixel has exactly four orthogonal Orange (7) neighbors, change its color to Magenta (6).
2. If an Orange (7) pixel has fewer than four orthogonal Orange (7) neighbors AND is located in the first row (row index 0), change its color to Yellow (4).
3. If an Orange (7) pixel has fewer than four orthogonal Orange (7) neighbors AND is NOT located in the first row, change its color to Magenta (6).
4. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
The transformation preserves the overall shape defined by the non-White pixels.
