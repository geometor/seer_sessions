Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The examples use 1-dimensional arrays (or single rows) of integers representing pixel colors.
2.  **Key Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), orange (7), maroon (9), and magenta (6).
3.  **Structure:** The white pixels (0) appear to act as a background or separator, remaining unchanged in the output. The transformation focuses on contiguous blocks of orange pixels (7).
4.  **Transformation:** Contiguous blocks of orange pixels in the input are replaced by blocks of either maroon (9) or magenta (6) pixels in the output. The length of each block is preserved.
5.  **Rule Dependency:** The choice between maroon (9) and magenta (6) for a given block doesn't seem based *solely* on its position (e.g., "first block always becomes X") or *solely* on its length in isolation. It appears to depend on the *distribution* of lengths across *all* orange blocks within the input array. Specifically, properties like length uniqueness and median length seem crucial.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Type: 1D array (row)
Input_Colors: [white(0), orange(7)]
Output_Colors: [white(0), maroon(9), magenta(6)]
Background_Color: white(0)
Objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    input_color: orange(7)
    output_colors: [maroon(9), magenta(6)]
    properties:
      - length: integer
      - position: index range
      - order: integer (1st, 2nd, ...)
      - length_uniqueness: boolean (is this length unique among all orange blocks?)
      - is_median_length: boolean (does this block have the median length?)
Relationships:
  - white(0) pixels separate orange(7) blocks.
  - The output color of an orange(7) block depends on the statistical properties (uniqueness, median) of its length relative to all other orange(7) block lengths in the input.
Transformation:
  - type: color_replacement
    target: orange(7) blocks
    conditions:
      - rule_based_on_length_distribution:
          - if length is uniquely occurring: output is maroon(9)
          - if length is not uniquely occurring: output is magenta(6)
          - exception: if multiple lengths are unique (or none are unique), use median length rule
      - median_length_rule:
          - find median length M (use larger of middle two for even number of blocks)
          - if block length equals M: output is maroon(9)
          - otherwise: output is magenta(6)
    preserve_property: length
  - type: identity
    target: white(0) pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input array to identify all contiguous blocks of orange (7) pixels. Keep track of the start index, end index, and length of each block found, maintaining their original order.
2.  If no orange blocks are found, the output is identical to the input.
3.  If orange blocks are found, create a list of their lengths.
4.  Calculate the frequency of each length in the list.
5.  Identify the lengths that appear exactly once (unique lengths).
6.  Count how many distinct lengths are unique.
7.  **Determine the Target Length for Maroon Color:**
