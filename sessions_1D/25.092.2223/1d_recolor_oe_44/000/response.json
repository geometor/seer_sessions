The transformation focuses on contiguous blocks of orange pixels (7).\n4.  **Transformation:** Contiguous blocks of orange pixels in the input are replaced by blocks of either maroon (9) or magenta (6) pixels in the output. The length of each block is preserved.\n5.  **Rule Dependency:** The choice between maroon (9) and magenta (6) for a given block doesn't seem based *solely* on its position (e.g., \"first block always becomes X\") or *solely* on its length in isolation. It appears to depend on the *distribution* of lengths across *all* orange blocks within the input array. Specifically, properties like length uniqueness and median length seem crucial.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
