"""
Identify contiguous blocks of orange (7) pixels in the input 1D array.
Determine a 'target length' based on the distribution of the lengths of these blocks.
If exactly one block length occurs uniquely (only once), that length is the target length.
Otherwise (if zero or multiple lengths are unique), the target length is the median length of all blocks. When calculating the median for an even number of blocks, use the larger of the two middle lengths after sorting.
Replace orange blocks:
- If a block's length equals the target length, replace its pixels with maroon (9).
- Otherwise, replace its pixels with magenta (6).
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
