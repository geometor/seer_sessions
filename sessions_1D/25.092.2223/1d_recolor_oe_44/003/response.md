```python
"""
Identifies contiguous blocks of orange (7) pixels in the input 1D array (row).
Determines a 'target length' based on the distribution of the lengths of these orange blocks.
The rule for determining the target length is:
1. If exactly one block length occurs uniquely (only once among all orange blocks), that length is the target length.
2. Otherwise (if zero unique lengths or multiple unique lengths exist), the target length is the median length of all orange blocks. When calculating the median for an even number of blocks, the larger of the two middle lengths (upper median) after sorting is used.

Transforms the input grid by replacing orange blocks:
- If an orange block's length equals the calculated target length, its pixels are replaced with maroon (9).
- Otherwise (if its length does not equal the target length), its pixels are replaced with magenta (6).
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
