task_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row in a 2D list structure)
grid_dimensions:
  input_height: 1
  input_width: variable (e.g., 17 for train_1, 17 for train_2, 17 for train_3)
  output_height: 1
  output_width: same as input_width
input_colors:
  - white (0) - background
  - orange (7) - object color
output_colors:
  - white (0) - background preserved
  - green (3) - replacement color 1
  - maroon (9) - replacement color 2
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segment
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - start_index: integer
      - end_index: integer (exclusive)
      - length: integer (end_index - start_index)
transformation:
  - type: object property-based color replacement
    input_object_color: orange (7)
    output_grid_init: copy of input grid
    action: iterate through identified orange segments
    condition_property: length of segment
    rules:
      - condition: length is even
        action: replace segment pixels with green (3) in the output grid
      - condition: length is odd
        action: replace segment pixels with maroon (9) in the output grid
  - type: color preservation
    input_color: white (0)
    action: no change (implicitly handled by copying input initially)
invariance:
  - grid dimensions (height=1, width=constant)
  - position and color of white (0) pixels
  - segment boundaries (only color within boundaries changes)
