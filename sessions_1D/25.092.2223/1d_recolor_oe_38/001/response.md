"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal segments of orange (7) pixels in a 1D input grid.
For each orange segment:
- If its length is even, replaces the segment with green (3) pixels.
- If its length is odd, replaces the segment with maroon (9) pixels.
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
