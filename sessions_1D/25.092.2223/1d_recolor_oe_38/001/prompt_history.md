Okay, let's analyze the provided example.

**Perception:**

The input is a 1-dimensional grid (a row vector) containing primarily white (0) pixels and some orange (7) pixels. The orange pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (or "objects") of varying lengths, separated by one or more white pixels.

The output is also a 1-dimensional grid of the same size. The white pixels from the input remain unchanged in the output. The segments of orange pixels in the input have been replaced by segments of either green (3) or maroon (9) pixels in the output. The length of each replacement segment is identical to the length of the original orange segment it replaced.

Comparing the input and output for `train_1`:
- The first orange segment `7 7 7 7` (length 4) is replaced by `3 3 3 3` (green).
- The second orange segment `7 7 7` (length 3) is replaced by `9 9 9` (maroon).

Looking across all examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`):
- `train_1`: lengths 4, 3 -> colors green (3), maroon (9)
- `train_2`: lengths 2, 3, 1, 1 -> colors green (3), maroon (9), maroon (9), maroon (9)
- `train_3`: lengths 5, 6 -> colors maroon (9), green (3)

It appears there's a rule based on the length of the contiguous orange segment:
- If the length is even (2, 4, 6), the segment is replaced by green (3).
- If the length is odd (1, 3, 5), the segment is replaced by maroon (9).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
input_colors:
  - white (0)
  - orange (7)
output_colors:
  - white (0)
  - green (3)
  - maroon (9)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segments
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - length (variable)
transformation:
  - type: color replacement based on object property
    input_object_color: orange (7)
    property_used: length of the contiguous segment
    rules:
      - condition: length is even
        output_color: green (3)
      - condition: length is odd
        output_color: maroon (9)
  - type: color preservation
    input_color: white (0)
    output_color: white (0)
invariance:
  - grid dimensions
  - position of white (0) pixels
  - length of colored segments (only color changes)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments composed solely of orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  If the length is an even number, replace all pixels in that segment with green (3) in the output grid.
    c.  If the length is an odd number, replace all pixels in that segment with maroon (9) in the output grid.
3.  Leave all white (0) pixels unchanged; their positions in the output grid should be the same as in the input grid.
4.  The output grid will have the same dimensions as the input grid.
