task_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
input_representation: Assumed List[List[int]], e.g., [[c1, c2, c3, ...]]
output_representation: List[List[int]], e.g., [[c1', c2', c3', ...]]
input_colors_present:
  - white (0)
  - orange (7)
output_colors_present:
  - white (0)
  - green (3)
  - maroon (9)
background_color: white (0) - remains unchanged
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal segment
    color: orange (7)
    defining_property: consists only of orange (7) pixels
    properties_measured:
      - length: number of pixels in the segment
actions:
  - type: color replacement (conditional)
    target: orange (7) segments
    condition: based on segment length parity
    rules:
      - if length is even: replace all pixels in the segment with green (3)
      - if length is odd: replace all pixels in the segment with maroon (9)
  - type: color preservation
    target: white (0) pixels
    rule: keep color and position unchanged
invariance:
  - grid dimensions (always 1 row, width remains same)
  - position of white (0) pixels
  - the start and end positions of the original orange segments define the positions of the new green/maroon segments.
