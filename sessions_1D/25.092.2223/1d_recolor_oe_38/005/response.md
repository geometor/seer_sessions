```python
"""
Transforms a 1D input grid containing white (0) and orange (7) pixels.
Identifies contiguous horizontal segments of orange (7) pixels.
For each orange segment:
- If its length is even, replaces the segment with green (3) pixels in the output.
- If its length is odd, replaces the segment with maroon (9) pixels in the output.
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
