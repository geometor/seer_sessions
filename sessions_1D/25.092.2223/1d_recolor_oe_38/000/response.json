            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided example.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input is a 1-dimensional grid (a row vector) containing primarily white (0) pixels and some orange (7) pixels. The orange pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (or \"objects\") of varying lengths, separated by one or more white pixels.\n\nThe output is also a 1-dimensional grid of the same size. The white pixels from the input remain unchanged in the output. The segments of orange pixels in the input have been replaced by segments of either green (3) or maroon (9) pixels in the output. The length of each replacement segment is identical to the length of the original orange segment it replaced.\n\nComparing the input and output for `train_1`:\n- The first orange segment `7 7 7 7` (length 4) is replaced by `3 3 3 3` (green).\n- The second orange segment `7 7 7` (length 3) is replaced by `9 9 9` (maroon).\n\nLooking across all examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`):\n- `train_1`: lengths 4, 3 -> colors green (3), maroon (9)\n- `train_2`: lengths 2, 3, 1, 1 -> colors green (3), maroon (9), maroon (9), maroon (9)\n- `train_3`: lengths 5, 6 -> colors maroon (9), green (3)\n\nIt appears there's a rule based on the length of the contiguous orange segment:\n- If the length is even (2, 4, 6), the segment is replaced by green (3).\n- If the length is odd (1, 3, 5), the segment is replaced by maroon (9).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
