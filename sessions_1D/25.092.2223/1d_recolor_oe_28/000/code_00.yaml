task_context:
  grid_type: 1D array (1xN)
  input_colors_present: [white (0), orange (7)]
  output_colors_present: [white (0), green (3), gray (5)]
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - object: orange_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more orange (7) pixels.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - position: The start and end indices of the segment in the grid.
    relationships:
      - separated_by: White (0) pixels.

actions:
  - action: recolor_segment
    description: Change the color of all pixels within an orange segment based on its properties.
    conditions:
      - property: length of orange_segment
        comparison: greater than 3
        result_color: gray (5)
      - property: length of orange_segment
        comparison: less than or equal to 3
        result_color: green (3)
    target: orange_segment
    preserves:
      - length of the segment
      - position of the segment

transformations:
  - description: Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous segments of orange (7) pixels.
  - description: For each identified orange segment, determine its length.
  - description: If the length is greater than 3, replace all orange (7) pixels in that segment with gray (5) pixels in the output grid.
  - description: If the length is less than or equal to 3, replace all orange (7) pixels in that segment with green (3) pixels in the output grid.
  - description: Copy all white (0) pixels from the input to the output grid in their original positions.
