Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of yellow (4) pixels using 4-way adjacency (horizontal and vertical).\n3. For each identified yellow object:\n   a. Count the total number of pixels (size) in the object.\n   b. If the object's total size is odd, determine the target color as orange (7).\n   c. If the object's total size is even, determine the target color as green (3).\n4. Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input grid.\n5. For each yellow object, update all pixels belonging to that object in the output grid to its determined target color (orange or green).\n6. Non-yellow pixels remain unchanged.\n7. Convert the final 2D output grid back into a 1D list format.\n\nNote: This rule perfectly explains Example 1 but contradicts the provided outputs for Examples 2 and 3, where single objects appear to be colored with both green and orange. The implementation follows the rule derived from Example 1.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef _find_objects(grid, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of a specific color in the grid using 4-way connectivity.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The 2D input grid.\n        target_color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of objects, where each object is a list of\n              (row, col) coordinates belonging to that object.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n    objects = []\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # If the cell has the target color and hasn't been visited yet, start a search\n            if grid[r, c] == target_color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                # Start Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the current object\n                current_object_coords = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited.add((r, c))\n                \n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()\n                    current_object_coords.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n                    \n                    # Check neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                        \n                        # Check if the neighbor is within grid boundaries\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                            # Check if the neighbor has the target color and hasn't been visited\n                            if grid[nr, nc] == target_color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                                visited.add((nr, nc))\n                                q.append((nr, nc))\n                                \n                # Add the completed object (list of coordinates) to the list of objects\n                if current_object_coords:\n                    objects.append(current_object_coords)\n                    \n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by recoloring contiguous yellow objects based \n    on the parity of their total size.
