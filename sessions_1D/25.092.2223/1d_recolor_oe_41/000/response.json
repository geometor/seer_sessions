Based on the length (32) and the patterns in the examples, the grids are likely 4x8 (4 rows, 8 columns).\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (`0`), yellow (`4`), green (`3`), and orange (`7`).\n3.  **Background:** The white (`0`) pixels seem to form the background and remain unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects the yellow (`4`) pixels. All yellow pixels in the input are changed to either green (`3`) or orange (`7`) in the output.\n5.  **Objects:** The yellow pixels form contiguous objects (connected horizontally or vertically).\n6.  **Pattern:** The color change (yellow to green or orange) appears to depend on a property of the yellow object the pixel belongs to. Comparing the input objects and their corresponding output colors across the examples suggests the determining factor is the size (number of pixels) of the yellow object.\n    *   If a yellow object has an *odd* number of pixels, all its pixels are changed to orange (`7`).\n    *   If a yellow object has an *even* number of pixels, all its pixels are changed to green (`3`).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Use horizontal and vertical adjacency to define contiguity. Keep track of which pixels belong to which object.\n4.  **Calculate Object Sizes:** For each identified yellow object, count the total number of pixels it contains (its size).\n5.  **Determine Output Colors:** For each yellow object:\n    *   Check if its size is odd or even.\n    *   If the size is odd, assign orange (`7`) as the target color for this object.\n    *   If the size is even, assign green (`3`) as the target color for this object.\n6.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the input grid:\n    *   If the input cell color is white (`0`), set the corresponding output cell `(row, col)` to white (`0`).\n    *   If the input cell color is yellow (`4`):\n        *   Identify the yellow object this cell belongs to.\n        *   Retrieve the target color (orange `7` or green `3`) determined in step 5 for that object.\n        *   Set the corresponding output cell `(row, col)` to that target color.\n7.  **Format Output:** Convert the populated 2D output grid back into a 1D array format."
