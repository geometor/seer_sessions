Grid:
  dimensionality: 2D
  background_color: 0 # white
  input_dimensions_observed: [4, 8] # based on 32 elements and pattern analysis
  output_dimensions: same as input

Objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixels
    input_color: 4 # yellow
    output_colors: [3, 7] # green, orange
    key_property: size # number of pixels in the object
    property_tested: parity # odd or even

Transformation:
  rule_description: Recolor yellow objects based on the parity of their size.
  condition_1:
    input_object_color: 4 # yellow
    object_size_parity: odd
    output_color: 7 # orange
  condition_2:
    input_object_color: 4 # yellow
    object_size_parity: even
    output_color: 3 # green
  unchanged_pixels:
    color: 0 # white

Assumptions:
  - Input 1D array represents a 2D grid (4x8 for these examples).
  - Connectivity for objects is horizontal and vertical adjacency.
