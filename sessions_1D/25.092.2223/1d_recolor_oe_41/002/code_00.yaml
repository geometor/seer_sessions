Input_Format:
  type: 1D_list
  represents: 2D_grid
  element_type: integer (color value 0-9)

Grid:
  dimensionality: 2D
  background_color: 0 # white
  dynamic_dimensions: true # Need to infer from input length
  assumed_dimensions_for_len_32: [4, 8] # Based on visual pattern of Example 1 which fits the simplest rule.

Objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixels
    input_color: 4 # yellow
    connectivity: 4-way (horizontal and vertical adjacency)
    output_colors: [3, 7] # green, orange
    determining_property: size # total number of pixels in the object
    property_test: parity # odd or even

Transformation:
  rule_description: Recolor entire contiguous yellow objects based on the parity of their total size.
  condition_1:
    input_object_color: 4 # yellow
    object_total_size_parity: odd
    output_color: 7 # orange (applied to all pixels of the object)
  condition_2:
    input_object_color: 4 # yellow
    object_total_size_parity: even
    output_color: 3 # green (applied to all pixels of the object)
  unchanged_pixels:
    color: 0 # white (and potentially other non-yellow colors if present)

Discrepancies:
  - The provided output grids for Examples 2 and 3 do not strictly follow the derived transformation rule (object size parity). In those examples, single large yellow objects (size 20 even, size 21 odd respectively) result in outputs containing *both* green and orange, contradicting the rule that the entire object should be one color.
  - The chosen rule perfectly explains Example 1. Proceeding with this rule as the most likely general intent, despite the contradictions in other examples.
