Transformation Rule Description:
1. Interpret the input 1D array as a 2D grid (assuming 4x8 based on examples).
2. Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of yellow (4) pixels. Contiguity is defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency.
3. For each yellow object found:
   a. Count the number of pixels (size) in the object.
   b. If the size is odd, the target color for all pixels in this object is orange (7).
   c. If the size is even, the target color for all pixels in this object is green (3).
4. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input.
5. Populate the output grid:
   a. Copy all non-yellow pixels (e.g., white (0)) from the input to the output grid at the same positions.
   b. For each yellow pixel in the input, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the target color (orange or green) determined in step 3 for the object it belongs to.
6. Convert the 2D output grid back into a 1D array format.
