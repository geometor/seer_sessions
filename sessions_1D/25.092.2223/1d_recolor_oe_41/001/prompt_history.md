Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are presented as 1D arrays, but they represent 2D grids. Based on the length (32) and the patterns in the examples, the grids are likely 4x8 (4 rows, 8 columns).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (`0`), yellow (`4`), green (`3`), and orange (`7`).
3.  **Background:** The white (`0`) pixels seem to form the background and remain unchanged in the output.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects the yellow (`4`) pixels. All yellow pixels in the input are changed to either green (`3`) or orange (`7`) in the output.
5.  **Objects:** The yellow pixels form contiguous objects (connected horizontally or vertically).
6.  **Pattern:** The color change (yellow to green or orange) appears to depend on a property of the yellow object the pixel belongs to. Comparing the input objects and their corresponding output colors across the examples suggests the determining factor is the size (number of pixels) of the yellow object.
    *   If a yellow object has an *odd* number of pixels, all its pixels are changed to orange (`7`).
    *   If a yellow object has an *even* number of pixels, all its pixels are changed to green (`3`).

## Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  dimensionality: 2D
  background_color: 0 # white
  input_dimensions_observed: [4, 8] # based on 32 elements and pattern analysis
  output_dimensions: same as input

Objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixels
    input_color: 4 # yellow
    output_colors: [3, 7] # green, orange
    key_property: size # number of pixels in the object
    property_tested: parity # odd or even

Transformation:
  rule_description: Recolor yellow objects based on the parity of their size.
  condition_1:
    input_object_color: 4 # yellow
    object_size_parity: odd
    output_color: 7 # orange
  condition_2:
    input_object_color: 4 # yellow
    object_size_parity: even
    output_color: 3 # green
  unchanged_pixels:
    color: 0 # white

Assumptions:
  - Input 1D array represents a 2D grid (4x8 for these examples).
  - Connectivity for objects is horizontal and vertical adjacency.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Parse Input:** Interpret the input 1D array as a 2D grid (e.g., 4 rows by 8 columns for the provided examples).
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Identify Yellow Objects:** Find all distinct contiguous objects composed of yellow (`4`) pixels in the input grid. Use horizontal and vertical adjacency to define contiguity. Keep track of which pixels belong to which object.
4.  **Calculate Object Sizes:** For each identified yellow object, count the total number of pixels it contains (its size).
5.  **Determine Output Colors:** For each yellow object:
    *   Check if its size is odd or even.
    *   If the size is odd, assign orange (`7`) as the target color for this object.
    *   If the size is even, assign green (`3`) as the target color for this object.
6.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the input grid:
    *   If the input cell color is white (`0`), set the corresponding output cell `(row, col)` to white (`0`).
    *   If the input cell color is yellow (`4`):
        *   Identify the yellow object this cell belongs to.
        *   Retrieve the target color (orange `7` or green `3`) determined in step 5 for that object.
        *   Set the corresponding output cell `(row, col)` to that target color.
7.  **Format Output:** Convert the populated 2D output grid back into a 1D array format.
