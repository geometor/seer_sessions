            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels represented by integers (colors). The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The input grids primarily feature yellow (4) pixels on a white (0) background. The output grids replace the yellow pixels with either green (3) or azure (8) pixels, while the white background remains.\n3.  **Objects:** The yellow pixels in the input form distinct, contiguous shapes or objects. Contiguity here means pixels are connected horizontally or vertically.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the yellow objects. The specific output color (green or azure) seems to depend on some property of the original yellow object.\n5.  **Pattern Recognition:** Comparing the input and output across the examples, it appears the size (number of pixels) of each yellow object determines its output color.\n    *   In train_1: An object of size 5 becomes 8, size 2 becomes 3, size 4 becomes 3, size 3 becomes 8.\n    *   In train_2: An object of size 5 becomes 8, size 2 becomes 3, size 1 becomes 8, size 1 becomes 8, size 3 becomes 8.\n    *   In train_3: An object of size 6 becomes 3, size 5 becomes 8, size 5 becomes 8, size 1 becomes 8.\n6.  **Hypothesis:** Yellow objects with an *odd* number of pixels are transformed into azure (8). Yellow objects with an *even* number of pixels are transformed into green (3). This holds true across all provided training examples.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Find all distinct groups (objects) of connected yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Pixels are considered connected if they share an edge (horizontally or vertically adjacent).\n3.  For each distinct yellow object found:\n    a.  Count the total number of pixels that make up the object (its size).\n    b.  Determine if the object's size is an odd or even number.\n    c.  If the size is odd, change the color of all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid to azure (8).\n    d.  If the size is even, change the color of all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid to green (3).\n4.  Leave all other pixels (originally white (0)) unchanged in the output grid.\n5.  The final output grid reflects these color changes."
