Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5).\n2. Determine the starting color based on the total number of segments:\n   - If the total count is odd, the first segment becomes azure (8).\n   - If the total count is even, the first segment becomes maroon (9).\n3. Assign colors to subsequent segments based on the previous segment's color and the length parity of both the current and previous segments:\n   - If both the current segment and the immediately preceding segment have lengths that are even, the current segment retains the same color as the previous one.\n   - Otherwise, the current segment's color alternates from the previous segment's color (8 becomes 9, 9 becomes 8).\n4. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_gray_segments_1d(grid_row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels in a 1D numpy array (a single row).\n\n    Args:\n        grid_row: A 1D numpy array representing a row of the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a segment\n        and contains keys 'start_col', 'end_col', and 'length'.\n        The list is ordered by the scanning order (left-to-right).\n    \"\"\"\n    segments = []\n    width = len(grid_row)\n    c = 0\n    while c < width:\n        # Look for the start of a gray segment\n        if grid_row[c] == 5:\n            start_col = c\n            end_col = c\n            # Extend the segment to the right\n            nc = c + 1\n            while nc < width and grid_row[nc] == 5:\n                end_col = nc\n                nc += 1\n            # Record the found segment\n            length = end_col - start_col + 1\n            segments.append({'start_col': start_col, 'end_col': end_col, 'length': length})\n            # Move past the segment we just found\n            c = end_col + 1\n        else:\n            # Not gray, move to the next pixel\n            c += 1\n    return segments\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described segment recoloring rules.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A 2D numpy array, expected to be 1xN.\n\n    Returns:\n        A 2D numpy array representing the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a 2D numpy array\n    if not isinstance(input_grid, np.ndarray) or input_grid.ndim != 2:\n         raise ValueError(\"Input must be a 2D numpy array\")\n\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # This task logic appears specific to 1-row grids based on examples\n    if height != 1:\n        # If grid has more than one row, behavior is undefined by examples.\n        # Returning original grid or raising error are options.\n        # For now, let's assume it only operates on the first row if multiple exist,\n        # or just copy if it's not a 1xN grid that fits the pattern.\n        # However, given ARC examples, we'll proceed assuming height is always 1.\n        pass # Or raise ValueError(\"Transformation defined only for 1-row grids\")\n\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    grid_row = input_grid[0, :] # Work with the single row\n\n    # 1.
