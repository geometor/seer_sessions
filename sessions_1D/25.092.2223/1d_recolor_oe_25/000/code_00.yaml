task_description: Recolor horizontal gray segments based on their sequential order.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  # Assuming 4x7 based on the example, this might need confirmation with more examples.
  height: 4 
  width: 7 
elements:
  - element_type: pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0), gray (5), azure (8), maroon (9)
  - element_type: object
    definition: A contiguous horizontal segment of one or more gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      location: defined by row index and column indices (start, end)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels form a 2D grid. Segments are horizontal within rows.
  - type: sequential_order
    description: Objects (segments) are ordered based on top-to-bottom row scan, then left-to-right column scan within each row.
transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: input grid
    output: list of gray horizontal segments with their locations
    details: Scan grid row by row, left to right, to find continuous sequences of gray (5).
  - action: assign_color
    input: ordered list of segments
    output: assignment of azure (8) or maroon (9) to each segment
    details: Assign azure (8) to the 1st, 3rd, 5th... segment and maroon (9) to the 2nd, 4th, 6th... segment in the identified order.
  - action: recolor_grid
    input: input grid, segment locations, assigned colors
    output: output grid
    details: Create the output grid by copying the input grid. For each identified segment, change the color of its corresponding pixels from gray (5) to the assigned color (azure 8 or maroon 9). Keep white (0) pixels unchanged.
