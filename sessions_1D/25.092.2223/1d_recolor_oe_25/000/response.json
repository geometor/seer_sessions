Given the context of ARC tasks, these likely represent flattened 2D grids. The length is 28, suggesting possible dimensions like 4x7 or 7x4.\n2.  **Color Changes:** The input contains white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The output contains white (0), azure (8), and maroon (9) pixels.\n3.  **Invariant Pixels:** White pixels (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output.\n4.  **Transformed Pixels:** All gray pixels (5) in the input are changed to either azure (8) or maroon (9) in the output. No gray pixels remain.\n5.  **Spatial Structure (Assuming 4x7 Grid):**\n    *   Input Grid (4x7):\n        "
