The output grid contains white (0), green (3), and maroon (9) pixels. White pixels remain unchanged. Gray pixels are transformed into either green or maroon. The transformation rule appears to depend on contiguous blocks of gray pixels. By analyzing the lengths of these gray blocks across the examples, a pattern emerges: gray blocks with an even length are transformed into green blocks, and gray blocks with an odd length are transformed into maroon blocks.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
