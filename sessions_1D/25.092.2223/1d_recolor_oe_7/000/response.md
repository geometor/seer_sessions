*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a 1D grid (represented as a single row) containing white (0) and gray (5) pixels into a new grid of the same dimensions. The output grid contains white (0), green (3), and maroon (9) pixels. White pixels remain unchanged. Gray pixels are transformed into either green or maroon. The transformation rule appears to depend on contiguous blocks of gray pixels. By analyzing the lengths of these gray blocks across the examples, a pattern emerges: gray blocks with an even length are transformed into green blocks, and gray blocks with an odd length are transformed into maroon blocks.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml

    transformation_rule:
      - input_pixels: white (0)
        output_pixels: white (0)
      - input_pixels: gray (5)
        condition: part of a contiguous block of gray pixels with even length
        output_pixels: green (3)
      - input_pixels: gray (5)
        condition: part of a contiguous block of gray pixels with odd length
        output_pixels: maroon (9)
    background_color: white (0) # appears unchanged and separates objects
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right to identify contiguous blocks (sequences) of gray (5) pixels. Keep track of the start and end index of each block.
    3.  For each identified block of gray pixels:
        a.  Calculate the length of the block.
        b.  Check if the length is even or odd.
        c.  If the length is even, replace all the gray (5) pixels within that block's range (from start index to end index) in the output grid with green (3).
        d.  If the length is odd, replace all the gray (5) pixels within that block's range in the output grid with maroon (9).
    4.  Return the modified output grid. White (0) pixels remain untouched throughout the process.
