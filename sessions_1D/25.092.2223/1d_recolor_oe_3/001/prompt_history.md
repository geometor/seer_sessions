Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: The examples appear to be 1-dimensional grids (or single rows). The dimensions seem consistent between input and output (1x14).
2.  **Colors**: The input grids primarily use white (0) and green (3). The output grids use white (0), magenta (6), and azure (8).
3.  **Background**: The white (0) pixels seem to act as a background and remain unchanged in position and color between input and output.
4.  **Objects**: The core objects appear to be contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of green (3) pixels.
5.  **Transformation**: The transformation targets these green blocks. Each green block is replaced by a block of the *same length* but a different color (either magenta or azure).
6.  **Color Change Logic**: The color change depends on the *length* of the green block:
    *   In train\_1, a block of length 5 becomes azure (8), and a block of length 4 becomes magenta (6).
    *   In train\_2, a block of length 2 becomes magenta (6), and a block of length 1 becomes azure (8).
    *   In train\_3, a block of length 4 becomes magenta (6), and a block of length 3 becomes azure (8).
7.  **Pattern**: By comparing the lengths and the resulting colors, a pattern emerges:
    *   Green blocks with an *odd* length (1, 3, 5) are changed to azure (8).
    *   Green blocks with an *even* length (2, 4) are changed to magenta (6).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid, identifying contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) composed solely of green (3) pixels.
3.  For each identified green segment:
    a.  Calculate its length (number of pixels).
    b.  Determine if the length is odd or even.
    c.  If the length is odd, fill the corresponding segment in the output grid with azure (8) pixels.
    d.  If the length is even, fill the corresponding segment in the output grid with magenta (6) pixels.
4.  Copy all non-green pixels (i.e., white (0) pixels) from the input grid to their corresponding positions in the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
