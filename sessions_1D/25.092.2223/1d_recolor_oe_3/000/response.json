            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The examples appear to be 1-dimensional grids (or single rows). The dimensions seem consistent between input and output (1x14).\n2.  **Colors**: The input grids primarily use white (0) and green (3). The output grids use white (0), magenta (6), and azure (8).\n3.  **Background**: The white (0) pixels seem to act as a background and remain unchanged in position and color between input and output.\n4.  **Objects**: The core objects appear to be contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of green (3) pixels.\n5.  **Transformation**: The transformation targets these green blocks. Each green block is replaced by a block of the *same length* but a different color (either magenta or azure).\n6.  **Color Change Logic**: The color change depends on the *length* of the green block:\n    *   In train\\_1, a block of length 5 becomes azure (8), and a block of length 4 becomes magenta (6).\n    *   In train\\_2, a block of length 2 becomes magenta (6), and a block of length 1 becomes azure (8).\n    *   In train\\_3, a block of length 4 becomes magenta (6), and a block of length 3 becomes azure (8).\n7.  **Pattern**: By comparing the lengths and the resulting colors, a pattern emerges:\n    *   Green blocks with an *odd* length (1, 3, 5) are changed to azure (8).\n    *   Green blocks with an *even* length (2, 4) are changed to magenta (6).\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
