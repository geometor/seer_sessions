Transformation Rule:

1. Identify contiguous horizontal segments of magenta pixels (color 6) in the input grid (which is 1-dimensional).
2. For each magenta segment found:
   a. Calculate its length.
   b. If the length is odd, replace the segment with maroon pixels (color 9) in the output grid.
   c. If the length is even, replace the segment with yellow pixels (color 4) in the output grid.
3. Preserve the position and color of all white pixels (color 0).
4. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
