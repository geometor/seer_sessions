task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN
objects:
  - object_type: segment
    description: Contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    input_color: magenta (6)
    output_colors: [yellow (4), maroon (9)]
    static_background_color: white (0)
properties:
  - property_name: length
    description: The number of pixels in a contiguous segment.
    applies_to: segment
relationships:
  - relationship_type: dependency
    description: The output color of a segment depends on the length of the corresponding input segment.
    input_object: magenta segment
    output_object: colored segment (yellow or maroon)
    condition:
      - if: length is odd
        then: output color is maroon (9)
      - if: length is even
        then: output color is yellow (4)
actions:
  - action_type: recolor
    description: Change the color of pixels within identified segments based on a rule.
    target: magenta segments
    rule: Apply color based on segment length (odd -> maroon, even -> yellow).
  - action_type: preserve
    description: Keep pixels unchanged.
    target: white pixels
