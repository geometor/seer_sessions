The transformation specifically targets contiguous segments (sequences) of 'magenta' pixels. The 'white' pixels appear to serve as separators and remain unchanged in the output. The 'magenta' segments are replaced by segments of either 'yellow' (4) or 'maroon' (9) in the output, maintaining the original position and length of the segment. The choice between 'yellow' and 'maroon' seems to depend on a property of the original 'magenta' segment. Observing the examples, the length of the 'magenta' segment determines the output color: odd-length segments become 'maroon', and even-length segments become 'yellow'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If a 'white' (0) pixel is encountered, copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output grid.\n4.  If a 'magenta' (6) pixel is encountered, identify the full contiguous horizontal segment of 'magenta' pixels it belongs to (i.e., find the start and end of the sequence of 6s).\n5.  Calculate the length of this 'magenta' segment.\n6.  Check if the length is odd or even.\n7.  If the length is odd, fill the corresponding segment positions in the output grid with 'maroon' (9).\n8.  If the length is even, fill the corresponding segment positions in the output grid with 'yellow' (4).\n9.  Skip the remaining pixels of the just-processed segment in the input grid iteration to avoid re-processing.\n10. Continue iterating until the end of the input grid is reached.\n11.
