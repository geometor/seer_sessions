            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified in the initial analysis appears correct and consistent across all three training examples. The failure reported during code execution (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") strongly suggests an issue with data types during testing, likely the `transform` function receiving a NumPy array instead of a standard Python list of lists, which then causes problems in conditional statements expecting single boolean values.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-affirm the correctness of the transformation rule based on the examples.\n2.  Update the documentation (YAML Facts and Natural Language Program) to reflect the understanding of the rule and acknowledge the potential data type issue encountered during execution, advising the coder phase to handle potential NumPy array inputs robustly.\n3.  Gather metrics to explicitly confirm the rule application in each example.\n\n**Metrics and Rule Confirmation**\n\nThe transformation rule identified is:\n*   White (0) pixels remain white (0).\n*   Contiguous horizontal blocks of gray (5) pixels are identified.\n*   If a gray block has length 3, its pixels are changed to blue (1).\n*   If a gray block has any other length, its pixels are changed to orange (7).\n\nAnalysis of examples:\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Output: `[[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Blocks: `5 5 5` (len 3) -> `1 1 1` (Correct); `5 5` (len 2) -> `7 7` (Correct); `5 5` (len 2) -> `7 7` (Correct).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Output: `[[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Blocks: `5 5 5` (len 3) -> `1 1 1` (Correct); `5 5 5 5` (len 4) -> `7 7 7 7` (Correct).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]]`\n    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]]`\n    *   Blocks: `5 5 5 5` (len 4) -> `7 7 7 7` (Correct); `5 5 5` (len 3) -> `1 1 1` (Correct); `5 5 5` (len 3) -> `1 1 1` (Correct).\n\nThe rule holds consistently. The execution error indicates a technical implementation detail needs adjustment, not a flaw in the core logic.\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
