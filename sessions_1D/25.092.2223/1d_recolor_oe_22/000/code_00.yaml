task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D grid)
  input_colors: [white (0), gray (5)]
  output_colors: [white (0), blue (1), orange (7)]
  transformation_scope: Pixel-level, based on local context (contiguous blocks)

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: static, remains unchanged
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - length: integer (number of consecutive gray pixels)
    behavior: changes color based on length

transformation_rules:
  - condition: Pixel is white (0)
    action: Keep pixel white (0)
  - condition: Pixel is gray (5) and belongs to a contiguous block of length 3
    action: Change pixel to blue (1)
  - condition: Pixel is gray (5) and belongs to a contiguous block of length other than 3 (e.g., 2 or 4 in examples)
    action: Change pixel to orange (7)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Defines contiguous blocks of gray pixels.
  - type: mapping
    description: Maps the length of a gray block to a specific output color (3 -> blue, others -> orange).
