**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 1D array (or a 1xN grid) containing only white (0) and gray (5) pixels into a new 1D array. The transformation rule depends on the contiguous blocks of gray pixels. White pixels remain unchanged. Gray pixels are recolored based on the length of the contiguous block they belong to. Specifically, blocks of three consecutive gray pixels are changed to blue (1), while blocks of other lengths (two or four in the examples) are changed to orange (7).

**Facts YAML:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D grid)
  input_colors: [white (0), gray (5)]
  output_colors: [white (0), blue (1), orange (7)]
  transformation_scope: Pixel-level, based on local context (contiguous blocks)

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: static, remains unchanged
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - length: integer (number of consecutive gray pixels)
    behavior: changes color based on length

transformation_rules:
  - condition: Pixel is white (0)
    action: Keep pixel white (0)
  - condition: Pixel is gray (5) and belongs to a contiguous block of length 3
    action: Change pixel to blue (1)
  - condition: Pixel is gray (5) and belongs to a contiguous block of length other than 3 (e.g., 2 or 4 in examples)
    action: Change pixel to orange (7)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Defines contiguous blocks of gray pixels.
  - type: mapping
    description: Maps the length of a gray block to a specific output color (3 -> blue, others -> orange).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous horizontal blocks of gray (5) pixels. Keep track of the start index and length of each block.
3.  For each identified gray block:
    a.  Determine the length of the block.
    b.  If the length is exactly 3, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with blue (1).
    c.  If the length is *not* 3, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with orange (7).
4.  Copy all white (0) pixels from their original positions in the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
