The transformation rule depends on the contiguous blocks of gray pixels. White pixels remain unchanged. Gray pixels are recolored based on the length of the contiguous block they belong to. Specifically, blocks of three consecutive gray pixels are changed to blue (1), while blocks of other lengths (two or four in the examples) are changed to orange (7).\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
