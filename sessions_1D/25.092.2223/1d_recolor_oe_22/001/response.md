import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid based on contiguous blocks of gray pixels.

1.  Iterate through the input grid (treated as a 1D array).
2.  Identify contiguous horizontal blocks of gray (5) pixels.
3.  For each gray block:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  If the length is 3, replace the gray pixels in the output with blue (1).
    c.  If the length is not 3, replace the gray pixels in the output with orange (7).
4.  White (0) pixels remain unchanged in the output.
