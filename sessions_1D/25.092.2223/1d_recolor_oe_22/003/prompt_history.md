**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 1D array (or a 1xN grid) containing only white (0) and gray (5) pixels into a new 1D array. The transformation rule depends on the contiguous blocks of gray pixels. White pixels remain unchanged. Gray pixels are recolored based on the length of the contiguous block they belong to. Specifically, blocks of three consecutive gray pixels are changed to blue (1), while blocks of other lengths (two or four in the examples) are changed to orange (7).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous horizontal blocks of gray (5) pixels. Keep track of the start index and length of each block.
3.  For each identified gray block:
    a.  Determine the length of the block.
    b.  If the length is exactly 3, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with blue (1).
    c.  If the length is *not* 3, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with orange (7).
4.  Copy all white (0) pixels from their original positions in the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The core transformation logic identified in the initial analysis appears correct and consistent across all three training examples. The failure reported during code execution ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") strongly suggests an issue with data types during testing, likely the `transform` function receiving a NumPy array instead of a standard Python list of lists, which then causes problems in conditional statements expecting single boolean values.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-affirm the correctness of the transformation rule based on the examples.
2.  Update the documentation (YAML Facts and Natural Language Program) to reflect the understanding of the rule and acknowledge the potential data type issue encountered during execution, advising the coder phase to handle potential NumPy array inputs robustly.
3.  Gather metrics to explicitly confirm the rule application in each example.

**Metrics and Rule Confirmation**

The transformation rule identified is:
*   White (0) pixels remain white (0).
*   Contiguous horizontal blocks of gray (5) pixels are identified.
*   If a gray block has length 3, its pixels are changed to blue (1).
*   If a gray block has any other length, its pixels are changed to orange (7).

Analysis of examples:
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Output: `[[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Blocks: `5 5 5` (len 3) -> `1 1 1` (Correct); `5 5` (len 2) -> `7 7` (Correct); `5 5` (len 2) -> `7 7` (Correct).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Output: `[[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Blocks: `5 5 5` (len 3) -> `1 1 1` (Correct); `5 5 5 5` (len 4) -> `7 7 7 7` (Correct).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]]`
    *   Output: `[[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]]`
    *   Blocks: `5 5 5 5` (len 4) -> `7 7 7 7` (Correct); `5 5 5` (len 3) -> `1 1 1` (Correct); `5 5 5` (len 3) -> `1 1 1` (Correct).

The rule holds consistently. The execution error indicates a technical implementation detail needs adjustment, not a flaw in the core logic.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid (assumed to be a 1xN grid, potentially represented as a list of lists or a NumPy array).
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initialized with the same values as the input grid or with white (0) pixels.
3.  Focus on the single row of the grid.
4.  Iterate through the row from left to right.
5.  If the current pixel is white (0), leave the corresponding output pixel as white (0) and move to the next pixel.
6.  If the current pixel is gray (5):
    a.  Identify the start of a contiguous block of gray pixels.
    b.  Scan forward to find the end of this contiguous block and determine its length.
    c.  Determine the target color for this block: blue (1) if the length is exactly 3, otherwise orange (7).
    d.  Fill the corresponding segment (from the start index to the end index) in the output row with the determined target color.
    e.  Advance the iteration index to the position immediately after the identified gray block.
7.  Once the iteration through the input row is complete, return the modified output grid in the same format as the input (e.g., list of lists).
