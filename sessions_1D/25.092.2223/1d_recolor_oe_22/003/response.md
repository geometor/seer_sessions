"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid containing white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
White pixels remain unchanged. 
Contiguous horizontal blocks of gray pixels are identified. 
If a gray block has a length of exactly 3, its pixels are changed to blue (1).
If a gray block has any other length, its pixels are changed to orange (7).
The input might be a list of lists or a NumPy array, but processing focuses on the single row.
