Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data are presented as flat strings of numbers. Given the consistent length of 29 (a prime number) for all strings, the most likely grid structure is 1-dimensional (1 row, 29 columns).
2.  **Colors Involved:**
    *   Input grids use only white (0) and maroon (9).
    *   Output grids use white (0), blue (1), and orange (7).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems localized to the maroon (9) pixels. White (0) pixels appear unchanged in their positions and value.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** Observing the changes to maroon pixels:
    *   In `train_1 -> output_1`, `9 9` becomes `7 7`, while `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`, `9` becomes `1`, `9 9 9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1 1 1`, and `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`.
    *   In `train_2 -> output_2`, `9 9 9 9 9 9` becomes `7 7 7 7 7 7`, while `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`, `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`, `9 9 9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1 1 1`, and `9` becomes `1`.
    *   In `train_3 -> output_3`, `9 9 9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1 1 1`, `9 9` becomes `7 7`, `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`, `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`, and `9 9 9 9` becomes `7 7 7 7`.
5.  **Core Logic:** The transformation appears to depend on contiguous horizontal sequences (runs) of maroon (9) pixels. The length of the sequence determines the output color:
    *   Sequences with an *even* length are replaced with orange (7).
    *   Sequences with an *odd* length are replaced with blue (1).

**Facts:**


```python
"""
Transform the input grid based on contiguous horizontal runs of maroon (9) pixels.
1. Identify all horizontal sequences (runs) of consecutive maroon (9) pixels.
2. For each run:
   - If the length of the run is even, replace all maroon (9) pixels in that run with orange (7) in the output grid.
   - If the length of the run is odd, replace all maroon (9) pixels in that run with blue (1) in the output grid.
3. All other pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged in their positions.
The grid is treated as a single row (1-dimensional).
