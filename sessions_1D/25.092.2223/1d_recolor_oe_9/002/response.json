            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: replacing contiguous horizontal runs of maroon (9) pixels based on the parity (even or odd) of the run's length. The errors encountered during the previous execution attempt stemmed from an incorrect assumption about the input data format passed to the `transform` function. The function expected a Python list, while the test harness likely provided a 2D NumPy array (specifically shape (1, N) for these examples, where N=29). The core logic remains sound but needs to be implemented using NumPy array indexing and operations.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the implementation to correctly handle 2D NumPy array inputs, specifically assuming a shape of (1, N) based on the examples. The iteration and pixel replacement logic will be modified to use NumPy's array indexing (`grid[row, col]`). The natural language program and supporting facts will be updated to reflect the 2D nature of the grid (even if only one row is present in the examples) and the row-based processing.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution simulating the likely input format and applying the refined logic:\n\n*   **Input/Output Shapes:** All training examples use input and output grids of shape (1, 29).\n*   **Transformation Logic Validation:** The rule (horizontal maroon run length parity determines replacement color: even -> orange (7), odd -> blue (1)) successfully transforms inputs to outputs for all three examples when applied to the single row of the (1, 29) grid.\n*   **Error Resolution:** Adapting the code to handle NumPy array inputs and indexing (`grid[0, col]`) resolves the `ValueError` and yields correct predictions for all training pairs.\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
