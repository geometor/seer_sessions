InputGrid:
  Type: 2D numpy array
  Shape: (1, 29) # Observed in all training examples
  Pixels:
    - Color: 0 (white)
      Role: Background, static, unchanged by transformation.
    - Color: 9 (maroon)
      Role: Target pixels, subject to transformation based on run properties.

OutputGrid:
  Type: 2D numpy array
  Shape: Identical to InputGrid shape, (1, 29).
  Pixels:
    - Color: 0 (white)
      Source: Copied directly from corresponding input positions.
    - Color: 1 (blue)
      Source: Replaces input maroon (9) pixels belonging to runs of odd length.
    - Color: 7 (orange)
      Source: Replaces input maroon (9) pixels belonging to runs of even length.

Objects:
  - Type: Horizontal Run
    Definition: A maximal contiguous sequence of one or more maroon (9) pixels within a single row.
    Location: Found within the rows of the InputGrid.
    Properties:
      - Length: Integer count of pixels in the run.
      - Parity: Derived property (even or odd) based on Length.

Actions:
  - Action: Scan and Identify Runs
    Input: A row from the InputGrid.
    Output: Identification of all Horizontal Runs within that row (including start/end indices and length).
    Scope: Applied independently to each row (although only one row exists in training examples).
  - Action: Determine Replacement Color
    Input: A Horizontal Run object.
    Output: Replacement color (1 or 7).
    Rule: If Run.Length is even, output 7 (orange); if Run.Length is odd, output 1 (blue).
  - Action: Update Output Grid
    Input: InputGrid, identified Runs, Replacement Colors.
    Process: Create a copy of InputGrid. For each identified Run, overwrite the pixels corresponding to the run's location in the copy with the determined Replacement Color.
    Result: The final OutputGrid.

TransformationRuleSummary:
  - Preserve the grid dimensions.
  - Preserve the location and color of all white (0) pixels.
  - Identify all contiguous horizontal runs of maroon (9) pixels within each row.
  - Replace the maroon pixels of each run with a new color determined by the run's length: blue (1) for odd length, orange (7) for even length.
