"""
Transform the input grid based on contiguous horizontal runs of maroon (9) pixels.
1. Identify all horizontal sequences (runs) of consecutive maroon (9) pixels.
2. For each run:
   - If the length of the run is even, replace all maroon (9) pixels in that run with orange (7) in the output grid.
   - If the length of the run is odd, replace all maroon (9) pixels in that run with blue (1) in the output grid.
3. All other pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged in their positions.
The grid is treated as a single row (1-dimensional).
