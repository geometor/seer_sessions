Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data are presented as flat strings of numbers. Given the consistent length of 29 (a prime number) for all strings, the most likely grid structure is 1-dimensional (1 row, 29 columns).
2.  **Colors Involved:**
    *   Input grids use only white (0) and maroon (9).
    *   Output grids use white (0), blue (1), and orange (7).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems localized to the maroon (9) pixels. White (0) pixels appear unchanged in their positions and value.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** Observing the changes to maroon pixels:
    *   In `train_1 -> output_1`, `9 9` becomes `7 7`, while `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`, `9` becomes `1`, `9 9 9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1 1 1`, and `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`.
    *   In `train_2 -> output_2`, `9 9 9 9 9 9` becomes `7 7 7 7 7 7`, while `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`, `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`, `9 9 9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1 1 1`, and `9` becomes `1`.
    *   In `train_3 -> output_3`, `9 9 9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1 1 1`, `9 9` becomes `7 7`, `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`, `9 9 9` becomes `1 1 1`, and `9 9 9 9` becomes `7 7 7 7`.
5.  **Core Logic:** The transformation appears to depend on contiguous horizontal sequences (runs) of maroon (9) pixels. The length of the sequence determines the output color:
    *   Sequences with an *even* length are replaced with orange (7).
    *   Sequences with an *odd* length are replaced with blue (1).

**Facts:**
