**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional grids or single rows/columns from larger grids. They consist of pixels with values 0 (white) and 4 (yellow) in the input, and 0 (white), 7 (orange), and 9 (maroon) in the output.
2.  **Background:** The white pixels (0) act as a background or separator and remain unchanged in their positions from input to output.
3.  **Objects:** The core objects are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of yellow pixels (4) in the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation acts specifically on these yellow blocks. Each yellow block changes color entirely. The resulting color depends on a property of the original yellow block.
5.  **Color Mapping Rule:**
    *   In train_1: a block of size 3 becomes maroon (9), a block of size 6 becomes orange (7), and a block of size 1 becomes maroon (9).
    *   In train_2: a block of size 6 becomes orange (7), a block of size 3 becomes maroon (9), and a block of size 5 becomes maroon (9).
    *   In train_3: a block of size 6 becomes orange (7), and two blocks of size 3 become maroon (9).
6.  **Pattern:** By observing the relationship between the size (length) of the yellow block and its resulting color, a pattern emerges:
    *   Yellow blocks of *odd* length (1, 3, 5) change to maroon (9).
    *   Yellow blocks of *even* length (6) change to orange (7).

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: "Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of a specific color based on the block's length parity (odd/even)."
elements:
  - type: background
    color: 0 # white
    behavior: static, remains unchanged
  - type: active_pixels
    color: 4 # yellow
    behavior: forms contiguous horizontal blocks, changes color based on block property
objects:
  - type: block
    definition: a contiguous horizontal sequence of yellow (4) pixels
    properties:
      - length: the number of pixels in the block
      - parity: whether the length is odd or even
relationships:
  - type: color_mapping
    input_color: 4 # yellow
    based_on: block length parity
    rules:
      - condition: length is odd
        output_color: 9 # maroon
      - condition: length is even
        output_color: 7 # orange
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: Assumed 1D (single row) based on examples, but could apply row-wise to 2D grids.
  contiguity: Horizontal adjacency is key for defining blocks.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, identifying the start of contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow (4) pixels.
3.  For each identified yellow block:
    a.  Measure its length (number of consecutive yellow pixels).
    b.  Determine if the length is odd or even.
    c.  If the length is odd, change the color of all pixels within that block in the output grid to maroon (9).
    d.  If the length is even, change the color of all pixels within that block in the output grid to orange (7).
4.  Ensure that pixels belonging to an already processed block are skipped in subsequent iterations to avoid recounting.
5.  Leave all non-yellow pixels (e.g., white (0)) unchanged in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
