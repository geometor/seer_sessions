task_description: "Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of a specific color based on the block's length parity (odd/even)."
elements:
  - type: background
    color: 0 # white
    behavior: static, remains unchanged
  - type: active_pixels
    color: 4 # yellow
    behavior: forms contiguous horizontal blocks, changes color based on block property
objects:
  - type: block
    definition: a contiguous horizontal sequence of yellow (4) pixels
    properties:
      - length: the number of pixels in the block
      - parity: whether the length is odd or even
relationships:
  - type: color_mapping
    input_color: 4 # yellow
    based_on: block length parity
    rules:
      - condition: length is odd
        output_color: 9 # maroon
      - condition: length is even
        output_color: 7 # orange
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: Assumed 1D (single row) based on examples, but could apply row-wise to 2D grids.
  contiguity: Horizontal adjacency is key for defining blocks.
