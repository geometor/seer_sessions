            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional grids or single rows/columns from larger grids. They consist of pixels with values 0 (white) and 4 (yellow) in the input, and 0 (white), 7 (orange), and 9 (maroon) in the output.\n2.  **Background:** The white pixels (0) act as a background or separator and remain unchanged in their positions from input to output.\n3.  **Objects:** The core objects are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of yellow pixels (4) in the input.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation acts specifically on these yellow blocks. Each yellow block changes color entirely. The resulting color depends on a property of the original yellow block.\n5.  **Color Mapping Rule:**\n    *   In train_1: a block of size 3 becomes maroon (9), a block of size 6 becomes orange (7), and a block of size 1 becomes maroon (9).\n    *   In train_2: a block of size 6 becomes orange (7), a block of size 3 becomes maroon (9), and a block of size 5 becomes maroon (9).\n    *   In train_3: a block of size 6 becomes orange (7), and two blocks of size 3 become maroon (9).\n6.  **Pattern:** By observing the relationship between the size (length) of the yellow block and its resulting color, a pattern emerges:\n    *   Yellow blocks of *odd* length (1, 3, 5) change to maroon (9).\n    *   Yellow blocks of *even* length (6) change to orange (7).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
