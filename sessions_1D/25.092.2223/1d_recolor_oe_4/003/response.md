Transforms an input grid by changing the color of maroon (9) pixels based on their row position relative to the topmost row containing any maroon pixel in the entire grid. Maroon pixels in the topmost row become azure (8), and maroon pixels in subsequent rows become red (2). White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
