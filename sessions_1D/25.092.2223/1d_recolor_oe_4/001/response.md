"""
Transforms an input grid by changing the color of maroon (9) pixels based on their row position relative to the topmost row containing any maroon pixels.

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row`) that contains any maroon (9) pixels.
3.  If no maroon pixels are found, return the original grid.
4.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
5.  If a cell contains a maroon (9) pixel:
    a. If the cell's row index is equal to `min_row`, change the corresponding output cell to azure (8).
    b. If the cell's row index is greater than `min_row`, change the corresponding output cell to red (2).
6.  Leave all white (0) cells unchanged.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
