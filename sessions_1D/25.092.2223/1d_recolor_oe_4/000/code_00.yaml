task_context:
  - The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and maroon (9).
  - The output grid contains three colors: white (0), red (2), and azure (8).
  - White pixels in the input remain white in the output.
  - Maroon pixels in the input are transformed into either red or azure pixels in the output.
  - The transformation rule for maroon pixels depends on their row index.

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: remains unchanged between input and output.
  - type: shape
    color: maroon (9) in input
    behavior:
      - transformed into a shape of the same configuration but with different colors (red and azure).
      - the transformation depends on the vertical position within the shape.

properties:
  - min_maroon_row: The smallest row index containing at least one maroon (9) pixel in the input grid.

relationships:
  - position_based_transformation: A maroon pixel's output color depends on its row index relative to the `min_maroon_row`.

transformation:
  - identify the `min_maroon_row`.
  - iterate through each pixel of the input grid:
    - if the pixel color is white (0), the output pixel color is white (0).
    - if the pixel color is maroon (9):
      - if the pixel's row index equals `min_maroon_row`, the output pixel color is azure (8).
      - if the pixel's row index is greater than `min_maroon_row`, the output pixel color is red (2).
