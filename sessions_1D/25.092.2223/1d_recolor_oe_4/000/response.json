The maroon pixels from the input are transformed into either azure pixels (8) or red pixels (2) in the output. The overall shape formed by the non-white pixels remains the same between input and output.\n\nThe transformation logic appears to depend on the vertical position (row index) of the maroon pixels relative to the entire maroon shape. Specifically, the maroon pixels located in the topmost row containing any maroon pixels are changed to azure (8). All other maroon pixels (those in rows below the topmost row) are changed to red (2).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
