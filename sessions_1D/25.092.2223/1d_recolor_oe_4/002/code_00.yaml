task_context:
  - The input grid contains white (0) and maroon (9) pixels.
  - The output grid contains white (0), red (2), and azure (8) pixels.
  - White pixels remain unchanged.
  - Maroon pixels are transformed based on their row position relative to the topmost row containing any maroon pixel in the entire grid.

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: remains unchanged.
  - type: shape_pixels
    color: maroon (9) in input
    behavior: transformed to azure (8) or red (2) based on row index.

properties:
  - global_min_maroon_row: The minimum row index containing any maroon (9) pixel across the entire input grid.

relationships:
  - position_based_transformation: A maroon pixel's output color depends on its row index (`r`) relative to the `global_min_maroon_row`.

transformation:
  - Find `global_min_maroon_row`.
  - If no maroon pixels exist, return the input grid.
  - Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)`:
    - If white (0), keep white (0).
    - If maroon (9):
      - If `r == global_min_maroon_row`, change to azure (8).
      - If `r > global_min_maroon_row`, change to red (2).
