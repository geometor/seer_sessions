*   **Perception:** The input grids contain patterns made of green (3) pixels on a white (0) background. The output grids retain the white background but replace the green pixels with either gray (5) or magenta (6) pixels. The specific replacement color (gray or magenta) appears to depend on the properties of the contiguous green shapes (objects) in the input. By analyzing the examples, it seems the size (number of pixels) of each distinct green object determines its output color. Specifically, green objects composed of an even number of pixels are transformed into magenta objects, while green objects composed of an odd number of pixels are transformed into gray objects. The shape and position of the objects are preserved, only their color changes based on this size parity rule. The input data is presented as a flat list but represents a 2D grid (likely 4x8 based on the length 32).

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context: color_transformation_based_on_object_size_parity
    grid_representation: 2D_array # inferred from data length and ARC context
    input_elements:
      - element: background
        color: white (0)
        properties: static, occupies remaining space
      - element: shape_pixels
        color: green (3)
        properties: form contiguous objects
    output_elements:
      - element: background
        color: white (0)
        properties: identical to input background
      - element: transformed_shape_pixels
        color: [gray (5), magenta (6)]
        properties: replace green pixels, occupy same locations
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_pixel_group
        input_color: green (3)
        properties:
          - size: number of pixels in the group (integer > 0)
          - location: grid coordinates occupied by the object
        relationships:
          - separate from other green objects (or connected only diagonally)
    actions:
      - action: identify_objects
        input: input_grid
        target: green (3) pixels
        method: find connected components (4-connectivity)
        output: list of green objects, each defined by its pixel coordinates
      - action: calculate_object_size
        input: identified green object
        output: pixel count (size) for the object
      - action: determine_output_color
        input: object_size
        condition:
          - if size is even:
              output_color: magenta (6)
          - if size is odd:
              output_color: gray (5)
      - action: apply_transformation
        input: input_grid, identified_objects, output_colors
        process: create output grid by replacing pixels of each green object with its determined output_color
        preserve: white (0) background pixels
    transformation_rule: Green objects with an even pixel count are recolored to magenta; green objects with an odd pixel count are recolored to gray. Background remains white.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of green (3) pixels in the input grid. Use 4-connectivity (pixels sharing an edge are considered connected).
    3.  For each identified green object:
        a.  Count the total number of pixels belonging to that object (calculate its size).
        b.  Check if the size is even or odd.
        c.  If the size is even, determine the target color to be magenta (6).
        d.  If the size is odd, determine the target color to be gray (5).
        e.  Update the output grid by changing the color of all pixels belonging to this object to the determined target color (magenta or gray).
    4.  Return the modified output grid. White (0) pixels remain unchanged throughout the process.
