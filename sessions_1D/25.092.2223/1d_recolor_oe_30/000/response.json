The output grids retain the white background but replace the green pixels with either gray (5) or magenta (6) pixels. The specific replacement color (gray or magenta) appears to depend on the properties of the contiguous green shapes (objects) in the input. By analyzing the examples, it seems the size (number of pixels) of each distinct green object determines its output color. Specifically, green objects composed of an even number of pixels are transformed into magenta objects, while green objects composed of an odd number of pixels are transformed into gray objects. The shape and position of the objects are preserved, only their color changes based on this size parity rule. The input data is presented as a flat list but represents a 2D grid (likely 4x8 based on the length 32).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
