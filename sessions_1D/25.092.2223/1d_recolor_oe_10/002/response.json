The initial code attempted to force the 1D list input into a 2D NumPy array structure (`np.array([input_grid])`), which might be causing inconsistencies.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the exact structure and dimensionality of the input arrays as processed by the NumPy conversion step using `tool_code`.\n2.  Adjust the code logic to correctly handle the actual array shape, likely by treating it as a purely 1D array for iteration and segment finding.\n3.  Re-evaluate the segment identification and recoloring logic based on the 1D structure.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the 1D processing approach.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's inspect the shape of the NumPy array created from the first training example's input.\n"

Therefore, the line `rows, cols = input_grid_np.shape` *should* successfully unpack `(1, N)` into `rows=1` and `cols=N`. The error \"too many values to unpack\" is therefore unexpected based on this check alone.\n\nHowever, the error message implies that `input_grid_np.shape` is *not* returning a 2-element tuple as expected in the execution environment where the tests were run. Perhaps there's an edge case or environment difference. A safer approach is to process the input directly as a 1D array, as its shape is consistently `(N,)`, which avoids the 2D indexing and unpacking issues altogether.\n\nThe segment analysis confirms the transformation logic (odd length -> green (3), even length -> gray (5)) remains valid.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
