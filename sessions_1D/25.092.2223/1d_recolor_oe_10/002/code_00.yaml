task: Recolor contiguous magenta segments in a 1D grid based on their length parity.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single list of integers)
  input_colors: [white (0), magenta (6)]
  output_colors: [white (0), green (3), gray (5)]
  structure: linear sequence of pixels
objects:
  - type: contiguous_segment
    description: A sequence of one or more adjacent pixels of the same color.
    input_color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - length: number of pixels in the segment
      - start_index: index of the first pixel in the segment
      - end_index: index of the pixel immediately after the segment
relationships:
  - input magenta segments map directly to output segments of a different color at the same location.
  - the output color depends solely on the length property of the corresponding input segment.
transformations:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Scan the 1D input grid linearly to find contiguous segments of magenta (6) pixels. Record their start index and length.
  - action: conditional_recolor
    description: For each identified magenta segment, determine its output color based on its length.
    conditions:
      - if: length is even
        then: set the output color to gray (5).
      - if: length is odd
        then: set the output color to green (3).
  - action: apply_recolor
    description: Create an output grid by copying the input grid, then update the pixel values within the identified segment boundaries to the determined output color.
  - action: preserve_background
    description: Pixels not belonging to any magenta segment (i.e., white pixels) retain their original color (0) in the output grid.
output_specification:
  - The output grid is a 1D list of the same length as the input grid.
  - Pixels corresponding to input magenta segments are recolored based on the length parity rule.
  - All other pixels retain their original color (white).
