"""
Recolor contiguous segments of magenta (6) pixels based on their size parity.
Segments with an even number of pixels are changed to gray (5).
Segments with an odd number of pixels are changed to green (3).
All other pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged.
The input and output grids have the same dimensions, and the examples provided are 1-dimensional (single row).
