            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (represented as single rows). The input grids contain white (0) and magenta (6) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), green (3), and gray (5) pixels.\n\nThe core transformation involves identifying contiguous segments (objects) of magenta pixels in the input grid. The color of these segments is then changed in the output grid based on a specific property of each segment. The white background pixels remain unchanged.\n\nBy comparing the input and output across the examples, we observe:\n- In `train_1`: A segment of 4 magenta pixels becomes gray, a segment of 1 becomes green, and a segment of 3 becomes green.\n- In `train_2`: A segment of 2 magenta pixels becomes gray, and a segment of 5 becomes green.\n- In `train_3`: A segment of 3 magenta pixels becomes green, a segment of 2 becomes gray, and a segment of 4 becomes gray.\n\nThis pattern suggests the transformation rule depends on the *size* (number of pixels) of each contiguous magenta segment. Specifically:\n- Segments with an *even* number of pixels (size 2, 4) are changed to gray (5).\n- Segments with an *odd* number of pixels (size 1, 3, 5) are changed to green (3).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
