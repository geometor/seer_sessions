task: Recolor magenta objects based on their size parity.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row)
  input_colors: [white (0), magenta (6)]
  output_colors: [white (0), green (3), gray (5)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_segment
    input_color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - size: number of pixels in the segment
      - position: indices of the pixels in the grid
relationships:
  - input objects map directly to output objects in terms of position and extent.
  - the output color depends solely on the size property of the corresponding input object.
transformations:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous segments of magenta (6) pixels in the input grid.
  - action: analyze_property
    description: For each identified magenta segment, calculate its size (pixel count).
  - action: conditional_recolor
    conditions:
      - if: size is even
        then: change the color of all pixels in the segment to gray (5).
      - if: size is odd
        then: change the color of all pixels in the segment to green (3).
  - action: preserve_background
    description: Keep all white (0) pixels unchanged.
output_specification:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Pixels corresponding to input magenta segments are recolored based on the size parity rule.
  - All other pixels retain their original color (white).
