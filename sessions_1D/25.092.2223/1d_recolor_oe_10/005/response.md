"""
Transforms an input grid by recoloring contiguous horizontal segments of magenta (6) pixels based on their length parity.
Segments with an odd number of pixels (length) are changed to green (3).
Segments with an even number of pixels (length) are changed to gray (5).
All other pixels (e.g., white (0)) remain unchanged.
The function handles grids of any dimension (1D or 2D) by processing each row independently.
