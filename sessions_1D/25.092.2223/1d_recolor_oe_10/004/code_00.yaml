task: Recolor contiguous horizontal magenta segments based on their length parity.
input_format: Grid (typically NumPy array, examples show 1xN dimensions)
output_format: Grid (same dimensions as input, typically NumPy array)
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: Primarily 1D (horizontal), but logic should handle rows independently in 2D.
  input_colors: [white (0), magenta (6)]
  output_colors: [white (0), green (3), gray (5)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    input_color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - length: number of pixels in the segment along a row.
      - position: starting and ending column indices within a row.
      - row_index: the row where the segment occurs.
relationships:
  - Each input magenta segment maps directly to an output segment of the same size and position.
  - The output color depends solely on the length property of the corresponding input segment.
transformations:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: For each row in the input grid, find all contiguous horizontal segments of magenta (6) pixels.
    details: Store the start index, end index, and length for each segment found.
  - action: conditional_recolor
    description: Based on the length of each identified magenta segment, determine its new color.
    conditions:
      - if: segment length is odd
        then: assign green (3) as the target color.
      - if: segment length is even
        then: assign gray (5) as the target color.
  - action: apply_recoloring
    description: Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input. For each identified segment, update the corresponding pixels in the output grid with the determined target color.
  - action: preserve_background
    description: Pixels not part of any magenta segment (i.e., white pixels) retain their original color (0) in the output grid.
output_specification:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions and data type as the input grid.
  - Pixels corresponding to input magenta segments are recolored based on the odd/even length rule.
  - All other pixels retain their original input color.
