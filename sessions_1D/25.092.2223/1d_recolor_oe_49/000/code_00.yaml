Input Grid:
  - Contains a background color: white (0)
  - Contains foreground objects composed of a single color: magenta (6)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous clusters of magenta (6) pixels.
  - Properties:
    - Color: magenta (6)
    - Size: Variable number of pixels per object.
    - Shape: Variable shapes.
  - Identification: Defined by adjacency (side-by-side or diagonal) of magenta pixels.

Transformation:
  - Target: Pixels within magenta (6) objects.
  - Action: Recolor magenta (6) pixels based on a property of the object they belong to.
  - Rule:
    - Determine the size (pixel count) of each distinct magenta object.
    - If the object's size is odd: change all its pixels to green (3).
    - If the object's size is even: change all its pixels to maroon (9).
  - Non-Target Pixels: White (0) background pixels remain unchanged.

Output Grid:
  - Retains the same dimensions as the input.
  - Background remains white (0).
  - Original magenta objects are replaced by objects of the same shape but colored either green (3) or maroon (9) based on the size rule.
