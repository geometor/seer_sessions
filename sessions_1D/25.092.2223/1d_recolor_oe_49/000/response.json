These objects vary in shape and size across the examples.\n4.  **Transformation:** The magenta (6) pixels in the input are transformed into either green (3) or maroon (9) pixels in the output. The spatial arrangement and shape of the original magenta objects are preserved in the output, but their color changes.\n5.  **Color Change Logic:** The determining factor for the output color (green or maroon) appears to be the size (number of pixels) of the original magenta object. Objects with an odd number of pixels become green (3), while objects with an even number of pixels become maroon (9).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
