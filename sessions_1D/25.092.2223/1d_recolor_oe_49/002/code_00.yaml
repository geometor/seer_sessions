Facts:
  Input Grid:
    - Contains a background color: white (0)
    - Contains foreground areas composed of magenta (6) pixels.

  Objects:
    - Type: Maximal contiguous rectangles composed solely of magenta (6) pixels.
    - Identification: A rectangle of magenta pixels is maximal if it cannot be extended in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and still consist entirely of magenta pixels.
    - Properties:
      - Color: magenta (6)
      - Size: Number of pixels (width * height).
      - Shape: Rectangle.
    - Overlap: It's possible for a single magenta pixel to belong to multiple maximal rectangles (e.g., a 2x2 square contains four 1x2 rectangles, four 2x1 rectangles, and one 2x2 rectangle). The rule must specify how to handle pixels potentially belonging to multiple maximal rectangles with different size parities. *Observation:* Looking closely, the output coloration suggests that each *input magenta pixel* is assigned a *single* output color. This implies either:
        a) Only specific maximal rectangles are considered (e.g., largest area first?), OR
        b) Each pixel is colored based on *one specific* maximal rectangle it belongs to (perhaps the first one found, or the largest one it's part of?). OR
        c) The "objects" are not maximal rectangles, but rather the original "sub-shapes" visually identified, and a rule exists to partition the connected components into these shapes.

  Let's stick to the Maximal Rectangle Hypothesis as the most promising structured approach found so far and assume for now that the process ensures each pixel gets colored uniquely based on *some* maximal rectangle it belongs to. Re-checking Example 1: The 'T' shape isn't one maximal rectangle. This invalidates the maximal rectangle hypothesis as stated.

  Backtracking: The first analysis identifying distinct visual shapes (T, L, square, line) in the output seemed correct intuitively.
  *   Example 1 Shapes: T (5, odd->G), L (4, even->M), Square (4, even->M), Diag Line (3, odd->G). Output: G, M, M, G. Matches.
  *   Example 2 Shapes: Vert Line (2, even->M), Pixel (1, odd->G), Horiz Line (3, odd->G), Plus (5, odd->G), Square (4, even->M). Output: M, G, G, G, M. Matches.
  *   Example 3 Shapes: Horiz Line (2, even->M), Vert Line (3, odd->G), Horiz Line (3, odd->G), L (3, odd->G), Pixel (1, odd->G). Output: M, G, G, G, G. Matches.

  This confirms the original intuitive segmentation was correct. The challenge is defining *how* the input's connected components are segmented into these specific shapes. The connected components algorithm (BFS/DFS) naturally finds the entire connected blob. The segmentation seems to happen *after* identifying the blob, or the definition of "object" is different.

  Let's refine the "Facts" based on the idea of partitioning the connected components.

  Facts (Revised):
    Input Grid:
      - Contains a background color: white (0)
      - Contains foreground objects composed of magenta (6) pixels.

    Initial Objects:
      - Type: Contiguous clusters of magenta (6) pixels identified using 8-way connectivity.

    Segmentation:
      - Each initial magenta object (connected component) is implicitly partitioned into smaller, non-overlapping sub-regions or "final objects".
      - The partitioning logic is not explicitly defined but results in visually distinct shapes (lines, L-shapes, T-shapes, squares, single pixels) seen in the examples.

    Final Objects (Sub-Regions):
      - Properties:
        - Color: Derived from input magenta pixels.
        - Size: Number of pixels in the sub-region.
        - Shape: Simple geometric shapes (lines, squares, L, T, etc.).
      - Identification: These are the contiguous blocks of green (3) or maroon (9) pixels seen in the output grid.

    Transformation:
      - Target: Pixels within magenta (6) connected components.
      - Action:
        1. Identify connected components of magenta (6) pixels (using 8-way adjacency).
        2. Partition each connected component into a set of smaller, non-overlapping "sub-regions" based on local geometric properties or shape recognition. (This partitioning step is the core unknown).
        3. For each identified "sub-region":
           a. Calculate its size (pixel count).
           b. Determine the output color based on size parity: green (3) if odd, maroon (9) if even.
           c. Recolor all pixels corresponding to this sub-region in the output grid with the determined color.
      - Non-Target Pixels: White (0) background pixels remain unchanged.

    Output Grid:
      - Retains the same dimensions as the input.
      - Background remains white (0).
      - Original magenta connected components are replaced by a mosaic of green (3) and maroon (9) sub-regions, where the color of each sub-region depends on the parity of its pixel count.
