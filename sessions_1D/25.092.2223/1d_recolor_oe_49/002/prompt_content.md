"""
Identifies distinct, contiguous objects composed of magenta (6) pixels in the input grid using 8-way connectivity.
For each identified magenta object, it calculates its size (number of pixels).
If the object's size is odd, all its pixels in the output grid are changed to green (3).
If the object's size is even, all its pixels in the output grid are changed to maroon (9).
All non-magenta pixels (e.g., white/0 background) remain unchanged.
