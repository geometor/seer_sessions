The provided Python code implements this logic using an 8-way connected components algorithm (BFS).\n\nThe error messages (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...\") reported during testing do not stem from the `transform` function's logic itself, but likely from the external testing harness comparing the output array (potentially as a NumPy array) with the expected output array incorrectly. The function returns a standard Python list of lists, as expected.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to confirm the transformation rule by systematically analyzing each example and gathering metrics, then refine the documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) to ensure clarity and accuracy based on this confirmation. The underlying logic appears sound and consistent across all provided training examples.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

            "text": "**Revised Assessment based on Metrics**\n\nThe `tool_code` execution reveals a significant discrepancy in Example 1. My manual analysis incorrectly identified multiple separate objects. The `find_connected_components` function, implementing 8-way adjacency correctly, identified *only one* large magenta object comprising all 16 magenta pixels in the input.\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis Revised:**\n    *   Input: One single magenta object of size 16 (Even).\n    *   Expected Output Color: Maroon (9).\n    *   Actual Output Grid: Shows multiple objects colored green (3) and maroon (9).\n*   **Example 2 Analysis Revised:**\n    *   Input: Two magenta objects.\n        *   Object 1: Size 14 (Even) -> Expected Maroon (9). Actual Output: Maroon (9). Correct.\n        *   Object 2: Size 1 (Odd) -> Expected Green (3). Actual Output: Green (3). Correct.\n*   **Example 3 Analysis Revised:**\n    *   Input: One single magenta object of size 12 (Even).\n    *   Expected Output Color: Maroon (9).\n    *   Actual Output Grid: Shows multiple objects colored green (3) and maroon (9).\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial hypothesis (recolor based on the size/parity of the *entire* connected component) is **incorrect** or incomplete. It works for Example 2 but fails for Examples 1 and 3.\n\n**New Hypothesis Generation:**\n\nLet's reconsider the inputs and outputs, especially for Examples 1 and 3 where the connected component analysis failed.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Object (Size 16, Even) -> Output shows Green (odd) and Maroon (even) regions.\n    *   Notice the shapes within the output:\n        *   Top 'T': 5 pixels -> Green (3) [Odd size]\n        *   Middle Left 'L': 4 pixels -> Maroon (9) [Even size]\n        *   Middle Right square: 4 pixels -> Maroon (9) [Even size]\n        *   Bottom Right diag: 3 pixels -> Green (3) [Odd size]\n    *   It seems the transformation rule applies not to the entire connected magenta component, but perhaps to smaller, visually distinct sub-shapes *within* the component, or based on some other local property.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Object (Size 12, Even) -> Output shows Green (odd) and Maroon (even) regions.\n    *   Output shapes:\n        *   Top line: 2 pixels -> Maroon (9) [Even size]\n        *   Middle left line: 3 pixels -> Green (3) [Odd size]\n        *   Middle horizontal line: 3 pixels -> Green (3) [Odd size]\n        *   Middle right 'L': 3 pixels -> Green (3) [Odd size]\n        *   Bottom pixel: 1 pixel -> Green (3) [Odd size]\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies maximal contiguous sub-regions *within* the input magenta objects that correspond to simple shapes (lines, squares, L-shapes, T-shapes, single pixels). It then calculates the size of *these sub-shapes* and recolors them based on their individual size parity (Odd -> Green, Even -> Maroon). The definition of these \"sub-shapes\" needs clarification. How are they segmented from the larger connected component?\n\nPossibility 1: Segmentation based on local neighborhood density? (e.g., pixels with fewer magenta neighbors act as boundaries?)\nPossibility 2: Segmentation based on recognizing predefined simple geometric shapes?\n\nLet's re-examine Example 1 visually: The sub-shapes identified ('T', 'L', square, diagonal line) look like maximal blocks of magenta pixels where each pixel has at least one adjacent (4-way or 8-way?) magenta neighbor *within that sub-shape*. This needs a more robust definition.\n\nConsider adjacency *within the magenta pixels only*. In Example 1, the pixel at (1, 2) connects the top 'T' shape to the middle 'L' shape. The pixel at (1, 4) connects the top 'T' shape to the middle right square. The pixel at (2, 4) connects the middle right square to the bottom right diagonal line. These connecting pixels seem to be the points where the larger object is conceptually \"broken down\" into the smaller shapes seen in the output.\n\n**Refined Hypothesis v2:**\n1. Identify all magenta (6) pixels.\n2. For each magenta pixel, determine its local \"sub-object\" based on some criteria (perhaps related to local connectivity patterns or maximal simple shapes).\n3. Calculate the size of this \"sub-object\".\n4. Recolor the pixel based on the parity of the sub-object's size (Odd -> 3, Even -> 9).\n\nThis is still vague. Let's reconsider the simplest explanation that fits: The original hypothesis might be correct, but my manual splitting of objects in the initial analysis was *accidentally* correct for the output, while the code's strict connected components approach was too broad for examples 1 & 3.\n\nWhat if the definition of \"object\" isn't just any connected component, but specifically **maximal rectangles** of magenta pixels?\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Maximal Rectangles:\n        *   (0, 2) to (0, 6): 1x5 -> Size 5 (Odd) -> Green (3). Matches output.\n        *   (1, 1) to (1, 2): 1x2 -> Size 2 (Even) -> Maroon (9). Matches output.\n        *   (1, 4) to (1, 5): 1x2 -> Size 2 (Even) -> Maroon (9). Matches output.\n        *   (2, 0) to (2, 3): 1x4 -> Size 4 (Even) -> Maroon (9). Matches output.\n        *   (2, 5) to (2, 7): 1x3 -> Size 3 (Odd) -> Green (3). Matches output.\n    *   This seems promising! It covers all magenta pixels and explains the output colors.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Maximal Rectangles:\n        *   (0, 1) to (0, 2): 1x2 -> Size 2 (Even) -> Maroon (9). Matches output.\n        *   (0, 4) to (0, 4): 1x1 -> Size 1 (Odd) -> Green (3). Matches output.\n        *   (1, 0) to (1, 2): 1x3 -> Size 3 (Odd) -> Green (3). Matches output.\n        *   (2, 0) to (2, 4): 1x5 -> Size 5 (Odd) -> Green (3). Matches output.\n        *   (3, 0) to (3, 3): 1x4 -> Size 4 (Even) -> Maroon (9). Matches output.\n    *   This also works perfectly.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Maximal Rectangles:\n        *   (0, 2) to (0, 3): 1x2 -> Size 2 (Even) -> Maroon (9). Matches output.\n        *   (1, 1) to (1, 3): 1x3 -> Size 3 (Odd) -> Green (3). Matches output.\n        *   (2, 0) to (2, 2): 1x3 -> Size 3 (Odd) -> Green (3). Matches output.\n        *   (2, 4) to (2, 6): 1x3 -> Size 3 (Odd) -> Green (3). Matches output.\n        *   (3, 1) to (3, 1): 1x1 -> Size 1 (Odd) -> Green (3). Matches output.\n    *   Works here too.\n\n**Final Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies all **maximal rectangles** composed entirely of magenta (6) pixels within the input grid. For each such maximal rectangle, it calculates its size (number of pixels). If the size is odd, all pixels within that rectangle in the output grid are colored green (3). If the size is even, they are colored maroon (9). Pixels belonging to multiple maximal rectangles seem to take their color from one of them (need to verify overlap handling, though visually it seems each input pixel maps to exactly one output color determined this way). White (0) background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n"

            "text": "```yaml\nFacts:\n  Input Grid:\n    - Contains a background color: white (0)\n    - Contains foreground areas composed of magenta (6) pixels.\n\n  Objects:\n    - Type: Maximal contiguous rectangles composed solely of magenta (6) pixels.\n    - Identification: A rectangle of magenta pixels is maximal if it cannot be extended in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and still consist entirely of magenta pixels.\n    - Properties:\n      - Color: magenta (6)\n      - Size: Number of pixels (width * height).\n      - Shape: Rectangle.\n    - Overlap: It's possible for a single magenta pixel to belong to multiple maximal rectangles (e.g., a 2x2 square contains four 1x2 rectangles, four 2x1 rectangles, and one 2x2 rectangle). The rule must specify how to handle pixels potentially belonging to multiple maximal rectangles with different size parities. *Observation:* Looking closely, the output coloration suggests that each *input magenta pixel* is assigned a *single* output color. This implies either:\n        a) Only specific maximal rectangles are considered (e.g., largest area first?), OR\n        b) Each pixel is colored based on *one specific* maximal rectangle it belongs to (perhaps the first one found, or the largest one it's part of?). OR\n        c) The \"objects\" are not maximal rectangles, but rather the original \"sub-shapes\" visually identified, and a rule exists to partition the connected components into these shapes.\n\n  Let's stick to the Maximal Rectangle Hypothesis as the most promising structured approach found so far and assume for now that the process ensures each pixel gets colored uniquely based on *some* maximal rectangle it belongs to. Re-checking Example 1: The 'T' shape isn't one maximal rectangle. This invalidates the maximal rectangle hypothesis as stated.\n\n  Backtracking: The first analysis identifying distinct visual shapes (T, L, square, line) in the output seemed correct intuitively.\n  *   Example 1 Shapes: T (5, odd->G), L (4, even->M), Square (4, even->M), Diag Line (3, odd->G). Output: G, M, M, G. Matches.\n  *   Example 2 Shapes: Vert Line (2, even->M), Pixel (1, odd->G), Horiz Line (3, odd->G), Plus (5, odd->G), Square (4, even->M). Output: M, G, G, G, M. Matches.\n  *   Example 3 Shapes: Horiz Line (2, even->M), Vert Line (3, odd->G), Horiz Line (3, odd->G), L (3, odd->G), Pixel (1, odd->G). Output: M, G, G, G, G. Matches.\n\n  This confirms the original intuitive segmentation was correct. The challenge is defining *how* the input's connected components are segmented into these specific shapes. The connected components algorithm (BFS/DFS) naturally finds the entire connected blob. The segmentation seems to happen *after* identifying the blob, or the definition of \"object\" is different.\n\n  Let's refine the \"Facts\" based on the idea of partitioning the connected components.\n\n  Facts (Revised):\n    Input Grid:\n      - Contains a background color: white (0)\n      - Contains foreground objects composed of magenta (6) pixels.\n\n    Initial Objects:\n      - Type: Contiguous clusters of magenta (6) pixels identified using 8-way connectivity.\n\n    Segmentation:\n      - Each initial magenta object (connected component) is implicitly partitioned into smaller, non-overlapping sub-regions or \"final objects\".\n      - The partitioning logic is not explicitly defined but results in visually distinct shapes (lines, L-shapes, T-shapes, squares, single pixels) seen in the examples.\n\n    Final Objects (Sub-Regions):\n      - Properties:\n        - Color: Derived from input magenta pixels.\n        - Size: Number of pixels in the sub-region.\n        - Shape: Simple geometric shapes (lines, squares, L, T, etc.).\n      - Identification: These are the contiguous blocks of green (3) or maroon (9) pixels seen in the output grid.\n\n    Transformation:\n      - Target: Pixels within magenta (6) connected components.\n      - Action:\n        1. Identify connected components of magenta (6) pixels (using 8-way adjacency).\n        2.
