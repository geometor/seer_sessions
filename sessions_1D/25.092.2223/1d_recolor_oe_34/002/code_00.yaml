elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1xN grid (represented as a list containing one list) of pixels.
    properties:
      - height: Always 1.
      - width: Variable (e.g., 29 in examples).
      - pixels: A list containing one list of integers (0-9).
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9). Primarily 0 (white) and 3 (green) in input; 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 5 (gray) in output.
      - position: Column index within the single row.
  - element: object
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of green (3) pixels within the single row.
    identifier: A sequence of adjacent pixels with color 3 in the row.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      - parity: Whether the length is odd or even.
      - pixels: The set of pixels constituting the object.
      - location: Start and end column indices of the sequence.
actions:
  - action: extract_row
    description: Get the single row (as a list) from the 1xN input grid.
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of green (3) pixels in the extracted row. Record their start index, end index, and length.
  - action: determine_parity
    description: For each green block, determine if its length is even or odd.
  - action: recolor_block
    description: Create a copy of the input row. For each identified green block, change the color of the corresponding pixels in the copy based on the block's length parity.
    conditions:
      - if: block length is even
        then: change color of block pixels to blue (1).
      - if: block length is odd
        then: change color of block pixels to gray (5).
  - action: preserve_background
    description: Ensure pixels that were originally white (0) remain white (0) in the output row copy. (Achieved by initializing the copy from the input and only modifying green blocks).
  - action: format_output
    description: Wrap the modified row list into another list to create the final 1xN output grid format.
relationships:
  - relationship: input_output_mapping
    description: The output grid has the same dimensions (1xN) as the input grid. Each pixel's final color depends on its original color and context.
    rules:
      - if: input pixel is white (0)
        then: output pixel is white (0).
      - if: input pixel is green (3)
        then: output pixel color is determined by the parity of the length of the contiguous green block it belongs to (blue (1) for even length, gray (5) for odd length).
