            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels are recolored based on the parity of their length (even length -> blue (1), odd length -> gray (5)), while white (0) pixels remain unchanged. The provided examples consistently follow this rule.\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly suggests an issue with how NumPy arrays are being handled, likely due to an unexpected input dimension. The ARC standard typically uses 2D lists (list of lists) even for single rows or columns (e.g., `[[...]]` for a row). The previous code assumed a 1D list input, but when `np.array([[...]])` is called, it creates a 2D array. Subsequent operations expecting a 1D array then fail.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Adapt the code to explicitly handle the standard ARC input format (List[List[int]]).\n2.  Extract the single row from the 2D input list.\n3.  Perform the block identification and transformation logic on this 1D row.\n4.  Return the transformed row wrapped in a list to match the expected 2D output format.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Shape (Assumed) | Output Shape (Assumed) | Green Blocks (Length) | Transformations (Input Color -> Output Color) | Notes |\n| :------ | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---- |\n| train_1 | 1x29                  | 1x29                   | 6, 3, 2, 1, 2         | 3->1 (len 6), 3->5 (len 3), 3->1 (len 2), 3->5 (len 1), 3->1 (len 2), 0->0 | Logic holds |\n| train_2 | 1x29                  | 1x29                   | 6, 3, 1, 1, 2         | 3->1 (len 6), 3->5 (len 3), 3->5 (len 1), 3->5 (len 1), 3->1 (len 2), 0->0 | Logic holds |\n| train_3 | 1x29                  | 1x29                   | 4, 3, 1, 4, 1         | 3->1 (len 4), 3->5 (len 3), 3->5 (len 1), 3->1 (len 4), 3->5 (len 1), 0->0 | Logic holds |\n\nThe core logic remains consistent across all examples. The issue is confirmed to be related to input data structure handling.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
