## Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels are recolored based on the parity of their length (even length -> blue (1), odd length -> gray (5)), while white (0) pixels remain unchanged. The provided examples consistently follow this rule.

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests an issue with how NumPy arrays are being handled, likely due to an unexpected input dimension. The ARC standard typically uses 2D lists (list of lists) even for single rows or columns (e.g., `[[...]]` for a row). The previous code assumed a 1D list input, but when `np.array([[...]])` is called, it creates a 2D array. Subsequent operations expecting a 1D array then fail.

**Strategy:**
1.  Adapt the code to explicitly handle the standard ARC input format (List[List[int]]).
2.  Extract the single row from the 2D input list.
3.  Perform the block identification and transformation logic on this 1D row.
4.  Return the transformed row wrapped in a list to match the expected 2D output format.

| Example | Input Shape (Assumed) | Output Shape (Assumed) | Green Blocks (Length) | Transformations (Input Color -> Output Color) | Notes |
| :------ | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---- |
| train_1 | 1x29                  | 1x29                   | 6, 3, 2, 1, 2         | 3->1 (len 6), 3->5 (len 3), 3->1 (len 2), 3->5 (len 1), 3->1 (len 2), 0->0 | Logic holds |
| train_2 | 1x29                  | 1x29                   | 6, 3, 1, 1, 2         | 3->1 (len 6), 3->5 (len 3), 3->5 (len 1), 3->5 (len 1), 3->1 (len 2), 0->0 | Logic holds |
| train_3 | 1x29                  | 1x29                   | 4, 3, 1, 4, 1         | 3->1 (len 4), 3->5 (len 3), 3->5 (len 1), 3->1 (len 4), 3->5 (len 1), 0->0 | Logic holds |

The core logic remains consistent across all examples. The issue is confirmed to be related to input data structure handling.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1xN grid (represented as a list containing one list) of pixels.
    properties:
      - height: Always 1.
      - width: Variable (e.g., 29 in examples).
      - pixels: A list containing one list of integers (0-9).
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9). Primarily 0 (white) and 3 (green) in input; 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 5 (gray) in output.
      - position: Column index within the single row.
  - element: object
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of green (3) pixels within the single row.
    identifier: A sequence of adjacent pixels with color 3 in the row.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      - parity: Whether the length is odd or even.
      - pixels: The set of pixels constituting the object.
      - location: Start and end column indices of the sequence.
actions:
  - action: extract_row
    description: Get the single row (as a list) from the 1xN input grid.
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of green (3) pixels in the extracted row. Record their start index, end index, and length.
  - action: determine_parity
    description: For each green block, determine if its length is even or odd.
  - action: recolor_block
    description: Create a copy of the input row. For each identified green block, change the color of the corresponding pixels in the copy based on the block's length parity.
    conditions:
      - if: block length is even
        then: change color of block pixels to blue (1).
      - if: block length is odd
        then: change color of block pixels to gray (5).
  - action: preserve_background
    description: Ensure pixels that were originally white (0) remain white (0) in the output row copy. (Achieved by initializing the copy from the input and only modifying green blocks).
  - action: format_output
    description: Wrap the modified row list into another list to create the final 1xN output grid format.
relationships:
  - relationship: input_output_mapping
    description: The output grid has the same dimensions (1xN) as the input grid. Each pixel's final color depends on its original color and context.
    rules:
      - if: input pixel is white (0)
        then: output pixel is white (0).
      - if: input pixel is green (3)
        then: output pixel color is determined by the parity of the length of the contiguous green block it belongs to (blue (1) for even length, gray (5) for odd length).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid (a list containing a single list representing the row).
2.  Extract the single row list from the input grid.
3.  Create a copy of the extracted row to serve as the basis for the output row.
4.  Initialize an index `i` to 0. Iterate through the input row from left to right (index `i` from 0 to length-1).
5.  If the pixel at index `i` is green (3):
    a.  Mark the start index `start = i`.
    b.  Continue advancing `i` as long as the pixel at `i` is green (3) and within the row bounds.
    c.  Mark the end index `end = i - 1`.
    d.  Calculate the length of the green block: `length = end - start + 1`.
    e.  Check the parity of the `length`:
        i.  If `length` is even, set the replacement color to blue (1).
        ii. If `length` is odd, set the replacement color to gray (5).
    f.  In the output row copy, change the color of all pixels from index `start` to `end` (inclusive) to the determined replacement color.
    g.  Resume the main iteration from index `i` (which is already positioned after the processed block).
6.  If the pixel at index `i` is not green (3) (i.e., it's white (0)), simply increment `i` to move to the next pixel. (No change is needed in the output copy as it was initialized from the input).
7.  After iterating through the entire input row, wrap the modified output row copy in a list to create the final 1xN grid format.
8.  Return the final output grid.
