elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1-dimensional array of pixels representing colors.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (0-9) representing a color.
      - position: The index within the grid.
  - element: object
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of green (3) pixels.
    identifier: sequence of adjacent pixels with color 3.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      - parity: Whether the length is odd or even.
      - pixels: The set of pixels constituting the object.
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous horizontal sequences of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
  - action: determine_length
    description: Calculate the number of pixels (length) for each identified green object.
  - action: recolor_object
    description: Change the color of all pixels within an object based on its length parity.
    conditions:
      - if: object length is even
        then: change color of object pixels to blue (1).
      - if: object length is odd
        then: change color of object pixels to gray (5).
relationships:
  - relationship: input_output_mapping
    description: Each pixel in the output grid corresponds to a pixel in the input grid at the same position.
    rules:
      - if: input pixel is white (0)
        then: output pixel is white (0).
      - if: input pixel is green (3)
        then: output pixel color depends on the parity of the length of the contiguous green block it belongs to (blue (1) for even length, gray (5) for odd length).
