These blocks seem to be the primary objects of interest.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** Each contiguous horizontal block of green pixels in the input is transformed into a block of *either* blue (1) or gray (5) pixels of the same length in the output.\n7.  **Pattern Recognition:** Observing the examples reveals a pattern related to the *length* of the contiguous green blocks:\n    *   Blocks with an *even* number of green pixels (length 2, 4, 6 in the examples) are transformed into blue (1) pixels.\n    *   Blocks with an *odd* number of green pixels (length 1, 3 in the examples) are transformed into gray (5) pixels.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
