Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays).
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Input uses white (0) and green (3).
    *   Output uses white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).
3.  **Background Preservation:** White (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) pixels in the same positions in the output.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects the green (3) pixels from the input.
5.  **Object Identification:** The green pixels appear in contiguous horizontal segments or blocks. These blocks seem to be the primary objects of interest.
6.  **Transformation Logic:** Each contiguous horizontal block of green pixels in the input is transformed into a block of *either* blue (1) or gray (5) pixels of the same length in the output.
7.  **Pattern Recognition:** Observing the examples reveals a pattern related to the *length* of the contiguous green blocks:
    *   Blocks with an *even* number of green pixels (length 2, 4, 6 in the examples) are transformed into blue (1) pixels.
    *   Blocks with an *odd* number of green pixels (length 1, 3 in the examples) are transformed into gray (5) pixels.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1-dimensional array of pixels representing colors.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (0-9) representing a color.
      - position: The index within the grid.
  - element: object
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of green (3) pixels.
    identifier: sequence of adjacent pixels with color 3.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      - parity: Whether the length is odd or even.
      - pixels: The set of pixels constituting the object.
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous horizontal sequences of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
  - action: determine_length
    description: Calculate the number of pixels (length) for each identified green object.
  - action: recolor_object
    description: Change the color of all pixels within an object based on its length parity.
    conditions:
      - if: object length is even
        then: change color of object pixels to blue (1).
      - if: object length is odd
        then: change color of object pixels to gray (5).
relationships:
  - relationship: input_output_mapping
    description: Each pixel in the output grid corresponds to a pixel in the input grid at the same position.
    rules:
      - if: input pixel is white (0)
        then: output pixel is white (0).
      - if: input pixel is green (3)
        then: output pixel color depends on the parity of the length of the contiguous green block it belongs to (blue (1) for even length, gray (5) for odd length).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to identify all contiguous horizontal blocks (sequences) of green (3) pixels.
3.  For each identified green block:
    a.  Determine the length (number of pixels) of the block.
    b.  Check if the length is even or odd.
    c.  If the length is even, change the color of all pixels corresponding to this block in the output grid to blue (1).
    d.  If the length is odd, change the color of all pixels corresponding to this block in the output grid to gray (5).
4.  Leave all white (0) pixels unchanged from their input positions.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
