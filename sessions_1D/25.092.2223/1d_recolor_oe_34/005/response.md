```python
"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid based on the properties of contiguous green blocks.
Specifically, it identifies contiguous horizontal blocks of green (3) pixels
in the single row of the input grid by reading the *original* input.
It calculates the length of each identified block.
If a block's length is even, the corresponding pixels in the output grid are
changed to blue (1). If a block's length is odd, the pixels are changed to
gray (5). White (0) pixels remain unchanged from the input.
The output grid retains the 1xN format.
