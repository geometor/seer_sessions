            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: contiguous blocks of green pixels are replaced based on the parity of their length (even -> blue, odd -> gray), while white pixels remain unchanged. However, the provided code execution results indicated that the implementation failed, returning the input grid unmodified.\n\nA review of the previous code suggests a potential bug: the code iterated through the `output_row` while simultaneously modifying it to identify green blocks. This could lead to incorrect block identification if a block was partially modified. A more robust approach is to identify blocks based on the *original* `input_row` and then apply the color changes to the `output_row`.\n\nAssuming this bug correction resolves the execution issue, the fundamental understanding of the task appears sound and consistent across all training examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the analysis and code execution:\n\n*   **Grid Size:** All input and output grids are 1x29.\n*   **Input Colors:** White (0), Green (3).\n*   **Output Colors:** White (0), Blue (1), Gray (5).\n*   **Background:** White (0) pixels in the input consistently remain white (0) in the output at the same positions.\n*   **Green Blocks:** Contiguous horizontal blocks of green (3) pixels are the objects being transformed.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The transformation depends solely on the length of these green blocks.\n    *   **Example 1:** Green block lengths [6, 3, 2, 1, 2]. Output colors [1, 5, 1, 5, 1]. (Even->1, Odd->5)\n    *   **Example 2:** Green block lengths [6, 3, 1, 1, 2]. Output colors [1, 5, 5, 5, 1]. (Even->1, Odd->5)\n    *   **Example 3:** Green block lengths [4, 3, 1, 4, 1]. Output colors [1, 5, 5, 1, 5]. (Even->1, Odd->5)\n*   **Consistency:** The rule (Even length green -> Blue; Odd length green -> Gray) holds true for all blocks across all training examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
