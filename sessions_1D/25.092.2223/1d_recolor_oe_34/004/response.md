## General Assessment

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: contiguous blocks of green pixels are replaced based on the parity of their length (even -> blue, odd -> gray), while white pixels remain unchanged. However, the provided code execution results indicated that the implementation failed, returning the input grid unmodified.

A review of the previous code suggests a potential bug: the code iterated through the `output_row` while simultaneously modifying it to identify green blocks. This could lead to incorrect block identification if a block was partially modified. A more robust approach is to identify blocks based on the *original* `input_row` and then apply the color changes to the `output_row`.

Assuming this bug correction resolves the execution issue, the fundamental understanding of the task appears sound and consistent across all training examples.

## Metrics

Based on the analysis and code execution:

*   **Grid Size:** All input and output grids are 1x29.
*   **Input Colors:** White (0), Green (3).
*   **Output Colors:** White (0), Blue (1), Gray (5).
*   **Background:** White (0) pixels in the input consistently remain white (0) in the output at the same positions.
*   **Green Blocks:** Contiguous horizontal blocks of green (3) pixels are the objects being transformed.
*   **Transformation Rule:** The transformation depends solely on the length of these green blocks.
    *   **Example 1:** Green block lengths [6, 3, 2, 1, 2]. Output colors [1, 5, 1, 5, 1]. (Even->1, Odd->5)
    *   **Example 2:** Green block lengths [6, 3, 1, 1, 2]. Output colors [1, 5, 5, 5, 1]. (Even->1, Odd->5)
    *   **Example 3:** Green block lengths [4, 3, 1, 4, 1]. Output colors [1, 5, 5, 1, 5]. (Even->1, Odd->5)
*   **Consistency:** The rule (Even length green -> Blue; Odd length green -> Gray) holds true for all blocks across all training examples.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 1-dimensional array (single row) of pixels.
    properties:
      - width: The number of pixels in the row (consistently 29 in examples).
      - height: 1
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). In this task, input uses 0 (white), 3 (green); output uses 0 (white), 1 (blue), 5 (gray).
      - position: Index within the 1D grid row.
  - element: object
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
    identifier: A maximal sequence of adjacent pixels where each pixel's color is 3.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      - parity: Derived property, whether the length is 'odd' or 'even'.
      - pixels: The set of pixels (identified by their positions) constituting the object.
      - start_index: The position of the first pixel in the sequence.
      - end_index: The position of the last pixel in the sequence.
actions:
  - action: copy_grid
    description: Create an output grid initially identical to the input grid.
  - action: identify_green_blocks
    description: Scan the input grid row to find all contiguous sequences (blocks) of green (3) pixels. Record their start index, end index, and length. This action should read from the *original* input grid.
  - action: determine_block_parity
    description: For each identified green block, determine if its length is even or odd.
  - action: recolor_block
    description: Modify the pixels in the output grid corresponding to the positions of an identified green block from the input grid. The new color is determined by the block's length parity.
    conditions:
      - if: block length parity is even
        then: change color of corresponding output pixels to blue (1).
      - if: block length parity is odd
        then: change color of corresponding output pixels to gray (5).
relationships:
  - relationship: pixel_mapping
    description: Each pixel in the output grid corresponds to the pixel at the same position in the input grid, potentially with a changed color.
    rules:
      - if: input pixel is white (0)
        then: output pixel is white (0).
      - if: input pixel is green (3)
        then: output pixel color depends on the properties (length parity) of the contiguous green block it belongs to in the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) as a copy of the input grid row.
2.  Iterate through the *input* grid row from left to right to identify contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels. Keep track of the current position (index).
3.  When the start of a green block is found at a given index:
    a.  Determine the full extent of this contiguous green block in the *input* grid row, noting its start index and end index.
    b.  Calculate the length of the block (end index - start index + 1).
    c.  Check if the length is even or odd (parity).
    d.  If the length is even, set the color of all pixels in the *output* grid row from the start index to the end index (inclusive) to blue (1).
    e.  If the length is odd, set the color of all pixels in the *output* grid row from the start index to the end index (inclusive) to gray (5).
    f.  Advance the current position (index) for the iteration to the position immediately *after* the identified block (end index + 1) to avoid re-processing pixels within the block.
4.  If the pixel at the current position in the *input* grid row is not green (i.e., it's white), leave the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid row unchanged (it will retain its copied value) and advance the current position (index) by one.
5.  Continue iterating until the end of the input grid row is reached.
6.  Return the modified output grid row (formatted as required, typically within a list).
