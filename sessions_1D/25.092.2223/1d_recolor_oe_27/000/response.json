There can be one or more such blue segments in an input grid, located on different rows.\n\nThe transformation rule involves changing the color of the blue pixels based on the properties of the horizontal segment they belong to. Specifically, the length of the contiguous horizontal segment of blue pixels determines the output color.\n\nObserving the examples:\n-   In example 1, a blue segment of length 6 becomes azure (8), and a blue segment of length 5 becomes magenta (6).\n-   In example 2, a blue segment of length 5 becomes magenta (6), and a blue segment of length 4 becomes azure (8).\n-   In example 3, a blue segment of length 5 becomes magenta (6), and two separate blue segments of length 2 both become azure (8).\n\nThis pattern suggests that blue segments with an even length are transformed into azure (8), while blue segments with an odd length are transformed into magenta (6). The white background pixels remain unchanged. The transformation operates independently on each distinct horizontal blue segment.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
