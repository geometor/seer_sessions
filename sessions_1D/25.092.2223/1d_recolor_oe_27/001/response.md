"""
Transforms an input grid by identifying horizontal segments of blue (1) pixels.
If a blue segment has an even length, its pixels are changed to azure (8) in the output grid.
If a blue segment has an odd length, its pixels are changed to magenta (6) in the output grid.
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
