"""
Transforms an input grid (represented as a 1D list) by identifying contiguous 
horizontal segments of orange pixels (7). If a segment has a length of exactly 6, 
it is replaced with red pixels (2) in the output. Otherwise (if the segment length
is not 6), it is replaced with green pixels (3). White pixels (0) remain unchanged.
