task_description: Replace contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels in a single-row grid based on their length.
input_format: 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N), where N is the number of columns.
output_format: 2D NumPy array with the same shape as the input.
elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0), orange (7), red (2), green (3)
      position: (row_index, column_index) - row_index is always 0.
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color within the single row.
    properties:
      color: orange (7) in input; red (2) or green (3) in output
      length: integer value representing the number of pixels (columns) in the segment
      start_column: integer index of the first pixel in the segment
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      shape: (1, N)
      pixels: Contains white (0) and orange (7) pixels.
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      shape: (1, N)
      pixels: Contains white (0), red (2), and green (3) pixels.
  - id: orange_segment
    type: segment
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      location: Defined by start_column and length within the input_grid's single row.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: orange_segment in input_grid
    to: segment of the same length and position in output_grid
    condition: >
      The color of the output segment is determined by the length of the input orange_segment.
actions:
  - name: find_orange_segments
    input: input_grid (1xN NumPy array)
    output: list of orange_segments (each with start_column and length)
  - name: determine_output_color
    input: length of an orange_segment
    output: red (2) or green (3)
    rule: if length is 6, output red (2); otherwise, output green (3).
  - name: generate_output_grid
    input: input_grid, list of orange_segments
    output: output_grid
    process: >
      Create a copy of the input_grid. For each orange_segment, determine its output color
      using 'determine_output_color' based on its length. Replace the pixels corresponding
      to the segment's location in the copied grid with the determined output color.
constants:
  - name: target_input_color
    value: orange (7)
  - name: special_length
    value: 6
  - name: color_for_special_length
    value: red (2)
  - name: color_for_other_length
    value: green (3)
  - name: background_color
    value: white (0) # Remains unchanged
