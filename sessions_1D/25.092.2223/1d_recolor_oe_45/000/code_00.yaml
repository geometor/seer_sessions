task_description: Replace contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels based on their length.
elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0), orange (7), red (2), green (3)
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      color: orange (7) in input; red (2) or green (3) in output
      length: integer value representing the number of pixels in the segment
objects:
  - id: input_segment
    type: segment
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
  - id: output_segment
    type: segment
    properties:
      color: red (2) or green (3)
relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input_segment (orange)
    to: output_segment (red or green)
    condition: Based on the length of the input_segment.
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input grid
    output: list of orange segments with their locations and lengths
  - name: determine_output_color
    input: length of an orange segment
    output: red (2) or green (3)
    rule: if length is 6, output red (2); otherwise, output green (3).
  - name: replace_segment
    input: input grid, segment location, segment length, new color
    output: modified grid with the segment replaced
constants:
  - name: target_color
    value: orange (7)
  - name: special_length
    value: 6
  - name: color_for_special_length
    value: red (2)
  - name: color_for_other_length
    value: green (3)
