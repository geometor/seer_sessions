Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 1D arrays (or potentially flattened 1xN grids).
*   The inputs contain only white (0) and orange (7) pixels.
*   The outputs contain white (0), red (2), and green (3) pixels.
*   White pixels in the input remain white pixels in the output, maintaining their positions.
*   Orange pixels in the input are replaced by either red or green pixels in the output.
*   The transformation seems to operate on contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels.
*   Looking across the examples:
    *   In `train_1`, an orange segment of length 6 becomes red, and an orange segment of length 5 becomes green.
    *   In `train_2`, an orange segment of length 3 becomes green, and an orange segment of length 6 becomes red.
    *   In `train_3`, an orange segment of length 6 becomes red, and two separate orange segments of length 3 both become green.
*   The determining factor for whether an orange segment becomes red (2) or green (3) appears to be its length. Specifically, segments of length 6 become red, while segments of other lengths (3 and 5 in the examples) become green.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same values as the input.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to identify all contiguous horizontal segments composed entirely of orange (7) pixels. Record the starting position and length of each identified orange segment.
3.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Check the length of the segment.
    b.  If the length of the segment is exactly 6, change the color of all pixels within that segment in the *output* grid to red (2).
    c.  If the length of the segment is *not* 6, change the color of all pixels within that segment in the *output* grid to green (3).
4.  Leave all pixels that were not part of an orange segment (i.e., white pixels) unchanged in the output grid.
5.  Return the final output grid.
