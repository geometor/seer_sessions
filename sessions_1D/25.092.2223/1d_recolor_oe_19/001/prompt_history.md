## Perception

The input and output are both 1-dimensional arrays (or grids of height 1).
The input contains only white (0) and maroon (9) pixels.
The output contains white (0), blue (1), and magenta (6) pixels.
The transformation preserves the positions of the white pixels.
The maroon pixels in the input are replaced by either blue or magenta pixels in the output.
The transformation appears to operate on contiguous segments of maroon pixels. The first segment of maroon pixels encountered (reading from left to right) is transformed into blue pixels. All subsequent segments of maroon pixels are transformed into magenta pixels.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output array.
2.  Initialize a flag or counter to track if the first segment of maroon (9) pixels has been processed (e.g., `first_segment_found = false`).
3.  Iterate through the input array from left to right.
4.  If the current pixel is maroon (9) and is the start of a new segment (either the first pixel or the previous pixel was not maroon):
    a.  Check the `first_segment_found` flag.
    b.  If `first_segment_found` is `false`:
        i.  Set `first_segment_found` to `true`.
        ii. The target color for this segment is blue (1).
    c.  If `first_segment_found` is `true`:
        i.  The target color for this segment is magenta (6).
    d.  Iterate through the current contiguous segment of maroon pixels, changing each corresponding pixel in the output array to the determined target color (blue or magenta). Advance the main iteration index past this segment.
5.  If the current pixel is white (0), leave the corresponding pixel in the output array as white (0) and continue to the next pixel.
6.  Return the modified output array.
