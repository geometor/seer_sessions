These are the objects being transformed.\n4.  **Transformation:** Each azure block in the input is replaced entirely by a block of a single *different* color in the output. The surrounding white pixels are unaffected.\n5.  **Color Mapping Rule:** The color used for replacement depends on the *length* (number of pixels) of the original azure block.\n    *   Observing the examples:\n        *   `train_1`: Length 5 -> red (2), Length 4 -> maroon (9), Length 4 -> maroon (9)\n        *   `train_2`: Length 2 -> maroon (9), Length 3 -> red (2), Length 4 -> maroon (9), Length 3 -> red (2)\n        *   `train_3`: Length 3 -> red (2), Length 6 -> maroon (9), Length 5 -> red (2)\n    *   Synthesizing: Blocks with an *odd* length (3, 5) are replaced with red (2). Blocks with an *even* length (2, 4, 6) are replaced with maroon (9).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
