*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves transforming a 1D grid (represented as a single row).
    *   The input grid contains only white (0) and yellow (4) pixels.
    *   The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
    *   White pixels in the input remain white in the output in the same positions.
    *   Yellow pixels in the input are changed to either azure (8) or maroon (9) in the output.
    *   The transformation rule appears to depend on contiguous blocks of yellow pixels.
    *   Analyzing the examples, it seems that the length of a contiguous horizontal block of yellow pixels determines the output color.
    *   In `train_1`, yellow blocks of length 2 become maroon (9), while blocks of length 1 and 5 become azure (8).
    *   In `train_2`, yellow blocks of length 2 and 4 become maroon (9), while blocks of length 1 and 5 become azure (8).
    *   In `train_3`, yellow blocks of length 6 become maroon (9), while blocks of length 1, 3, and 5 become azure (8).
    *   The pattern emerges: If a contiguous block of yellow pixels has an *even* length (2, 4, 6, ...), all pixels in that block are changed to maroon (9). If the block has an *odd* length (1, 3, 5, ...), all pixels in that block are changed to azure (8).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally to identify contiguous blocks of yellow (4) pixels.
    3.  For each identified block of yellow pixels:
        a.  Calculate the length (number of pixels) of the block.
        b.  Check if the length is even or odd.
        c.  If the length is even, change all pixels corresponding to this block in the output grid to maroon (9).
        d.  If the length is odd, change all pixels corresponding to this block in the output grid to azure (8).
    4.  Leave all white (0) pixels unchanged.
    5.  Return the modified output grid.
