Although described as grids, they are presented as flattened lists, and the transformation seems to operate on this linear sequence.\n    *   The input consists of white (0) and blue (1) pixels.\n    *   The output consists of white (0), gray (5), and azure (8) pixels.\n    *   White pixels (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output at the same position.\n    *   Blue pixels (1) in the input change color in the output depending on their position (index) in the sequence.\n    *   There's a consistent pattern: blue pixels within a specific range of indices (2 through 7) become azure (8), while blue pixels outside this range become gray (5).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n\n"
