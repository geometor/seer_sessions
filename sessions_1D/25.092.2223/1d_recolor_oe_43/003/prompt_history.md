Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples.

*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of 26 pixels each. Although described as grids, they are presented as flattened lists, and the transformation seems to operate on this linear sequence.
    *   The input consists of white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
    *   The output consists of white (0), gray (5), and azure (8) pixels.
    *   White pixels (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output at the same position.
    *   Blue pixels (1) in the input change color in the output depending on their position (index) in the sequence.
    *   There's a consistent pattern: blue pixels within a specific range of indices (2 through 7) become azure (8), while blue pixels outside this range become gray (5).

*   **YAML Facts:**

  - type: conditional_color_mapping
    input_color: blue (1)
    output_color: gray (5)
    condition: pixel index is less than 2 or greater than 7
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence (26 pixels).
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from index 0 to 25. Let the current index be `i` and the pixel value at that index be `v`.
3.  Check the value `v`:
    *   If `v` is 0 (white), set the pixel at index `i` in the output sequence to 0 (white).
    *   If `v` is 1 (blue), check the index `i`:
        *   If `i` is greater than or equal to 2 AND `i` is less than or equal to 7, set the pixel at index `i` in the output sequence to 8 (azure).
        *   Otherwise (if `i < 2` or `i > 7`), set the pixel at index `i` in the output sequence to 5 (gray).
4.  Return the completed output sequence.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis incorrectly assumed the input and output were 1D sequences based on their flattened representation. The `ValueError` clearly indicates that the `input_grid` is actually a multi-dimensional NumPy array, which is standard for ARC tasks. The transformation logic needs to be revisited considering the 2D grid structure. The error occurs because standard Python boolean checks (`if pixel_value == 0:`) don't work element-wise on NumPy arrays in the way the previous code attempted without proper indexing or looping.

*   **Strategy for Resolution:**
    1.  Determine the correct 2D shape of the input/output grids.
    2.  Re-examine the relationship between input and output pixels based on their row and column indices within the 2D grid.
    3.  Update the transformation rule to operate on the 2D grid structure.
    4.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program accordingly.

*   **Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's confirm the grid shapes and re-evaluate the transformation rule using the first example.

Shape confirmed as 2x13 for Example 1.
Input Grid 1 (2x13):
 [[0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1]
 [1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0]]
Output Grid 1 (2x13):
 [[0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 5 5]
 [5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 0]]
Hypothesized rule holds for Example 1 (2x13): False
Shape confirmed as 2x13 for Examples 2 and 3.

```
**Revised Analysis:**

The code execution confirmed the shape is 2x13. However, the initial hypothesis (`blue(1)` in row 0 -> `azure(8)`, `blue(1)` in row 1 -> `gray(5)`) failed for Example 1 when checked programmatically.

Let's re-examine Example 1 (2x13):
Input:

```
[[0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1]
 [1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0]]
```

Output:

```
[[0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 5 5]  <- Mismatch here: Input (0,11)=1, Output (0,11)=5. Input(0,12)=1, Output(0,12)=5
 [5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 0]]
```

The hypothesis failed because the code checking the rule assumed *all* blue pixels in row 0 become azure (8). But looking closely at Example 1, the last two blue pixels `(0, 11)` and `(0, 12)` in the *first row* actually become gray (5), not azure (8).

Let's reconsider the original linear index idea, but applied correctly to the 2D array access. The linear indices 2 through 7 correspond to `(0, 2)` through `(0, 7)` in the 2x13 grid.

Hypothesis 2:
- White (0) stays white (0).
- Blue (1) at coordinates `(r, c)` becomes azure (8) if `r == 0` AND `2 <= c <= 7`.
- Blue (1) at coordinates `(r, c)` becomes gray (5) otherwise (i.e., if `r != 0` or `c < 2` or `c > 7`).

Let's test this mentally on Example 1:
- Input `(0, 2)` to `(0, 7)` are blue (1). Output `(0, 2)` to `(0, 7)` are azure (8). -> Matches.
- Input `(0, 11)` and `(0, 12)` are blue (1). Here `r=0` but `c > 7`. Output `(0, 11)` and `(0, 12)` are gray (5). -> Matches.
- Input `(1, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(1, 5)`, `(1, 6)`, `(1, 9)`, `(1, 10)`, `(1, 11)` are blue (1). Here `r=1`. Output at these positions is gray (5). -> Matches.
- All white (0) inputs match white (0) outputs. -> Matches.

This revised hypothesis seems correct for Example 1. Let's quickly check Example 2:
Input 2:

```
[[0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0]
 [1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]]
```

Output 2:

```
[[0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 5 5 5 0]  <- Blue (1) at (0,9), (0,10), (0,11) -> Gray (5). Matches (c > 7).
 [5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0]]  <- Blue (1) at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8) -> Gray (5). Matches (r=1).
```

This hypothesis holds for Example 2 as well.

Check Example 3:
Input 3:

```
[[0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1]
 [1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1]]
```

Output 3:

```
[[0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 5 5 5 5]  <- Blue (1) at (0,2) to (0,5) -> Azure (8). Matches (r=0, 2<=c<=7). Blue (1) at (0,9) to (0,12) -> Gray (5). Matches (c > 7).
 [5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5]]  <- Blue (1) at (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,10), (1,11), (1,12) -> Gray (5). Matches (r=1).
```

The hypothesis holds for Example 3.

*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a 2x13 grid of pixels.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (2x13), initialized perhaps with zeros.
3.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to 1) and column index `c` (from 0 to 12).
4.  For each cell at `(r, c)`, get the input pixel value `v`.
5.  Check the input pixel value `v`:
    *   If `v` is 0 (white), set the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to 0 (white).
    *   If `v` is 1 (blue), apply positional checks:
        *   If the row index `r` is 0 AND the column index `c` is greater than or equal to 2 AND `c` is less than or equal to 7, set the output cell `(r, c)` to 8 (azure).
        *   Otherwise (if `r` is not 0 OR `c` is less than 2 OR `c` is greater than 7), set the output cell `(r, c)` to 5 (gray).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
