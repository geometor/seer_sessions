Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples.

*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of 26 pixels each. Although described as grids, they are presented as flattened lists, and the transformation seems to operate on this linear sequence.
    *   The input consists of white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
    *   The output consists of white (0), gray (5), and azure (8) pixels.
    *   White pixels (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output at the same position.
    *   Blue pixels (1) in the input change color in the output depending on their position (index) in the sequence.
    *   There's a consistent pattern: blue pixels within a specific range of indices (2 through 7) become azure (8), while blue pixels outside this range become gray (5).

*   **YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_output_shape:
  dimensionality: 1 # Treated as a 1D sequence
  size: 26
input_colors:
  - white (0)
  - blue (1)
output_colors:
  - white (0)
  - gray (5)
  - azure (8)
transformations:
  - type: conditional_color_mapping
    input_color: white (0)
    output_color: white (0)
    condition: always
  - type: conditional_color_mapping
    input_color: blue (1)
    output_color: azure (8)
    condition: pixel index is between 2 and 7 (inclusive)
  - type: conditional_color_mapping
    input_color: blue (1)
    output_color: gray (5)
    condition: pixel index is less than 2 or greater than 7
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence (26 pixels).
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from index 0 to 25. Let the current index be `i` and the pixel value at that index be `v`.
3.  Check the value `v`:
    *   If `v` is 0 (white), set the pixel at index `i` in the output sequence to 0 (white).
    *   If `v` is 1 (blue), check the index `i`:
        *   If `i` is greater than or equal to 2 AND `i` is less than or equal to 7, set the pixel at index `i` in the output sequence to 8 (azure).
        *   Otherwise (if `i < 2` or `i > 7`), set the pixel at index `i` in the output sequence to 5 (gray).
4.  Return the completed output sequence.
```python
"""
Transforms a 1D sequence of pixels based on value and position.

Iterates through the input sequence.
If a pixel is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output.
If a pixel is blue (1):
  - If its index is between 2 and 7 (inclusive), it becomes azure (8) in the output.
  - Otherwise (index < 2 or index > 7), it becomes gray (5) in the output.
