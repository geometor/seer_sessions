            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided error message, \"Input must be a non-empty list of lists,\" indicates that the `transform` function's input validation failed. The function expects the input grid to be represented as a list containing at least one inner list (e.g., `[[0, 0, 7, ...]]` for a single row), which aligns with the general ARC format of representing grids as 2D arrays (or lists of lists). However, the error suggests the function might have received input in a different format, potentially a flat list (e.g., `[0, 0, 7, ...]`) or an empty list/None, during the test execution.\n\nThe core transformation logic derived previously (identifying contiguous orange segments and changing their color based on length parity) appears consistent across all three training examples. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  Reiterate the assumed input format (a list containing a single list representing the 1xN grid).\n2.  Maintain the core transformation logic based on segment length parity.\n3.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts to be precise about the 1D nature and the transformation rule. The implementation details of input validation robustness will be handled by the coder phase, but the *expected* input format needs to be clear.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the provided examples:\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]` (Length: 15)\n    *   Orange Segments: (index 2, length 2), (index 7, length 3), (index 12, length 3)\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`\n    *   Logic Check: Length 2 (even) -> Green (3). Length 3 (odd) -> Red (2). Length 3 (odd) -> Red (2). Matches expected output.\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length: 15)\n    *   Orange Segments: (index 2, length 5), (index 9, length 2)\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Logic Check: Length 5 (odd) -> Red (2). Length 2 (even) -> Green (3). Matches expected output.\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]` (Length: 15)\n    *   Orange Segments: (index 1, length 5), (index 7, length 6)\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]`\n    *   Logic Check: Length 5 (odd) -> Red (2). Length 6 (even) -> Green (3). Matches expected output.\n\nThe transformation logic holds for all training examples. The failure reported is due to input format validation, not the core algorithm.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
