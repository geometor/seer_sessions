task_description: Transforms contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels based on their length parity within a single-row grid.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1xN grid)
input_format_assumption: List containing a single list (e.g., [[0, 7, 7, 0,...]])
color_palette_input: [black(0), orange(7)]
color_palette_output: [black(0), red(2), green(3)]
background_color: black(0)
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: orange(7)
    properties:
      - contiguity: horizontal
      - length: variable
transformations:
  - description: Process contiguous orange segments.
    object_type: segment
    input_color: orange(7)
    output_determination: Based on segment length.
    rules:
      - condition: segment length is even
        output_color: green(3)
        applies_to: all pixels within the segment
      - condition: segment length is odd
        output_color: red(2)
        applies_to: all pixels within the segment
  - description: Preserve background pixels.
    object_type: pixel
    input_color: black(0)
    output_determination: No change.
    output_color: black(0)
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: True # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
relationships:
  - type: pixel_membership
    description: Pixels belong to orange segments or the black background.
  - type: transformation_dependency
    description: The output color of an orange pixel depends on the length of the contiguous orange segment it belongs to.
