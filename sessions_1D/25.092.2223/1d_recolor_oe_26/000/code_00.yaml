task_description: Transform orange segments based on their length parity.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or single row)
color_palette_input: [black(0), orange(7)]
color_palette_output: [black(0), red(2), green(3)]
background_color: black(0)
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: orange(7)
    properties:
      - contiguity: horizontal
      - length: variable
transformations:
  - object_type: segment
    input_color: orange(7)
    output_color_rule:
      condition: length is even
      output: green(3)
  - object_type: segment
    input_color: orange(7)
    output_color_rule:
      condition: length is odd
      output: red(2)
  - object_type: pixel
    input_color: black(0)
    output_color_rule:
      condition: always
      output: black(0) # remains unchanged
relationships:
  - type: pixel_membership
    description: Pixels belong to segments or the background.
  - type: transformation_dependency
    description: The output color of an orange pixel depends on the length of the contiguous orange segment it belongs to.
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: True # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
