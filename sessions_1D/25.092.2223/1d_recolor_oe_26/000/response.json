The output grids contain black (0), green (3), and red (2) pixels.\n3.  **Background:** Black pixels (0) seem to act as a background or separator and remain unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Objects:** The core elements undergoing transformation are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of orange (7) pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The orange pixels change color based on the properties of the block they belong to. Comparing the input and output blocks:\n    *   In `train_1`: A block of two 7s becomes two 3s. Two blocks of three 7s become three 2s each.\n    *   In `train_2`: A block of five 7s becomes five 2s. A block of two 7s becomes two 3s.\n    *   In `train_3`: A block of five 7s becomes five 2s. A block of six 7s becomes six 3s.\n6.  **Pattern Discovery:** The transformation rule appears related to the *length* of the contiguous orange blocks.\n    *   Blocks with an *even* number of orange pixels (length 2, length 6) are transformed into blocks of green (3) pixels of the same length.\n    *   Blocks with an *odd* number of orange pixels (length 3, length 5) are transformed into blocks of red (2) pixels of the same length.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
