Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The data appears to represent 1-dimensional grids or single rows of pixels.
2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain black (0) and orange (7) pixels. The output grids contain black (0), green (3), and red (2) pixels.
3.  **Background:** Black pixels (0) seem to act as a background or separator and remain unchanged in the output.
4.  **Objects:** The core elements undergoing transformation are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of orange (7) pixels.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The orange pixels change color based on the properties of the block they belong to. Comparing the input and output blocks:
    *   In `train_1`: A block of two 7s becomes two 3s. Two blocks of three 7s become three 2s each.
    *   In `train_2`: A block of five 7s becomes five 2s. A block of two 7s becomes two 3s.
    *   In `train_3`: A block of five 7s becomes five 2s. A block of six 7s becomes six 3s.
6.  **Pattern Discovery:** The transformation rule appears related to the *length* of the contiguous orange blocks.
    *   Blocks with an *even* number of orange pixels (length 2, length 6) are transformed into blocks of green (3) pixels of the same length.
    *   Blocks with an *odd* number of orange pixels (length 3, length 5) are transformed into blocks of red (2) pixels of the same length.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of orange (7) pixels. Keep track of the start index and length of each segment. Black (0) pixels act as separators between segments.
3.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Determine the length of the segment.
    b.  Check if the length is even or odd.
    c.  If the length is even, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with green (3) pixels.
    d.  If the length is odd, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with red (2) pixels.
4.  For any pixel in the input grid that is black (0), copy the black (0) pixel to the corresponding position in the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
