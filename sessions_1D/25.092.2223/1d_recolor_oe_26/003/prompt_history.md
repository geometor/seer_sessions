Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The data appears to represent 1-dimensional grids or single rows of pixels.
2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain black (0) and orange (7) pixels. The output grids contain black (0), green (3), and red (2) pixels.
3.  **Background:** Black pixels (0) seem to act as a background or separator and remain unchanged in the output.
4.  **Objects:** The core elements undergoing transformation are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of orange (7) pixels.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The orange pixels change color based on the properties of the block they belong to. Comparing the input and output blocks:
    *   In `train_1`: A block of two 7s becomes two 3s. Two blocks of three 7s become three 2s each.
    *   In `train_2`: A block of five 7s becomes five 2s. A block of two 7s becomes two 3s.
    *   In `train_3`: A block of five 7s becomes five 2s. A block of six 7s becomes six 3s.
6.  **Pattern Discovery:** The transformation rule appears related to the *length* of the contiguous orange blocks.
    *   Blocks with an *even* number of orange pixels (length 2, length 6) are transformed into blocks of green (3) pixels of the same length.
    *   Blocks with an *odd* number of orange pixels (length 3, length 5) are transformed into blocks of red (2) pixels of the same length.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of orange (7) pixels. Keep track of the start index and length of each segment. Black (0) pixels act as separators between segments.
3.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Determine the length of the segment.
    b.  Check if the length is even or odd.
    c.  If the length is even, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with green (3) pixels.
    d.  If the length is odd, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with red (2) pixels.
4.  For any pixel in the input grid that is black (0), copy the black (0) pixel to the corresponding position in the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

## Example 2:
Error: Input must be a non-empty list of lists.

## Example 3:
Error: Input must be a non-empty list of lists.
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The provided error message, "Input must be a non-empty list of lists," indicates that the `transform` function's input validation failed. The function expects the input grid to be represented as a list containing at least one inner list (e.g., `[[0, 0, 7, ...]]` for a single row), which aligns with the general ARC format of representing grids as 2D arrays (or lists of lists). However, the error suggests the function might have received input in a different format, potentially a flat list (e.g., `[0, 0, 7, ...]`) or an empty list/None, during the test execution.

The core transformation logic derived previously (identifying contiguous orange segments and changing their color based on length parity) appears consistent across all three training examples. The strategy is to:

1.  Reiterate the assumed input format (a list containing a single list representing the 1xN grid).
2.  Maintain the core transformation logic based on segment length parity.
3.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts to be precise about the 1D nature and the transformation rule. The implementation details of input validation robustness will be handled by the coder phase, but the *expected* input format needs to be clear.

**Metrics:**

Based on the provided examples:

*   **train_1:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]` (Length: 15)
    *   Orange Segments: (index 2, length 2), (index 7, length 3), (index 12, length 3)
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`
    *   Logic Check: Length 2 (even) -> Green (3). Length 3 (odd) -> Red (2). Length 3 (odd) -> Red (2). Matches expected output.
*   **train_2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length: 15)
    *   Orange Segments: (index 2, length 5), (index 9, length 2)
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Logic Check: Length 5 (odd) -> Red (2). Length 2 (even) -> Green (3). Matches expected output.
*   **train_3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]` (Length: 15)
    *   Orange Segments: (index 1, length 5), (index 7, length 6)
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]`
    *   Logic Check: Length 5 (odd) -> Red (2). Length 6 (even) -> Green (3). Matches expected output.

The transformation logic holds for all training examples. The failure reported is due to input format validation, not the core algorithm.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a single-row grid, represented as a list containing one inner list (e.g., `[[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]`).
2.  Initialize an output row with the same values as the input row.
3.  Iterate through the input row from left to right to identify contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of orange (7) pixels. For each segment, record its starting position and its length. Black (0) pixels mark the boundaries between segments or are part of the background.
4.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Determine the length of the segment.
    b.  Check if the length is even or odd.
    c.  If the length is even, replace all pixels within that segment's range in the *output* row with green (3).
    d.  If the length is odd, replace all pixels within that segment's range in the *output* row with red (2).
5.  Pixels that were initially black (0) remain unchanged in the output row (as they were copied during initialization and not modified by the segment processing).
6.  Return the modified output row, wrapped in a list to maintain the single-row grid format (e.g., `[[output_pixel1, output_pixel2, ...]]`).
