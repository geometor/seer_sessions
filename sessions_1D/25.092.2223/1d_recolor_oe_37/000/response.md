*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid containing white (0) pixels and maroon (9) pixels into an output grid. The maroon pixels form distinct contiguous blocks or objects. In the output grid, these maroon objects are replaced by objects of the same shape but different colors: either yellow (4) or red (2). The white background pixels remain unchanged. The key transformation seems to depend on a property of each individual maroon object. By analyzing the examples, it appears the determining property is the size (number of pixels) of each maroon object. Objects with an even number of pixels are colored red (2) in the output, while objects with an odd number of pixels are colored yellow (4).

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - role: background
        color: white (0)
        static: true
      - role: object
        color: maroon (9)
        identified_by: contiguity
        properties:
          - size: count of pixels in the contiguous block
    actions:
      - name: identify_maroon_objects
        input: input_grid
        output: list of maroon objects
      - name: calculate_object_size
        input: maroon_object
        output: size (integer)
      - name: determine_replacement_color
        input: object_size
        logic: |
          if size is even:
            replacement_color = red (2)
          else:
            replacement_color = yellow (4)
        output: replacement_color
      - name: replace_object_color
        input: input_grid, maroon_object, replacement_color
        output: modified_output_grid
        effect: Replaces all pixels of the maroon_object in the grid with the replacement_color.
    relationships:
      - type: conditional_replacement
        source: maroon_object
        target: output_object_color
        condition: parity of maroon_object size
        details: Even size maps to red (2), Odd size maps to yellow (4).
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions: remain unchanged between input and output
      - background_pixels: remain unchanged
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Find all distinct contiguous groups (objects) of maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
    3.  For each found maroon object:
        a.  Count the total number of pixels constituting the object (determine its size).
        b.  Check if the size is an even or odd number.
        c.  If the size is even, change the color of all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid to red (2).
        d.  If the size is odd, change the color of all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid to yellow (4).
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
