The maroon pixels form distinct contiguous blocks or objects. In the output grid, these maroon objects are replaced by objects of the same shape but different colors: either yellow (4) or red (2). The white background pixels remain unchanged. The key transformation seems to depend on a property of each individual maroon object. By analyzing the examples, it appears the determining property is the size (number of pixels) of each maroon object. Objects with an even number of pixels are colored red (2) in the output, while objects with an odd number of pixels are colored yellow (4).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
