Okay, let's analyze the provided task example.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output are grids of pixels. Based on the number of elements (24), the grid could be 4x6 or 6x4. Let's assume 4x6 for visualization:
    Input 4x6:
    
```
    0 0 0 3 3 3
    3 3 3 0 0 3
    3 3 3 3 3 0
    0 0 3 3 3 0
    ```

    Output 4x6:
    
```
    0 0 0 5 5 5
    5 5 5 0 0 8
    8 8 8 8 8 0
    0 0 8 8 8 0
    ```

2.  **Color Preservation**: The white pixels (color 0) in the input grid remain white (color 0) in the output grid in the exact same positions.
3.  **Color Transformation**: The green pixels (color 3) in the input grid are transformed into either gray (color 5) or azure (color 8) in the output grid.
4.  **Positional Dependency**: The transformation rule for the green pixels seems to depend on their vertical position (row index).
    *   Green pixels in the top half of the grid (rows 0 and 1 in the 4x6 example) become gray (5).
    *   Green pixels in the bottom half of the grid (rows 2 and 3 in the 4x6 example) become azure (8).
5.  **Generalization**: The grid is effectively split horizontally at its midpoint (Height / 2). All green pixels above this midpoint change to gray, and all green pixels at or below this midpoint change to azure. This holds true whether we interpret the grid as 4x6 or 6x4.

**Facts**


```yaml
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_input: unknown (e.g., 4x6 or 6x4 for this example)
  - dimensions_output: same_as_input
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - foreground_color_input: 3 # green
objects:
  - type: background_pixels
    color: 0
    location: preserved between input and output
  - type: foreground_pixels
    color_input: 3
    location: various positions within the grid
actions:
  - action: map_colors_based_on_position
    target: foreground_pixels (color 3)
    condition: location relative to horizontal midpoint of the grid
    outputs:
      - color_output: 5 # gray, for pixels in the top half
      - color_output: 8 # azure, for pixels in the bottom half

      description: The transformation of a green pixel depends on its row index relative to the grid's height.
      rule: |
        If row_index < grid_height / 2, map color 3 to 5.
        If row_index >= grid_height / 2, map color 3 to 8.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid and determine its height (H) and width (W).
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions (H x W).
3.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to W-1).
4.  For each cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Get the color `input_color` from the input grid at `(r, c)`.
    b.  If `input_color` is white (0), set the output grid cell `(r, c)` to white (0).
    c.  If `input_color` is green (3):
        i.  Check if the row index `r` is less than half the grid height (`r < H / 2`).
        ii. If true (the cell is in the top half), set the output grid cell `(r, c)` to gray (5).
        iii.If false (the cell is in the bottom half, including the middle row if H is odd), set the output grid cell `(r, c)` to azure (8).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
