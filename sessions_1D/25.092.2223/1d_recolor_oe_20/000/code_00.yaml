task_description: Recolor contiguous objects based on their size parity.
grid_properties:
  background_color: 0 # white
  input_object_color: 9 # maroon
  output_colors:
    - 3 # green (for even-sized objects)
    - 6 # magenta (for odd-sized objects)
transformation:
  scope: Contiguous objects of the input_object_color (9).
  steps:
    - Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of the input_object_color (9).
    - For each identified object:
      - Calculate its size (number of pixels).
      - Check the parity (even or odd) of the size.
      - If the size is even, change the color of all pixels in that object to green (3).
      - If the size is odd, change the color of all pixels in that object to magenta (6).
  unchanged_elements: Pixels with the background_color (0) remain unchanged.
