The original maroon color is replaced entirely by either green or magenta.\n6.  **Rule Discovery:** Observing the examples suggests the color change depends on a property of each maroon object. Specifically, the *size* (number of pixels) of each contiguous maroon object determines its output color. Objects with an even number of pixels become green (3), and objects with an odd number of pixels become magenta (6).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
