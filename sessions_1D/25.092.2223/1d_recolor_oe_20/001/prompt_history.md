Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   The input grids contain only white (0) and maroon (9) pixels.
    *   The output grids contain white (0), green (3), and magenta (6) pixels.
3.  **Background:** The white (0) pixels act as a static background, remaining unchanged in the output.
4.  **Objects:** The maroon (9) pixels in the input form distinct contiguous objects (groups of adjacent pixels of the same color, considering side-by-side adjacency).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the maroon objects. The original maroon color is replaced entirely by either green or magenta.
6.  **Rule Discovery:** Observing the examples suggests the color change depends on a property of each maroon object. Specifically, the *size* (number of pixels) of each contiguous maroon object determines its output color. Objects with an even number of pixels become green (3), and objects with an odd number of pixels become magenta (6).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous objects based on their size parity.
grid_properties:
  background_color: 0 # white
  input_object_color: 9 # maroon
  output_colors:
    - 3 # green (for even-sized objects)
    - 6 # magenta (for odd-sized objects)
transformation:
  scope: Contiguous objects of the input_object_color (9).
  steps:
    - Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of the input_object_color (9).
    - For each identified object:
      - Calculate its size (number of pixels).
      - Check the parity (even or odd) of the size.
      - If the size is even, change the color of all pixels in that object to green (3).
      - If the size is odd, change the color of all pixels in that object to magenta (6).
  unchanged_elements: Pixels with the background_color (0) remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all connected components (objects) formed by pixels of color maroon (9) in the input grid. Use 4-connectivity (only horizontal and vertical neighbors count).
3.  For each identified maroon object:
    a.  Count the number of pixels constituting the object (determine its size).
    b.  Check if the size is even or odd.
    c.  If the size is even, replace the color of all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid with green (3).
    d.  If the size is odd, replace the color of all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid with magenta (6).
4.  Return the modified output grid. Pixels that were originally white (0) remain white (0).
