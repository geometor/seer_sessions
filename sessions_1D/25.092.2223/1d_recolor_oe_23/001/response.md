"""
Iterate through the input array/row. If a pixel is white (0), keep it white in the output. 
If a pixel is orange (7), identify the contiguous horizontal segment of orange pixels it belongs to. 
Determine the length of this segment. If the length is 3, change all pixels in that segment to red (2) in the output. 
If the length is 2, change all pixels in that segment to magenta (6) in the output.
