## Perception

The input and output are one-dimensional arrays (or single-row grids) of pixels.
The input contains white (0) and orange (7) pixels.
The output contains white (0), red (2), and magenta (6) pixels.
The white pixels remain unchanged in the output.
The orange pixels change color based on the length of the contiguous horizontal segment they belong to.
Specifically, contiguous segments of three orange pixels change to red, and contiguous segments of two orange pixels change to magenta.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Iterate through the input array/row to identify contiguous horizontal segments of orange (7) pixels.
2.  For each identified orange segment:
    *   Determine the length of the segment.
    *   If the length is 3, replace all orange pixels in that segment with red (2) pixels in the output.
    *   If the length is 2, replace all orange pixels in that segment with magenta (6) pixels in the output.
3.  Keep all white (0) pixels unchanged in their original positions in the output.
4.  Construct the output array/row based on these replacements and unchanged pixels.

## General Assessment

The previous `transform` function failed because the transformation rule was derived solely from the first training example. Analyzing all three examples reveals a different, consistent pattern: the color an orange segment transforms into depends on whether the length of the segment is odd or even. The provided code implementation also failed to produce any transformation, returning the input unchanged, suggesting a potential issue in the execution environment or a subtle bug, although the traced logic appeared correct for the *initial* (incorrect) rule.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the revised transformation rule (odd length -> red, even length -> magenta) by analyzing segment lengths and output colors across all examples using `tool_code`.
2.  Update the documented facts and the natural language program to reflect this refined understanding.
3.  The coder phase will then need to implement this corrected logic.

## Metrics

The following code analyzes the segments and color distributions in the training examples.

  - Each contiguous segment of orange pixels in the input maps to a contiguous segment of a single color (either red or magenta) in the output, with the same length and position.
  - The transformation rule (odd length -> red, even length -> magenta) is consistent across all three training examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), continue to the next pixel.
4.  If the current pixel is orange (7):
    *   Identify the start of the contiguous horizontal segment of orange pixels.
    *   Measure the length of this segment by checking subsequent pixels until a non-orange pixel or the end of the grid is reached.
    *   Determine if the measured length is odd or even.
    *   If the length is odd, change the color of all pixels within this segment in the *output grid* to red (2).
    *   If the length is even, change the color of all pixels within this segment in the *output grid* to magenta (6).
    *   Advance the iteration index past the identified segment to avoid re-processing pixels within it.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
