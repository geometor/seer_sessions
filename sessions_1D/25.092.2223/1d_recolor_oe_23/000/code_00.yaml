task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (or single row)
  colors_present_input: [white, orange]
  colors_present_output: [white, red, magenta]

objects:
  - type: pixel_segment
    description: Contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment (e.g., white, orange).
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.

transformation:
  description: Changes the color of orange pixel segments based on their length.
  rules:
    - condition: Input pixel is white (0).
      action: Output pixel remains white (0).
    - condition: Input pixel is orange (7) and belongs to a segment of length 3.
      action: Output pixel becomes red (2).
    - condition: Input pixel is orange (7) and belongs to a segment of length 2.
      action: Output pixel becomes magenta (6).
  unchanged_elements: White background pixels.

relationships:
  - type: color_mapping
    input_color: orange (7)
    output_color_conditions:
      - condition: segment length == 3
        output_color: red (2)
      - condition: segment length == 2
        output_color: magenta (6)
