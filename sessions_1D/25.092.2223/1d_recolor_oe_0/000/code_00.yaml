task_type: pixel_color_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1x20
  output: 1x20
colors_involved:
  input: [white (0), red (2)]
  output: [white (0), blue (1), azure (8)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length (number of pixels in the block)
relationships:
  - background pixels (white) remain unchanged in position and color.
transformation_rule:
  - operates on contiguous horizontal blocks of red (2) pixels.
  - output color depends on the length of the red block:
      - if length is odd: change red (2) to blue (1)
      - if length is even: change red (2) to azure (8)
