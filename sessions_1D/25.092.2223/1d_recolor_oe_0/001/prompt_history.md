## Perception

The input and output are both single-row grids (1x20).
The input grid contains only white (0) and red (2) pixels.
The output grid contains white (0), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels.
The white pixels in the input appear to remain white in the output and stay in the same positions.
The red pixels in the input are transformed into either blue or azure pixels in the output.
The transformation seems to depend on the contiguous horizontal blocks of red pixels.

Let's analyze the blocks:
-   **train_1:**
    -   Input: `[2 2 2]` (length 3), `[2 2]` (length 2), `[2 2 2 2 2]` (length 5)
    -   Output: `[1 1 1]` (blue), `[8 8]` (azure), `[1 1 1 1 1]` (blue)
-   **train_2:**
    -   Input: `[2 2]` (length 2), `[2]` (length 1), `[2 2 2]` (length 3), `[2 2 2 2 2]` (length 5)
    -   Output: `[8 8]` (azure), `[1]` (blue), `[1 1 1]` (blue), `[1 1 1 1 1]` (blue)
-   **train_3:**
    -   Input: `[2 2 2 2 2 2]` (length 6), `[2 2 2]` (length 3), `[2 2 2 2 2]` (length 5)
    -   Output: `[8 8 8 8 8 8]` (azure), `[1 1 1]` (blue), `[1 1 1 1 1]` (blue)

It appears that blocks of red pixels with an odd length are transformed into blue pixels, and blocks of red pixels with an even length are transformed into azure pixels.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: pixel_color_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1x20
  output: 1x20
colors_involved:
  input: [white (0), red (2)]
  output: [white (0), blue (1), azure (8)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length (number of pixels in the block)
relationships:
  - background pixels (white) remain unchanged in position and color.
transformation_rule:
  - operates on contiguous horizontal blocks of red (2) pixels.
  - output color depends on the length of the red block:
      - if length is odd: change red (2) to blue (1)
      - if length is even: change red (2) to azure (8)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally to identify contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels.
3.  For each identified block of red pixels:
    a.  Calculate the length (number of pixels) of the block.
    b.  Check if the length is even or odd.
    c.  If the length is odd, change the color of all pixels within that block in the output grid to blue (1).
    d.  If the length is even, change the color of all pixels within that block in the output grid to azure (8).
4.  Leave all white (0) pixels unchanged.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
