*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output grids are one-dimensional arrays (or grids with a height of 1).
    *   The input grids contain only white (0) and yellow (4) pixels.
    *   The yellow pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) separated by one or more white pixels.
    *   The output grids retain the white pixels in their original positions.
    *   The yellow pixels in the input are replaced by either blue (1) or magenta (6) pixels in the output.
    *   The color used for replacement appears to depend on the length of the contiguous block of yellow pixels in the input.
    *   Observing the examples:
        *   `train_1`: Length 6 (even) -> blue (1), Length 3 (odd) -> magenta (6), Length 4 (even) -> blue (1), Length 3 (odd) -> magenta (6).
        *   `train_2`: Length 2 (even) -> blue (1), Length 3 (odd) -> magenta (6), Length 3 (odd) -> magenta (6), Length 5 (odd) -> magenta (6).
        *   `train_3`: Length 4 (even) -> blue (1), Length 3 (odd) -> magenta (6), Length 4 (even) -> blue (1), Length 4 (even) -> blue (1).
    *   The pattern seems to be: replace yellow blocks of even length with blue, and yellow blocks of odd length with magenta.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    Task: Replace yellow pixel blocks based on length parity.
    Input_Grid:
      Properties:
        - Grid: 1D array (or HxW where H=1)
        - Pixels: Contains white (0) and yellow (4) pixels.
      Objects:
        - Type: Background
          Color: white (0)
        - Type: Block
          Color: yellow (4)
          Properties:
            - Contiguous_Horizontal: True
            - Length: Variable (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
            - Parity: Derived from Length (even or odd)
    Output_Grid:
      Properties:
        - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
        - Pixels: Contains white (0), blue (1), and magenta (6) pixels.
      Objects:
        - Type: Background
          Color: white (0)
          Relationship: Unchanged from input.
        - Type: Block
          Color: blue (1)
          Relationship: Replaces input yellow blocks of even length.
          Properties:
            - Same position and length as corresponding input yellow block.
        - Type: Block
          Color: magenta (6)
          Relationship: Replaces input yellow blocks of odd length.
          Properties:
            - Same position and length as corresponding input yellow block.
    Transformation:
      Action: Identify contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow (4) pixels in the input.
      Rule:
        - Condition: If the length of a yellow block is even.
          - Action: Replace all pixels in that block with blue (1) in the output.
        - Condition: If the length of a yellow block is odd.
          - Action: Replace all pixels in that block with magenta (6) in the output.
      Rule_Otherwise: Keep white (0) pixels unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
    2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally, identifying contiguous blocks of yellow (4) pixels.
    3.  For each identified yellow block:
        a.  Determine the length of the block.
        b.  Check if the length is even or odd.
        c.  If the length is even, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with blue (1) pixels.
        d.  If the length is odd, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with magenta (6) pixels.
    4.  Leave all original white (0) pixel positions in the output grid as white (0).
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
