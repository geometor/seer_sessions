Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input and output are grids of the same dimensions. The background color is consistently white (0).
2.  **Color Transformation:** The primary transformation involves changing green (3) pixels in the input to either blue (1) or gray (5) pixels in the output. All other pixels (white background) remain unchanged.
3.  **Object Identification:** The green pixels in the input form distinct connected components (objects). These objects appear to be processed independently.
4.  **Shape Dependency:** The final color (blue or gray) seems to depend on the shape properties of the green objects or their constituent parts.
5.  **Rule 1: Solid Rectangles:** Connected components of green pixels that form a solid rectangle (where the number of green pixels equals the area of their bounding box) are consistently transformed into blue (1) pixels.
6.  **Rule 2: Non-Rectangular Shapes:** For connected green components that are *not* solid rectangles, the transformation depends on the horizontal segments within them.
    *   Maximal horizontal segments of green pixels are identified within these non-rectangular shapes.
    *   Segments with a length of exactly 2 or exactly 4 are transformed into blue (1) pixels.
    *   Segments with any other length (e.g., 1, 3, 5) are transformed into gray (5) pixels.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Task: Color transformation based on shape properties of green objects.

Input_Grid:
  - Contains_Pixels: [0, 3] # white, green
  - Background_Color: 0 # white

Output_Grid:
  - Contains_Pixels: [0, 1, 5] # white, blue, gray
  - Background_Color: 0 # white
  - Derived_From: Input_Grid

Objects:
  - Type: Connected Components
  - Color: 3 # green
  - Properties:
      - Bounding_Box: Calculated for each component.
      - Size: Number of pixels in the component.
      - Is_Solid_Rectangle: True if Size == (Bounding_Box.height * Bounding_Box.width), False otherwise.
      - Horizontal_Segments: List of contiguous horizontal runs of green pixels within the component.
        - Properties:
            - Length: Number of pixels in the segment.

Transformation_Rules:
  - Rule_1:
      - Applies_To: Green objects where Is_Solid_Rectangle is True.
      - Action: Recolor all pixels of the object to 1 (blue).
  - Rule_2:
      - Applies_To: Green objects where Is_Solid_Rectangle is False.
      - Action: Process each Horizontal_Segment within the object.
        - If Segment.Length is 2 or Segment.Length is 4:
            - Recolor pixels of the segment to 1 (blue).
        - Else (Segment.Length is 1, 3, 5, etc.):
            - Recolor pixels of the segment to 5 (gray).

Relationships:
  - Pixel_Mapping: Each output pixel corresponds to the input pixel at the same coordinate.
  - Color_Mapping:
      - Input 0 -> Output 0
      - Input 3 -> Output 1 (if part of Rule_1 object, or specific segments in Rule_2 object)
      - Input 3 -> Output 5 (if part of Rule_2 object and segment length is not 2 or 4)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct connected components (objects) consisting of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each green object found:
    a.  Determine if the object forms a solid rectangle (i.e., its pixel count equals the area of its bounding box).
    b.  **If the object is a solid rectangle:** Change the color of all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid to blue (1).
    c.  **If the object is not a solid rectangle:**
        i.  Identify all maximal horizontal segments of green pixels within this object.
        ii. For each horizontal segment:
            *   Calculate the length of the segment.
            *   If the length is exactly 2 or exactly 4, change the color of the pixels belonging to this segment in the output grid to blue (1).
            *   Otherwise (if the length is 1, 3, 5, or any other value not equal to 2 or 4), change the color of the pixels belonging to this segment in the output grid to gray (5).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
