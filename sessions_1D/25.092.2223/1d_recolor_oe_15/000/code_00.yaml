Task: Color transformation based on shape properties of green objects.

Input_Grid:
  - Contains_Pixels: [0, 3] # white, green
  - Background_Color: 0 # white

Output_Grid:
  - Contains_Pixels: [0, 1, 5] # white, blue, gray
  - Background_Color: 0 # white
  - Derived_From: Input_Grid

Objects:
  - Type: Connected Components
  - Color: 3 # green
  - Properties:
      - Bounding_Box: Calculated for each component.
      - Size: Number of pixels in the component.
      - Is_Solid_Rectangle: True if Size == (Bounding_Box.height * Bounding_Box.width), False otherwise.
      - Horizontal_Segments: List of contiguous horizontal runs of green pixels within the component.
        - Properties:
            - Length: Number of pixels in the segment.

Transformation_Rules:
  - Rule_1:
      - Applies_To: Green objects where Is_Solid_Rectangle is True.
      - Action: Recolor all pixels of the object to 1 (blue).
  - Rule_2:
      - Applies_To: Green objects where Is_Solid_Rectangle is False.
      - Action: Process each Horizontal_Segment within the object.
        - If Segment.Length is 2 or Segment.Length is 4:
            - Recolor pixels of the segment to 1 (blue).
        - Else (Segment.Length is 1, 3, 5, etc.):
            - Recolor pixels of the segment to 5 (gray).

Relationships:
  - Pixel_Mapping: Each output pixel corresponds to the input pixel at the same coordinate.
  - Color_Mapping:
      - Input 0 -> Output 0
      - Input 3 -> Output 1 (if part of Rule_1 object, or specific segments in Rule_2 object)
      - Input 3 -> Output 5 (if part of Rule_2 object and segment length is not 2 or 4)
