The background color is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Color Transformation:** The primary transformation involves changing green (3) pixels in the input to either blue (1) or gray (5) pixels in the output. All other pixels (white background) remain unchanged.\n3.  **Object Identification:** The green pixels in the input form distinct connected components (objects). These objects appear to be processed independently.\n4.  **Shape Dependency:** The final color (blue or gray) seems to depend on the shape properties of the green objects or their constituent parts.\n5.  **Rule 1: Solid Rectangles:** Connected components of green pixels that form a solid rectangle (where the number of green pixels equals the area of their bounding box) are consistently transformed into blue (1) pixels.\n6.  **Rule 2: Non-Rectangular Shapes:** For connected green components that are *not* solid rectangles, the transformation depends on the horizontal segments within them.\n    *   Maximal horizontal segments of green pixels are identified within these non-rectangular shapes.\n    *   Segments with a length of exactly 2 or exactly 4 are transformed into blue (1) pixels.\n    *   Segments with any other length (e.g., 1, 3, 5) are transformed into gray (5) pixels.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
