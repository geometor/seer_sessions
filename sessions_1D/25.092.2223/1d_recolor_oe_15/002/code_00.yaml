Task: Color transformation based on the length of horizontal green segments.

Input_Grid:
  - Contains_Pixels: [0, 3] # white, green
  - Background_Color: 0 # white

Output_Grid:
  - Contains_Pixels: [0, 1, 5] # white, blue, gray
  - Background_Color: 0 # white
  - Derived_From: Input_Grid

Objects:
  - Type: Maximal Horizontal Segment
  - Color: 3 # green
  - Properties:
      - Length: Number of contiguous green pixels in the segment horizontally.
      - Parity: Even or Odd, based on Length.

Transformation_Rules:
  - Rule_1:
      - Applies_To: Green horizontal segments where Length is Even (2, 4, 6, ...).
      - Action: Recolor all pixels of the segment to 1 (blue).
  - Rule_2:
      - Applies_To: Green horizontal segments where Length is Odd (1, 3, 5, ...).
      - Action: Recolor all pixels of the segment to 5 (gray).

Relationships:
  - Pixel_Mapping: Each output pixel corresponds to the input pixel at the same coordinate.
  - Color_Mapping:
      - Input 0 -> Output 0
      - Input 3 -> Output 1 (if part of an even-length horizontal green segment)
      - Input 3 -> Output 5 (if part of an odd-length horizontal green segment)
