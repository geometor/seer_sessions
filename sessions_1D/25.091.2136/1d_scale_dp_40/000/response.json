Each input array contains a sequence of pixels of one color (let's call this the *main color*), followed by a sequence of white pixels (color 0), and then a single orange pixel (color 7). There might be other pixels before the main color sequence or after the orange pixel.\n\nThe transformation involves changing the color of the white pixels that are located *between* the last instance of the main color and the orange pixel. These white pixels are replaced with the main color. Pixels before the main sequence, the main sequence itself, the orange pixel, and any pixels after the orange pixel remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Example 1**: The main color is blue (1). The white pixels between the last blue and the orange (7) are changed to blue.\n*   **Example 2**: The main color is green (3). The white pixels between the last green and the orange (7) are changed to green. The final white pixel after the orange remains white.\n*   **Example 3**: The main color is azure (8). The white pixels between the last azure and the orange (7) are changed to azure. The leading white pixel and the trailing white pixels remain white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Find the index (position) of the orange pixel (color 7) in the input array. Let this be `orange_index`.\n3.  Initialize a variable `fill_start_index` to `orange_index - 1`.\n4.  Iterate backwards from `fill_start_index` as long as the current index is valid (>= 0) and the pixel at the current index in the input array is white (color 0). Decrement the current index in each step of this iteration.\n5.  After the loop in step 4 finishes, the current index points to the last white pixel in the sequence (or is invalid if there were no preceding white pixels). Let `last_white_index` be the index where the backward iteration stopped (the index *before* the first non-white pixel or index -1).\n6.  The pixel immediately before the sequence of white pixels (at index `last_white_index`) determines the *fill color*. Get the color of the pixel at `input_array[last_white_index]`. Let this be `fill_color`.\n7.  Iterate from `last_white_index + 1` up to (but not including) `orange_index`. For each index `i` in this range:\n    *   Set the pixel at index `i` in the *output* array to `fill_color`.\n8.  Return the modified output array."
