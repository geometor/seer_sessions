task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - item: input_array
    type: 1D array of pixels
  - item: output_array
    type: 1D array of pixels (same dimensions as input)
objects:
  - object: main_color_pixel
    description: Pixels forming the primary sequence before the target sequence. Varies per example (blue, green, azure).
  - object: white_pixel
    value: 0
    description: Pixels acting as fillers between the main color and the marker.
  - object: marker_pixel
    value: 7
    color: orange
    description: A single pixel indicating the end of the sequence to be modified.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: White pixels (0) are located sequentially between the last main_color_pixel and the marker_pixel (7).
actions:
  - action: identify_marker
    target: marker_pixel (7)
    description: Find the index of the orange pixel.
  - action: identify_fill_sequence
    target: white_pixel (0)
    condition: Located immediately before the marker_pixel (7).
    description: Find the contiguous block of white pixels preceding the orange pixel.
  - action: identify_fill_color
    target: pixel immediately preceding the identified fill_sequence
    description: Determine the color to use for filling. This is the color of the pixel just before the sequence of white pixels starts.
  - action: replace_pixels
    target: identified fill_sequence (white pixels)
    result: Pixels in the sequence change color to the identified fill_color.
    description: Change the color of the identified white pixels to the fill color.
constraints:
  - Only white pixels located directly between the last instance of the fill color and the orange marker pixel are changed.
  - The orange marker pixel itself is never changed.
  - Pixels outside this specific [last fill color ... orange marker] range are unchanged.
