Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are all 1-dimensional grids (rows).
2.  **Colors Present:** The grids primarily use white (`0`), azure (`8`), and one other color per example (blue `1` or red `2`).
3.  **Key Markers:** The azure pixel (`8`) seems to act as a right boundary or target marker.
4.  **Transformation Area:** The changes occur in the segment between the sequence of the main color (blue or red) and the azure pixel.
5.  **Nature of Change:** White pixels (`0`) located between the last instance of the main color and the first instance of the azure color (`8`) are replaced by the main color.
6.  **Main Color Identification:** The main color (blue or red in the examples) is the non-white, non-azure color that appears as a contiguous block (or potentially multiple blocks, but the last one before azure seems key).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Dimensions:
  - Type: 1D Array (Row)
  - Size: Variable width (e.g., 1x16)
Objects:
  - Object: Color Segment
    Properties:
      - Color: Variable (e.g., blue '1', red '2') - referred to as 'Fill Color'
      - Shape: Horizontal line segment
      - Location: Starts near the left, extends rightwards.
  - Object: Marker Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: azure '8'
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Location: To the right of the Color Segment, separated by white pixels.
  - Object: Background/Filler Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: white '0'
      - Location: Surrounds other objects, notably filling the gap between the Color Segment and the Marker Pixel in the input.
Relationships:
  - Relation: Spatial Order
    Details: In the input, the sequence is typically [optional white] -> [Fill Color Segment] -> [white gap] -> [azure Marker Pixel] -> [optional white].
Actions:
  - Action: Identify Fill Color
    Details: Find the non-white, non-azure color present in the input.
  - Action: Locate Boundaries
    Details: Find the index of the last pixel of the Fill Color Segment and the index of the azure Marker Pixel.
  - Action: Fill Gap
    Details: Change the color of all white pixels located between the last Fill Color pixel and the azure Marker Pixel to the Fill Color.
Transformation_Goal:
  - Goal: Extend the Fill Color Segment rightwards until it immediately precedes the azure Marker Pixel by replacing the intervening white pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify the primary non-white, non-azure color (the "fill color").
2.  Find the index (position) of the rightmost pixel that has the fill color. Let this be `last_fill_index`.
3.  Find the index (position) of the leftmost pixel that has the azure color (`8`). Let this be `azure_index`.
4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
5.  Iterate through the indices of the output grid from `last_fill_index + 1` up to (but not including) `azure_index`.
6.  For each index in this range, set the pixel color in the output grid to the identified "fill color".
7.  Return the modified output grid.
