Specifically, the white (0) pixels located *between* the end of the colored block and the maroon (9) marker are changed to match the color of the block.\n4.  **Invariance:** Pixels before the colored block, the colored block itself, the maroon (9) marker, and any pixels after the maroon marker remain unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Objects:** We can identify:\n    *   A \"colored segment\" (orange, yellow, or red).\n    *   A \"gap\" (sequence of white pixels).\n    *   A \"marker\" (the maroon pixel).\n6.  **Action:** The action is \"filling\" the gap with the color of the segment preceding it, stopping just before the marker.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
