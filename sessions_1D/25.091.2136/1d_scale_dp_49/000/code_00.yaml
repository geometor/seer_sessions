task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and a marker pixel.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row).
objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of a single non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., orange, yellow, red).
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the block (variable across examples).
      - location: Precedes the marker pixel.
      - relation_to_marker: Separated from the marker by a gap of white pixels in the input.
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the maroon (9) color.
    properties:
      - color: Always maroon (9).
      - location: Appears after the colored_block and the gap.
      - role: Defines the endpoint for the fill operation.
  - id: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Always white (0).
      - location: Situated between the end of the colored_block and the marker_pixel.
      - role: This is the area that gets modified in the output.
actions:
  - name: identify_elements
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - colored_block (including its color and end position)
      - marker_pixel (its position)
      - gap (start and end positions, implicitly defined by block end and marker position)
  - name: fill_gap
    inputs:
      - grid
      - gap_start_position
      - gap_end_position
      - fill_color (color of the colored_block)
    outputs:
      - modified_grid
    description: Change the color of pixels within the gap range [gap_start_position, gap_end_position) to the fill_color.
process_flow:
  - step: Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
  - step: Locate the position (`marker_pos`) of the marker_pixel (maroon, 9).
  - step: Scan backwards from `marker_pos - 1` to find the first non-white pixel. Record its color (`fill_color`) and its position (`block_end_pos`).
  - step: Iterate from position `block_end_pos + 1` up to (but not including) `marker_pos`.
  - step: For each position in the iteration, set the pixel value in the output grid to `fill_color`.
  - step: Return the modified output grid.
constraints:
  - Assumes exactly one marker_pixel (maroon, 9) exists.
  - Assumes there is at least one non-white pixel before the marker_pixel to determine the fill_color.
  - The fill operation only affects white (0) pixels between the block and the marker.
