Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as single rows (1D arrays or 1xN grids).
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   White (0) acts as a background or empty space.
    *   A non-white color (orange-7, yellow-4, red-2 in the examples) forms a contiguous block.
    *   Maroon (9) acts as a distinct marker or endpoint.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extending the block of non-white color. Specifically, the white (0) pixels located *between* the end of the colored block and the maroon (9) marker are changed to match the color of the block.
4.  **Invariance:** Pixels before the colored block, the colored block itself, the maroon (9) marker, and any pixels after the maroon marker remain unchanged in the output.
5.  **Objects:** We can identify:
    *   A "colored segment" (orange, yellow, or red).
    *   A "gap" (sequence of white pixels).
    *   A "marker" (the maroon pixel).
6.  **Action:** The action is "filling" the gap with the color of the segment preceding it, stopping just before the marker.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and a marker pixel.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row).
objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of a single non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., orange, yellow, red).
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the block (variable across examples).
      - location: Precedes the marker pixel.
      - relation_to_marker: Separated from the marker by a gap of white pixels in the input.
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the maroon (9) color.
    properties:
      - color: Always maroon (9).
      - location: Appears after the colored_block and the gap.
      - role: Defines the endpoint for the fill operation.
  - id: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Always white (0).
      - location: Situated between the end of the colored_block and the marker_pixel.
      - role: This is the area that gets modified in the output.
actions:
  - name: identify_elements
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - colored_block (including its color and end position)
      - marker_pixel (its position)
      - gap (start and end positions, implicitly defined by block end and marker position)
  - name: fill_gap
    inputs:
      - grid
      - gap_start_position
      - gap_end_position
      - fill_color (color of the colored_block)
    outputs:
      - modified_grid
    description: Change the color of pixels within the gap range [gap_start_position, gap_end_position) to the fill_color.
process_flow:
  - step: Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
  - step: Locate the position (`marker_pos`) of the marker_pixel (maroon, 9).
  - step: Scan backwards from `marker_pos - 1` to find the first non-white pixel. Record its color (`fill_color`) and its position (`block_end_pos`).
  - step: Iterate from position `block_end_pos + 1` up to (but not including) `marker_pos`.
  - step: For each position in the iteration, set the pixel value in the output grid to `fill_color`.
  - step: Return the modified output grid.
constraints:
  - Assumes exactly one marker_pixel (maroon, 9) exists.
  - Assumes there is at least one non-white pixel before the marker_pixel to determine the fill_color.
  - The fill operation only affects white (0) pixels between the block and the marker.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Find the index (position) of the maroon (9) pixel in the grid. Let this be `marker_index`.
3.  Starting from the position immediately before the maroon pixel (`marker_index - 1`), scan backwards (leftwards) through the grid until you find the first pixel that is not white (0).
4.  Record the color of this non-white pixel; this is the `fill_color`. Let the index where this pixel was found be `last_color_index`.
5.  Iterate through the grid indices starting from `last_color_index + 1` up to, but not including, `marker_index`.
6.  For each index in this range, change the pixel in the output grid to the `fill_color`.
7.  The final modified grid is the result.
