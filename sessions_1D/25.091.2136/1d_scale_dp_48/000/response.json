Each input array contains a contiguous block of a single color (other than white or azure), followed by some white pixels, and then a single azure pixel. The transformation involves extending the colored block to the right, overwriting the intermediate white pixels until it reaches the azure pixel. The azure pixel itself and any pixels preceding the colored block or following the azure pixel remain unchanged. The color used for filling is the color of the original contiguous block.\n\n*   **Facts YAML**:\n    "
