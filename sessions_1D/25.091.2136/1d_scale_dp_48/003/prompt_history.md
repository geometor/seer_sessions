*   **Perception**: The task operates on 1-dimensional arrays (or single-row grids) of colored pixels. Each input array contains a contiguous block of a single color (other than white or azure), followed by some white pixels, and then a single azure pixel. The transformation involves extending the colored block to the right, overwriting the intermediate white pixels until it reaches the azure pixel. The azure pixel itself and any pixels preceding the colored block or following the azure pixel remain unchanged. The color used for filling is the color of the original contiguous block.

*   **Facts YAML**:
    
```yaml

    objects:
      - object: fill_block
        description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels with a color other than white (0) or azure (8). There is only one such block per input.
        properties:
          - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., yellow, gray, orange).
          - start_index: The index of the first pixel in the block.
          - end_index: The index of the last pixel in the block.
      - object: boundary_pixel
        description: An azure (8) pixel that appears after the fill_block.
        properties:

      - object: gap_pixels

        properties:
          - color: white (0).

    relationships:
      - relationship: spatial_order
        description: The fill_block appears first, followed by zero or more gap_pixels, followed by the boundary_pixel. All other pixels either precede the fill_block or follow the boundary_pixel.
    invariants:
      - Pixels before the start of the fill_block remain unchanged.
      - The fill_block itself remains unchanged (though it becomes part of a larger block of the same color).
      - The boundary_pixel (azure) remains unchanged in color and position.
      - Pixels after the boundary_pixel remain unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of pixels having the same color, where the color is not white (0) and not azure (8). Record its color (let's call it `fill_color`) and the index of its last pixel (`end_fill_index`).
    2.  Find the index of the first azure (8) pixel that occurs after `end_fill_index`. Let this be `azure_index`.
    3.  Iterate through the array from the index immediately following `end_fill_index` up to (but not including) `azure_index`.
    4.  For each pixel in this range, if its color is white (0), change its color to `fill_color`.
    5.  Leave all other pixels in the array unchanged.
    6.  The resulting array is the output.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`. This strongly indicates an issue with how the input data structure is being handled, likely assuming a 1D list when the environment provides a 2D structure (list of lists or NumPy array) representing a single row (1xN grid). The core logic of identifying the colored block, the azure boundary, and filling the gap seems correct based on manual analysis and simulation. The strategy is to modify the code to explicitly handle the expected 1xN input format by extracting the single row, processing it as a 1D list, and then wrapping the result back into the 1xN format.

**Metrics:**

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` to simulate the process on the assumption of a 1xN input structure (list containing one list).

*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a list containing a single list `[[...]]`, representing a 1xN grid.
*   **Grid Size:** All examples use a 1x27 grid.
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Row: `[0, ..., 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
    *   Fill Block: Yellow (4), indices 19-21.
    *   Azure Boundary: Index 26.
    *   Gap Indices: 22, 23, 24, 25.
    *   Action: Fill indices 22-25 with Yellow (4).
    *   Output Row: `[0, ..., 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8]`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Row: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, ...0]`
    *   Fill Block: Gray (5), indices 4-9.
    *   Azure Boundary: Index 13.
    *   Gap Indices: 10, 11, 12.
    *   Action: Fill indices 10-12 with Gray (5).
    *   Output Row: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, ...0]`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Row: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, ...0]`
    *   Fill Block: Orange (7), indices 0-8.
    *   Azure Boundary: Index 12.
    *   Gap Indices: 9, 10, 11.
    *   Action: Fill indices 9-11 with Orange (7).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels. Extract this row as a list.
2.  Make a copy of the row to serve as the output row.
3.  Scan the input row to find the first contiguous block of pixels where the color is neither white (0) nor azure (8). Record the color of this block (`fill_color`) and the index of its last pixel (`end_fill_index`). If no such block exists, return the original grid.
4.  Starting from the position immediately after the block (`end_fill_index + 1`), scan the input row to find the index of the first azure (8) pixel (`azure_index`). If no such azure pixel exists, return the original grid.
5.  Iterate through the indices `i` from `end_fill_index + 1` up to, but not including, `azure_index`.
6.  For each index `i` in this range, set the pixel color at index `i` in the output row copy to `fill_color`.
7.  Package the modified output row back into a single-row grid structure.
8.  Return the resulting grid.
