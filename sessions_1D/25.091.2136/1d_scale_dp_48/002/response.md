**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`. This strongly indicates an issue with how the input data structure is being handled, likely assuming a 1D list when the environment provides a 2D structure (list of lists or NumPy array) representing a single row (1xN grid). The core logic of identifying the colored block, the azure boundary, and filling the gap seems correct based on manual analysis and simulation. The strategy is to modify the code to explicitly handle the expected 1xN input format by extracting the single row, processing it as a 1D list, and then wrapping the result back into the 1xN format.

**Metrics:**

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` to simulate the process on the assumption of a 1xN input structure (list containing one list).

*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a list containing a single list `[[...]]`, representing a 1xN grid.
*   **Grid Size:** All examples use a 1x27 grid.
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Row: `[0, ..., 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
    *   Fill Block: Yellow (4), indices 19-21.
    *   Azure Boundary: Index 26.
    *   Gap Indices: 22, 23, 24, 25.
    *   Action: Fill indices 22-25 with Yellow (4).
    *   Output Row: `[0, ..., 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8]`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Row: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, ...0]`
    *   Fill Block: Gray (5), indices 4-9.
    *   Azure Boundary: Index 13.
    *   Gap Indices: 10, 11, 12.
    *   Action: Fill indices 10-12 with Gray (5).
    *   Output Row: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, ...0]`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Row: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, ...0]`
    *   Fill Block: Orange (7), indices 0-8.
    *   Azure Boundary: Index 12.
    *   Gap Indices: 9, 10, 11.
    *   Action: Fill indices 9-11 with Orange (7).
    *   Output Row: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, ...0]`

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_manipulation
dimensionality: pseudo-1D # Input/output are 1xN grids, but processed row by row (effectively 1D).
input_format: List containing a single list of integers (e.g., [[pixel1, pixel2, ...]])
output_format: List containing a single list of integers (e.g., [[pixel1, pixel2, ...]])
objects:
  - object: row_data
    description: The single list of pixels representing the row contained within the input grid.
    properties:
      - pixels: A list of integers (0-9) representing pixel colors.
      - length: The number of pixels in the row.
  - object: fill_block
    description: >
      A contiguous sequence of identical pixels within the row_data.
      Its color must not be white (0) or azure (8).
      Assumed unique per input row based on examples.
    properties:
      - color: The single color shared by all pixels in the block.
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel of the block within the row_data.
      - end_index: The index of the last pixel of the block within the row_data.
  - object: boundary_pixel
    description: >
      An azure (8) pixel within the row_data located at an index strictly greater
      than the fill_block's end_index. The first such pixel encountered after
      the block is the relevant boundary.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8).
      - index: The position of this pixel in the row_data.
  - object: fill_gap
    description: >
      The sequence of pixel positions located strictly between the end of the
      fill_block and the boundary_pixel.
    properties:
      - location: Indices range from (fill_block.end_index + 1) up to (boundary_pixel.index - 1).
actions:
  - action: identify_elements
    description: >
      Scan the row_data to find the fill_block and the subsequent boundary_pixel.
    steps:
      - Find the first pixel that is not white(0) or azure(8). This marks the start of the fill_block.
      - Continue scanning to find the end of this contiguous block of the same color (end_fill_index). Note the color (fill_color).
      - Scan from end_fill_index + 1 onwards to find the first azure(8) pixel (azure_index).
  - action: fill_color
    description: >
      Modify the pixels located within the identified fill_gap.
    target: Pixels in row_data at indices within the fill_gap location range.
    details: Change the color of each targeted pixel to the fill_color identified from the fill_block.
relationships:
  - relationship: sequence
    description: >
      Within the row_data, the elements appear in the order:
      [optional prefix pixels] -> fill_block -> fill_gap -> boundary_pixel -> [optional suffix pixels].
invariants:
  - The grid structure (1xN) remains unchanged.
  - Pixels before the fill_block's start_index are unchanged.
  - The pixels originally part of the fill_block retain their color (fill_color).
  - The boundary_pixel retains its color (azure) and position.
  - Pixels after the boundary_pixel's index are unchanged.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels. Extract this row as a list.
2.  Make a copy of the row to serve as the output row.
3.  Scan the input row to find the first contiguous block of pixels where the color is neither white (0) nor azure (8). Record the color of this block (`fill_color`) and the index of its last pixel (`end_fill_index`). If no such block exists, return the original grid.
4.  Starting from the position immediately after the block (`end_fill_index + 1`), scan the input row to find the index of the first azure (8) pixel (`azure_index`). If no such azure pixel exists, return the original grid.
5.  Iterate through the indices `i` from `end_fill_index + 1` up to, but not including, `azure_index`.
6.  For each index `i` in this range, set the pixel color at index `i` in the output row copy to `fill_color`.
7.  Package the modified output row back into a single-row grid structure.
8.  Return the resulting grid.
