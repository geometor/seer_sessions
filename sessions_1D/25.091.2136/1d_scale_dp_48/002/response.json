            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`. This strongly indicates an issue with how the input data structure is being handled, likely assuming a 1D list when the environment provides a 2D structure (list of lists or NumPy array) representing a single row (1xN grid). The core logic of identifying the colored block, the azure boundary, and filling the gap seems correct based on manual analysis and simulation. The strategy is to modify the code to explicitly handle the expected 1xN input format by extracting the single row, processing it as a 1D list, and then wrapping the result back into the 1xN format.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nMetrics were gathered using `tool_code` to simulate the process on the assumption of a 1xN input structure (list containing one list).\n\n*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a list containing a single list `[[...]]`, representing a 1xN grid.\n*   **Grid Size:** All examples use a 1x27 grid.\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Row: `[0, ..., 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`\n    *   Fill Block: Yellow (4), indices 19-21.\n    *   Azure Boundary: Index 26.\n    *   Gap Indices: 22, 23, 24, 25.\n    *   Action: Fill indices 22-25 with Yellow (4).\n    *   Output Row: `[0, ..., 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8]`\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Row: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, ...0]`\n    *   Fill Block: Gray (5), indices 4-9.\n    *   Azure Boundary: Index 13.\n    *   Gap Indices: 10, 11, 12.\n    *   Action: Fill indices 10-12 with Gray (5).\n    *   Output Row: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, ...0]`\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Row: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, ...0]`\n    *   Fill Block: Orange (7), indices 0-8.\n    *   Azure Boundary: Index 12.\n    *   Gap Indices: 9, 10, 11.\n    *   Action: Fill indices 9-11 with Orange (7).\n    *   Output Row: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, ...0]`\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
