task_description: "Fill white pixels to the left of a specific marker pixel (maroon/9) within the same row, using a contextually determined fill color."
grid_properties:
  - type: rectangular
  - variable_size: true # Implied, though examples are 4x5
  - color_palette: 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
objects:
  - object: marker_pixel
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1 per grid
    role: Reference point for transformation location.
  - object: target_pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Pixels potentially modified by the transformation.
  - object: fill_color_source
    color: Variable (e.g., 4, 8, 6 in examples)
    role: Determines the color used for filling.
    derivation: Most frequent color in the input grid, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The target_pixels (white) must be in the same row as the marker_pixel (maroon).
  - type: spatial
    description: The target_pixels (white) must be located horizontally to the left of the marker_pixel (maroon).
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker_pixel (maroon/9)
    purpose: Find its row and column index.
  - action: analyze
    target: entire input grid
    purpose: Determine the fill_color by finding the most frequent color excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
  - action: iterate_and_replace
    target: target_pixels (white)
    condition: Must satisfy the spatial relationships (same row, left of marker_pixel).
    replacement: fill_color
    purpose: Modify the grid according to the rule.
