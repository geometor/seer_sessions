Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels. The size seems consistent within each example pair (e.g., 4x5 in the examples shown after reshaping).
2.  **Key Colors**: Several colors are used, but white (0) and maroon (9) seem particularly important for the transformation logic. Other colors (yellow/4, azure/8, magenta/6) act as background or fill colors.
3.  **Target Pixel**: The maroon (9) pixel appears exactly once in each input grid and seems to be a critical reference point.
4.  **Pixels to Change**: The transformation specifically targets white (0) pixels.
5.  **Spatial Relationship**: The white pixels that are changed are always located in the *same row* as the maroon (9) pixel and strictly to its *left*.
6.  **Fill Color Determination**: The color used to replace the white pixels is determined by analyzing the overall composition of the input grid. It appears to be the most frequent color in the grid, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: "Fill white pixels to the left of a specific marker pixel (maroon/9) within the same row, using a contextually determined fill color."
grid_properties:
  - type: rectangular
  - variable_size: true # Implied, though examples are 4x5
  - color_palette: 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
objects:
  - object: marker_pixel
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1 per grid
    role: Reference point for transformation location.
  - object: target_pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Pixels potentially modified by the transformation.
  - object: fill_color_source
    color: Variable (e.g., 4, 8, 6 in examples)
    role: Determines the color used for filling.
    derivation: Most frequent color in the input grid, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The target_pixels (white) must be in the same row as the marker_pixel (maroon).
  - type: spatial
    description: The target_pixels (white) must be located horizontally to the left of the marker_pixel (maroon).
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker_pixel (maroon/9)
    purpose: Find its row and column index.
  - action: analyze
    target: entire input grid
    purpose: Determine the fill_color by finding the most frequent color excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
  - action: iterate_and_replace
    target: target_pixels (white)
    condition: Must satisfy the spatial relationships (same row, left of marker_pixel).
    replacement: fill_color
    purpose: Modify the grid according to the rule.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Marker**: Scan the input grid to find the location (row `R` and column `C`) of the single maroon (9) pixel.
2.  **Determine the Fill Color**: Count the occurrences of each color in the entire input grid. Identify the color that appears most frequently, ignoring any counts for white (0) and maroon (9). This most frequent color is the `fill_color`.
3.  **Modify the Grid**: Iterate through all the pixels in row `R` starting from the leftmost column (column 0) up to, but not including, column `C` (the column of the maroon pixel).
4.  **Apply Transformation**: For each pixel visited in step 3, if its color is white (0), change its color to the `fill_color` determined in step 2.
5.  **Output**: The resulting grid, with the specified white pixels changed, is the output. All other pixels remain unchanged.
