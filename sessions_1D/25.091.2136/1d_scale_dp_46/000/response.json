The size seems consistent within each example pair (e.g., 4x5 in the examples shown after reshaping).\n2.  **Key Colors**: Several colors are used, but white (0) and maroon (9) seem particularly important for the transformation logic. Other colors (yellow/4, azure/8, magenta/6) act as background or fill colors.\n3.  **Target Pixel**: The maroon (9) pixel appears exactly once in each input grid and seems to be a critical reference point.\n4.  **Pixels to Change**: The transformation specifically targets white (0) pixels.\n5.  **Spatial Relationship**: The white pixels that are changed are always located in the *same row* as the maroon (9) pixel and strictly to its *left*.\n6.  **Fill Color Determination**: The color used to replace the white pixels is determined by analyzing the overall composition of the input grid. It appears to be the most frequent color in the grid, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify the color that appears most frequently, ignoring any counts for white (0) and maroon (9). This most frequent color is the `fill_color`.\n3.  **Modify the Grid**: Iterate through all the pixels in row `R` starting from the leftmost column (column 0) up to, but not including, column `C` (the column of the maroon pixel).\n4.  **Apply Transformation**: For each pixel visited in step 3, if its color is white (0), change its color to the `fill_color` determined in step 2.\n5.  **Output**: The resulting grid, with the specified white pixels changed, is the output. All other pixels remain unchanged."
