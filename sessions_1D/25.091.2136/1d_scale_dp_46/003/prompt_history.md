Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels. The size seems consistent within each example pair (e.g., 4x5 in the examples shown after reshaping).
2.  **Key Colors**: Several colors are used, but white (0) and maroon (9) seem particularly important for the transformation logic. Other colors (yellow/4, azure/8, magenta/6) act as background or fill colors.
3.  **Target Pixel**: The maroon (9) pixel appears exactly once in each input grid and seems to be a critical reference point.
4.  **Pixels to Change**: The transformation specifically targets white (0) pixels.
5.  **Spatial Relationship**: The white pixels that are changed are always located in the *same row* as the maroon (9) pixel and strictly to its *left*.
6.  **Fill Color Determination**: The color used to replace the white pixels is determined by analyzing the overall composition of the input grid. It appears to be the most frequent color in the grid, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: "Fill white pixels to the left of a specific marker pixel (maroon/9) within the same row, using a contextually determined fill color."
grid_properties:
  - type: rectangular
  - variable_size: true # Implied, though examples are 4x5
  - color_palette: 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
objects:
  - object: marker_pixel
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1 per grid
    role: Reference point for transformation location.
  - object: target_pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Pixels potentially modified by the transformation.
  - object: fill_color_source
    color: Variable (e.g., 4, 8, 6 in examples)

    derivation: Most frequent color in the input grid, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The target_pixels (white) must be in the same row as the marker_pixel (maroon).
  - type: spatial
    description: The target_pixels (white) must be located horizontally to the left of the marker_pixel (maroon).
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker_pixel (maroon/9)
    purpose: Find its row and column index.
  - action: analyze
    target: entire input grid
    purpose: Determine the fill_color by finding the most frequent color excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
  - action: iterate_and_replace
    target: target_pixels (white)
    condition: Must satisfy the spatial relationships (same row, left of marker_pixel).
    replacement: fill_color
    purpose: Modify the grid according to the rule.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Marker**: Scan the input grid to find the location (row `R` and column `C`) of the single maroon (9) pixel.
2.  **Determine the Fill Color**: Count the occurrences of each color in the entire input grid. Identify the color that appears most frequently, ignoring any counts for white (0) and maroon (9). This most frequent color is the `fill_color`.
3.  **Modify the Grid**: Iterate through all the pixels in row `R` starting from the leftmost column (column 0) up to, but not including, column `C` (the column of the maroon pixel).
4.  **Apply Transformation**: For each pixel visited in step 3, if its color is white (0), change its color to the `fill_color` determined in step 2.
5.  **Output**: The resulting grid, with the specified white pixels changed, is the output. All other pixels remain unchanged.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components: locating a marker (maroon/9), determining a fill color (most frequent non-white/non-maroon), and applying it to white pixels (0) in the marker's row. However, the execution results revealed an inaccuracy in the transformation rule, specifically regarding *which* white pixels are modified.

**Example 3 Failure Analysis:** The code incorrectly filled *all* white pixels to the left of the marker in the designated row. The expected output shows that only the contiguous block of white pixels immediately preceding the marker should be filled. The leading white pixels at the beginning of the row remained unchanged.

**Refinement Strategy:**

1.  **Revise Transformation Logic:** The core logic needs refinement. Instead of filling all white pixels from the start of the row up to the marker, the process should start from the column immediately to the left of the marker (`marker_col - 1`) and proceed leftwards.
2.  **Introduce Contiguity Condition:** The filling should only continue as long as the pixels encountered (while moving leftwards) are white (0). The process stops upon encountering the first non-white pixel or reaching the beginning of the row (column 0).
3.  **Update Documentation:** Both the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program must be updated to reflect this revised understanding of contiguity.

## Metrics and Observations

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Marker Location:** Consistently found in each input.
*   **Fill Color:** Correctly determined as the most frequent non-white/non-maroon color (4, 8, 6 respectively).
*   **Changed Pixels:** The `changed_indices` confirm which white pixels in the marker row were modified.
*   **Contiguity:** The `contiguous_change_matches_expectation` is `True` for all examples. This confirms the refined hypothesis: the transformation fills the contiguous block of white pixels immediately to the left of the maroon marker. The `expected_contiguous_indices` calculated by the analysis script match the `changed_indices` observed in the output grids.

*Correction Note:* The analysis for Example 3 used the input/output data provided in the initial problem description (reshaped to 4x5). The code correctly identifies the fill color (6), marker position (row 3, col 2), and determines that the contiguous white pixels to the left are at indices 0 and 1. It confirms that these are indeed the pixels changed in the provided output. This validates the contiguity rule.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: "Fill the contiguous block of white pixels immediately to the left of a specific marker pixel (maroon/9), within the same row, using a contextually determined fill color."
grid_properties:
  - type: rectangular
  - variable_size: true # Implied by ARC standard, confirmed by shape differences if any
  - color_palette: 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
objects:
  - object: marker_pixel
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1 per grid
    role: Reference point for transformation location (row R, column C).
  - object: target_pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Pixels potentially modified by the transformation.
    location: Must be in row R, at columns < C.
    condition: Must form a contiguous horizontal segment ending at column C-1.
  - object: fill_color_source
    color: Variable (e.g., 4, 8, 6 in examples)
    role: Determines the color used for filling.
    derivation: Most frequent color in the input grid, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The target_pixels (white) must be in the same row as the marker_pixel (maroon).
  - type: spatial
    description: The target_pixels (white) must form a single, contiguous horizontal block immediately to the left of the marker_pixel.
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker_pixel (maroon/9)
    purpose: Find its row (R) and column (C) index.
  - action: analyze
    target: entire input grid
    purpose: Determine the fill_color by finding the most frequent color excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
  - action: iterate_and_replace_contiguous
    target: target_pixels (white) in row R
    start_column: C-1 (column immediately left of marker)
    direction: Leftwards (decrementing column index)
    condition_iterate: Current pixel column >= 0 AND current pixel color is white (0).
    condition_stop: Current pixel column < 0 OR current pixel color is not white (0).
    replacement: fill_color
    purpose: Modify only the contiguous block of white pixels left of the marker.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Marker**: Scan the input grid to find the location (row `R`, column `C`) of the single maroon (9) pixel. If no marker is found, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  **Determine the Fill Color**: Count the occurrences of each color in the entire input grid. Identify the color that appears most frequently, ignoring any counts for white (0) and maroon (9). This most frequent color is the `fill_color`. If only white and maroon pixels exist, the behavior for determining fill color is undefined by examples, but likely results in no change or uses a default (though this scenario seems unlikely based on examples).
3.  **Modify the Grid Contiguously**: Starting from the pixel immediately to the left of the marker (row `R`, column `C-1`), proceed leftwards (decrementing the column index).
4.  **Apply Transformation**: For each pixel visited in step 3:
    *   If the current column index is valid (>= 0) AND the pixel's color is white (0), change its color to the `fill_color`.
    *   If the current column index is invalid (< 0) OR the pixel's color is NOT white (0), stop the modification process for this row.
5.  **Output**: The resulting grid, with the specified contiguous block of white pixels changed, is the output. All other pixels remain unchanged.
