## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components: locating a marker (maroon/9), determining a fill color (most frequent non-white/non-maroon), and applying it to white pixels (0) in the marker's row. However, the execution results revealed an inaccuracy in the transformation rule, specifically regarding *which* white pixels are modified.

**Example 3 Failure Analysis:** The code incorrectly filled *all* white pixels to the left of the marker in the designated row. The expected output shows that only the contiguous block of white pixels immediately preceding the marker should be filled. The leading white pixels at the beginning of the row remained unchanged.

**Refinement Strategy:**

1.  **Revise Transformation Logic:** The core logic needs refinement. Instead of filling all white pixels from the start of the row up to the marker, the process should start from the column immediately to the left of the marker (`marker_col - 1`) and proceed leftwards.
2.  **Introduce Contiguity Condition:** The filling should only continue as long as the pixels encountered (while moving leftwards) are white (0). The process stops upon encountering the first non-white pixel or reaching the beginning of the row (column 0).
3.  **Update Documentation:** Both the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program must be updated to reflect this revised understanding of contiguity.

## Metrics and Observations

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Marker Location:** Consistently found in each input.
*   **Fill Color:** Correctly determined as the most frequent non-white/non-maroon color (4, 8, 6 respectively).
*   **Changed Pixels:** The `changed_indices` confirm which white pixels in the marker row were modified.
*   **Contiguity:** The `contiguous_change_matches_expectation` is `True` for all examples. This confirms the refined hypothesis: the transformation fills the contiguous block of white pixels immediately to the left of the maroon marker. The `expected_contiguous_indices` calculated by the analysis script match the `changed_indices` observed in the output grids.

*Correction Note:* The analysis for Example 3 used the input/output data provided in the initial problem description (reshaped to 4x5). The code correctly identifies the fill color (6), marker position (row 3, col 2), and determines that the contiguous white pixels to the left are at indices 0 and 1. It confirms that these are indeed the pixels changed in the provided output. This validates the contiguity rule.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Marker**: Scan the input grid to find the location (row `R`, column `C`) of the single maroon (9) pixel. If no marker is found, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  **Determine the Fill Color**: Count the occurrences of each color in the entire input grid. Identify the color that appears most frequently, ignoring any counts for white (0) and maroon (9). This most frequent color is the `fill_color`. If only white and maroon pixels exist, the behavior for determining fill color is undefined by examples, but likely results in no change or uses a default (though this scenario seems unlikely based on examples).
3.  **Modify the Grid Contiguously**: Starting from the pixel immediately to the left of the marker (row `R`, column `C-1`), proceed leftwards (decrementing the column index).
4.  **Apply Transformation**: For each pixel visited in step 3:
    *   If the current column index is valid (>= 0) AND the pixel's color is white (0), change its color to the `fill_color`.
    *   If the current column index is invalid (< 0) OR the pixel's color is NOT white (0), stop the modification process for this row.
5.  **Output**: The resulting grid, with the specified contiguous block of white pixels changed, is the output. All other pixels remain unchanged.
