task_description: "Fill the contiguous block of white pixels immediately to the left of a specific marker pixel (maroon/9), within the same row, using a contextually determined fill color."
grid_properties:
  - type: rectangular
  - variable_size: true # Implied by ARC standard, confirmed by shape differences if any
  - color_palette: 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
objects:
  - object: marker_pixel
    color: 9 (maroon)
    count: 1 per grid
    role: Reference point for transformation location (row R, column C).
  - object: target_pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Pixels potentially modified by the transformation.
    location: Must be in row R, at columns < C.
    condition: Must form a contiguous horizontal segment ending at column C-1.
  - object: fill_color_source
    color: Variable (e.g., 4, 8, 6 in examples)
    role: Determines the color used for filling.
    derivation: Most frequent color in the input grid, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The target_pixels (white) must be in the same row as the marker_pixel (maroon).
  - type: spatial
    description: The target_pixels (white) must form a single, contiguous horizontal block immediately to the left of the marker_pixel.
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker_pixel (maroon/9)
    purpose: Find its row (R) and column (C) index.
  - action: analyze
    target: entire input grid
    purpose: Determine the fill_color by finding the most frequent color excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
  - action: iterate_and_replace_contiguous
    target: target_pixels (white) in row R
    start_column: C-1 (column immediately left of marker)
    direction: Leftwards (decrementing column index)
    condition_iterate: Current pixel column >= 0 AND current pixel color is white (0).
    condition_stop: Current pixel column < 0 OR current pixel color is not white (0).
    replacement: fill_color
    purpose: Modify only the contiguous block of white pixels left of the marker.
