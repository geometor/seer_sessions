            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: locating a marker (maroon/9), determining a fill color (most frequent non-white/non-maroon), and applying it to white pixels (0) in the marker's row. However, the execution results revealed an inaccuracy in the transformation rule, specifically regarding *which* white pixels are modified.\n\n**Example 3 Failure Analysis:** The code incorrectly filled *all* white pixels to the left of the marker in the designated row. The expected output shows that only the contiguous block of white pixels immediately preceding the marker should be filled. The leading white pixels at the beginning of the row remained unchanged.\n\n**Refinement Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Revise Transformation Logic:** The core logic needs refinement. Instead of filling all white pixels from the start of the row up to the marker, the process should start from the column immediately to the left of the marker (`marker_col - 1`) and proceed leftwards.\n2.  **Introduce Contiguity Condition:** The filling should only continue as long as the pixels encountered (while moving leftwards) are white (0). The process stops upon encountering the first non-white pixel or reaching the beginning of the row (column 0).\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Both the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program must be updated to reflect this revised understanding of contiguity.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nLet's gather specific details for each example to confirm the revised hypothesis.\n"

This confirms the refined hypothesis: the transformation fills the contiguous block of white pixels immediately to the left of the maroon marker. The `expected_contiguous_indices` calculated by the analysis script match the `changed_indices` observed in the output grids.\n\n*Correction Note:* The analysis for Example 3 used the input/output data provided in the initial problem description (reshaped to 4x5). The code correctly identifies the fill color (6), marker position (row 3, col 2), and determines that the contiguous white pixels to the left are at indices 0 and 1.
