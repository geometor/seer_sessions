Transformation Rule:
1. Scan the input sequence of pixels to find the unique magenta pixel (color 6).
2. Identify the contiguous sequence of white pixels (color 0) that immediately precedes the magenta pixel.
3. Determine the color of the pixel that immediately precedes this sequence of white pixels. This is the "fill color".
4. Change the color of all pixels in the identified white sequence to the "fill color".
5. Keep all other pixels (the magenta pixel, pixels after it, and pixels before the fill color pixel) unchanged.
6. Output the modified sequence.
