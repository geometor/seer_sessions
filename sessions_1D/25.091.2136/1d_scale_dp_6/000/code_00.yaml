elements:
  - object: marker_pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    quantity: 1
    role: Identifies the location for the transformation.
  - object: gap_pixels
    color: white (0)
    quantity: variable (2 or 3 in examples)
    property: Forms a contiguous sequence.
    location: Immediately precedes the marker_pixel in the sequence.
    role: Represents the area to be modified.
  - object: fill_color_pixel
    color: variable (red 2, gray 5, azure 8 in examples)
    quantity: 1
    location: Immediately precedes the sequence of gap_pixels.
    role: Provides the color value used to fill the gap.
  - object: other_pixels
    color: any
    role: Pixels not part of the marker, gap, or fill_color sequence remain unchanged.

actions:
  - name: locate_marker
    input: input sequence
    output: index of the magenta (6) pixel.
  - name: identify_gap
    input: input sequence, index of marker_pixel
    output: indices of the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels immediately preceding the marker_pixel.
  - name: determine_fill_color
    input: input sequence, indices of the gap_pixels
    output: color of the pixel immediately preceding the first gap_pixel.
  - name: fill_gap
    input: input sequence, indices of gap_pixels, fill_color
    output: modified sequence where gap_pixels are changed to the fill_color.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The fill_color_pixel is immediately before the first gap_pixel.
  - type: adjacency
    description: The sequence of gap_pixels is immediately before the marker_pixel.
  - type: sequence
    description: The transformation operates based on the linear order of pixels.
