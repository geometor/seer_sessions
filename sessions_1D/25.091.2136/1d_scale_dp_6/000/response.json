            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n## Perception of the Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The examples present sequences of colored pixels. While ARC tasks typically involve 2D grids, these examples can be interpreted as 1D sequences or single rows/columns. The transformation appears to operate sequentially along this 1D structure.\n2.  **Key Colors:**\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Acts as a marker or trigger point in the sequence. There is exactly one magenta pixel in each example.\n    *   **White (0):** Represents \"empty\" space or gaps that are candidates for being filled. Sequences of white pixels appear immediately before the magenta pixel.\n    *   **Other Colors (Red 2, Gray 5, Azure 8):** These act as the \"fill colors\". The specific fill color is determined by the pixel immediately preceding the sequence of white pixels that are adjacent to the magenta pixel.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the magenta pixel, looking immediately backward in the sequence to find a contiguous block of white pixels, and then changing the color of these white pixels to match the color of the pixel that comes just before the white block. The magenta pixel itself and any pixels after it remain unchanged. The pixels before the \"fill color\" pixel also remain unchanged. Essentially, a gap (white pixels) just before the magenta marker is filled with the color that borders the gap on the left.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
