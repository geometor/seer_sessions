Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

## Perception of the Elements

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The examples present sequences of colored pixels. While ARC tasks typically involve 2D grids, these examples can be interpreted as 1D sequences or single rows/columns. The transformation appears to operate sequentially along this 1D structure.
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   **Magenta (6):** Acts as a marker or trigger point in the sequence. There is exactly one magenta pixel in each example.
    *   **White (0):** Represents "empty" space or gaps that are candidates for being filled. Sequences of white pixels appear immediately before the magenta pixel.
    *   **Other Colors (Red 2, Gray 5, Azure 8):** These act as the "fill colors". The specific fill color is determined by the pixel immediately preceding the sequence of white pixels that are adjacent to the magenta pixel.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the magenta pixel, looking immediately backward in the sequence to find a contiguous block of white pixels, and then changing the color of these white pixels to match the color of the pixel that comes just before the white block. The magenta pixel itself and any pixels after it remain unchanged. The pixels before the "fill color" pixel also remain unchanged. Essentially, a gap (white pixels) just before the magenta marker is filled with the color that borders the gap on the left.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - object: marker_pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    quantity: 1
    role: Identifies the location for the transformation.
  - object: gap_pixels
    color: white (0)
    quantity: variable (2 or 3 in examples)
    property: Forms a contiguous sequence.
    location: Immediately precedes the marker_pixel in the sequence.
    role: Represents the area to be modified.
  - object: fill_color_pixel
    color: variable (red 2, gray 5, azure 8 in examples)
    quantity: 1
    location: Immediately precedes the sequence of gap_pixels.
    role: Provides the color value used to fill the gap.
  - object: other_pixels
    color: any
    role: Pixels not part of the marker, gap, or fill_color sequence remain unchanged.

actions:
  - name: locate_marker
    input: input sequence
    output: index of the magenta (6) pixel.
  - name: identify_gap
    input: input sequence, index of marker_pixel
    output: indices of the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels immediately preceding the marker_pixel.
  - name: determine_fill_color
    input: input sequence, indices of the gap_pixels
    output: color of the pixel immediately preceding the first gap_pixel.
  - name: fill_gap
    input: input sequence, indices of gap_pixels, fill_color
    output: modified sequence where gap_pixels are changed to the fill_color.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The fill_color_pixel is immediately before the first gap_pixel.
  - type: adjacency
    description: The sequence of gap_pixels is immediately before the marker_pixel.
  - type: sequence
    description: The transformation operates based on the linear order of pixels.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input sequence of pixels to find the unique magenta pixel (color 6).
2.  Identify the contiguous sequence of white pixels (color 0) that immediately precedes the magenta pixel.
3.  Determine the color of the pixel that immediately precedes this sequence of white pixels. This is the "fill color".
4.  Change the color of all pixels in the identified white sequence to the "fill color".
5.  Keep all other pixels (the magenta pixel, pixels after it, and pixels before the fill color pixel) unchanged.
6.  Output the modified sequence.
