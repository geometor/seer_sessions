task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and a marker pixel.
elements:
  - object: color_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal segment of pixels with a uniform color, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., green, gray, blue).
      - start_index: The starting column index of the block.
      - end_index: The ending column index of the block.
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9).
      - index: The column index of the pixel.
  - object: gap_pixels
    description: Pixels located spatially between the color_block and the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: Typically white (0) in the input examples.
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The color_block and marker_pixel are separated by gap_pixels along the horizontal axis. In the examples, the marker_pixel is always to the right of the color_block.
action:
  - name: fill_gap
    description: Change the color of the gap_pixels (if they are white) to match the color of the color_block.
    conditions:
      - The gap_pixels must be white (0).
    target: gap_pixels
    effect: Modifies the color of the target pixels.
input_output_mapping:
  - input: Contains a color_block, a marker_pixel, and potentially white gap_pixels between them.
  - output: The color_block is extended towards the marker_pixel by changing the color of the white gap_pixels to match the color_block's color. The extension stops adjacent to the marker_pixel.
assumptions:
  - Each input grid is a single row.
  - There is exactly one color_block (non-white, non-maroon).
  - There is exactly one marker_pixel (maroon).
  - The pixels between the color_block and the marker_pixel to be filled are always white (0).
