Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single rows (1D grids).
*   **Colors:** The significant colors are white (0), maroon (9), and one other color per example (green (3), gray (5), blue (1)).
*   **Objects:**
    *   A contiguous horizontal block of a non-white, non-maroon color.
    *   A single maroon (9) pixel.
    *   Background white (0) pixels.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extending the non-white, non-maroon colored block. The extension fills in the white pixels between the original block and the maroon pixel. The direction of extension seems determined by the relative position of the block and the maroon pixel (in these examples, the block extends rightward towards the maroon pixel).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and a marker pixel.
elements:
  - object: color_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal segment of pixels with a uniform color, excluding white (0) and maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., green, gray, blue).
      - start_index: The starting column index of the block.
      - end_index: The ending column index of the block.
  - object: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9).
      - index: The column index of the pixel.
  - object: gap_pixels
    description: Pixels located spatially between the color_block and the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: Typically white (0) in the input examples.
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The color_block and marker_pixel are separated by gap_pixels along the horizontal axis. In the examples, the marker_pixel is always to the right of the color_block.
action:
  - name: fill_gap
    description: Change the color of the gap_pixels (if they are white) to match the color of the color_block.
    conditions:
      - The gap_pixels must be white (0).
    target: gap_pixels
    effect: Modifies the color of the target pixels.
input_output_mapping:
  - input: Contains a color_block, a marker_pixel, and potentially white gap_pixels between them.
  - output: The color_block is extended towards the marker_pixel by changing the color of the white gap_pixels to match the color_block's color. The extension stops adjacent to the marker_pixel.
assumptions:
  - Each input grid is a single row.
  - There is exactly one color_block (non-white, non-maroon).
  - There is exactly one marker_pixel (maroon).
  - The pixels between the color_block and the marker_pixel to be filled are always white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input row to find the contiguous block of pixels that are neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record the color (`C`) and the start and end indices of this block.
2.  Scan the input row to find the index of the maroon (9) pixel (`maroon_index`).
3.  Determine the range of indices between the colored block and the maroon pixel.
    *   If the maroon pixel is to the right of the block (i.e., `maroon_index` > end index of the block), the range is from the index immediately after the block's end up to (but not including) `maroon_index`.
    *   If the maroon pixel is to the left of the block (i.e., `maroon_index` < start index of the block), the range is from the index immediately after `maroon_index` up to (but not including) the block's start index.
4.  Iterate through the indices identified in the range from step 3.
5.  For each index in the range, if the pixel at that index in the input row is white (0), change its color to the color `C` recorded in step 1.
6.  Leave all other pixels unchanged. The resulting row is the output.
