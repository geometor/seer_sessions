            "text": "*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming a 1D sequence of colored pixels. The transformation seems to operate like a \"fill\" or \"paint\" operation. White pixels (color 0) are changed based on the color of a preceding pixel, but this filling process stops once a magenta pixel (color 6) is encountered. The magenta pixel acts as a boundary.\n\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   The input and output grids appear to be processed linearly, likely as a 1D array or a single row/column.\n    *   There's a state maintained during processing: the \"current fill color\". This color is updated whenever a non-white, non-magenta pixel is encountered.\n    *   Another state is whether the magenta boundary has been passed.\n    *   White pixels encountered *before* the magenta boundary are changed to the `current_fill_color`.\n    *   White pixels encountered *after* the magenta boundary, or at the very beginning before any non-white/non-magenta color is seen, remain white.\n    *   All non-white pixels remain unchanged in the output, except for their role in potentially setting the `current_fill_color` or acting as the boundary (magenta).\n\n"

Can also be the initial fill color if the sequence starts with white.\n          - Magenta (6): Acts as a terminal boundary for the fill operation. Remains unchanged.\n          - Other Colors (1, 2, 7, etc.): Act as \"source\" colors for filling. They update the fill color state when encountered before the boundary. Remain unchanged.\n  - State_Variables:\n      - current_fill_color: Stores the color to be used for filling white pixels. Initialized to white (0). Updated by non-white, non-magenta pixels encountered before the boundary.\n      - magenta_boundary_reached: Boolean flag, initially false. Set to true when the first magenta pixel is encountered.\n  - Transformation_Rule:\n      - Iterate through pixels linearly.\n      - If the magenta boundary has been reached, copy the pixel unchanged.\n      - If the current pixel is magenta, set the boundary flag to true and copy the pixel unchanged.\n      - If the boundary has not been reached:\n          - If the pixel is white (0), change it to the `current_fill_color`.\n          - If the pixel is non-white and non-magenta, update `current_fill_color` to this pixel's color and copy the pixel unchanged.\n  - Input_Output_Relationship: White pixels before the first magenta pixel are replaced by the color of the nearest preceding non-white, non-magenta pixel. Pixels after the magenta pixel, the magenta pixel itself, and the source color pixels are unchanged. Initial white pixels remain white.\n```"
