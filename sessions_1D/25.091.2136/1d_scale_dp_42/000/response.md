*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming a 1D sequence of colored pixels. The transformation seems to operate like a "fill" or "paint" operation. White pixels (color 0) are changed based on the color of a preceding pixel, but this filling process stops once a magenta pixel (color 6) is encountered. The magenta pixel acts as a boundary.

*   **Analysis**:
    *   The input and output grids appear to be processed linearly, likely as a 1D array or a single row/column.
    *   There's a state maintained during processing: the "current fill color". This color is updated whenever a non-white, non-magenta pixel is encountered.
    *   Another state is whether the magenta boundary has been passed.
    *   White pixels encountered *before* the magenta boundary are changed to the `current_fill_color`.
    *   White pixels encountered *after* the magenta boundary, or at the very beginning before any non-white/non-magenta color is seen, remain white.
    *   All non-white pixels remain unchanged in the output, except for their role in potentially setting the `current_fill_color` or acting as the boundary (magenta).


```yaml
Facts:
  - Task: Fill white pixels based on preceding color, bounded by magenta.
  - Grid_Processing: Linear scan (e.g., left-to-right).
  - Objects:
      - Pixels: Basic units with a color attribute.
      - Colors:
          - White (0): Target for filling. Can also be the initial fill color if the sequence starts with white.
          - Magenta (6): Acts as a terminal boundary for the fill operation. Remains unchanged.
          - Other Colors (1, 2, 7, etc.): Act as "source" colors for filling. They update the fill color state when encountered before the boundary. Remain unchanged.
  - State_Variables:
      - current_fill_color: Stores the color to be used for filling white pixels. Initialized to white (0). Updated by non-white, non-magenta pixels encountered before the boundary.
      - magenta_boundary_reached: Boolean flag, initially false. Set to true when the first magenta pixel is encountered.
  - Transformation_Rule:
      - Iterate through pixels linearly.
      - If the magenta boundary has been reached, copy the pixel unchanged.
      - If the current pixel is magenta, set the boundary flag to true and copy the pixel unchanged.
      - If the boundary has not been reached:
          - If the pixel is white (0), change it to the `current_fill_color`.
          - If the pixel is non-white and non-magenta, update `current_fill_color` to this pixel's color and copy the pixel unchanged.
  - Input_Output_Relationship: White pixels before the first magenta pixel are replaced by the color of the nearest preceding non-white, non-magenta pixel. Pixels after the magenta pixel, the magenta pixel itself, and the source color pixels are unchanged. Initial white pixels remain white.

```plaintext
Natural Language Program:

1.  Initialize a state variable `current_fill_color` to white (0).
2.  Initialize a state flag `magenta_seen` to false.
3.  Create a new grid identical to the input grid to store the results.
4.  Iterate through the pixels of the input grid in their sequence order (e.g., left to right).
5.  For each pixel:
    a.  Check if the pixel color is magenta (6). If it is, set the `magenta_seen` flag to true. Do not modify this pixel in the result grid.
    b.  If the `magenta_seen` flag is true, do not modify the current pixel in the result grid and proceed to the next pixel.
    c.  If the `magenta_seen` flag is false:
        i.  Check if the pixel color is white (0). If it is, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the result grid to the value of `current_fill_color`.
        ii. Check if the pixel color is neither white (0) nor magenta (6). If it is, update the `current_fill_color` state variable to this pixel's color. Do not modify this pixel in the result grid.
6.  Return the modified result grid.
