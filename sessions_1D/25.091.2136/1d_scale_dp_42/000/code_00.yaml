Facts:
  - Task: Fill white pixels based on preceding color, bounded by magenta.
  - Grid_Processing: Linear scan (e.g., left-to-right).
  - Objects:
      - Pixels: Basic units with a color attribute.
      - Colors:
          - White (0): Target for filling. Can also be the initial fill color if the sequence starts with white.
          - Magenta (6): Acts as a terminal boundary for the fill operation. Remains unchanged.
          - Other Colors (1, 2, 7, etc.): Act as "source" colors for filling. They update the fill color state when encountered before the boundary. Remain unchanged.
  - State_Variables:
      - current_fill_color: Stores the color to be used for filling white pixels. Initialized to white (0). Updated by non-white, non-magenta pixels encountered before the boundary.
      - magenta_boundary_reached: Boolean flag, initially false. Set to true when the first magenta pixel is encountered.
  - Transformation_Rule:
      - Iterate through pixels linearly.
      - If the magenta boundary has been reached, copy the pixel unchanged.
      - If the current pixel is magenta, set the boundary flag to true and copy the pixel unchanged.
      - If the boundary has not been reached:
          - If the pixel is white (0), change it to the `current_fill_color`.
          - If the pixel is non-white and non-magenta, update `current_fill_color` to this pixel's color and copy the pixel unchanged.
  - Input_Output_Relationship: White pixels before the first magenta pixel are replaced by the color of the nearest preceding non-white, non-magenta pixel. Pixels after the magenta pixel, the magenta pixel itself, and the source color pixels are unchanged. Initial white pixels remain white.
