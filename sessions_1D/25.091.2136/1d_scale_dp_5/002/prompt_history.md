Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs are presented as 1D sequences (arrays) of integers, representing colors.
2.  **Key Objects:**
    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white, non-gray color (e.g., red, green, yellow).
    *   A single gray pixel (color 5).
    *   White pixels (color 0) act as background or spacing.
3.  **Relationship:** In all examples, the gray pixel appears to the right of (at a higher index than) the colored block. There are usually some white pixels separating the colored block and the gray pixel.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the colored block "expanding" or "growing" towards the gray pixel. Specifically, the white pixels located between the end of the colored block and the gray pixel are changed to match the color of the block. The positions of the original colored block and the gray pixel remain unchanged, as do any pixels outside this "expansion zone".

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and a gray pixel with the block's color.

elements:
  - object: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels with a color other than white (0) or gray (5).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., red, green, yellow).
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel of the block.
      - end_index: The index of the last pixel of the block.
  - object: gray_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color gray (5).
    properties:
      - index: The position of the gray pixel in the sequence.
  - object: white_space
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      - location: Can be anywhere, but specifically relevant when located between the colored_block and the gray_pixel.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The gray_pixel is always located at a higher index than the end_index of the colored_block.
  - type: spatial
    description: There may be white_space pixels between the colored_block and the gray_pixel.

actions:
  - action: fill_gap
    actor: colored_block
    target: white_space
    condition: The white_space pixels are located between the end_index of the colored_block and the index of the gray_pixel.
    effect: Change the color of the targeted white_space pixels to the color of the colored_block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-gray colored pixels. Determine its color (let's call it `block_color`) and the index of its last pixel (`end_index`).
2.  Identify the index of the gray pixel (`gray_index`).
3.  Iterate through the indices from `end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `gray_index`.
4.  For each pixel at these intermediate indices, if the pixel's color is white (0), change its color to `block_color`.
5.  Leave all other pixels (the original colored block, the gray pixel, and any pixels outside the range defined in step 3) unchanged.
6.  Return the modified sequence.

import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the contiguous block of a single non-white (0), non-gray (5) color. Record its color and the index of its last pixel.
2. Identify the index of the single gray (5) pixel.
3. Fill the gap between the end of the colored block and the gray pixel with the block's color. Specifically, change any white (0) pixels located at indices strictly greater than the block's end index and strictly less than the gray pixel's index to the block's color.
