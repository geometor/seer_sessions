task_description: In a single-row grid, fill the horizontal gap between a colored block and a subsequent gray pixel with the block's color.

grid_properties:
  - property: shape
    value: [1, N] # Always a single row grid of variable width N.

elements:
  - object: colored_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of identical pixels within the row, with a color other than white (0) or gray (5). Assumed to be unique or the first encountered one from the left.
    properties:
      - color: The integer color value of the pixels in the block (e.g., 2, 3, 4).
      - start_col: The column index of the first pixel of the block.
      - end_col: The column index of the last pixel of the block.
  - object: gray_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color gray (5). Assumed to be unique or the first encountered one.
    properties:
      - col: The column index of the gray pixel.
  - object: gap_pixels
    description: Pixels located horizontally between the colored_block and the gray_pixel.
    properties:
      - start_col: block_end_col + 1
      - end_col: gray_col - 1
      - initial_color: Can be any color, but typically white (0) in the examples.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The gray_pixel is always located in a column with a higher index than the end_col of the colored_block (gray_col > block_end_col).
  - type: contiguity
    description: The gap_pixels occupy all columns strictly between the colored_block's end and the gray_pixel's column.

actions:
  - action: fill_gap
    actor: colored_block
    target: gap_pixels
    condition: A colored_block and a gray_pixel exist, with gray_col > block_end_col.
    effect: Change the color of all gap_pixels (from column block_end_col + 1 up to gray_col - 1) to the color of the colored_block.
