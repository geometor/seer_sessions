task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and a gray pixel with the block's color.

elements:
  - object: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels with a color other than white (0) or gray (5).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., red, green, yellow).
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel of the block.
      - end_index: The index of the last pixel of the block.
  - object: gray_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color gray (5).
    properties:
      - index: The position of the gray pixel in the sequence.
  - object: white_space
    description: Pixels with the color white (0).
    properties:
      - location: Can be anywhere, but specifically relevant when located between the colored_block and the gray_pixel.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The gray_pixel is always located at a higher index than the end_index of the colored_block.
  - type: spatial
    description: There may be white_space pixels between the colored_block and the gray_pixel.

actions:
  - action: fill_gap
    actor: colored_block
    target: white_space
    condition: The white_space pixels are located between the end_index of the colored_block and the index of the gray_pixel.
    effect: Change the color of the targeted white_space pixels to the color of the colored_block.
