There are usually some white pixels separating the colored block and the gray pixel.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the colored block \"expanding\" or \"growing\" towards the gray pixel. Specifically, the white pixels located between the end of the colored block and the gray pixel are changed to match the color of the block. The positions of the original colored block and the gray pixel remain unchanged, as do any pixels outside this \"expansion zone\".\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine its color (let's call it `block_color`) and the index of its last pixel (`end_index`).\n2.  Identify the index of the gray pixel (`gray_index`).\n3.  Iterate through the indices from `end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `gray_index`.\n4.  For each pixel at these intermediate indices, if the pixel's color is white (0), change its color to `block_color`.\n5.  Leave all other pixels (the original colored block, the gray pixel, and any pixels outside the range defined in step 3) unchanged.\n6.  Return the modified sequence."
