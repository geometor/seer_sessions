**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single rows (1D arrays) of pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Key Colors:** The primary colors involved are White (0), Green (3), and one other non-white color per example (Red=2, Yellow=4, Azure=8).
3.  **Structure:** Each input row contains a contiguous block of a specific color (let's call it the 'source color'), followed by one or more White pixels, and then a single Green pixel. There might be leading or trailing White pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the White pixels located *between* the source color block and the Green pixel. These White pixels are replaced with the source color. This effectively extends the source color block until it becomes adjacent to the Green pixel.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single Green pixel (color 3) in the input row. Let its index be `green_index`.
2.  Scan the row from left to right, stopping just before `green_index`. Find the rightmost pixel that is *not* White (color 0). Let its index be `block_end_index` and its color be `source_color`.
3.  Iterate through the pixels from index `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `green_index`.
4.  For each pixel in this range, change its color to `source_color`.
5.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.

**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code aims to implement the logic described in the initial analysis: find a colored block, find a green pixel to its right, and fill the white gap between them with the block's color. However, the execution results show that the code consistently failed to modify the input grid, returning the original input instead of the expected output for all training examples.

My trace of the provided code suggests it *should* produce the correct output. The discrepancy indicates either:
1.  The code executed was different from the code presented in the history.
2.  There was an issue in the execution environment or the reporting of results.
3.  There is a subtle flaw in the provided code's logic or interaction with NumPy that isn't immediately apparent from static analysis.

Given the instruction to proceed based on the reported results, I must assume the code *is* flawed, even if the bug isn't obvious. The strategy is to refine the understanding and description of the process, ensuring the core logic is clearly stated, while acknowledging the unexplained failure. The core logic (identify block, identify green marker, identify gap, fill gap) appears sound and directly supported by the visual transformation in the examples. No alternative transformation logic seems plausible from the data.

**Metrics:**

Based on the inputs and expected outputs:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]`
    *   Expected Output: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]`
    *   Green Pixel (3) Index: 8
    *   Rightmost non-white pixel before green: Index 5 (Color 2)
    *   Gap Indices (White pixels between index 5 and 8): 6, 7
    *   Action: Change pixels at indices 6 and 7 to Color 2.
    *   Reported Result: Failed (Output identical to input), 2 pixels incorrect.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3]`
    *   Expected Output: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3]`
    *   Green Pixel (3) Index: 9
    *   Rightmost non-white pixel before green: Index 5 (Color 4)
    *   Gap Indices (White pixels between index 5 and 9): 6, 7, 8
    *   Action: Change pixels at indices 6, 7, 8 to Color 4.
    *   Reported Result: Failed (Output identical to input), 3 pixels incorrect.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]`
    *   Expected Output: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0]`
    *   Green Pixel (3) Index: 8
    *   Rightmost non-white pixel before green: Index 3 (Color 8)
    *   Gap Indices (White pixels between index 3 and 8): 4, 5, 6, 7
    *   Action: Change pixels at indices 4, 5, 6, 7 to Color 8.
    *   Reported Result: Failed (Output identical to input), 4 pixels incorrect.

The pattern of failure is consistent: the gap identified by the logic was not filled in the output reported by the execution environment.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
2.  Locate the index of the Green pixel (color 3) in the row. If no Green pixel exists, return the copied row unchanged. Let this index be `green_index`.
3.  Scan the row from right to left, starting at the index immediately before the Green pixel (`green_index - 1`) down to the beginning of the row (index 0).
4.  Find the first pixel encountered during this scan that is *not* White (color 0). Let its index be `source_index` and its color be `source_color`.
5.  If no non-White pixel is found to the left of the Green pixel (`source_index` remains unfound), or if the found non-White pixel is immediately adjacent to the Green pixel (`source_index == green_index - 1`), return the copied row unchanged.
6.  Iterate through the indices `i` starting from `source_index + 1` up to (but not including) `green_index`.
7.  For each index `i` in this range, check if the pixel in the copied row at `output_row[i]` is White (color 0).
8.  If `output_row[i]` is White (0), change its color to `source_color`.
9.  Return the modified output row.
