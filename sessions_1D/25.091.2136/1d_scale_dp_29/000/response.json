There might be leading or trailing White pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the White pixels located *between* the source color block and the Green pixel. These White pixels are replaced with the source color. This effectively extends the source color block until it becomes adjacent to the Green pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
