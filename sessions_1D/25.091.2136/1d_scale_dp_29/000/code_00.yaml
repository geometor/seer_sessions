task_description: Fill the gap of white pixels between a colored block and a green pixel using the color of the block.

elements:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D (row)
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      - color: Integer (0-9)

objects:
  - id: source_block
    description: The first contiguous block of non-white, non-green pixels encountered when scanning from left to right.
    attributes:
      - color: C (varies per example, e.g., 2, 4, 8)
      - location: Typically starts near the left end.
  - id: green_marker
    description: A single pixel with the color Green (3).
    attributes:
      - color: 3
      - location: Always present, located to the right of the source_block.
  - id: gap
    description: A sequence of one or more White (0) pixels.
    attributes:
      - color: 0
      - location: Situated immediately between the right end of the source_block and the green_marker.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_block, gap, and green_marker appear in that order from left to right.
    entities: [source_block, gap, green_marker]

actions:
  - id: fill_gap
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the gap.
    inputs:
      - gap
      - source_block.color
    outputs:
      - Modified grid where gap pixels now have the source_block's color.

goal: Extend the source_block horizontally to the right until it is adjacent to the green_marker by filling the intervening white gap with the source_block's color.
