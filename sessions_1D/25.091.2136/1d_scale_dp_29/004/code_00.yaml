task_description: Fill the contiguous sequence of white pixels located between the rightmost non-white/non-green pixel and the first green pixel to its right, using the color of that non-white pixel.

elements:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D (row)
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      - color: Integer (0-9), representing white, green, or a source color.

objects:
  - id: green_marker
    description: The first pixel with Green color (3) found when scanning the row.
    attributes:
      - color: 3
      - index: green_index
  - id: source_pixel
    description: The rightmost pixel to the left of the green_marker that is not White (0). Its color defines the fill color.
    attributes:
      - color: source_color (non-0, non-3)
      - index: source_index
  - id: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more White (0) pixels.
    attributes:
      - color: 0
      - location: Spans indices from source_index + 1 to green_index - 1.
      - condition: Must exist (i.e., green_index > source_index + 1).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_pixel is located to the left of the gap, and the gap is located to the left of the green_marker.
    entities: [source_pixel, gap, green_marker]
    constraints:
      - source_index < (source_index + 1)
      - (green_index - 1) < green_index
      - source_index < green_index

actions:
  - id: fill_gap_with_source_color
    description: Change the color of all White pixels within the gap to the source_color.
    inputs:
      - gap_indices: list of indices from source_index + 1 to green_index - 1
      - source_color: color of the source_pixel
    preconditions:
      - A green_marker exists.
      - A source_pixel exists to the left of the green_marker.
      - A gap exists between the source_pixel and green_marker (green_index > source_index + 1).
      - All pixels within the gap indices are initially White (0).
    outputs:
      - Modified grid where pixels at gap_indices now have source_color.

goal: Modify the input row by identifying the green_marker, finding the source_pixel to its left, and filling the intervening white gap with the source_color. If any conditions (existence of green, source, or gap; gap being white) are not met, the grid remains unchanged.
