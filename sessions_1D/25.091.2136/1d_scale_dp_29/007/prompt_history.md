**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single rows (1D arrays) of pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Key Colors:** The primary colors involved are White (0), Green (3), and one other non-white color per example (Red=2, Yellow=4, Azure=8).
3.  **Structure:** Each input row contains a contiguous block of a specific color (let's call it the 'source color'), followed by one or more White pixels, and then a single Green pixel. There might be leading or trailing White pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the White pixels located *between* the source color block and the Green pixel. These White pixels are replaced with the source color. This effectively extends the source color block until it becomes adjacent to the Green pixel.

**YAML Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single Green pixel (color 3) in the input row. Let its index be `green_index`.
2.  Scan the row from left to right, stopping just before `green_index`. Find the rightmost pixel that is *not* White (color 0). Let its index be `block_end_index` and its color be `source_color`.
3.  Iterate through the pixels from index `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `green_index`.
4.  For each pixel in this range, change its color to `source_color`.
5.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed on all training examples, consistently returning the input grid unmodified. The logical walkthrough of the code against the examples suggests the implemented algorithm *should* produce the correct output if the input is a 1D array. However, ARC grids are fundamentally 2D, even if they have only one row. The most likely cause of the failure is that the code treated the 1xN input grid as a 1D array, leading to incorrect index calculations (especially when using `np.where`). The strategy is to revise the logic to explicitly handle 1xN 2D grids, finding the green pixel's column index and the source pixel's column index within the single row (row 0).

**Metrics:**

Let's gather metrics assuming the inputs are 1xN grids.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap of white pixels between a colored object and a green pixel marker within a single row grid.

input_output_shape:
  dimensionality: 2D
  shape: Consistent 1xN for input and output within each example pair (e.g., 1x10).

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 1xN grid of pixels.
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      - color: Integer (0-9) representing White, Red, Green, Yellow, Azure, etc.

objects:
  - id: source_pixel
    description: The rightmost non-White pixel located to the left of the green_marker within the row.
    attributes:
      - color: C (varies per example, e.g., 2, 4, 8)
      - location: Column index `source_col` in row 0. Identified by scanning leftwards from `green_col - 1`.
  - id: green_marker
    description: A single pixel with the color Green (3). Assumed unique within the row.
    attributes:
      - color: 3
      - location: Column index `green_col` in row 0.
  - id: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of White (0) pixels.
    attributes:
      - color: 0
      - location: Column indices strictly between `source_col` and `green_col` in row 0. The gap must contain at least one pixel (`green_col > source_col + 1`).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_pixel is located to the left of the green_marker. The gap exists between them.
    entities: [source_pixel, gap, green_marker]
    constraints:
      - source_pixel.column < gap.start_column
      - gap.end_column < green_marker.column

actions:
  - id: fill_gap
    description: Change the color of all White pixels within the identified gap to the color of the source_pixel.
    inputs:
      - gap pixels (identified by their location between source_pixel and green_marker)
      - source_pixel.color
    outputs:
      - Modified grid where gap pixels have their color changed. Non-white pixels within the gap range, if any, remain unchanged.

goal: Modify the input grid by locating the green_marker and the source_pixel, identifying the white gap between them, and filling this gap with the source_pixel's color. If no green_marker, no source_pixel, or no gap exists, the grid remains unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a 1xN grid (a single row).
2.  Identify the column index of the first (and assumed only) Green pixel (color 3) in the row. Let this be `green_col`. If no Green pixel exists, return the original grid.
3.  Scan the row leftwards starting from the column immediately to the left of the Green pixel (`green_col - 1`) down to column 0. Find the first pixel encountered that is *not* White (color 0). Let its column index be `source_col` and its color be `source_color`. If no such pixel is found before reaching the beginning of the row, return the original grid.
4.  Check if a gap exists between the source pixel and the Green pixel. A gap exists if `green_col` is greater than `source_col + 1`. If no gap exists (they are adjacent or the source wasn't found correctly), return the original grid.
5.  Iterate through the columns from `source_col + 1` up to (but not including) `green_col`.
6.  For each column index `i` in this range, check the color of the pixel at `(0, i)`. If the pixel's color is White (0), change its color to `source_color`.
7.  Return the modified grid.
