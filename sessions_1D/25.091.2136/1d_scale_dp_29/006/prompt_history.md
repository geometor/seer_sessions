**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single rows (1D arrays) of pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Key Colors:** The primary colors involved are White (0), Green (3), and one other non-white color per example (Red=2, Yellow=4, Azure=8).
3.  **Structure:** Each input row contains a contiguous block of a specific color (let's call it the 'source color'), followed by one or more White pixels, and then a single Green pixel. There might be leading or trailing White pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the White pixels located *between* the source color block and the Green pixel. These White pixels are replaced with the source color. This effectively extends the source color block until it becomes adjacent to the Green pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml

    outputs:
      - Modified grid where gap pixels now have the source_block's color.

goal: Extend the source_block horizontally to the right until it is adjacent to the green_marker by filling the intervening white gap with the source_block's color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single Green pixel (color 3) in the input row. Let its index be `green_index`.
2.  Scan the row from left to right, stopping just before `green_index`. Find the rightmost pixel that is *not* White (color 0). Let its index be `block_end_index` and its color be `source_color`.
3.  Iterate through the pixels from index `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `green_index`.
4.  For each pixel in this range, change its color to `source_color`.
5.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.
