task_description: Fill the gap of white pixels between a colored object and a green pixel marker within a single row grid.

input_output_shape:
  dimensionality: 2D
  shape: Consistent 1xN for input and output within each example pair (e.g., 1x10).

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 1xN grid of pixels.
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      - color: Integer (0-9) representing White, Red, Green, Yellow, Azure, etc.

objects:
  - id: source_pixel
    description: The rightmost non-White pixel located to the left of the green_marker within the row.
    attributes:
      - color: C (varies per example, e.g., 2, 4, 8)
      - location: Column index `source_col` in row 0. Identified by scanning leftwards from `green_col - 1`.
  - id: green_marker
    description: A single pixel with the color Green (3). Assumed unique within the row.
    attributes:
      - color: 3
      - location: Column index `green_col` in row 0.
  - id: gap
    description: A contiguous sequence of White (0) pixels.
    attributes:
      - color: 0
      - location: Column indices strictly between `source_col` and `green_col` in row 0. The gap must contain at least one pixel (`green_col > source_col + 1`).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_pixel is located to the left of the green_marker. The gap exists between them.
    entities: [source_pixel, gap, green_marker]
    constraints:
      - source_pixel.column < gap.start_column
      - gap.end_column < green_marker.column

actions:
  - id: fill_gap
    description: Change the color of all White pixels within the identified gap to the color of the source_pixel.
    inputs:
      - gap pixels (identified by their location between source_pixel and green_marker)
      - source_pixel.color
    outputs:
      - Modified grid where gap pixels have their color changed. Non-white pixels within the gap range, if any, remain unchanged.

goal: Modify the input grid by locating the green_marker and the source_pixel, identifying the white gap between them, and filling this gap with the source_pixel's color. If no green_marker, no source_pixel, or no gap exists, the grid remains unchanged.
