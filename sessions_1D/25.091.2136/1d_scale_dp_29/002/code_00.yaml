task_description: Fill the gap of white pixels between a colored block and a specific marker pixel using the color of the block.

elements:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1D (row)
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      - color: Integer (0-9)

objects:
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color Green (3).
    attributes:
      - color: 3
      - location: Unique index within the row. Required for transformation.
  - id: source_pixel
    description: The rightmost non-White (0) pixel located to the left of the marker_pixel. Its color defines the fill color.
    attributes:
      - color: C (where C is not 0, varies per example, e.g., 2, 4, 8)
      - location: Index `source_index` such that `source_index < marker_pixel.location`. Must exist for transformation.
  - id: gap
    description: A sequence of one or more White (0) pixels located strictly between the source_pixel and the marker_pixel.
    attributes:
      - color: 0
      - location: Indices `i` such that `source_pixel.location < i < marker_pixel.location`. All pixels in this range must be White (0).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_pixel, gap, and marker_pixel appear in that order from left to right, with the gap potentially being empty (if source_pixel is immediately adjacent to marker_pixel).
    entities: [source_pixel, gap, marker_pixel]

actions:
  - id: fill_gap
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the gap to match the color of the source_pixel.
    condition: A gap exists (i.e., `marker_pixel.location > source_pixel.location + 1`) and all pixels in the gap are White (0).
    inputs:
      - gap
      - source_pixel.color
    outputs:
      - Modified grid where gap pixels now have the source_pixel's color.

goal: Modify the input row such that the source_pixel's color extends rightward, replacing any intermediate White pixels, until it reaches the position immediately to the left of the marker_pixel.
