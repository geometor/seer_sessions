**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a single row (1D grid) of pixels. Each input grid contains three main elements:
1.  A background color, which is `white` (0).
2.  A contiguous horizontal segment of a non-`white`, non-`blue` color (the "fill color"). Examples use `red` (2), `orange` (7), and `magenta` (6).
3.  A single `blue` (1) pixel.

The transformation modifies the horizontal segment of the "fill color".

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid Structure:
  - Type: 1D Array (represented as 1xN grid)
  - Dimensions: Always 1x30 in the examples.

Objects:
  - Name: Fill Segment
    Description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels with the same color, which is not white (0) or blue (1).
    Properties:
      - Color: Variable (red, orange, magenta in examples).
      - Start Column: The index of the leftmost pixel of the segment.
      - End Column: The index of the rightmost pixel of the segment.
  - Name: Boundary Marker
    Description: A single pixel with the color blue (1).
    Properties:
      - Color: blue (1).
      - Position: A specific column index. Always located to the right of the Fill Segment in the examples.
  - Name: Background
    Description: Pixels with the color white (0).

Relationships:
  - The Boundary Marker (blue pixel) is always positioned to the right of the Fill Segment in the input grids.
  - The Boundary Marker defines the extent of the transformation action.

Actions/Transformation:
  - Identify: Locate the Fill Segment (its color, start column, end column) and the Boundary Marker (its column).
  - Extend: Modify the grid by changing the color of the pixels between the original end of the Fill Segment and the Boundary Marker.
  - Rule: The pixels starting from the column immediately after the Fill Segment's end column, up to (but not including) the column of the Boundary Marker, are changed to the color of the Fill Segment.
  - Preservation: The position and color of the Boundary Marker (blue pixel) remain unchanged. Pixels before the Fill Segment and after the Boundary Marker also remain unchanged (unless they are part of the extension).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid (which is a single row) to identify the contiguous segment of non-`white`, non-`blue` pixels (the "Fill Segment"). Record its color ("fill color") and the column index of its rightmost pixel ("end column").
2.  Scan the input grid to find the column index of the single `blue` pixel ("boundary column").
3.  Iterate through the columns starting from the column immediately after the "end column" (`end column + 1`) up to, but not including, the "boundary column".
4.  For each column in this range, change the pixel's color to the identified "fill color".
5.  Leave all other pixels (including the `blue` pixel) unchanged.
6.  Output the modified grid.
