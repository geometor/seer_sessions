Grid Structure:
  - Type: 1D Array (represented as 1xN grid)
  - Dimensions: Always 1x30 in the examples.

Objects:
  - Name: Fill Segment
    Description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels with the same color, which is not white (0) or blue (1).
    Properties:
      - Color: Variable (red, orange, magenta in examples).
      - Start Column: The index of the leftmost pixel of the segment.
      - End Column: The index of the rightmost pixel of the segment.
  - Name: Boundary Marker
    Description: A single pixel with the color blue (1).
    Properties:
      - Color: blue (1).
      - Position: A specific column index. Always located to the right of the Fill Segment in the examples.
  - Name: Background
    Description: Pixels with the color white (0).

Relationships:
  - The Boundary Marker (blue pixel) is always positioned to the right of the Fill Segment in the input grids.
  - The Boundary Marker defines the extent of the transformation action.

Actions/Transformation:
  - Identify: Locate the Fill Segment (its color, start column, end column) and the Boundary Marker (its column).
  - Extend: Modify the grid by changing the color of the pixels between the original end of the Fill Segment and the Boundary Marker.
  - Rule: The pixels starting from the column immediately after the Fill Segment's end column, up to (but not including) the column of the Boundary Marker, are changed to the color of the Fill Segment.
  - Preservation: The position and color of the Boundary Marker (blue pixel) remain unchanged. Pixels before the Fill Segment and after the Boundary Marker also remain unchanged (unless they are part of the extension).
