A background color, which is `white` (0).\n2.  A contiguous horizontal segment of a non-`white`, non-`blue` color (the \"fill color\"). Examples use `red` (2), `orange` (7), and `magenta` (6).\n3.  A single `blue` (1) pixel.\n\nThe transformation modifies the horizontal segment of the \"fill color\".\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Always located to the right of the Fill Segment in the examples.\n  - Name: Background\n    Description: Pixels with the color white (0).\n\nRelationships:\n  - The Boundary Marker (blue pixel) is always positioned to the right of the Fill Segment in the input grids.\n  - The Boundary Marker defines the extent of the transformation action.\n\nActions/Transformation:\n  - Identify: Locate the Fill Segment (its color, start column, end column) and the Boundary Marker (its column).\n  - Extend: Modify the grid by changing the color of the pixels between the original end of the Fill Segment and the Boundary Marker.\n  - Rule: The pixels starting from the column immediately after the Fill Segment's end column, up to (but not including) the column of the Boundary Marker, are changed to the color of the Fill Segment.\n  - Preservation: The position and color of the Boundary Marker (blue pixel) remain unchanged. Pixels before the Fill Segment and after the Boundary Marker also remain unchanged (unless they are part of the extension).\n```"
