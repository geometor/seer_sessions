transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: initial_block
    details: Find the first contiguous block of non-white color starting from the left. Note its color and its rightmost extent.
  - action: identify
    target: azure_marker
    details: Find the first occurrence of the azure (8) pixel to the right of the initial_block. Note its position.
  - action: identify
    target: fill_target
    details: Identify all white (0) pixels located between the rightmost extent of the initial_block and the position of the azure_marker.
  - action: modify_color
    target: fill_target
    details: Change the color of the identified white pixels to the color of the initial_block.
  - action: keep_unchanged
