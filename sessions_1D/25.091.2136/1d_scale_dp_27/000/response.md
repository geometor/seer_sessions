## Perception

The input and output are single rows (1D grids or vectors).
Each row contains a sequence of colors.
In all examples, there is an initial contiguous block of a single color (blue, orange, or red) starting from the left edge.
Further to the right, there is always an azure (8) pixel.
Between the initial block and the azure pixel, there are one or more white (0) pixels in the input.
In the output, these white pixels are replaced by the color of the initial block.
The initial block, the azure pixel, and any pixels to the right of the azure pixel remain unchanged.

transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: initial_block
    details: Find the first contiguous block of non-white color starting from the left. Note its color and its rightmost extent.
  - action: identify
    target: azure_marker
    details: Find the first occurrence of the azure (8) pixel to the right of the initial_block. Note its position.
  - action: identify
    target: fill_target
    details: Identify all white (0) pixels located between the rightmost extent of the initial_block and the position of the azure_marker.
  - action: modify_color
    target: fill_target
    details: Change the color of the identified white pixels to the color of the initial_block.
  - action: keep_unchanged
    target: all_other_pixels
    details: All pixels in the initial_block, the azure_marker itself, and any pixels to the right of the azure_marker retain their original color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the initial contiguous block of non-white color starting from the leftmost position in the input row. Record the color of this block (let's call it `fill_color`) and the index of its last pixel.
2.  Scan the row to the right of this initial block to find the index of the first occurrence of the azure (8) pixel.
3.  Iterate through the pixels between the end of the initial block (exclusive) and the position of the azure pixel (exclusive).
4.  If a pixel in this range is white (0), change its color to `fill_color`.
5.  Leave all other pixels (the initial block, the azure pixel, and any pixels to the right of the azure pixel) unchanged.
6.  The resulting row is the output.
