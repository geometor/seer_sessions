task_type: fill_segment
dimensionality: 1D

elements:
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: index in the array

objects:
  - object: segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - length
  - object: white_space
    description: A segment where the color is white (0).
  - object: colored_segment
    description: A segment where the color is non-white (1-9).
  - object: first_colored_segment
    description: The leftmost colored_segment in the array.
    properties:
      - fill_color: The color of this segment.
      - start_fill_boundary: The start_index of this segment.
  - object: boundary_pixel
    description: The rightmost non-white pixel in the array. In these examples, it is always yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - end_fill_boundary: The index of this pixel.

relationships:
  - relationship: spatial
    description: Describes the relative positions of segments and pixels.
    properties:
      - between: Identifies pixels located spatially between the start_fill_boundary and the end_fill_boundary.

actions:
  - action: find_boundaries
    description: Identify the start and end points for the filling operation.
    inputs:
      - input_array
    outputs:
      - fill_color: Color of the first non-white pixel from the left.
      - start_fill_boundary: Index of the first non-white pixel from the left.
      - end_fill_boundary: Index of the last non-white pixel from the right (specifically yellow/4 in these examples).
  - action: fill_between
    description: Change the color of specific white pixels.
    inputs:
      - input_array
      - fill_color
      - start_fill_boundary
      - end_fill_boundary
    process: Iterate through the input array from start_fill_boundary up to (but not including) end_fill_boundary. If a pixel's color is white (0), change it to fill_color.
    outputs:
      - modified_array

goal:
  - description: Modify the input array by filling the white space between the first colored segment and the specific boundary pixel (yellow/4) using the color of the first colored segment.
