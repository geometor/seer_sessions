            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core logic: filling the gap between the first and last non-white elements with the color of the first non-white element. However, it failed because it assumed the input was a 1D list, whereas ARC grids are 2D structures (numpy arrays or lists of lists), even if they only have one row. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" confirms that comparisons were being made on array slices instead of individual pixel values.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the error is to adapt the logic to operate explicitly on the first row of the 2D input grid.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
