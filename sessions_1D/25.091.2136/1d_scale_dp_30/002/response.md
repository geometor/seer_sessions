## General Assessment

The previous attempt correctly identified the core logic: filling the gap between the first and last non-white elements with the color of the first non-white element. However, it failed because it assumed the input was a 1D list, whereas ARC grids are 2D structures (numpy arrays or lists of lists), even if they only have one row. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms that comparisons were being made on array slices instead of individual pixel values.

The strategy for resolving the error is to adapt the logic to operate explicitly on the first row of the 2D input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid (a 2D array, typically with shape (1, N)).
2.  Extract the first row of the grid.
3.  Scan the first row from left to right (index `j` from 0 upwards) to find the column index and color of the *first* non-white pixel. Let this color be `fill_color` and the index be `start_col_index`. If no non-white pixel is found (row is all white), return a copy of the original input grid.
4.  Scan the first row from right to left (index `j` from `width-1` downwards) to find the column index of the *first* non-white pixel encountered (which corresponds to the *last* non-white pixel in the row). Let this index be `end_col_index`. (If no non-white pixel was found in step 3, this step is skipped).
5.  Create a deep copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
6.  If `start_col_index` and `end_col_index` were found and `end_col_index` is greater than `start_col_index + 1` (meaning there is at least one pixel between them):
    a.  Iterate through the column indices `j` from `start_col_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_col_index`.
    b.  For each index `j`, check the color of the pixel at `(0, j)` in the *original* input grid.
    c.  If the color is white (0), update the color of the pixel at `(0, j)` in the *output* grid to `fill_color`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
