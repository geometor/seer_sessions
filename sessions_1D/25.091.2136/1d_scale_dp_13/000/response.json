Appears exactly once in each input.\n    *   Other colors (Orange-7, Yellow-4): Form a contiguous block. Only one such color appears per example, always to the left of the maroon pixel.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extending the contiguous block of the non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., orange or yellow) rightwards. This extension fills the space originally occupied by white (0) pixels, stopping just before the maroon (9) pixel. The maroon pixel and any pixels to its right remain unchanged. The original block of color also remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
