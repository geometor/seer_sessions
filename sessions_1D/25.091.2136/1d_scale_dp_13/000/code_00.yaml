task_dimensionality: 1D # Input/Output grids are single rows
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: A sequence of identical non-white, non-maroon pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., orange, yellow). Let's call this 'main_color'.
      - location: Positioned to the left of the marker pixel.
      - extent: Defined by its start and end indices.
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel acting as a boundary.
    properties:
      - color: Always maroon (9).
      - location: Positioned to the right of the contiguous_block.
  - type: filler_pixels
    description: Pixels filling the space between the block and the marker.
    properties:
      - color: Always white (0) in the input.
      - location: Between the rightmost pixel of the contiguous_block and the marker_pixel.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The contiguous_block is always to the left of the marker_pixel.
  - type: spatial
    description: The filler_pixels (if any) are always located between the contiguous_block and the marker_pixel.
actions:
  - type: fill
    description: The filler_pixels are replaced with the main_color of the contiguous_block.
    target: filler_pixels
    parameters:
      - color: main_color (color of the contiguous_block)
    condition: Only pixels between the end of the contiguous_block and the marker_pixel are affected.
