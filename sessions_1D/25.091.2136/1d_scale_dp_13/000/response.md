Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are all 1-dimensional grids (single rows).
*   **Key Colors:** The significant colors involved are:
    *   White (0): Appears as background or filler.
    *   Maroon (9): Acts as a boundary or marker. Appears exactly once in each input.
    *   Other colors (Orange-7, Yellow-4): Form a contiguous block. Only one such color appears per example, always to the left of the maroon pixel.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extending the contiguous block of the non-white, non-maroon color (e.g., orange or yellow) rightwards. This extension fills the space originally occupied by white (0) pixels, stopping just before the maroon (9) pixel. The maroon pixel and any pixels to its right remain unchanged. The original block of color also remains unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_dimensionality: 1D # Input/Output grids are single rows
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: A sequence of identical non-white, non-maroon pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., orange, yellow). Let's call this 'main_color'.
      - location: Positioned to the left of the marker pixel.
      - extent: Defined by its start and end indices.
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel acting as a boundary.
    properties:
      - color: Always maroon (9).
      - location: Positioned to the right of the contiguous_block.
  - type: filler_pixels
    description: Pixels filling the space between the block and the marker.
    properties:
      - color: Always white (0) in the input.
      - location: Between the rightmost pixel of the contiguous_block and the marker_pixel.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The contiguous_block is always to the left of the marker_pixel.
  - type: spatial
    description: The filler_pixels (if any) are always located between the contiguous_block and the marker_pixel.
actions:
  - type: fill
    description: The filler_pixels are replaced with the main_color of the contiguous_block.
    target: filler_pixels
    parameters:
      - color: main_color (color of the contiguous_block)
    condition: Only pixels between the end of the contiguous_block and the marker_pixel are affected.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single maroon (9) pixel in the input row and note its index (position).
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels. Note its color (the 'main color') and the index of its rightmost pixel.
3.  Iterate through the pixels starting from the position immediately to the right of the identified block, up to (but not including) the position of the maroon pixel.
4.  Change the color of each pixel in this range to the 'main color' identified in step 2.
5.  Leave all other pixels (the original block, the maroon pixel, and any pixels to the right of the maroon pixel) unchanged.
6.  The resulting row is the output.
