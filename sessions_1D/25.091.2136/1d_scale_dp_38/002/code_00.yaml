task_type: sequence_manipulation
dimensionality: 1D
input_type: list_of_integers (pixels)
output_type: list_of_integers (pixels)
objects:
  - type: pixel_sequence
    description: A 1D sequence of pixels represented by integers 0-9.
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: non_white (C1, value 1-9)
      - start_index: index of the first pixel in the block
      - end_index: index of the last pixel in the block
    identification: The first sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels encountered when scanning from left to right.
  - type: target_pixel
    properties:
      - color: non_white (C2, value 1-9)
      - index: position in the sequence (index_C2)
    identification: The first non-white pixel encountered after the end of the contiguous_block (C1).
  - type: gap_region
    properties:
      - start_index: end_index of C1 + 1
      - end_index: index_C2 - 1
      - content: sequence of pixels between C1 and C2.
    identification: The sequence of pixels located strictly between the end of the first non-white block (C1) and the next non-white pixel (C2).
actions:
  - name: find_first_block
    inputs: pixel_sequence
    outputs: block_color (C1), block_end_index
    description: Scan sequence left-to-right to find the first pixel != 0. Identify its color (C1) and the end index of the contiguous block of this color.
  - name: find_next_pixel
    inputs: pixel_sequence, start_search_index (block_end_index + 1)
    outputs: pixel_index (index_C2)
    description: Scan sequence starting from start_search_index to find the index of the first pixel != 0.
  - name: check_gap_content
    inputs: pixel_sequence, gap_start_index, gap_end_index
    outputs: is_all_white (boolean)
    description: Verify if all pixels within the gap region (from gap_start_index to gap_end_index, inclusive) have the color white (0).
  - name: fill_gap
    inputs: pixel_sequence, gap_start_index, gap_end_index, fill_color (C1)
    outputs: modified_pixel_sequence
    condition: is_all_white is true for the gap region.
    effect: Change the color of all pixels within the gap region to the fill_color (C1).
constraints:
  - If no initial non-white block is found, the sequence is unchanged.
  - If no second non-white pixel is found after the first block, the sequence is unchanged.
  - If the gap between the block and the next pixel does not exist (i.e., they are adjacent) or contains any non-white pixels, the sequence is unchanged.
