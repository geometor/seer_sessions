            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic based on the provided examples. The error (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...\") strongly suggests an issue with data types during testing, likely involving NumPy arrays being used where a single boolean was expected, rather than a flaw in the perceived transformation rule itself. The provided Python code attempts to mitigate this by converting the input grid to a list, suggesting the error might have occurred either in the test harness comparing the list output to a NumPy array target or during the initial parsing of input before the `transform` function was called.\n\nThe strategy is to re-affirm the transformation logic based on a careful review of all examples and refine the natural language program and factual documentation. The core logic appears robust for the given examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze each training example step-by-step according to the perceived logic:\n\n*   **Train Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]`\n    *   First Non-White Block (C1): Color=4 (Yellow), Start=5, End=7.\n    *   Next Non-White Pixel (C2): Color=9 (Maroon), Index=15.\n    *   Gap Range: Index 8 to 14.\n    *   Gap Content: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (All White).\n    *   Action: Fill gap (indices 8-14) with Color 4.\n    *   Result: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]` (Matches Expected Output)\n\n*   **Train Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]`\n    *   First Non-White Block (C1): Color=4 (Yellow), Start=1, End=11.\n    *   Next Non-White Pixel (C2): Color=9 (Maroon), Index=15.\n    *   Gap Range: Index 12 to 14.\n    *   Gap Content: `[0, 0, 0]` (All White).\n    *   Action: Fill gap (indices 12-14) with Color 4.\n    *   Result: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]` (Matches Expected Output)\n\n*   **Train Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   First Non-White Block (C1): Color=3 (Green), Start=0, End=3.\n    *   Next Non-White Pixel (C2): Color=9 (Maroon), Index=9.\n    *   Gap Range: Index 4 to 8.\n    *   Gap Content: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (All White).\n    *   Action: Fill gap (indices 4-8) with Color 3.\n    *   Result: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches Expected Output)\n\nThe logic holds for all examples.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

If no subsequent non-white pixel is found after `end_C1`, return the current output grid (which is still the original grid).\n7.
