*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN arrays) of pixels.
    *   The grids contain blocks of white pixels (0) and blocks of non-white pixels (e.g., yellow=4, green=3, maroon=9).
    *   The core transformation involves identifying the first contiguous block of a non-white color and the next non-white pixel that appears after it in the sequence.
    *   The space between the first non-white block and the subsequent non-white pixel, if filled with white pixels, gets filled with the color of the first block.
    *   The non-white pixels themselves seem to retain their original positions and colors, except for the white pixels being overwritten.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml

    objects:
      - type: pixel_sequence
        properties:
          - color: white (0)

      - type: contiguous_block
        properties:
          - color: non_white (C1)
          - start_index: index of the first pixel of the block
          - end_index: index of the last pixel of the block
      - type: target_pixel
        properties:
          - color: non_white (C2)
          - index: position in the sequence
          - relationship: first non_white pixel after the C1 block
      - type: fill_region
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - start_index: index immediately after the C1 block ends
          - end_index: index immediately before the C2 pixel
          - relationship: located between the C1 block and the C2 pixel
    actions:
      - name: identify_first_non_white_block
        inputs: input_grid
        outputs: color (C1), end_index_C1

      - name: fill_gap
        inputs: C1, end_index_C1, index_C2
        outputs: modified_grid
        condition: pixels between end_index_C1 and index_C2 are all white (0)
        effect: change color of pixels from (end_index_C1 + 1) to (index_C2 - 1) to C1
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid from left to right.
    2.  Identify the first contiguous block of a non-white color (call this color C1). Note the index where this block ends (end_index_C1).
    3.  Continue scanning from the position immediately after end_index_C1.
    4.  Identify the very next pixel that has a non-white color (call this color C2). Note the index of this pixel (index_C2).
    5.  Examine the pixels in the range between end_index_C1 + 1 and index_C2 - 1.
    6.  If all pixels in this range are white (color 0), change their color to C1.
    7.  Leave all other pixels in the grid unchanged.
    8.  The resulting grid is the output.
