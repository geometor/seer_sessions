task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 2D (input/output are 1xN arrays)
focus_dimension: Row (operations apply to the single row)
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - shape: 1xN (1 row, N columns)
      - format: numpy.ndarray
  - type: pixel_sequence
    source: first row of the grid
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: non_white (1-9)
  - type: first_non_white_block (C1)
    description: The first contiguous sequence of one or more identical non-white pixels in the row.
    properties:
      - color: C1 (non-white)
      - start_index: column index of the first pixel of the block
      - end_index: column index of the last pixel of the block
  - type: next_non_white_pixel (C2)
    description: The first non-white pixel encountered after the end of the first_non_white_block.
    properties:
      - color: C2 (non-white)
      - index: column index in the row
      - relationship: index > end_index of C1
  - type: gap_region
    description: The sequence of pixels located strictly between the end of C1 and the location of C2.
    properties:
      - start_index: end_index of C1 + 1
      - end_index: index of C2 - 1
      - pixels: sequence of pixels within these indices
      - condition: exists only if start_index <= end_index
actions:
  - name: extract_row
    inputs: input_grid (1xN numpy array)
    outputs: pixel_sequence (1D list or array)
  - name: find_first_non_white_block
    inputs: pixel_sequence
    outputs: color (C1), end_index_C1
    condition: a non-white block exists
  - name: find_next_non_white_pixel
    inputs: pixel_sequence, end_index_C1
    outputs: index_C2
    condition: a non-white pixel exists after end_index_C1
  - name: check_gap_is_white
    inputs: pixel_sequence, end_index_C1, index_C2
    outputs: boolean (True if gap exists and all pixels in it are white)
    steps:
        1. Determine gap indices: gap_start = end_index_C1 + 1, gap_end = index_C2 - 1.
        2. Check if gap exists (gap_start <= gap_end).
        3. If gap exists, check if all pixels from gap_start to gap_end are white (0).

    inputs: pixel_sequence, color_C1, end_index_C1, index_C2
    outputs: modified_pixel_sequence
    condition: check_gap_is_white is True
    effect: change color of pixels from (end_index_C1 + 1) to (index_C2 - 1) to C1

    inputs: modified_pixel_sequence
