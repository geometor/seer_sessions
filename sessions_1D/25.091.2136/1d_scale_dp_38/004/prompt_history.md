*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN arrays) of pixels.
    *   The grids contain blocks of white pixels (0) and blocks of non-white pixels (e.g., yellow=4, green=3, maroon=9).
    *   The core transformation involves identifying the first contiguous block of a non-white color and the next non-white pixel that appears after it in the sequence.
    *   The space between the first non-white block and the subsequent non-white pixel, if filled with white pixels, gets filled with the color of the first block.
    *   The non-white pixels themselves seem to retain their original positions and colors, except for the white pixels being overwritten.

*   **Facts:**

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid from left to right.
    2.  Identify the first contiguous block of a non-white color (call this color C1). Note the index where this block ends (end_index_C1).
    3.  Continue scanning from the position immediately after end_index_C1.
    4.  Identify the very next pixel that has a non-white color (call this color C2). Note the index of this pixel (index_C2).
    5.  Examine the pixels in the range between end_index_C1 + 1 and index_C2 - 1.
    6.  If all pixels in this range are white (color 0), change their color to C1.
    7.  Leave all other pixels in the grid unchanged.
    8.  The resulting grid is the output.
