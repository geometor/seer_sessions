*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN arrays) of pixels.
    *   The grids contain blocks of white pixels (0) and blocks of non-white pixels (e.g., yellow=4, green=3, maroon=9).
    *   The core transformation involves identifying the first contiguous block of a non-white color and the next non-white pixel that appears after it in the sequence.
    *   The space between the first non-white block and the subsequent non-white pixel, if filled with white pixels, gets filled with the color of the first block.
    *   The non-white pixels themselves seem to retain their original positions and colors, except for the white pixels being overwritten.

*   **Facts:**

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid from left to right.
    2.  Identify the first contiguous block of a non-white color (call this color C1). Note the index where this block ends (end_index_C1).
    3.  Continue scanning from the position immediately after end_index_C1.
    4.  Identify the very next pixel that has a non-white color (call this color C2). Note the index of this pixel (index_C2).
    5.  Examine the pixels in the range between end_index_C1 + 1 and index_C2 - 1.
    6.  If all pixels in this range are white (color 0), change their color to C1.
    7.  Leave all other pixels in the grid unchanged.
    8.  The resulting grid is the output.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D list or tuple, while ARC tasks typically provide inputs as 2D NumPy arrays, even if they represent a single row (shape 1xN). The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms this, arising from direct comparisons (like `pixel != 0`) applied to NumPy arrays instead of individual elements.

The core logic identified—finding the first non-white block, finding the next non-white pixel, and filling the all-white gap between them with the first block's color—appears correct based on visual inspection of all three training examples.

The strategy is to explicitly acknowledge the input format as a 1xN NumPy array and refine the natural language program and supporting facts to reflect that the operations should be performed on the single row contained within the array. The Python code will need modification in the coder phase to access this row (e.g., `input_grid[0]`) and potentially use NumPy-specific functions if beneficial, though standard iteration over the row should also work once accessed correctly.

## Metrics

Let's confirm the structure and key elements for each example. We'll assume the input is a 1xN NumPy array and analyze its first row.

The metrics confirm:
*   Inputs and outputs are 1xN NumPy arrays.
*   The transformation involves locating the first contiguous block of non-white pixels (C1) and the very next non-white pixel (C2) after the block.
*   The segment of pixels strictly between the end of C1 and the position of C2 (the gap) is examined.
*   If the gap exists and consists entirely of white pixels (0), it is filled with the color C1.
*   This logic holds for all three training examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N).
2.  Extract the single row from the input grid to get a 1D sequence of pixels.
3.  Create a mutable copy of this 1D pixel sequence to serve as the basis for the output.
4.  Scan the sequence from left to right to find the first contiguous block of non-white pixels. Identify its color (C1) and the index of its last pixel (end\_index\_C1).
5.  If no non-white block is found, the sequence remains unchanged. Proceed to step 11.
6.  Continue scanning the sequence starting from the index immediately after end\_index\_C1 (i.e., end\_index\_C1 + 1). Find the index of the very next non-white pixel (index\_C2).
7.  If no subsequent non-white pixel is found after the first block, the sequence remains unchanged. Proceed to step 11.
8.  Define the potential 'gap' region as the indices strictly between end\_index\_C1 and index\_C2 (i.e., from end\_index\_C1 + 1 up to index\_C2 - 1).
9.  Check if this gap region exists (i.e., if end\_index\_C1 + 1 <= index\_C2 - 1) and if *all* pixels within this gap region in the sequence are white (color 0).
10. If the gap exists and is entirely white, fill this gap in the copied sequence by changing the color of all pixels from index (end\_index\_C1 + 1) to (index\_C2 - 1) inclusive, to the color C1.
11. Reshape the final (potentially modified) 1D sequence back into a 1xN NumPy array.
12. Return the resulting 1xN array as the output grid.
