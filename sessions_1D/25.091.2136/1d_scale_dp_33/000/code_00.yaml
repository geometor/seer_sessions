task_type: extension
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - color: variable (non-white, non-orange)
      - contiguous: true
      - location: left/center part of the grid
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: orange (7)
      - count: 1
      - location: right part of the grid, to the right of the horizontal_segment
  - type: background_pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: potentially surrounding the segment and pixel, and importantly, between the segment and the orange pixel
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: segment_color, segment_end_index
  - name: identify_target_pixel
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: target_pixel_index (orange pixel)
  - name: fill_gap
    inputs: segment_color, segment_end_index, target_pixel_index
    outputs: modified_grid
    details: Change the color of pixels between segment_end_index + 1 and target_pixel_index - 1 to segment_color.
relationship:
  - The horizontal_segment always appears to the left of the orange pixel.
  - The transformation targets the white pixels located specifically between the right end of the horizontal_segment and the orange pixel.
output_grid_properties:
  - The original horizontal_segment is extended rightwards.
  - The gap between the original segment and the orange pixel is filled with the segment's color.
  - The orange pixel and pixels to its right are unchanged.
  - The pixels to the left of the original segment are unchanged.
