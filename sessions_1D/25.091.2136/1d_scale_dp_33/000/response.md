Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input grids are single rows (1D arrays). Each grid contains a contiguous horizontal segment of a single color (let's call this the "main color"), distinct from white (0) and orange (7). There is also a single orange pixel (7) present somewhere to the right of this main colored segment. The space between the main colored segment and the orange pixel is filled with white pixels (0). The transformation involves extending the main colored segment to the right, replacing the intervening white pixels with the main color, until it reaches the column immediately preceding the orange pixel. The orange pixel itself and any pixels to its right remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: extension
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - color: variable (non-white, non-orange)
      - contiguous: true
      - location: left/center part of the grid
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: orange (7)
      - count: 1
      - location: right part of the grid, to the right of the horizontal_segment
  - type: background_pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: potentially surrounding the segment and pixel, and importantly, between the segment and the orange pixel
actions:
  - name: identify_segment
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: segment_color, segment_end_index
  - name: identify_target_pixel
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: target_pixel_index (orange pixel)
  - name: fill_gap
    inputs: segment_color, segment_end_index, target_pixel_index
    outputs: modified_grid
    details: Change the color of pixels between segment_end_index + 1 and target_pixel_index - 1 to segment_color.
relationship:
  - The horizontal_segment always appears to the left of the orange pixel.
  - The transformation targets the white pixels located specifically between the right end of the horizontal_segment and the orange pixel.
output_grid_properties:
  - The original horizontal_segment is extended rightwards.
  - The gap between the original segment and the orange pixel is filled with the segment's color.
  - The orange pixel and pixels to its right are unchanged.
  - The pixels to the left of the original segment are unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the main contiguous horizontal segment of non-white, non-orange pixels. Record its color (let's call it `segment_color`) and the column index of its rightmost pixel (let's call it `segment_end_index`).
2.  Identify the column index of the single orange pixel (color 7) (let's call it `orange_index`).
3.  Iterate through the columns from `segment_end_index + 1` up to, but not including, `orange_index`.
4.  For each column index in this range, change the color of the pixel at that position to `segment_color`.
5.  Leave all other pixels unchanged. The resulting grid is the output.
