Each grid contains a contiguous horizontal segment of a single color (let's call this the \"main color\"), distinct from white (0) and orange (7). There is also a single orange pixel (7) present somewhere to the right of this main colored segment. The space between the main colored segment and the orange pixel is filled with white pixels (0). The transformation involves extending the main colored segment to the right, replacing the intervening white pixels with the main color, until it reaches the column immediately preceding the orange pixel. The orange pixel itself and any pixels to its right remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
