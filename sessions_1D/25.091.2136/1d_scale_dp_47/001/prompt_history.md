Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or single-row grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Key Colors:** The colors white (`0`), magenta (`6`), and one other dominant color (orange `7`, green `3`, yellow `4`) seem important in each example.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation consistently occurs in the region immediately to the left of the single magenta pixel (`6`).
4.  **Core Change:** A contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) located directly to the left of the magenta pixel (`6`) changes color.
5.  **Color Source:** The new color for the white block is determined by the color of the non-white pixel(s) immediately adjacent to the left of that white block.
6.  **Stability:** The magenta pixel (`6`) itself, pixels to its right, and the non-white block to the left of the target white block remain unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Modify a sequence of pixels based on the position of a specific marker color.

elements:
  - element: pixel_sequence
    description: A 1D array of pixels representing colors 0-9.
  - element: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color magenta (6). It acts as a reference point.
  - element: target_block
    description: A contiguous block of white pixels (0) located immediately to the left of the marker_pixel.
  - element: source_color_block
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels located immediately to the left of the target_block. The color of these pixels is the source color.

relationships:
  - relation: adjacency
    description: The target_block is directly adjacent to the left of the marker_pixel. The source_color_block is directly adjacent to the left of the target_block.

actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker_pixel
    description: Find the index of the single magenta (6) pixel in the sequence.
  - action: identify_target
    target: target_block
    description: Identify the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels ending just before the marker_pixel's index.
  - action: identify_source_color
    target: source_color_block
    description: Determine the color of the pixel(s) immediately to the left of the target_block. Assume this color is uniform within the adjacent non-white block.
  - action: recolor
    target: target_block
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the target_block to the identified source_color.

properties:
  - property: length
    element: pixel_sequence
    description: The input and output sequences have the same length.
  - property: uniqueness
    element: marker_pixel
    description: There is only one magenta (6) pixel in each input sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input pixel sequence to find the unique magenta pixel (color 6). Record its position (index).
2.  Starting from the position immediately to the left of the magenta pixel, identify the contiguous block of white pixels (color 0). This is the 'target block'. Note the start and end positions of this block.
3.  Identify the color of the pixel located immediately to the left of the start position of the 'target block'. This is the 'source color'.
4.  Create a copy of the input pixel sequence.
5.  In the copied sequence, change the color of all pixels within the 'target block' (from its start position to its end position) to the 'source color'.
6.  The modified sequence is the output.
