task_description: Modify a sequence of pixels based on the position of a specific marker color.

elements:
  - element: pixel_sequence
    description: A 1D array of pixels representing colors 0-9.
  - element: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color magenta (6). It acts as a reference point.
  - element: target_block
    description: A contiguous block of white pixels (0) located immediately to the left of the marker_pixel.
  - element: source_color_block
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels located immediately to the left of the target_block. The color of these pixels is the source color.

relationships:
  - relation: adjacency
    description: The target_block is directly adjacent to the left of the marker_pixel. The source_color_block is directly adjacent to the left of the target_block.

actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker_pixel
    description: Find the index of the single magenta (6) pixel in the sequence.
  - action: identify_target
    target: target_block
    description: Identify the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels ending just before the marker_pixel's index.
  - action: identify_source_color
    target: source_color_block
    description: Determine the color of the pixel(s) immediately to the left of the target_block. Assume this color is uniform within the adjacent non-white block.
  - action: recolor
    target: target_block
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the target_block to the identified source_color.

properties:
  - property: length
    element: pixel_sequence
    description: The input and output sequences have the same length.
  - property: uniqueness
    element: marker_pixel
    description: There is only one magenta (6) pixel in each input sequence.
