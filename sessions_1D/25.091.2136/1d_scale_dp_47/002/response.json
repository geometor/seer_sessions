            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code failed on all training examples with a `ValueError` indicating ambiguity when evaluating the truthiness of an array. This strongly suggests that the input/output data, although presented linearly in the text, are being processed as multi-dimensional NumPy arrays (likely 2D grids, even if they only have one row). The initial code treated the input as a 1D list, causing comparisons like `pixel == 6` or `output_grid[current_index] == 0` to potentially operate on arrays or slices, leading to the error when used in conditional statements (`if`).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the dimensionality of the input/output data using `tool_code`.\n2.  Revise the understanding and the natural language program to explicitly account for a 2D grid structure. The core logic (find magenta, find white block left, find source color left of that, recolor) remains the same, but operations must be specified relative to the row containing the magenta pixel.\n3.  Update the facts (YAML) to reflect the 2D grid structure.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
