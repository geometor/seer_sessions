task_description: Modify a 2D grid by recoloring a block of white pixels based on the position of a magenta marker and an adjacent color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D NumPy array of pixels representing colors 0-9. In the examples, these are single-row grids.
  - element: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color magenta (6). It acts as a reference point. Assumed to be unique in the grid.
  - element: target_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of white pixels (0) located within the same row as the marker_pixel and immediately to its left.
  - element: source_pixel
    description: The single pixel located immediately to the left of the target_block, within the same row. Its color is the source color.

relationships:
  - relation: location
    description: The marker_pixel has a specific row and column index.
  - relation: adjacency (horizontal)
    description: The target_block ends at the column index immediately preceding the marker_pixel's column index, within the marker's row. The source_pixel is at the column index immediately preceding the start column index of the target_block, within the same row.

actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker_pixel
    description: Find the row and column index of the single magenta (6) pixel in the grid.
  - action: identify_target
    target: target_block
    description: Identify the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels in the marker's row, ending just before the marker_pixel's column index. Determine the start and end column indices of this block.
  - action: identify_source_color
    target: source_pixel
    description: Determine the color of the pixel at the column index immediately to the left of the target_block's start column index, within the marker's row.
  - action: recolor
    target: target_block
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the target_block (identified column range in the marker's row) to the identified source_color.

properties:
  - property: shape
    element: grid
    description: The input and output grids have the same shape (dimensions).
  - property: uniqueness
    element: marker_pixel
    description: Assumed there is only one magenta (6) pixel in each input grid based on examples.
  - property: color_constraint
    element: source_pixel
    description: Based on examples, the source_pixel's color is non-white (not 0).
  - property: modification_scope
    description: Only the pixels within the target_block are modified; all other pixels remain unchanged.
