Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or single-row grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Key Colors:** The colors white (`0`), magenta (`6`), and one other dominant color (orange `7`, green `3`, yellow `4`) seem important in each example.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation consistently occurs in the region immediately to the left of the single magenta pixel (`6`).
4.  **Core Change:** A contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) located directly to the left of the magenta pixel (`6`) changes color.
5.  **Color Source:** The new color for the white block is determined by the color of the non-white pixel(s) immediately adjacent to the left of that white block.
6.  **Stability:** The magenta pixel (`6`) itself, pixels to its right, and the non-white block to the left of the target white block remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input pixel sequence to find the unique magenta pixel (color 6). Record its position (index).
2.  Starting from the position immediately to the left of the magenta pixel, identify the contiguous block of white pixels (color 0). This is the 'target block'. Note the start and end positions of this block.
3.  Identify the color of the pixel located immediately to the left of the start position of the 'target block'. This is the 'source color'.
4.  Create a copy of the input pixel sequence.
5.  In the copied sequence, change the color of all pixels within the 'target block' (from its start position to its end position) to the 'source color'.
6.  The modified sequence is the output.

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed on all training examples with a `ValueError` indicating ambiguity when evaluating the truthiness of an array. This strongly suggests that the input/output data, although presented linearly in the text, are being processed as multi-dimensional NumPy arrays (likely 2D grids, even if they only have one row). The initial code treated the input as a 1D list, causing comparisons like `pixel == 6` or `output_grid[current_index] == 0` to potentially operate on arrays or slices, leading to the error when used in conditional statements (`if`).

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the dimensionality of the input/output data using `tool_code`.
2.  Revise the understanding and the natural language program to explicitly account for a 2D grid structure. The core logic (find magenta, find white block left, find source color left of that, recolor) remains the same, but operations must be specified relative to the row containing the magenta pixel.
3.  Update the facts (YAML) to reflect the 2D grid structure.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Make a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the coordinates (row index `r`, column index `c`) of the unique magenta pixel (color 6).
3.  If no magenta pixel is found, return the copied grid unchanged.
4.  Identify the horizontal contiguous block of white pixels (color 0) located in row `r` immediately to the left of column `c`.
    *   Start checking from column `c-1` and move leftwards (decreasing column index) as long as the pixels are white and the column index is valid (>= 0).
    *   Record the starting column index (`start_c`) and ending column index (`end_c` which is `c-1`) of this white block.
5.  If no white block is found immediately to the left of the magenta pixel (i.e., the pixel at `(r, c-1)` is not white, or `c` is 0), return the copied grid unchanged.
6.  Determine the source color by checking the pixel located at `(r, start_c - 1)`, which is immediately to the left of the identified white block.
7.  If `start_c` is 0 (meaning the white block starts at the grid edge), there is no pixel to the left, so return the copied grid unchanged.
8.  If the source pixel at `(r, start_c - 1)` is white (0), return the copied grid unchanged (as this contradicts the pattern seen in examples where the source color is non-white).
9.  Iterate through the columns from `start_c` to `end_c` (inclusive). For each column index `i` in this range, update the pixel in the output grid at `(r, i)` to the determined source color.
10. Return the modified output grid.
