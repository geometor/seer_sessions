"""
Transforms a 2D grid by finding a unique magenta marker (6), identifying the
contiguous horizontal block of white pixels (0) immediately to its left within
the same row, determining the color of the non-white pixel immediately to the
left of that white block, and then recoloring the entire white block with
this source color. If the marker is not found, not unique, has no white block
immediately left, the white block is at the left edge, or the pixel left of
the white block is also white, the grid is returned unchanged.
