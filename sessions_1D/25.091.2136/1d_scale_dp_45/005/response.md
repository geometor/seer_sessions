"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid based on the following rule:
1. Find the last occurrence of the sequence [0, 0, 0, 9] (three white pixels followed by a maroon pixel) within the single row of the grid.
2. Identify the color 'C' of the pixel immediately preceding this sequence.
3. If the sequence exists, has a preceding pixel, and the preceding pixel's color 'C' is not white (0), then replace the three white pixels [0, 0, 0] with three pixels of color 'C' ([C, C, C]).
4. Otherwise, the grid remains unchanged.
