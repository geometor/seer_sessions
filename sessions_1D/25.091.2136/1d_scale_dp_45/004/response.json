            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed on all training examples, returning the input grid unchanged. The code logic aims to find the last occurrence of the sequence `[0, 0, 0, 9]`, identify the non-white color `C` of the preceding pixel, and replace `[0, 0, 0]` with `[C, C, C]`.\n\nThe traceback or execution details suggest the code correctly identifies the pattern and the replacement color `C`. However, the modification step `output_grid[last_match_index : last_match_index + 3] = preceding_color` appears not to have taken effect or the condition leading to it was not met.\n\nA key observation from the tool execution is that the input, even if visually appearing 1D, is structured as a 2D array (specifically, shape `(1, N)`). The original code calculates `n = len(grid)`, which returns the number of rows (1), not the number of columns. Consequently, the loop `for i in range(n - sequence_len + 1)` becomes `for i in range(1 - 4 + 1)`, which is `range(-2)`, meaning the loop body never executes. The `last_match_index` remains -1, and no transformation occurs.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the code to operate explicitly on the *first row* of the input grid.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the assessment that the input is a 1xN grid:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]]` (Shape: 1x16)\n    *   Target Sequence `[0, 0, 0, 9]` found at column index 10 in row 0.\n    *   Preceding Pixel (index 9): Color `1` (Blue).\n    *   Condition `preceding_color != 0` is true (`1 != 0`).\n    *   Required transformation: Replace pixels at indices (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12) with color `1`.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Grid: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9]]` (Shape: 1x16)\n    *   Target Sequence `[0, 0, 0, 9]` found at column index 12 in row 0.\n    *   Preceding Pixel (index 11): Color `1` (Blue).\n    *   Condition `preceding_color != 0` is true (`1 != 0`).\n    *   Required transformation: Replace pixels at indices (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 14) with color `1`.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Grid: `[[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]]` (Shape: 1x16)\n    *   Target Sequence `[0, 0, 0, 9]` found at column index 11 in row 0.\n    *   Preceding Pixel (index 10): Color `6` (Magenta).\n    *   Condition `preceding_color != 0` is true (`6 != 0`).\n    *   Required transformation: Replace pixels at indices (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 13) with color `6`.\n\nThe core transformation logic derived previously seems correct, but its application needs to target the specific row within the 2D grid structure.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
