elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels, specifically with dimensions 1xN (one row, N columns).
    properties:
      - rows: Always 1 in the examples.
      - columns: Variable length (e.g., 16).
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (white: 0, blue: 1, red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 4, gray: 5, magenta: 6, orange: 7, azure: 8, maroon: 9)
      - position: (row_index, column_index). Since there's only one row, we can refer to position by column index.
  - object: row
    description: The single sequence of pixels constituting the grid.
  - object: gap
    description: A specific contiguous sequence of three white pixels (0 0 0) within the row.
  - object: marker
    description: A single maroon pixel (9) immediately following the gap within the row.
  - object: fill_source
    description: The pixel immediately preceding the gap within the row. Its color is used for filling. Let its color be C.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_sequence
    description: Within the grid's single row, find the last occurrence where a fill_source pixel (color C != 0) is followed by a gap (0 0 0), which is followed by a marker (9).
    pattern: "... [C] [0 0 0] [9] ..." where C != 0.
action:
  - type: replacement
    description: The gap sequence (0 0 0) found in the pattern is replaced by a sequence of three pixels, all having the color C derived from the fill_source pixel.
    input_pattern: (within the row) "... [C] [0 0 0] [9] ..."
    output_pattern: (within the row) "... [C] [C C C] [9] ..."
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions (1xN) remain constant.
  - Pixels outside the identified gap sequence remain unchanged.
  - The fill_source pixel [C] and the marker pixel [9] remain unchanged.
  - Only the last occurrence of the pattern in the row is modified.
