elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 1D array of pixels with color values 0-9.
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (white: 0, blue: 1, red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 4, gray: 5, magenta: 6, orange: 7, azure: 8, maroon: 9)
      - position: index within the 1D array.
  - object: target_sequence
    description: A specific contiguous sequence of four pixels [white, white, white, maroon] ([0, 0, 0, 9]).
  - object: preceding_pixel
    description: The pixel immediately before the start of the target_sequence.
    properties:
      - color: C
relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: The target_sequence ([0, 0, 0, 9]) is found within the grid.
  - type: condition
    description: A preceding_pixel exists (the sequence is not at the very beginning of the grid) and its color C is not white (C != 0).
action:
  - type: replacement
    description: If the target_sequence is found and the condition on the preceding_pixel is met, the first three pixels of the target_sequence ([0, 0, 0]) are replaced by three pixels of color C ([C, C, C]).
    input_pattern: "... [Pixel C] [0 0 0] [9] ..."
    output_pattern: "... [Pixel C] [C C C] [9] ..."
  - type: find_last
    description: If multiple instances of the target_sequence exist that satisfy the condition, only the *last* one (rightmost) is modified.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain constant.
  - Pixels not part of the modified [0, 0, 0] sequence remain unchanged.
  - The marker pixel [9] and the preceding pixel [C] remain unchanged.
