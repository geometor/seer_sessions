"""
Identifies the last occurrence of the sequence [0, 0, 0, 9] (three white pixels followed by a maroon pixel) in a 1D input grid. 
If found, it checks the color 'C' of the pixel immediately preceding this sequence. 
If this preceding pixel exists and its color 'C' is not white (0), it replaces the three white pixels [0, 0, 0] with three pixels of color 'C' ([C, C, C]). 
Otherwise, the grid remains unchanged.
