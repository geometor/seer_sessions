Task: Fill a gap between a colored sequence and a boundary marker.
Input:
  Type: Single-row grid (1D array).
  Elements:
    - Leading_White_Pixels: Optional sequence of white pixels (0) at the beginning.
    - Main_Color_Sequence: Contiguous sequence of a single non-white, non-yellow color.
    - Intermediate_White_Pixels: Sequence of white pixels (0) following the Main_Color_Sequence.
    - Boundary_Marker: Single yellow pixel (4) following the Intermediate_White_Pixels.
    - Trailing_White_Pixels: Optional sequence of white pixels (0) at the end.
Output:
  Type: Single-row grid (1D array).
  Relationship_to_Input: Modified version of the input grid.
Transformation:
  Action: Fill.
  Target: Intermediate_White_Pixels.
  Fill_Color: The color of the Main_Color_Sequence.
  Condition: The filling occurs only in the segment between the end of the Main_Color_Sequence and the position of the Boundary_Marker (yellow pixel).
  Preserved_Elements:
    - Leading_White_Pixels
