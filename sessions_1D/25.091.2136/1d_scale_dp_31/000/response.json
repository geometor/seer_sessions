A contiguous sequence of pixels of a single color (e.g., red '2' in train_1, magenta '6' in train_2, green '3' in train_3). Let's call this the \"main color\".\n3.  A sequence of white pixels (0).\n4.  A single yellow pixel (4).\n5.  Optional trailing white pixels (0).\n\nThe transformation involves identifying the main color and the position of the yellow pixel. The white pixels located *between* the end of the main color sequence and the yellow pixel are replaced with the main color. All other pixels (leading white pixels, the original main color sequence, the yellow pixel, and trailing white pixels) remain unchanged. The yellow pixel acts as a right-hand boundary for the fill operation.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
