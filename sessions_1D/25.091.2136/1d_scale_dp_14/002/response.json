The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" indicates that the `input_grid` was treated as a multi-dimensional NumPy array (likely 2D with one row) within the testing environment, while the provided code expected a simple 1D Python list.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input format is indeed a 2D NumPy array with a single row.\n2.  Adapt the code to handle this 2D NumPy array structure, primarily by accessing elements using `[0, col_index]` instead of just `[index]`.\n3.  Verify that the core transformation logic identified previously remains correct under this revised format.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's confirm the shape of the input data using `tool_code`.\n"
