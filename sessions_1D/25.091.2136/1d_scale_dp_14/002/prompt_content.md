"""
Identify the rightmost non-white pixel in the 1D input grid.
Scan leftwards from the position immediately preceding this pixel.
Identify the contiguous block of white pixels encountered.
Determine the color of the non-white pixel immediately to the left of this white block.
Replace the identified white block with this non-white color.
All other pixels remain unchanged.
