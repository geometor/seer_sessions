GridType: 2D (single row)
Input Grid Properties:
  - Shape: (1, Width) where Width varies.
  - Contains contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of colors.
  - Features a recurring pattern: [Optional White Segment] -> [Non-White Segment A] -> [White Segment B] -> [Rightmost Non-White Pixel C] -> [Optional Trailing White Segment]
Output Grid Properties:
  - Shape: Identical to the input grid's shape (1, Width).
Transformation Rule:
  - Objects: Segments of contiguous pixels of the same color in the single row.
  - Action: Fill operation.
  - Target Object: The contiguous segment of white (0) pixels (Segment B) located immediately to the left of the rightmost non-white pixel (Pixel C) in the row.
  - Source Color Object: The pixel immediately to the left of Segment B (this pixel belongs to Segment A).
  - Process:
    1. Identify the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (Pixel C).
    2. Scan leftwards from the column index immediately preceding Pixel C.
    3. Identify the contiguous segment of white pixels (Segment B) encountered during this scan. Record the start and end column indices of this segment.
    4. Identify the color of the pixel immediately to the left of Segment B's starting column index. This is the `fill_color`.
    5. Modify the input grid by replacing all pixels within Segment B (from its start index to its end index, inclusive) with the `fill_color`.
  - Constraints: The transformation only applies if Segment B exists and is preceded by a non-white pixel.
Pixel Colors Used:
  - Background: white (0)
  - Segment A Colors: magenta (6), green (3), gray (5)
  - Segment B Color (Input): white (0)
  - Pixel C Color: yellow (4)
  - Segment B Color (Output): Same as Segment A color.
