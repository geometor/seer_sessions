Notably, there's a block of non-white color, followed by one or more white pixels, and then terminated by a non-white pixel (yellow in all examples), potentially followed by more white pixels.\n*   **Transformation:** The primary change occurs in the block of white pixels located *before* the last non-white pixel in the sequence. This block of white pixels is replaced by the color of the block immediately preceding it. The overall length of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Let this be fill_color.\n  - Replace all pixels in block B with fill_color.\n  - All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.\nObject Interaction:\n  - A block of non-white pixels (A) effectively \"fills\" an adjacent gap of white pixels (B) that separates it from the final non-white pixel (C).\n```"
