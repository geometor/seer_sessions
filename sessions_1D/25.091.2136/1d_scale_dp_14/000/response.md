Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 1D grids (single rows) of colored pixels (integers 0-9).
*   **Key Colors:** The examples prominently feature white (0), magenta (6), green (3), gray (5), and yellow (4).
*   **Structure:** The inputs consist of blocks of colors. Notably, there's a block of non-white color, followed by one or more white pixels, and then terminated by a non-white pixel (yellow in all examples), potentially followed by more white pixels.
*   **Transformation:** The primary change occurs in the block of white pixels located *before* the last non-white pixel in the sequence. This block of white pixels is replaced by the color of the block immediately preceding it. The overall length of the grid remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
GridType: 1D
Input Grid Structure:
  - Contains blocks of contiguous colors.
  - Features a pattern: [Optional Leading Whites] -> [Non-White Block A] -> [White Block B] -> [Last Non-White Pixel C] -> [Optional Trailing Whites]
Output Grid Structure:
  - Derived from the input grid.
  - Length is identical to the input grid.
Transformation Rule:
  - Identify the index of the rightmost non-white pixel (C).
  - Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (B) immediately to the left of C.
  - Identify the color of the pixel immediately to the left of block B (this pixel belongs to block A). Let this be fill_color.
  - Replace all pixels in block B with fill_color.
  - All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.
Object Interaction:
  - A block of non-white pixels (A) effectively "fills" an adjacent gap of white pixels (B) that separates it from the final non-white pixel (C).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Locate the position (index) of the rightmost non-white pixel in the grid.
3.  Scan backwards (leftwards) from the position *before* the rightmost non-white pixel.
4.  Identify the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels encountered during this backward scan.
5.  Determine the color of the pixel immediately to the left of this sequence of white pixels. This color must be non-white.
6.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
7.  In the output grid, change the color of all pixels identified in step 4 (the sequence of white pixels) to the color determined in step 5.
8.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their corresponding input positions.
