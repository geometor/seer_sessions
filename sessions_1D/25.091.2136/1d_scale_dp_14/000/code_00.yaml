GridType: 1D
Input Grid Structure:
  - Contains blocks of contiguous colors.
  - Features a pattern: [Optional Leading Whites] -> [Non-White Block A] -> [White Block B] -> [Last Non-White Pixel C] -> [Optional Trailing Whites]
Output Grid Structure:
  - Derived from the input grid.
  - Length is identical to the input grid.
Transformation Rule:
  - Identify the index of the rightmost non-white pixel (C).
  - Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (B) immediately to the left of C.
  - Identify the color of the pixel immediately to the left of block B (this pixel belongs to block A). Let this be fill_color.
  - Replace all pixels in block B with fill_color.
  - All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.
Object Interaction:
  - A block of non-white pixels (A) effectively "fills" an adjacent gap of white pixels (B) that separates it from the final non-white pixel (C).
