Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 1D grids (single rows) of colored pixels (integers 0-9).
*   **Key Colors:** The examples prominently feature white (0), magenta (6), green (3), gray (5), and yellow (4).
*   **Structure:** The inputs consist of blocks of colors. Notably, there's a block of non-white color, followed by one or more white pixels, and then terminated by a non-white pixel (yellow in all examples), potentially followed by more white pixels.
*   **Transformation:** The primary change occurs in the block of white pixels located *before* the last non-white pixel in the sequence. This block of white pixels is replaced by the color of the block immediately preceding it. The overall length of the grid remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
GridType: 1D
Input Grid Structure:
  - Contains blocks of contiguous colors.
  - Features a pattern: [Optional Leading Whites] -> [Non-White Block A] -> [White Block B] -> [Last Non-White Pixel C] -> [Optional Trailing Whites]
Output Grid Structure:
  - Derived from the input grid.
  - Length is identical to the input grid.
Transformation Rule:
  - Identify the index of the rightmost non-white pixel (C).
  - Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (B) immediately to the left of C.
  - Identify the color of the pixel immediately to the left of block B (this pixel belongs to block A). Let this be fill_color.
  - Replace all pixels in block B with fill_color.
  - All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.
Object Interaction:
  - A block of non-white pixels (A) effectively "fills" an adjacent gap of white pixels (B) that separates it from the final non-white pixel (C).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Locate the position (index) of the rightmost non-white pixel in the grid.
3.  Scan backwards (leftwards) from the position *before* the rightmost non-white pixel.
4.  Identify the contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels encountered during this backward scan.
5.  Determine the color of the pixel immediately to the left of this sequence of white pixels. This color must be non-white.
6.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
7.  In the output grid, change the color of all pixels identified in step 4 (the sequence of white pixels) to the color determined in step 5.
8.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their corresponding input positions.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous attempt failed due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the input data format. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" indicates that the `input_grid` was treated as a multi-dimensional NumPy array (likely 2D with one row) within the testing environment, while the provided code expected a simple 1D Python list.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input format is indeed a 2D NumPy array with a single row.
2.  Adapt the code to handle this 2D NumPy array structure, primarily by accessing elements using `[0, col_index]` instead of just `[index]`.
3.  Verify that the core transformation logic identified previously remains correct under this revised format.

**Metrics:**

Let's confirm the shape of the input data using `tool_code`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
GridType: 2D (single row)
Input Grid Properties:
  - Shape: (1, Width) where Width varies.
  - Contains contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of colors.
  - Features a recurring pattern: [Optional White Segment] -> [Non-White Segment A] -> [White Segment B] -> [Rightmost Non-White Pixel C] -> [Optional Trailing White Segment]
Output Grid Properties:
  - Shape: Identical to the input grid's shape (1, Width).
Transformation Rule:
  - Objects: Segments of contiguous pixels of the same color in the single row.
  - Action: Fill operation.
  - Target Object: The contiguous segment of white (0) pixels (Segment B) located immediately to the left of the rightmost non-white pixel (Pixel C) in the row.
  - Source Color Object: The pixel immediately to the left of Segment B (this pixel belongs to Segment A).
  - Process:
    1. Identify the column index of the rightmost non-white pixel (Pixel C).
    2. Scan leftwards from the column index immediately preceding Pixel C.
    3. Identify the contiguous segment of white pixels (Segment B) encountered during this scan. Record the start and end column indices of this segment.
    4. Identify the color of the pixel immediately to the left of Segment B's starting column index. This is the `fill_color`.
    5. Modify the input grid by replacing all pixels within Segment B (from its start index to its end index, inclusive) with the `fill_color`.
  - Constraints: The transformation only applies if Segment B exists and is preceded by a non-white pixel.
Pixel Colors Used:
  - Background: white (0)
  - Segment A Colors: magenta (6), green (3), gray (5)
  - Segment B Color (Input): white (0)
  - Pixel C Color: yellow (4)
  - Segment B Color (Output): Same as Segment A color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array with one row.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Determine the number of columns (`width`) in the grid.
4.  Iterate backwards from the rightmost column (`width - 1`) to the leftmost column (0) to find the column index (`last_non_white_col`) of the rightmost pixel that is not white (0).
5.  If no non-white pixel is found, or if it's in the very first column (index 0), return the unmodified output grid copy.
6.  Initialize variables to track the start (`white_block_start_col`) and end (`white_block_end_col`) column indices of the target white segment, setting them to an invalid state (e.g., -1).
7.  Iterate backwards (leftwards) starting from the column index immediately to the left of the rightmost non-white pixel (`last_non_white_col - 1`) down to column 0.
8.  In this backward scan:
    *   If the current pixel at `[0, current_col]` is white (0):
        *   If `white_block_end_col` is still -1, set it to `current_col` (this marks the rightmost extent of the white block).
        *   Update `white_block_start_col` to `current_col` (this marks the current leftmost extent of the white block found so far).
    *   If the current pixel is *not* white:
        *   Check if a white block has been identified (i.e., `white_block_end_col` is not -1).
        *   If yes, this non-white pixel's color is the `fill_color`. Store this color.
        *   Modify the output grid: Iterate from `white_block_start_col` to `white_block_end_col` (inclusive) and set the pixel color at `[0, col]` to the `fill_color`.
        *   Stop the backward scan and return the modified output grid.
        *   If no white block had been identified (`white_block_end_col` is still -1), it means the pixel immediately left of the `last_non_white_col` wasn't white, so the pattern doesn't match. Stop the backward scan.
9.  If the backward scan completes without finding the pattern (e.g., reached column 0 while still scanning the white block, or never found a white block adjacent to the rightmost non-white pixel), return the unmodified output grid copy.
