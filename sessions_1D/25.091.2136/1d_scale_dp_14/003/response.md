Identify the rightmost non-white pixel in the 1D input grid (represented as a 1xN 2D array).
Scan leftwards from the column immediately preceding this pixel.
Identify the contiguous block (segment) of white pixels encountered.
Determine the color of the non-white pixel immediately to the left of this white block.
Replace the identified white block segment in the output grid with this non-white color.
