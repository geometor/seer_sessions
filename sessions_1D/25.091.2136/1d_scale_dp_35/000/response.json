            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n### Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 1-dimensional grids (row vectors) of size 1x21.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors are white (0) as the background, red (2) acting as a boundary marker, and another non-white color (yellow-4, azure-8, blue-1) forming a contiguous block.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a specific color (not white or red). To the right of this block, possibly separated by white pixels, there is a single red pixel.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that the white pixels located between the end of the colored block and the red pixel are filled with the color of that block.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation is a \"fill\" or \"extend\" operation. The colored block extends rightward, replacing white pixels, until it reaches the position immediately preceding the red pixel. The red pixel itself remains unchanged and acts as a stopping point for the extension.\n\n### YAML Facts Documentation\n\n"

Scan the row from left to right to find the contiguous block of non-white, non-red pixels. Record its color (let's call it `fill_color`) and the index of its rightmost pixel (let's call it `block_end_index`).\n3.  Continue scanning the row from `block_end_index + 1` to the right to find the index of the red (2) pixel (let's call it `stopper_index`).\n4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n5.  Iterate through the indices from `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `stopper_index`. For each index `i` in this range:\n    *   Set the pixel at index `i` in the output grid to `fill_color`.\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
