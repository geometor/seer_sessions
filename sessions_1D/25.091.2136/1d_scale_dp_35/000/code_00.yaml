task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and a red stopper pixel.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
  size: 1x21 (in examples)
objects:
  - type: color_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color (not white or red).
    properties:
      - color: Varies (yellow, azure, blue in examples)
      - location: Somewhere in the row.
      - count: 1 per input grid.
  - type: stopper_pixel
    description: A single red pixel.
    properties:
      - color: Red (2)
      - location: To the right of the color_block.
      - count: 1 per input grid.
  - type: background_pixels
    description: White pixels filling the rest of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - location: Surrounding the color_block and stopper_pixel, potentially between them.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The stopper_pixel is always located to the right of the color_block.
  - type: spatial
    description: There might be white background_pixels between the end of the color_block and the stopper_pixel.
actions:
  - name: identify_elements
    description: Locate the color_block (its color and end position) and the stopper_pixel (its position).
  - name: fill_gap
    description: Change the color of all white pixels between the end position of the color_block and the position of the stopper_pixel to the color of the color_block.
goal: Extend the color_block rightwards until it reaches the stopper_pixel.
