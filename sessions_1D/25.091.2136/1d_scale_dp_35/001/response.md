"""
Fills the gap between a colored block and a red stopper pixel in a 1D row grid.

The transformation identifies a contiguous horizontal block of a single color 
(not white=0 or red=2). It also identifies a single red pixel (color 2) located 
somewhere to the right of this block. The process then fills any white pixels (color 0) 
that lie strictly between the end of the colored block and the position of the 
red pixel with the color of the block. The colored block effectively extends 
rightwards until it meets the red stopper pixel.
