**Perception:**

The input and output are single rows (1D arrays) of colored pixels. Each example features a contiguous block of a specific color (yellow, orange, gray) followed by some white pixels, and then a single magenta pixel. The transformation involves extending the contiguous block of the specific color to the right, replacing the intermediate white pixels until the position just before the magenta pixel. The magenta pixel and pixels to its right (if any) remain unchanged. The pixels to the left of the main color block also remain unchanged. The core action is a "fill" operation between the end of a color block and a specific marker pixel (magenta).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  colors_present:
    - white (0) - background/fillable space
    - yellow (4), orange (7), gray (5) - primary color block
    - magenta (6) - marker/boundary pixel
objects:
  - type: color_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (yellow, orange, or gray in examples).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 4, 7, 5).
      - start_index: The index of the leftmost pixel of the block.
      - end_index: The index of the rightmost pixel of the block.
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: A single magenta (6) pixel.
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - index: The position of the magenta pixel in the row.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The color block appears to the left of the marker pixel.
  - type: separation
    description: There is a sequence of white (0) pixels between the right end of the color block and the marker pixel.
actions:
  - type: identify
    description: Locate the main color block (longest contiguous non-white sequence) and determine its color and rightmost index.
  - type: identify
    description: Locate the magenta (6) marker pixel and determine its index.
  - type: fill
    description: Change the color of the white (0) pixels located between the rightmost index of the color block and the index of the marker pixel.
    properties:
      - target_color: white (0)
      - fill_color: The color of the identified color block.
      - start_index: Index immediately after the color block's end index.
      - end_index: Index immediately before the marker pixel's index.
transformation_goal:
  - Extend the main color block rightwards, filling the intervening white space until it reaches the magenta marker pixel, without changing the marker pixel itself or any pixels beyond it.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the main contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Record its color (let's call it `fill_color`) and the index of its rightmost pixel (let's call it `block_end_index`).
2.  Identify the index of the magenta (6) pixel (let's call it `marker_index`).
3.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
4.  Iterate through the indices from `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `marker_index`.
5.  For each index in this range, if the pixel at that index in the input row is white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output row to `fill_color`.
6.  Return the modified output row.
