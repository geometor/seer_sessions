task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  colors_present:
    - white (0) - background/fillable space
    - yellow (4), orange (7), gray (5) - primary color block
    - magenta (6) - marker/boundary pixel
objects:
  - type: color_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (yellow, orange, or gray in examples).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 4, 7, 5).
      - start_index: The index of the leftmost pixel of the block.
      - end_index: The index of the rightmost pixel of the block.
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: A single magenta (6) pixel.
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - index: The position of the magenta pixel in the row.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The color block appears to the left of the marker pixel.
  - type: separation
    description: There is a sequence of white (0) pixels between the right end of the color block and the marker pixel.
actions:
  - type: identify
    description: Locate the main color block (longest contiguous non-white sequence) and determine its color and rightmost index.
  - type: identify
    description: Locate the magenta (6) marker pixel and determine its index.
  - type: fill
    description: Change the color of the white (0) pixels located between the rightmost index of the color block and the index of the marker pixel.
    properties:
      - target_color: white (0)
      - fill_color: The color of the identified color block.
      - start_index: Index immediately after the color block's end index.
      - end_index: Index immediately before the marker pixel's index.
transformation_goal:
  - Extend the main color block rightwards, filling the intervening white space until it reaches the magenta marker pixel, without changing the marker pixel itself or any pixels beyond it.
