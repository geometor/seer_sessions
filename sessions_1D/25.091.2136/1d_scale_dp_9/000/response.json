Each example features a contiguous block of a specific color (yellow, orange, gray) followed by some white pixels, and then a single magenta pixel. The transformation involves extending the contiguous block of the specific color to the right, replacing the intermediate white pixels until the position just before the magenta pixel. The magenta pixel and pixels to its right (if any) remain unchanged. The pixels to the left of the main color block also remain unchanged. The core action is a \"fill\" operation between the end of a color block and a specific marker pixel (magenta).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
