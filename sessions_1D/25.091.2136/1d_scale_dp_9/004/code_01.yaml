task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  grid_size: Constant (1x25 in all examples) # Observation updated
  colors_present:
    - white (0) - background/fillable space
    - yellow (4), orange (7), gray (5) - primary block colors observed
    - magenta (6) - marker/boundary pixel
objects:
  - type: primary_color_block
    description: The first contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels found when scanning the row from left to right.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 4, 7, 5).
      - start_index: The index of the leftmost pixel of this block.
      - end_index: The index of the rightmost pixel of this block.
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: The first occurrence of a magenta (6) pixel when scanning the row from left to right.
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - index: The position (index) of this magenta pixel in the row.
  - type: fill_zone
    description: The sequence of pixels located strictly between the end of the primary_color_block and the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - start_index: `primary_color_block.end_index + 1`
      - end_index: `marker_pixel.index - 1`
      - exists: True only if `marker_pixel.index > primary_color_block.end_index + 1`.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_ordering
    description: The primary_color_block appears before the marker_pixel in all examples.
  - type: separation
    description: A sequence of white (0) pixels exists within the fill_zone in the input grid.
actions:
  - type: find
    description: Locate the primary_color_block and determine its color (`fill_color`) and `end_index`.
  - type: find
    description: Locate the marker_pixel and determine its `index`.
  - type: conditional_fill
    description: If a primary_color_block and a marker_pixel are found, and the marker_pixel's index is at least two positions greater than the block's end_index, then proceed to fill.
  - type: fill_pixels
    description: Within the fill_zone (indices from `block_end_index + 1` up to, but not including, `marker_index`), change the color of all pixels that are currently white (0) to the `fill_color` identified from the primary_color_block.
transformation_goal:
  - Extend the primary color block rightwards by filling the intervening white space with the block's color, stopping just before the magenta marker pixel. Preserve all other pixels (the block itself, pixels before it, the marker, and pixels after the marker).
