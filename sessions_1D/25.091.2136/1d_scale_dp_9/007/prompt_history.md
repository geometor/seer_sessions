**Perception:**

The input and output are single rows (1D arrays) of colored pixels. Each example features a contiguous block of a specific color (yellow, orange, gray) followed by some white pixels, and then a single magenta pixel. The transformation involves extending the contiguous block of the specific color to the right, replacing the intermediate white pixels until the position just before the magenta pixel. The magenta pixel and pixels to its right (if any) remain unchanged. The pixels to the left of the main color block also remain unchanged. The core action is a "fill" operation between the end of a color block and a specific marker pixel (magenta).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  colors_present:
    - white (0) - background/fillable space
    - yellow (4), orange (7), gray (5) - primary color block
    - magenta (6) - marker/boundary pixel
objects:
  - type: color_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (yellow, orange, or gray in examples).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 4, 7, 5).
      - start_index: The index of the leftmost pixel of the block.
      - end_index: The index of the rightmost pixel of the block.
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: A single magenta (6) pixel.
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - index: The position of the magenta pixel in the row.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The color block appears to the left of the marker pixel.
  - type: separation
    description: There is a sequence of white (0) pixels between the right end of the color block and the marker pixel.
actions:
  - type: identify
    description: Locate the main color block (longest contiguous non-white sequence) and determine its color and rightmost index.
  - type: identify
    description: Locate the magenta (6) marker pixel and determine its index.
  - type: fill
    description: Change the color of the white (0) pixels located between the rightmost index of the color block and the index of the marker pixel.
    properties:
      - target_color: white (0)
      - fill_color: The color of the identified color block.
      - start_index: Index immediately after the color block's end index.
      - end_index: Index immediately before the marker pixel's index.
transformation_goal:
  - Extend the main color block rightwards, filling the intervening white space until it reaches the magenta marker pixel, without changing the marker pixel itself or any pixels beyond it.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the main contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Record its color (let's call it `fill_color`) and the index of its rightmost pixel (let's call it `block_end_index`).
2.  Identify the index of the magenta (6) pixel (let's call it `marker_index`).
3.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
4.  Iterate through the indices from `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `marker_index`.
5.  For each index in this range, if the pixel at that index in the input row is white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output row to `fill_color`.
6.  Return the modified output row.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: filling the gap between the end of the first non-white color block and the first magenta marker pixel with the block's color. The provided Python code attempted to implement this logic. However, the code failed on all training examples with a NumPy error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous."

The metrics gathered using `tool_code` confirm that:
1.  The input and output grids are single rows.
2.  The key elements are indeed the *first* contiguous block of non-white color and the *first* magenta (6) pixel.
3.  The transformation involves filling *only* the white (0) pixels located strictly between the end of the block and the marker pixel.
4.  The block's color is used for filling.
5.  The marker pixel and anything to its right remain unchanged.
6.  Pixels to the left of the block remain unchanged.

The error suggests an issue where a boolean condition is evaluated on a multi-element NumPy array instead of a single boolean value. Although a line-by-line trace of the previous code based on the examples *appears* logically sound and operates on scalars where expected, the error indicates a flaw in the implementation. The logic described in the Natural Language Program remains consistent with the examples.

**Strategy:**

The plan is to refine the Natural Language Program and the YAML facts based on the confirmed metrics. The core logic is sound, but the implementation needs careful debugging. The `coder` phase must ensure that all comparisons and assignments correctly handle NumPy arrays and scalars to avoid the ambiguity error. Explicit checks for the existence and relative positions of the block and marker are crucial before attempting the fill operation.

    description: The first contiguous sequence of identical non-white, non-magenta pixels encountered when scanning from left to right.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (variable, e.g., 4, 7, 5). Let's call this 'fill_color'.
      - start_index: The index of the leftmost pixel of this block.
      - end_index: The index of the rightmost pixel of this block. Let's call this 'block_end_index'.

      For each index in this range, if the pixel at that index in the *input* row is white (0),
      change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* row to 'fill_color'.
      Otherwise, make no changes to the pixels in this zone.
transformation_goal:
  - Create an output row by copying the input row.
  - Identify the first color block and the first magenta marker.
  - If they exist and are separated by at least one pixel, fill the white pixels strictly between them with the color of the block.
  - Return the potentially modified row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input row (which is a single list of integers) to serve as the output row.
2.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the *first* contiguous block of identical pixels that are not white (0) and not magenta (6).
    *   If found, record its color (`fill_color`) and the index of its rightmost pixel (`block_end_index`).
    *   If not found, proceed to step 6 (return the unchanged copy).
3.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the *first* magenta (6) pixel.
    *   If found, record its index (`marker_index`).
    *   If not found, proceed to step 6 (return the unchanged copy).
4.  Check if a gap exists between the identified block and the marker: verify if `marker_index` is greater than `block_end_index + 1`.
5.  If a block and a marker were found *and* a gap exists (`marker_index > block_end_index + 1`):
    *   Iterate through the pixel indices starting from `block_end_index + 1` up to (but *not* including) `marker_index`.
    *   For each index `i` in this range:
        *   Check the color of the pixel at index `i` in the *original input* row.
        *   If this pixel's color is white (0), change the color of the pixel at index `i` in the *output* row to `fill_color`.
        *   If the pixel's color is not white, leave the pixel at index `i` in the *output* row unchanged.
6.  Return the modified output row (within a list, maintaining the 1xN grid structure).
