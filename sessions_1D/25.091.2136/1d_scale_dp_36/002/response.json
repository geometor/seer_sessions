Use a.any() or a.all()\" clearly indicates that the initial assumption of the input being a 1D list was incorrect. The data is being passed as a NumPy array, likely representing a 2D grid, even though the initial prompt presented them linearly. Comparisons and conditional checks on NumPy arrays behave differently than on standard Python lists, causing this error.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the data structure is indeed a 2D NumPy array using `tool_code`.\n2.  Revise the understanding of the task to operate within a 2D grid context. The core logic (find marker, find adjacent white space, find source color, fill) likely remains the same, but the implementation needs to account for row and column indices.\n3.  Update the `Facts` and `Natural Language Program` to reflect this 2D structure and refined logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"
