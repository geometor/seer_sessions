White (0) seems to be a background or changeable color. Orange (7) appears to be a special marker or boundary pixel. Red, Blue, and Gray seem to be 'fill' or 'source' colors.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes consistently occur in the vicinity of the Orange (7) pixel. Specifically, White (0) pixels located immediately to the left of the Orange pixel are modified.\n4.  **Pattern:** The White pixels immediately preceding the Orange pixel are replaced by the color of the pixel found immediately to the left of that block of White pixels. The Orange pixel itself and any pixels to its right remain unchanged. The block of the source color effectively expands rightward, overwriting the adjacent White pixels until it reaches the Orange pixel.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Its color is the Source_Color.\nRelationships:\n  - The Fill_Block is always located immediately to the left of the Marker_Pixel.\n  - The Source_Pixel is always located immediately to the left of the Fill_Block.\nActions:\n  - Identify the location (index) of the Marker_Pixel (Orange, 7).\n  - Identify the contiguous block of White (0) pixels immediately to the left of the Marker_Pixel.\n  - Identify the color of the pixel immediately to the left of this White block (Source_Color).\n  - Replace the color of all pixels within the identified White block with the Source_Color.\nConstraints:\n  - The transformation only affects White pixels immediately preceding the Orange marker.\n  - The Orange marker and pixels to its right are unchanged.\n  - Pixels far to the left of the affected area are unchanged.\n```"

Starting from the index immediately to the left of the Orange pixel, move leftward as long as the pixels encountered are White (0). Record the indices of these White pixels.\n4.  If one or more White pixels were found adjacent to the left of the Orange pixel, determine the color of the pixel located at the index immediately to the left of the first (leftmost) identified White pixel. This is the \"fill color\".\n5.  In the output grid, change the color of all the identified White pixels (from step 3) to the \"fill color\" (determined in step 4).\n6.
