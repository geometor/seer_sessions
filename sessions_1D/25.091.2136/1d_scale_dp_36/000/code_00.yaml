Task: Fill white space left of a marker
Examples: 3
Grid_Type: 1D array (interpreted as 1xN grid)
Colors:
  - Marker: Orange (7)
  - Background/Target: White (0)
  - Source_Colors: Red (2), Blue (1), Gray (5) - any non-white, non-orange color potentially
Objects:
  - Marker_Pixel: A single pixel with the color Orange (7).
  - Fill_Block: A contiguous sequence of one or more White (0) pixels.
  - Source_Pixel: The pixel immediately to the left of the Fill_Block. Its color is the Source_Color.
Relationships:
  - The Fill_Block is always located immediately to the left of the Marker_Pixel.
  - The Source_Pixel is always located immediately to the left of the Fill_Block.
Actions:
  - Identify the location (index) of the Marker_Pixel (Orange, 7).
  - Identify the contiguous block of White (0) pixels immediately to the left of the Marker_Pixel.
  - Identify the color of the pixel immediately to the left of this White block (Source_Color).
  - Replace the color of all pixels within the identified White block with the Source_Color.
Constraints:
  - The transformation only affects White pixels immediately preceding the Orange marker.
  - The Orange marker and pixels to its right are unchanged.
  - Pixels far to the left of the affected area are unchanged.
