Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data are presented as 1D arrays, which can be interpreted as 1xN grids (single rows).
2.  **Key Colors:** The colors involved are Red (2), Blue (1), Gray (5), White (0), and Orange (7). White (0) seems to be a background or changeable color. Orange (7) appears to be a special marker or boundary pixel. Red, Blue, and Gray seem to be 'fill' or 'source' colors.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes consistently occur in the vicinity of the Orange (7) pixel. Specifically, White (0) pixels located immediately to the left of the Orange pixel are modified.
4.  **Pattern:** The White pixels immediately preceding the Orange pixel are replaced by the color of the pixel found immediately to the left of that block of White pixels. The Orange pixel itself and any pixels to its right remain unchanged. The block of the source color effectively expands rightward, overwriting the adjacent White pixels until it reaches the Orange pixel.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Fill white space left of a marker
Examples: 3
Grid_Type: 1D array (interpreted as 1xN grid)
Colors:
  - Marker: Orange (7)
  - Background/Target: White (0)
  - Source_Colors: Red (2), Blue (1), Gray (5) - any non-white, non-orange color potentially
Objects:
  - Marker_Pixel: A single pixel with the color Orange (7).
  - Fill_Block: A contiguous sequence of one or more White (0) pixels.
  - Source_Pixel: The pixel immediately to the left of the Fill_Block. Its color is the Source_Color.
Relationships:
  - The Fill_Block is always located immediately to the left of the Marker_Pixel.
  - The Source_Pixel is always located immediately to the left of the Fill_Block.
Actions:
  - Identify the location (index) of the Marker_Pixel (Orange, 7).
  - Identify the contiguous block of White (0) pixels immediately to the left of the Marker_Pixel.
  - Identify the color of the pixel immediately to the left of this White block (Source_Color).
  - Replace the color of all pixels within the identified White block with the Source_Color.
Constraints:
  - The transformation only affects White pixels immediately preceding the Orange marker.
  - The Orange marker and pixels to its right are unchanged.
  - Pixels far to the left of the affected area are unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the index of the Orange pixel (7).
3.  Starting from the index immediately to the left of the Orange pixel, move leftward as long as the pixels encountered are White (0). Record the indices of these White pixels.
4.  If one or more White pixels were found adjacent to the left of the Orange pixel, determine the color of the pixel located at the index immediately to the left of the first (leftmost) identified White pixel. This is the "fill color".
5.  In the output grid, change the color of all the identified White pixels (from step 3) to the "fill color" (determined in step 4).
6.  Return the modified output grid.

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" clearly indicates that the initial assumption of the input being a 1D list was incorrect. The data is being passed as a NumPy array, likely representing a 2D grid, even though the initial prompt presented them linearly. Comparisons and conditional checks on NumPy arrays behave differently than on standard Python lists, causing this error.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the data structure is indeed a 2D NumPy array using `tool_code`.
2.  Revise the understanding of the task to operate within a 2D grid context. The core logic (find marker, find adjacent white space, find source color, fill) likely remains the same, but the implementation needs to account for row and column indices.
3.  Update the `Facts` and `Natural Language Program` to reflect this 2D structure and refined logic.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Fill horizontal white space left of a marker within a row
Examples: 3
Grid_Type: 2D NumPy array (all examples are 1xN, single-row grids)
Colors:
  - Marker: Orange (7)
  - Background/Target: White (0)
  - Source_Colors: Any non-white, non-orange color (Red(2), Blue(1), Gray(5) observed)
Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D NumPy array of integers representing colors.
  - Marker_Pixel: The pixel with the color Orange (7). There appears to be only one per grid.
  - Fill_Segment: A contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more White (0) pixels within a single row.
  - Source_Pixel: The pixel located immediately to the left of the Fill_Segment, within the same row.
Relationships:
  - The Fill_Segment is always located immediately to the left of the Marker_Pixel, within the same row.
  - The Source_Pixel is always located immediately to the left of the Fill_Segment, within the same row.
Actions:
  - Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  - Within each row, find the column index of the Marker_Pixel (Orange, 7), if present.
  - If a Marker_Pixel is found in a row:
    - Starting from the column index immediately to the left of the Marker_Pixel, search leftward within the same row as long as the pixels encountered are White (0). Record the column indices of these White pixels.
    - If one or more adjacent White pixels were found:
        - Identify the column index of the pixel immediately to the left of the leftmost identified White pixel (this is the Source_Pixel's column index).
        - Get the color of the Source_Pixel. This is the "fill color".
        - In the corresponding row of the output grid, change the color of all identified White pixels (from the search step) to the "fill color".
Constraints:
  - The transformation only affects White pixels immediately preceding an Orange marker *within the same row*.
  - Only horizontal adjacency (leftward) is considered for finding the White segment and the source pixel.
  - The Orange marker itself and pixels to its right, or in other rows, are unchanged relative to this specific transformation rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid (2D NumPy array) to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the current row index (`r`).
3.  Within each row (`r`), scan from left to right to find the column index (`marker_c`) of the first occurrence of the Orange pixel (7).
4.  If an Orange pixel is found at `(r, marker_c)`:
    a.  Initialize an empty list to store the column indices of the White pixels to be filled (`white_cols`).
    b.  Set the current column index to check (`current_c`) to `marker_c - 1`.
    c.  While `current_c` is a valid column index (>= 0) and the pixel at `(r, current_c)` in the input grid is White (0):
        i.  Add `current_c` to the beginning of the `white_cols` list (to maintain left-to-right order later).
        ii. Decrement `current_c` by 1.
    d.  If the `white_cols` list is not empty (meaning adjacent White pixels were found):
        i.  Determine the column index of the source pixel: `source_c = white_cols[0] - 1`.
        ii. If `source_c` is a valid column index (>= 0):
            1.  Get the `fill_color` from the input grid at `(r, source_c)`.
            2.  Iterate through each column index (`c`) in the `white_cols` list.
            3.  In the output grid, set the pixel value at `(r, c)` to the `fill_color`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
