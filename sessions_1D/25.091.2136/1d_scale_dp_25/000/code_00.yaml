task_type: sequence_transformation_1d
elements:
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: green (3)
    role: Marks the end position for the target sequence. Always present once.
  - type: target_sequence
    color: white (0)
    location: Contiguous block immediately preceding the green pixel.
    role: This sequence is replaced.
  - type: fill_color_pixel
    color: variable (non-white, non-green)
    location: Immediately precedes the target sequence (white block).
    role: Determines the color used for replacement.
  - type: background_pixels
    color: variable (can include white, but not the target sequence)
    location: All other pixels not part of the target sequence, marker pixel, or fill color pixel (in its specific role).
    role: Remain unchanged in their positions relative to the start/end or the transformed block.
transformation:
  type: sequence_replacement
  steps:
    1: Identify the green marker pixel (3).
    2: Identify the contiguous sequence of white pixels (0) immediately before the green pixel.
    3: Identify the color of the pixel immediately before this white sequence (the fill color).
    4: Replace the white sequence with the fill color, repeating it for the length of the original white sequence.
constraints:
  - The input sequence always contains exactly one green pixel (3).
  - There is always a contiguous sequence of one or more white pixels (0) immediately before the green pixel.
  - There is always a non-white pixel immediately before the sequence of white pixels.
  - The length of the sequence remains constant.
