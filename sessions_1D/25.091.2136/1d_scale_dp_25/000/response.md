Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are single rows (1D arrays) of colored pixels.
2.  **Key Colors:** The colors green (`3`) and white (`0`) seem crucial. The green pixel appears exactly once in each input and output. White pixels appear in sequences, particularly right before the green pixel. Other colors (red `2`, azure `8`, magenta `6`) also appear and seem involved in the transformation.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes consistently occur in the region immediately preceding the green (`3`) pixel. Specifically, a sequence of white (`0`) pixels before the green pixel is altered.
4.  **The Change:** The sequence of white pixels located directly before the green pixel is replaced. The replacement color is the same as the color of the pixel immediately preceding the sequence of white pixels. The number of replacement pixels matches the number of white pixels they replace.
5.  **Consistency:** The length of the row remains the same from input to output in all examples. The position of the green pixel shifts left because the preceding white pixels are replaced, but the elements *after* the green pixel maintain their relative order and values. The elements *before* the affected white sequence also remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation_1d
elements:
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: green (3)
    role: Marks the end position for the target sequence. Always present once.
  - type: target_sequence
    color: white (0)
    location: Contiguous block immediately preceding the green pixel.
    role: This sequence is replaced.
  - type: fill_color_pixel
    color: variable (non-white, non-green)
    location: Immediately precedes the target sequence (white block).
    role: Determines the color used for replacement.
  - type: background_pixels
    color: variable (can include white, but not the target sequence)
    location: All other pixels not part of the target sequence, marker pixel, or fill color pixel (in its specific role).
    role: Remain unchanged in their positions relative to the start/end or the transformed block.
transformation:
  type: sequence_replacement
  steps:
    1: Identify the green marker pixel (3).
    2: Identify the contiguous sequence of white pixels (0) immediately before the green pixel.
    3: Identify the color of the pixel immediately before this white sequence (the fill color).
    4: Replace the white sequence with the fill color, repeating it for the length of the original white sequence.
constraints:
  - The input sequence always contains exactly one green pixel (3).
  - There is always a contiguous sequence of one or more white pixels (0) immediately before the green pixel.
  - There is always a non-white pixel immediately before the sequence of white pixels.
  - The length of the sequence remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Locate the green pixel (`3`) in the input sequence.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) that is located immediately to the left of the green pixel.
3.  Determine the color of the pixel that is located immediately to the left of this block of white pixels. Call this the "fill color".
4.  Replace each white pixel within the identified block with the "fill color".
5.  Leave all other pixels in the sequence unchanged. The output is the modified sequence.
