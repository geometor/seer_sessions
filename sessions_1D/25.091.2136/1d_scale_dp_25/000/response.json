The green pixel appears exactly once in each input and output. White pixels appear in sequences, particularly right before the green pixel. Other colors (red `2`, azure `8`, magenta `6`) also appear and seem involved in the transformation.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes consistently occur in the region immediately preceding the green (`3`) pixel. Specifically, a sequence of white (`0`) pixels before the green pixel is altered.\n4.  **The Change:** The sequence of white pixels located directly before the green pixel is replaced. The replacement color is the same as the color of the pixel immediately preceding the sequence of white pixels. The number of replacement pixels matches the number of white pixels they replace.\n5.  **Consistency:** The length of the row remains the same from input to output in all examples. The position of the green pixel shifts left because the preceding white pixels are replaced, but the elements *after* the green pixel maintain their relative order and values. The elements *before* the affected white sequence also remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
