Each example features a sequence starting with white (0), followed by a long stretch of a single non-white color (magenta 6 in example 1 and 3, yellow 4 in example 2), then three white pixels (0 0 0), and finally a single maroon pixel (9).\n\nThe transformation appears to focus on the `0 0 0 9` pattern at the end of the input sequence. Specifically, the three white pixels (0 0 0) immediately preceding the final maroon pixel (9) are replaced. The replacement pixels take on the color of the long, dominant sequence found earlier in the input. The rest of the sequence, including the initial white pixel(s), the main color block, and the final maroon pixel, remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
