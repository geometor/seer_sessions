Data:
  - type: 1D array (or 1xN grid) of integers representing colors.
  - structure:
      input: Starts with white(s), followed by a contiguous block of a single 'main' color, followed by three whites [0, 0, 0], ending with a single maroon [9].
      output: Same as input, but the [0, 0, 0] sequence is replaced by three pixels of the 'main' color.
Objects:
  - identifier: main_color_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of a single color (not white or maroon) that appears after initial white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Varies between examples (magenta 6, yellow 4).
      - length: Varies.
  - identifier: white_spacer
    description: A sequence of three white pixels [0, 0, 0].
    location: Immediately precedes the final maroon pixel in the input.
  - identifier: terminator
    description: A single maroon pixel [9].
    location: The last element in the input and output arrays.
Relationships:
  - white_spacer is located between the main_color_block and the terminator in the input.
Actions:
  - Identify: Find the 'main' color (the color of the main_color_block).
  - Locate: Find the sequence [0, 0, 0, 9] at the end of the input array.
  - Replace: Change the [0, 0, 0] part of the located sequence to three pixels of the 'main' color.
Transformation:
  - The transformation modifies the input array by replacing the three white pixels immediately before the final maroon pixel with three pixels of the dominant color found earlier in the array.
