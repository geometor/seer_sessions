Transformation Rule:
Assume the input is a grid with a single row. Let the row be represented as a sequence of colors.
Iterate through the sequence from the beginning up to, but not including, the last four elements. Find the first element whose color is not white (0). This color is the 'main color'.
Verify that the last four elements of the sequence are exactly [white, white, white, maroon] (i.e., [0, 0, 0, 9]).
Create a copy of the input sequence for the output.
In the output sequence, change the elements at the positions corresponding to the [white, white, white] part of the ending sequence (i.e., the fourth-to-last, third-to-last, and second-to-last elements) to the identified 'main color'.
Keep all other elements in the output sequence the same as the input sequence.
The modified sequence, formatted as a single-row grid, is the final output.
