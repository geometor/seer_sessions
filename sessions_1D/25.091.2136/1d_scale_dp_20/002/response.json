This operation is ambiguous for arrays.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Explicitly handle potential NumPy array inputs by converting relevant parts to lists before comparison or using appropriate NumPy comparison methods.\n2.  Verify the core transformation logic against the examples: identify the primary non-white/non-maroon color and use it to replace the `[0, 0, 0]` sequence preceding the final `9`.\n3.  Gather metrics to confirm assumptions about input structure and content.\n4.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on confirmed details and the corrected implementation approach.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"
