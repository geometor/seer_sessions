Data:
  - type: 1xN grid (represented potentially as numpy array or list of lists) of integers (colors).
  - structure:
      input: Contains an initial sequence (possibly starting with white), followed by a contiguous block of a single non-white/non-maroon 'main' color, ending precisely with the sequence [white, white, white, maroon] ([0, 0, 0, 9]).
      output: Identical to the input, except the [white, white, white] segment immediately preceding the final maroon is replaced by three pixels of the 'main' color.
  - properties:
      - grid_width: Varies (all examples have width 19).
      - grid_height: Always 1.
Objects:
  - identifier: main_color_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of a single color that is not white (0) or maroon (9).
    properties:
      - color: The color value identifies the 'main' color (e.g., magenta 6, yellow 4). Found by taking the first non-white color encountered when scanning from the start, excluding the final four elements.
      - location: Appears before the final four elements.
  - identifier: ending_pattern
    description: The fixed sequence [white, white, white, maroon] ([0, 0, 0, 9]).
    location: Occupies the last four positions of the input grid's single row.
  - identifier: replacement_segment
    description: The sequence [white, white, white] ([0, 0, 0]) within the ending_pattern.
    location: Occupies the positions n-4, n-3, n-2, where n is the grid width.
Relationships:
  - The replacement_segment is the part of the ending_pattern that gets modified.
  - The color used for modification is determined by the main_color_block.
Actions:
  - Identify Main Color: Scan the input row from left to right. The first color encountered that is not white (0) is the 'main color'. Stop scanning before the last four elements.
  - Locate Replacement Segment: Identify the elements at indices n-4, n-3, and n-2 (where n is the row length), verifying they are [0, 0, 0] and are followed by 9 at index n-1.
  - Replace: Change the values at indices n-4, n-3, and n-2 to the identified 'main color'.
Transformation:
  - Find the first non-white color ('main color') in the input row, ignoring the last four elements.
  - Replace the sequence [0, 0, 0] found at the end of the row (just before the final 9) with three instances of the 'main color'.
