White seems to act as a background or separator.\n3.  **Key Features**:\n    *   Each input contains a contiguous block of a single color (red or orange). Let's call this the \"primary color block\".\n    *   Each input contains a single yellow pixel (4) located somewhere to the right of the primary color block.\n    *   Between the primary color block and the yellow pixel, there can be one or more white pixels (0).\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation happens in the space *between* the end of the primary color block and the yellow pixel. Specifically, any white pixels (0) in this gap are changed to match the color of the primary color block.\n5.  **Consistency**: The primary color block (red or orange) and the yellow pixel maintain their positions and colors in the output. Pixels outside the gap between these two features also remain unchanged.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
