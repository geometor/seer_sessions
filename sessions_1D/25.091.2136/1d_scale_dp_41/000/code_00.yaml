task_description: Fill white pixels between a colored block and a specific marker pixel (yellow).
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
key_colors:
  - white (0): Background/Gap filler
  - red (2): Primary block color (Example 1, 2)
  - orange (7): Primary block color (Example 3)
  - yellow (4): Marker pixel
objects:
  - id: primary_block
    description: The first contiguous sequence of pixels with a color C, where C is neither white (0) nor yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: C (variable, e.g., red, orange)
      - location: Identified by the index of its last pixel.
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - location: Identified by its index. It appears to the right of the primary_block.
  - id: gap
    description: The sequence of pixels located strictly between the end of the primary_block and the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - content: Can contain white (0) pixels or be empty.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The gap exists between the primary_block and the marker_pixel based on their indices (index(last_pixel_of_primary_block) < index(gap_pixel) < index(marker_pixel)).
actions:
  - name: fill_gap_with_primary_color
    description: Change the color of all white (0) pixels within the gap to the color C of the primary_block.
    inputs:
      - primary_block (specifically its color C)
      - gap (specifically the indices of white pixels within it)
    output: Modified grid where white pixels in the gap are replaced by color C.
invariants:
  - The color and position of the primary_block remain unchanged.
  - The color and position of the marker_pixel remain unchanged.
  - Pixels outside the gap (before the primary_block, after the marker_pixel) remain unchanged.
