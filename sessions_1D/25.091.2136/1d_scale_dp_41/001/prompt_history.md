Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output grids appear to be one-dimensional arrays or single rows.
2.  **Colors Used**: The significant colors are white (0), red (2), orange (7), and yellow (4). White seems to act as a background or separator.
3.  **Key Features**:
    *   Each input contains a contiguous block of a single color (red or orange). Let's call this the "primary color block".
    *   Each input contains a single yellow pixel (4) located somewhere to the right of the primary color block.
    *   Between the primary color block and the yellow pixel, there can be one or more white pixels (0).
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation happens in the space *between* the end of the primary color block and the yellow pixel. Specifically, any white pixels (0) in this gap are changed to match the color of the primary color block.
5.  **Consistency**: The primary color block (red or orange) and the yellow pixel maintain their positions and colors in the output. Pixels outside the gap between these two features also remain unchanged.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Fill white pixels between a colored block and a specific marker pixel (yellow).
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
key_colors:
  - white (0): Background/Gap filler
  - red (2): Primary block color (Example 1, 2)
  - orange (7): Primary block color (Example 3)
  - yellow (4): Marker pixel
objects:
  - id: primary_block
    description: The first contiguous sequence of pixels with a color C, where C is neither white (0) nor yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: C (variable, e.g., red, orange)
      - location: Identified by the index of its last pixel.
  - id: marker_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color yellow (4).
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - location: Identified by its index. It appears to the right of the primary_block.
  - id: gap
    description: The sequence of pixels located strictly between the end of the primary_block and the marker_pixel.
    properties:
      - content: Can contain white (0) pixels or be empty.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The gap exists between the primary_block and the marker_pixel based on their indices (index(last_pixel_of_primary_block) < index(gap_pixel) < index(marker_pixel)).
actions:
  - name: fill_gap_with_primary_color
    description: Change the color of all white (0) pixels within the gap to the color C of the primary_block.
    inputs:
      - primary_block (specifically its color C)
      - gap (specifically the indices of white pixels within it)
    output: Modified grid where white pixels in the gap are replaced by color C.
invariants:
  - The color and position of the primary_block remain unchanged.
  - The color and position of the marker_pixel remain unchanged.
  - Pixels outside the gap (before the primary_block, after the marker_pixel) remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the first contiguous block of pixels whose color (`C`) is not white (0) or yellow (4). Record this color `C` and the index of the last pixel in this block (`end_block_idx`).
2.  Continue scanning from `end_block_idx + 1` to find the index of the first yellow (4) pixel (`yellow_idx`).
3.  Iterate through the pixels in the grid from index `end_block_idx + 1` up to (but not including) `yellow_idx`.
4.  For each pixel in this range, if its color is white (0), change its color to `C`.
5.  Leave all other pixels in the grid unchanged.
6.  Output the modified grid.
