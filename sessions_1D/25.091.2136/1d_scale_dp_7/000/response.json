This color is never white (0) or azure (8). Let's call this the \"source color\".\n    *   A block of white (0) pixels.\n    *   A single azure (8) pixel, which always appears as the rightmost pixel in both input and output.\n3.  **Spatial Relationship:** In the input grids, the block of white pixels is located spatially between the block of the source color and the final azure pixel.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation consists of changing the color of the white pixels located between the source color block and the final azure pixel. These white pixels adopt the source color.\n5.  **Invariance:** Pixels before the source color block (like the initial white pixel in example 1), the source color block itself, and the final azure pixel remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
