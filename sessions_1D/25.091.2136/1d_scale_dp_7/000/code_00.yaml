task_type: color_filling
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows

input_elements:
  - element: source_color_block
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of a single color, excluding white (0) and azure (8).
    properties: [color_variable, position_variable]
  - element: white_block
    description: A contiguous block of white (0) pixels.
    properties: [color_fixed=0, position_variable]
  - element: boundary_pixel
    description: A single azure (8) pixel.
    properties: [color_fixed=8, position=rightmost]

relationships:
  - type: spatial_arrangement
    description: The white_block is located to the right of the source_color_block and to the left of the boundary_pixel.

transformation:
  action: recolor
  target: white_block (pixels within)
  condition: Must be located between the source_color_block and the boundary_pixel.
  new_color: The color of the source_color_block immediately preceding the white_block segment being considered.

invariants:
  - Pixels to the left of the first occurrence of a non-white, non-azure color.
  - The source_color_block(s).
  - The boundary_pixel (azure, 8).
