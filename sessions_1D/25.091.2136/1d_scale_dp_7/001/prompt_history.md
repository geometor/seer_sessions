**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All input and output examples are single rows (1D grids).
2.  **Key Colors/Pixels:** The tasks consistently involve three types of elements:
    *   A block of pixels of a specific color (e.g., green in example 1, red in example 2, green in example 3). This color is never white (0) or azure (8). Let's call this the "source color".
    *   A block of white (0) pixels.
    *   A single azure (8) pixel, which always appears as the rightmost pixel in both input and output.
3.  **Spatial Relationship:** In the input grids, the block of white pixels is located spatially between the block of the source color and the final azure pixel.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation consists of changing the color of the white pixels located between the source color block and the final azure pixel. These white pixels adopt the source color.
5.  **Invariance:** Pixels before the source color block (like the initial white pixel in example 1), the source color block itself, and the final azure pixel remain unchanged in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_filling
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows

input_elements:
  - element: source_color_block
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of a single color, excluding white (0) and azure (8).
    properties: [color_variable, position_variable]
  - element: white_block
    description: A contiguous block of white (0) pixels.
    properties: [color_fixed=0, position_variable]
  - element: boundary_pixel
    description: A single azure (8) pixel.
    properties: [color_fixed=8, position=rightmost]

relationships:
  - type: spatial_arrangement
    description: The white_block is located to the right of the source_color_block and to the left of the boundary_pixel.

transformation:
  action: recolor
  target: white_block (pixels within)
  condition: Must be located between the source_color_block and the boundary_pixel.
  new_color: The color of the source_color_block immediately preceding the white_block segment being considered.

invariants:
  - Pixels to the left of the first occurrence of a non-white, non-azure color.
  - The source_color_block(s).
  - The boundary_pixel (azure, 8).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Initialize a variable `current_fill_color` to `None`.
3.  Iterate through the input grid pixels from left to right, up to (but not including) the last pixel.
4.  For each pixel at the current position `i`:
    a.  Get the color `pixel_color` of the input pixel at position `i`.
    b.  If `pixel_color` is white (0):
        i.  If `current_fill_color` is not `None`, set the output grid pixel at position `i` to `current_fill_color`.
        ii. If `current_fill_color` is `None`, set the output grid pixel at position `i` to white (0) (i.e., copy the input).
    c.  If `pixel_color` is not white (0) and not azure (8):
        i.  Update `current_fill_color` to `pixel_color`.
        ii. Set the output grid pixel at position `i` to `pixel_color` (copy the input).
    d.  If `pixel_color` is azure (8):
        i. This case should not be reached due to the loop limit, but if it were, copy the input pixel.
5.  Set the last pixel of the output grid to be the same as the last pixel of the input grid (which is always azure, 8).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
