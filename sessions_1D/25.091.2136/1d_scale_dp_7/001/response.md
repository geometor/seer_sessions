def transform(input_grid_list):
  """
  Transforms a 1D input grid based on the following rule:
  Iterate through the grid from left to right, up to the second-to-last pixel.
  Maintain a 'current_fill_color', initially None.
  If a non-white (0), non-azure (8) pixel is encountered, update 'current_fill_color' to its color.
  If a white (0) pixel is encountered *after* a 'current_fill_color' has been set (meaning a non-white, non-azure color was seen to its left),
  change that white pixel in the output to the 'current_fill_color'.
  All other pixels (initial white pixels before the first non-white/non-azure color, the source color pixels themselves, and the final azure pixel)
  retain their original color. The transformation effectively fills white space between a colored block and the final azure pixel with the color of that block.
