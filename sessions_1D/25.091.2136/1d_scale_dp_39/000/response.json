Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color (like magenta '6' or red '2'), followed by some white ('0') pixels, and then an azure ('8') pixel. The transformation fills the gap of white pixels between the colored block and the azure pixel with the color of the block. Pixels before the block, within the block, the azure pixel itself, and any pixels after the azure pixel remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
