*   **Perception:** The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (or single-row 2D grids). Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color (like magenta '6' or red '2'), followed by some white ('0') pixels, and then an azure ('8') pixel. The transformation fills the gap of white pixels between the colored block and the azure pixel with the color of the block. Pixels before the block, within the block, the azure pixel itself, and any pixels after the azure pixel remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN 2D)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        description: The leftmost contiguous block of non-white pixels. Its color varies between examples (magenta '6', red '2').
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)
        location: Between the colored block and the azure pixel.
      - type: pixel
        color: azure (8)
        location: To the right of the colored block, potentially separated by white pixels.
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The colored block appears first, followed by zero or more white pixels, followed by an azure pixel. Other pixels may exist before the block or after the azure pixel.
    actions:
      - name: identify_block
        inputs: input_grid
        outputs: color_of_block, end_index_of_block
      - name: identify_target_pixel
        inputs: input_grid, start_search_index (end_index_of_block + 1)
        outputs: index_of_azure_pixel
      - name: fill_gap
        inputs: input_grid, start_index (end_index_of_block + 1), end_index (index_of_azure_pixel), fill_color (color_of_block)
        description: Change all white (0) pixels within the specified range [start_index, end_index) to the fill_color.
    constraints:
      - The filling action only affects white pixels located strictly between the colored block and the first subsequent azure pixel.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the first contiguous block of non-white pixels starting from the left of the input grid. Record its color (`fill_color`) and the index of its rightmost pixel (`block_end_index`).
    2.  Find the index of the first azure (`8`) pixel that appears at an index greater than `block_end_index` (`azure_index`).
    3.  If such an azure pixel is found:
        a. Iterate through the grid from the index immediately after the block (`block_end_index + 1`) up to, but not including, the `azure_index`.
        b. For each pixel in this range, if its current color is white (`0`), change its color to `fill_color`.
    4.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.
    5.  Return the modified grid.
