task_description: Fill a contiguous block of white pixels to the left of a specific marker pixel (orange) with the color found immediately before the white block.

elements:
  - object: marker_pixel
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      count: 1 per input row
      role: defines the right boundary of the target area
  - object: target_block
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: immediately to the left of the marker_pixel
      structure: contiguous horizontal sequence
      role: region to be modified
  - object: source_pixel
    properties:
      location: immediately to the left of the target_block
      role: provides the fill color for the target_block
      condition: must not be white (0) if the target_block exists and needs filling

transformation:
  action: identify
    target: marker_pixel (orange)
  action: identify
    target: target_block (contiguous white pixels left of marker_pixel)
  action: identify
    target: source_pixel (pixel left of target_block)
  action: fill
    region: target_block
    color: color of source_pixel
  action: preserve
    target: all other pixels

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    entities: [source_pixel, target_block]
    direction: source_pixel is immediately left of target_block
  - type: adjacency
    entities: [target_block, marker_pixel]
    direction: target_block is immediately left of marker_pixel
