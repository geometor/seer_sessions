Each input contains exactly one orange (7) pixel.\n3.  The transformation modifies pixels located to the *left* of the orange pixel.\n4.  Specifically, contiguous blocks of white (0) pixels immediately adjacent to the left of the orange pixel are targeted.\n5.  These white pixels are replaced with the color of the pixel immediately preceding the white block.\n6.  Pixels to the right of the orange pixel, the orange pixel itself, and any non-white pixels within the \"fill zone\" remain unchanged. Also, pixels to the left of the \"source color\" pixel remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
