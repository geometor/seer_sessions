Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception:**

1.  Each input is a single row (or 1D array) of colored pixels.
2.  Each input contains exactly one orange (7) pixel.
3.  The transformation modifies pixels located to the *left* of the orange pixel.
4.  Specifically, contiguous blocks of white (0) pixels immediately adjacent to the left of the orange pixel are targeted.
5.  These white pixels are replaced with the color of the pixel immediately preceding the white block.
6.  Pixels to the right of the orange pixel, the orange pixel itself, and any non-white pixels within the "fill zone" remain unchanged. Also, pixels to the left of the "source color" pixel remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill a contiguous block of white pixels to the left of a specific marker pixel (orange) with the color found immediately before the white block.

elements:
  - object: marker_pixel
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      count: 1 per input row
      role: defines the right boundary of the target area
  - object: target_block
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: immediately to the left of the marker_pixel
      structure: contiguous horizontal sequence
      role: region to be modified
  - object: source_pixel
    properties:
      location: immediately to the left of the target_block
      role: provides the fill color for the target_block
      condition: must not be white (0) if the target_block exists and needs filling

transformation:
  action: identify
    target: marker_pixel (orange)
  action: identify
    target: target_block (contiguous white pixels left of marker_pixel)
  action: identify
    target: source_pixel (pixel left of target_block)
  action: fill
    region: target_block
    color: color of source_pixel
  action: preserve
    target: all other pixels

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    entities: [source_pixel, target_block]
    direction: source_pixel is immediately left of target_block
  - type: adjacency
    entities: [target_block, marker_pixel]
    direction: target_block is immediately left of marker_pixel
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the position of the orange (7) pixel.
2.  Starting from the position immediately to the left of the orange pixel, scan leftwards to identify the extent of the contiguous block of white (0) pixels. Let the rightmost index of this block be `end_white` and the leftmost index be `start_white`.
3.  Identify the color of the pixel at the position immediately to the left of this white block (index `start_white - 1`). This is the `fill_color`.
4.  For every pixel position from `start_white` to `end_white` (inclusive), change its color to `fill_color`.
5.  Keep all other pixels in the row unchanged.
6.  Output the modified row.
