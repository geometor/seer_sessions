Each input features one contiguous block of a non-white color (Magenta/6, Yellow/4, Red/2) and a single Orange (7) pixel located to the right of this block.\n3.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves extending the main colored block rightwards. The White (0) pixels situated between the right edge of the main colored block and the Orange (7) pixel are changed to the color of the main block.\n4.  **Boundary:** The Orange (7) pixel appears to act as a fixed boundary marker, determining the extent of the fill operation. Its position and color remain unchanged.\n5.  **Consistency:** This pattern of \"filling the gap\" between the main colored block and the Orange marker is consistent across all three examples, regardless of the main block's color or initial length.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
