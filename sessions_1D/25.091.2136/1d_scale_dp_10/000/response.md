Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples seem to represent 1-dimensional grids (or single rows from a 2D grid).
2.  **Key Colors:** White (0) acts as the background. Each input features one contiguous block of a non-white color (Magenta/6, Yellow/4, Red/2) and a single Orange (7) pixel located to the right of this block.
3.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves extending the main colored block rightwards. The White (0) pixels situated between the right edge of the main colored block and the Orange (7) pixel are changed to the color of the main block.
4.  **Boundary:** The Orange (7) pixel appears to act as a fixed boundary marker, determining the extent of the fill operation. Its position and color remain unchanged.
5.  **Consistency:** This pattern of "filling the gap" between the main colored block and the Orange marker is consistent across all three examples, regardless of the main block's color or initial length.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and an orange marker.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or single row)
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - id: main_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single color C, where C is not white (0) and not orange (7).
    properties:
      color: C (variable, e.g., 6, 4, 2)
      location: To the left of the boundary_marker.
      extent: Defined by start and end indices.
  - id: boundary_marker
    description: A single pixel acting as a right boundary.
    properties:
      color: 7 # orange
      location: To the right of the main_block.
      position: Fixed index within the row.
  - id: fill_gap
    description: The region of white (0) pixels between the main_block and the boundary_marker.
    properties:
      color: 0 # white (initially)
      location: Between the rightmost pixel of main_block and the boundary_marker pixel.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: main_block
    to: boundary_marker
    details: main_block is entirely to the left of boundary_marker.
  - type: spatial
    from: fill_gap
    to: main_block
    details: fill_gap is immediately to the right of main_block.
  - type: spatial
    from: fill_gap
    to: boundary_marker
    details: fill_gap is immediately to the left of boundary_marker.
actions:

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of color that is not white (0) or orange (7). Let its color be `C` and the index of its rightmost pixel be `R`.
2.  Identify the pixel with the orange color (7). Let its index be `O`.
3.  Iterate through the grid pixels starting from the index immediately after the main block (`R + 1`) up to, but not including, the index of the orange pixel (`O`).
4.  For each pixel within this range, change its color to `C`.
5.  Leave all other pixels (including the main block itself and the orange pixel) unchanged.
6.  The resulting grid is the output.
