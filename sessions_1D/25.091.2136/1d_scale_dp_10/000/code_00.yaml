task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and an orange marker.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or single row)
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - id: main_block
    description: A contiguous block of a single color C, where C is not white (0) and not orange (7).
    properties:
      color: C (variable, e.g., 6, 4, 2)
      location: To the left of the boundary_marker.
      extent: Defined by start and end indices.
  - id: boundary_marker
    description: A single pixel acting as a right boundary.
    properties:
      color: 7 # orange
      location: To the right of the main_block.
      position: Fixed index within the row.
  - id: fill_gap
    description: The region of white (0) pixels between the main_block and the boundary_marker.
    properties:
      color: 0 # white (initially)
      location: Between the rightmost pixel of main_block and the boundary_marker pixel.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: main_block
    to: boundary_marker
    details: main_block is entirely to the left of boundary_marker.
  - type: spatial
    from: fill_gap
    to: main_block
    details: fill_gap is immediately to the right of main_block.
  - type: spatial
    from: fill_gap
    to: boundary_marker
    details: fill_gap is immediately to the left of boundary_marker.
