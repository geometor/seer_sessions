White pixels may also exist before the colored block and after the green pixel.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a \"filling\" action. The colored block extends its color rightwards, replacing any white pixels encountered, until it reaches the position immediately before the green pixel. The green pixel itself and any pixels following it remain unchanged. Pixels before the original colored block also remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the columns from `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) the column index of the green pixel.\n6.  For each pixel in this range, if its color is white (0), change its color to the `fill_color`.\n7.
