Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve grids that are effectively single rows (or can be treated as such since the transformation only affects elements within a row).
2.  **Key Colors/Objects:**
    *   A single **green pixel (3)** appears in each input row.
    *   A contiguous block of a **non-white, non-green color** (red=2, orange=7, azure=8 in the examples) exists somewhere before the green pixel.
    *   **White pixels (0)** often exist between the colored block and the green pixel. White pixels may also exist before the colored block and after the green pixel.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a "filling" action. The colored block extends its color rightwards, replacing any white pixels encountered, until it reaches the position immediately before the green pixel. The green pixel itself and any pixels following it remain unchanged. Pixels before the original colored block also remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and a green pixel marker.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (effectively single rows matter)
objects:
  - object: marker_pixel
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
      - count: 1 per relevant row
      - role: acts as a boundary or stop signal for the fill action.
  - object: colored_block
    properties:
      - color: variable (non-white, non-green)
      - shape: contiguous horizontal block
      - position: located somewhere to the left of the marker_pixel in the same row.
  - object: gap_pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - position: located between the rightmost edge of the colored_block and the marker_pixel.
      - role: target area for the fill action.
actions:
  - action: fill_gap
    actor: colored_block
    target: gap_pixels
    details:
      - Change the color of all gap_pixels to the color of the colored_block.
      - The fill stops exactly one pixel before the marker_pixel.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entities: [colored_block, gap_pixels, marker_pixel]
    details: The colored_block is to the left of the gap_pixels (if any), which are to the left of the marker_pixel, all within the same row.
invariants:
  - Pixels to the left of the original colored_block remain unchanged.
  - The marker_pixel (green) remains unchanged.
  - Pixels to the right of the marker_pixel remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  For each row in the input grid:
2.  Locate the position of the single green pixel (value 3). If no green pixel exists in the row, leave the row unchanged and proceed to the next row.
3.  Scan the row from left to right, up to the position *before* the green pixel.
4.  Identify the rightmost contiguous block of pixels with the same non-white, non-green color. Record this color (let's call it the `fill_color`) and the column index of the rightmost pixel in this block (`block_end_index`). If no such block exists before the green pixel, leave the row unchanged.
5.  Iterate through the columns from `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) the column index of the green pixel.
6.  For each pixel in this range, if its color is white (0), change its color to the `fill_color`.
7.  Leave all other pixels in the row (including the green pixel and those after it, and those before the original block) unchanged.
8.  Combine the potentially modified rows to form the output grid.
