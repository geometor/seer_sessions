task_description: Fill the gap between a colored block and a green pixel marker.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (effectively single rows matter)
objects:
  - object: marker_pixel
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
      - count: 1 per relevant row
      - role: acts as a boundary or stop signal for the fill action.
  - object: colored_block
    properties:
      - color: variable (non-white, non-green)
      - shape: contiguous horizontal block
      - position: located somewhere to the left of the marker_pixel in the same row.
  - object: gap_pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - position: located between the rightmost edge of the colored_block and the marker_pixel.
      - role: target area for the fill action.
actions:
  - action: fill_gap
    actor: colored_block
    target: gap_pixels
    details:
      - Change the color of all gap_pixels to the color of the colored_block.
      - The fill stops exactly one pixel before the marker_pixel.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entities: [colored_block, gap_pixels, marker_pixel]
    details: The colored_block is to the left of the gap_pixels (if any), which are to the left of the marker_pixel, all within the same row.
invariants:
  - Pixels to the left of the original colored_block remain unchanged.
  - The marker_pixel (green) remains unchanged.
  - Pixels to the right of the marker_pixel remain unchanged.
