**Perception**

The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (or single-row grids). Each grid contains sequences of pixels of different colors. The key elements appear to be:
1.  A contiguous block of a single, non-white color (e.g., magenta `6`, red `2`, azure `8`).
2.  A single blue pixel (`1`).
3.  A contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) located immediately between the non-white block and the blue pixel.

The transformation involves extending the non-white color block to the right, replacing the white pixels that lie between it and the blue pixel. The blue pixel acts as a boundary, stopping the extension. The number of white pixels being replaced determines the extent of the extension. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: source_block
    description: A sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: (variable, not white)
      - length: (variable, >= 1)
      - position: (variable)
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: gap_block
    description: A sequence of white pixels (0) immediately to the right of the source_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: (variable, >= 0)
      - position: immediately follows source_block
  - type: single_pixel
    id: boundary_pixel
    description: A single blue pixel (1) immediately to the right of the gap_block.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: immediately follows gap_block
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_block, gap_block, and boundary_pixel appear consecutively from left to right. `source_block -> gap_block -> boundary_pixel`
action:
  - type: replace_color
    target: gap_block
    description: Replace the color of all pixels within the gap_block with the color of the source_block.
    condition: The sequence source_block, gap_block, boundary_pixel must exist.
    effect: The length of the source_block effectively increases by the length of the gap_block. The gap_block disappears, replaced by the extended source_block. The boundary_pixel remains unchanged and marks the end of the extended block.
constraints:
  - The source color is never white (0) or blue (1).
  - The boundary pixel is always blue (1).
  - The gap block consists only of white pixels (0).
  - All other pixels outside this identified sequence remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single blue pixel (`1`) in the input grid.
2.  Scan the grid to the left of the blue pixel.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) immediately preceding the blue pixel. Record the number of these white pixels (let this be `N`). If there are no white pixels immediately preceding the blue pixel (`N=0`), no change occurs in this step.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-blue pixels immediately preceding the block of white pixels (or immediately preceding the blue pixel if `N=0`). Record the color of this block (let this be `C`).
5.  Modify the input grid: Change the color of the `N` white pixels identified in step 3 to color `C`.
6.  Leave all other pixels in the grid unchanged.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.
