**General Assessment**

The previous code failed because its logic for identifying the pattern was flawed. It prematurely exited if the pixel immediately to the left of the blue boundary pixel was not white, even if a valid white gap and source block existed further to the left. The code did not correctly implement the natural language description, which implied identifying the boundary, then the gap preceding it, and then the source block preceding the gap.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to adjust the logic to:
1.  Locate the first blue pixel (boundary).
2.  Scan leftwards from the boundary to find the first non-white, non-blue pixel (potential source pixel).
3.  Verify that all pixels between the found source pixel and the blue boundary pixel are white (confirming the gap).
4.  If these conditions are met, fill the gap with the source pixel's color.

This revised approach correctly identifies the pattern elements in the specified order (boundary -> source -> gap check) and should handle the training examples.

task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: single_pixel
    id: boundary_pixel
    description: The first blue pixel (1) encountered when scanning from left to right.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: (variable, index `blue_idx`)
  - type: single_pixel
    id: source_pixel
    description: The first non-white pixel encountered when scanning leftwards from the position immediately before the boundary_pixel (`blue_idx - 1`).
    properties:
      - color: (variable, not white (0), not blue (1))
      - position: (variable, index `source_end_idx`)
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: gap_block
    description: A sequence of one or more white pixels located immediately between the source_pixel and the boundary_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: (variable, >= 1)
      - position_start: `source_end_idx + 1`
      - position_end: `blue_idx - 1` (inclusive)
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_pixel, gap_block, and boundary_pixel appear consecutively from left to right. `source_pixel -> gap_block -> boundary_pixel`. The gap_block must contain only white pixels.
action:
  - type: replace_color
    target: gap_block
    description: Replace the color of all pixels within the gap_block with the color of the source_pixel.
    condition: The sequence source_pixel, gap_block (all white), boundary_pixel must exist in that order, where source_pixel is not blue and gap_block has length >= 1.
    effect: The gap_block is filled with the source_pixel's color, effectively extending the influence of the source color up to the boundary_pixel. The boundary_pixel and all other pixels remain unchanged.
constraints:
  - Input is a 1xN grid.
  - The boundary_pixel must exist and not be at index 0.
  - A source_pixel must exist to the left of the boundary_pixel.
  - The source_pixel color must not be white (0) or blue (1).
  - All pixels between the source_pixel and the boundary_pixel must be white (0).
  - There must be at least one white pixel in the gap (i.e., `blue_idx > source_end_idx + 1`).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the 1xN input grid.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the index (`blue_idx`) of the *first* blue pixel (`1`).
4.  If no blue pixel is found, or if `blue_idx` is 0, return the unmodified output grid.
5.  Scan the input grid leftwards starting from index `blue_idx - 1` down to index 0. Find the index (`source_end_idx`) of the first pixel encountered whose color is *not* white (`0`).
6.  If no such non-white pixel is found (i.e., all pixels to the left of `blue_idx` are white or `blue_idx` was 1), return the unmodified output grid.
7.  Get the color (`source_color`) of the pixel at `source_end_idx`.
8.  If `source_color` is blue (`1`), return the unmodified output grid.
9.  Define the potential gap region as the indices from `gap_start_idx = source_end_idx + 1` up to (and including) `gap_end_idx = blue_idx - 1`.
10. Check if `gap_start_idx` is less than or equal to `gap_end_idx`. If not (meaning no space between source and boundary), return the unmodified output grid.
11. Check if all pixels within the gap region (from `gap_start_idx` to `gap_end_idx` inclusive) in the input grid have the color white (`0`).
12. If the gap region exists and all pixels within it are white, modify the output grid by setting the color of all pixels from index `gap_start_idx` up to (but *not* including) `blue_idx` to `source_color`.
13. Return the modified output grid.
