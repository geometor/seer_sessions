"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by finding a specific pattern and modifying it. 
The pattern consists of:
1. The first blue pixel (1) found scanning left-to-right (boundary_pixel).
2. The first non-white pixel found scanning right-to-left starting just before the boundary_pixel (source_pixel). The source_pixel must not be blue (1).
3. A contiguous block of one or more white pixels (0) located exactly between the source_pixel and the boundary_pixel (gap_block).

If this pattern is found, the transformation replaces the white pixels in the 
gap_block with the color of the source_pixel. Otherwise, the grid remains unchanged.
