**Perception**

The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (or single-row grids). Each grid contains sequences of pixels of different colors. The key elements appear to be:
1.  A contiguous block of a single, non-white color (e.g., magenta `6`, red `2`, azure `8`).
2.  A single blue pixel (`1`).
3.  A contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) located immediately between the non-white block and the blue pixel.

The transformation involves extending the non-white color block to the right, replacing the white pixels that lie between it and the blue pixel. The blue pixel acts as a boundary, stopping the extension. The number of white pixels being replaced determines the extent of the extension. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: source_block
    description: A sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: (variable, not white)
      - length: (variable, >= 1)
      - position: (variable)
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: gap_block
    description: A sequence of white pixels (0) immediately to the right of the source_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: (variable, >= 0)
      - position: immediately follows source_block
  - type: single_pixel
    id: boundary_pixel
    description: A single blue pixel (1) immediately to the right of the gap_block.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: immediately follows gap_block
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_block, gap_block, and boundary_pixel appear consecutively from left to right. `source_block -> gap_block -> boundary_pixel`
action:
  - type: replace_color
    target: gap_block
    description: Replace the color of all pixels within the gap_block with the color of the source_block.
    condition: The sequence source_block, gap_block, boundary_pixel must exist.
    effect: The length of the source_block effectively increases by the length of the gap_block. The gap_block disappears, replaced by the extended source_block. The boundary_pixel remains unchanged and marks the end of the extended block.
constraints:
  - The source color is never white (0) or blue (1).
  - The boundary pixel is always blue (1).
  - The gap block consists only of white pixels (0).
  - All other pixels outside this identified sequence remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single blue pixel (`1`) in the input grid.
2.  Scan the grid to the left of the blue pixel.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) immediately preceding the blue pixel. Record the number of these white pixels (let this be `N`). If there are no white pixels immediately preceding the blue pixel (`N=0`), no change occurs in this step.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-blue pixels immediately preceding the block of white pixels (or immediately preceding the blue pixel if `N=0`). Record the color of this block (let this be `C`).
5.  Modify the input grid: Change the color of the `N` white pixels identified in step 3 to color `C`.
6.  Leave all other pixels in the grid unchanged.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.

**General Assessment**

The previous code failed because its logic for identifying the pattern was flawed. It prematurely exited if the pixel immediately to the left of the blue boundary pixel was not white, even if a valid white gap and source block existed further to the left. The code did not correctly implement the natural language description, which implied identifying the boundary, then the gap preceding it, and then the source block preceding the gap.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to adjust the logic to:
1.  Locate the first blue pixel (boundary).
2.  Scan leftwards from the boundary to find the first non-white, non-blue pixel (potential source pixel).
3.  Verify that all pixels between the found source pixel and the blue boundary pixel are white (confirming the gap).
4.  If these conditions are met, fill the gap with the source pixel's color.

This revised approach correctly identifies the pattern elements in the specified order (boundary -> source -> gap check) and should handle the training examples.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: single_pixel
    id: boundary_pixel
    description: The first blue pixel (1) encountered when scanning from left to right.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: (variable, index `blue_idx`)
  - type: single_pixel
    id: source_pixel
    description: The first non-white pixel encountered when scanning leftwards from the position immediately before the boundary_pixel (`blue_idx - 1`).
    properties:
      - color: (variable, not white (0), not blue (1))
      - position: (variable, index `source_end_idx`)
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: gap_block
    description: A sequence of one or more white pixels located immediately between the source_pixel and the boundary_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: (variable, >= 1)
      - position_start: `source_end_idx + 1`
      - position_end: `blue_idx - 1` (inclusive)
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_pixel, gap_block, and boundary_pixel appear consecutively from left to right. `source_pixel -> gap_block -> boundary_pixel`. The gap_block must contain only white pixels.
action:
  - type: replace_color
    target: gap_block
    description: Replace the color of all pixels within the gap_block with the color of the source_pixel.
    condition: The sequence source_pixel, gap_block (all white), boundary_pixel must exist in that order, where source_pixel is not blue and gap_block has length >= 1.
    effect: The gap_block is filled with the source_pixel's color, effectively extending the influence of the source color up to the boundary_pixel. The boundary_pixel and all other pixels remain unchanged.
constraints:
  - Input is a 1xN grid.
  - The boundary_pixel must exist and not be at index 0.
  - A source_pixel must exist to the left of the boundary_pixel.
  - The source_pixel color must not be white (0) or blue (1).
  - All pixels between the source_pixel and the boundary_pixel must be white (0).
  - There must be at least one white pixel in the gap (i.e., `blue_idx > source_end_idx + 1`).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the 1xN input grid.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the index (`blue_idx`) of the *first* blue pixel (`1`).
4.  If no blue pixel is found, or if `blue_idx` is 0, return the unmodified output grid.
5.  Scan the input grid leftwards starting from index `blue_idx - 1` down to index 0. Find the index (`source_end_idx`) of the first pixel encountered whose color is *not* white (`0`).
6.  If no such non-white pixel is found (i.e., all pixels to the left of `blue_idx` are white or `blue_idx` was 1), return the unmodified output grid.
7.  Get the color (`source_color`) of the pixel at `source_end_idx`.
8.  If `source_color` is blue (`1`), return the unmodified output grid.
9.  Define the potential gap region as the indices from `gap_start_idx = source_end_idx + 1` up to (and including) `gap_end_idx = blue_idx - 1`.
10. Check if `gap_start_idx` is less than or equal to `gap_end_idx`. If not (meaning no space between source and boundary), return the unmodified output grid.
11. Check if all pixels within the gap region (from `gap_start_idx` to `gap_end_idx` inclusive) in the input grid have the color white (`0`).
12. If the gap region exists and all pixels within it are white, modify the output grid by setting the color of all pixels from index `gap_start_idx` up to (but *not* including) `blue_idx` to `source_color`.
13. Return the modified output grid.
