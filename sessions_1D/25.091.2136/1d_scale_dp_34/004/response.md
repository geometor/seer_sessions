**General Assessment**

The previous attempt failed consistently across all training examples, returning the input grid unchanged instead of the expected transformed output. Tracing the code logic against the examples suggests the core algorithm (find first blue pixel, find preceding white gap, find pixel left of gap, fill gap with that pixel's color) correctly reflects the transformation observed. The failure implies either a subtle misunderstanding of the required conditions/pattern, an edge case not covered, or an issue related to input/output data types or the execution environment interaction (e.g., how array modifications were handled or returned).

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-verify the pattern identification steps (blue pixel, white gap, source pixel) using code execution for precision.
2.  Refine the description of the components and the transformation logic to ensure accuracy.
3.  Simplify the implementation assumption to strictly use the standard ARC format (`List[List[int]]`) for input and output, removing the potentially problematic handling of flat lists, to minimize type-related errors.
4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language program accordingly.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the indices, gap lengths, and source colors for each example based on the assumed logic.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_list):
    grid_1d = np.array(input_list, dtype=int)
    analysis = {"input": input_list}

    blue_indices = np.where(grid_1d == 1)[0]
    if len(blue_indices) == 0:
        analysis["blue_idx"] = None
        return analysis
    
    blue_idx = blue_indices[0]
    analysis["blue_idx"] = blue_idx

    if blue_idx == 0:
        analysis["gap_start_idx"] = None
        analysis["gap_length"] = 0
        analysis["source_idx"] = None
        analysis["source_color"] = None
        return analysis

    # Find gap
    current_idx = blue_idx - 1
    gap_start_idx = blue_idx 
    while current_idx >= 0 and grid_1d[current_idx] == 0:
        gap_start_idx = current_idx
        current_idx -= 1
    
    gap_length = blue_idx - gap_start_idx
    analysis["gap_start_idx"] = gap_start_idx if gap_length > 0 else None
    analysis["gap_length"] = gap_length

    # Find source
    if gap_length > 0:
        source_idx = gap_start_idx - 1
        if source_idx >= 0:
             analysis["source_idx"] = source_idx
             source_color = grid_1d[source_idx]
             if source_color != 0 and source_color != 1:
                 analysis["source_color"] = source_color
             else:
                 analysis["source_color"] = f"Invalid ({source_color})"
        else:
             analysis["source_idx"] = None
             analysis["source_color"] = None # Gap at start
    else:
         analysis["source_idx"] = None
         analysis["source_color"] = None # No gap

    return analysis

examples = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

results = [analyze_example(ex) for ex in examples]
for i, res in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input: {res['input']}")
    print(f"  Blue Idx: {res['blue_idx']}")
    print(f"  Gap Start Idx: {res['gap_start_idx']}")
    print(f"  Gap Length: {res['gap_length']}")
    print(f"  Source Idx: {res['source_idx']}")
    print(f"  Source Color: {res['source_color']}")
    print("-" * 20)
```
```
Example 1:
  Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  Blue Idx: 12
  Gap Start Idx: 10
  Gap Length: 2
  Source Idx: 9
  Source Color: 6
--------------------
Example 2:
  Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Blue Idx: 6
  Gap Start Idx: 4
  Gap Length: 2
  Source Idx: 3
  Source Color: 2
--------------------
Example 3:
  Input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Blue Idx: 9
  Gap Start Idx: 6
  Gap Length: 3
  Source Idx: 5
  Source Color: 8
--------------------

```
The analysis confirms the identification of the key components (blue pixel, gap, source pixel/color) aligns with the transformation seen in the examples. The failure wasn't due to misidentifying these components based on the logic used. The issue likely lies elsewhere, possibly in implementation details or assumptions outside this core logic.

**Updated Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
input_format: List[List[int]] (1 row, N columns)
output_format: List[List[int]] (1 row, N columns)
components:
  - type: target_pixel
    id: boundary_pixel
    description: The first occurrence of a blue pixel (1) when scanning from left to right.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - required: true (if not present, no transformation occurs)
      - position: index `blue_idx`
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: gap_block
    description: A sequence of one or more white pixels (0) located immediately to the left of the boundary_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: (variable, >= 1)
      - position: ends at index `blue_idx - 1`, starts at `gap_start_idx`
      - required: true (if no such gap exists, no transformation occurs)
  - type: source_pixel
    id: color_source
    description: The single pixel located immediately to the left of the gap_block.
    properties:
      - color: (variable, must not be white(0) or blue(1))
      - position: index `gap_start_idx - 1`
      - required: true (must exist and have a valid color, otherwise no transformation occurs)
relationship:
  - type: spatial_sequence
    description: The required pattern is `... -> color_source -> gap_block -> boundary_pixel -> ...` appearing consecutively.
action:
  - type: fill_color
    target: gap_block
    description: Replace the color of all pixels within the gap_block with the color of the color_source pixel.
    condition: The full sequence (color_source with valid color, gap_block, boundary_pixel) must be identified.
    effect: The gap_block's pixels change color. All other pixels remain unchanged.
constraints:
  - The transformation only applies if the specific sequence is found.
  - Only the first occurrence of the blue pixel matters.
  - The gap must contain only white pixels and be immediately left of the blue pixel.
  - The pixel left of the gap must exist and be neither white nor blue.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid as a list containing a single list of integers (representing one row).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the index of the *first* blue pixel (`1`). Let this index be `blue_idx`.
4.  If no blue pixel is found, or if `blue_idx` is 0, return the unmodified output grid.
5.  Starting from the index `blue_idx - 1`, scan leftwards to identify the contiguous block of white pixels (`0`). Determine the starting index of this block, `gap_start_idx`.
6.  If no white pixels are found immediately to the left of `blue_idx` (i.e., the pixel at `blue_idx - 1` is not white, or `blue_idx` was 0), return the unmodified output grid. The length of the gap is `gap_length = blue_idx - gap_start_idx`.
7.  Check if a pixel exists immediately to the left of the gap block, i.e., check if `gap_start_idx - 1` is a valid index (>= 0). If not, return the unmodified output grid.
8.  Get the color of the pixel at index `gap_start_idx - 1`. Let this be `source_color`.
9.  Check if `source_color` is neither white (`0`) nor blue (`1`). If it is white or blue, return the unmodified output grid.
10. If all checks passed, modify the output grid: Change the color of all pixels from index `gap_start_idx` up to (but not including) `blue_idx` to `source_color`.
11. Return the modified output grid.
