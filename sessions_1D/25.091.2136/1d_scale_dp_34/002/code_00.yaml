task_type: array_transformation_1d_sequence_fill
grid_dimensionality: Primarily 1D, potentially represented as 1xN 2D array.
components:
  - type: pixel
    id: boundary_pixel
    description: The first occurrence of a blue pixel (1) in the sequence.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: (variable column index, row index 0 if 1xN)
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: gap_block
    description: A sequence of one or more white pixels (0) immediately preceding the boundary_pixel (leftwards).
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: (variable, >= 1)
      - position: adjacent (left) to boundary_pixel
  - type: pixel
    id: source_pixel
    description: The pixel immediately preceding the gap_block (leftwards).
    properties:
      - color: (variable, must not be white (0) or blue (1))
      - position: adjacent (left) to gap_block
relationship:
  - type: spatial_sequence
    description: The relevant pattern is formed by the `source_pixel`, `gap_block`, and `boundary_pixel` appearing consecutively from left to right. `... -> source_pixel -> gap_block -> boundary_pixel -> ...`
action:
  - type: replace_color_in_block
    target: gap_block
    description: Replace the color of all pixels within the gap_block with the color of the source_pixel.
    condition: The sequence `source_pixel` (non-white, non-blue), `gap_block` (white, length >= 1), `boundary_pixel` (blue) must exist, using the first occurrence of the blue pixel.
    effect: The white gap is filled with the source color, effectively extending the visual block represented by the source color up to the blue boundary pixel.
constraints:
  - The transformation is triggered by the first blue pixel found.
  - A gap of at least one white pixel must exist immediately before the blue pixel.
  - The pixel immediately before the white gap must be non-white and non-blue.
  - All other pixels outside the identified gap_block remain unchanged.
