**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed because it returned the input unchanged for all training examples. A detailed trace suggested the core logic for identifying the blue pixel, the preceding white gap, and the source color pixel was correct for a 1D list input. However, the observed failure (returning the original input) strongly implies that the code might have incorrectly processed the input grid format. Specifically, if the input was treated as a 1xN 2D array instead of a 1D array, the blue pixel index finding (`np.where(grid == 1)[0]`) would return the row index (0), leading the code to exit early via the `if blue_idx == 0:` check.

The strategy is to modify the code to explicitly handle both 1D list inputs and potential 1xN list-of-lists or numpy array inputs. This involves adjusting how indices are extracted and used. The YAML description and Natural Language Program will be refined to reflect this potential input structure and clarify the exact sequence pattern being targeted.

**Metrics**

| Example | Input Shape (assumed 1xN) | Blue Index (col) | Gap Indices (col) | Gap Length | Source Index (col) | Source Color | Pixels Changed | Expected Output Matches Pattern? |
| :------ | :------------------------ | :--------------- | :---------------- | :--------- | :----------------- | :----------- | :------------- | :----------------------------- |
| 1       | 1x15                      | 12               | [10, 11]          | 2          | 9                  | 6 (Magenta)  | 2              | Yes                            |
| 2       | 1x15                      | 6                | [4, 5]            | 2          | 3                  | 2 (Red)      | 2              | Yes                            |
| 3       | 1x15                      | 9                | [6, 7, 8]         | 3          | 5                  | 8 (Azure)    | 3              | Yes                            |

**Assumptions based on metrics:**
1.  Inputs are effectively 1D sequences, potentially represented as 1xN grids.
2.  There is exactly one blue pixel (`1`) relevant to the transformation.
3.  The transformation involves filling a gap of white pixels (`0`) located immediately to the left of the blue pixel.
4.  The color used for filling is determined by the pixel immediately to the left of the white gap.
5.  The source color pixel must be non-white (`0`) and non-blue (`1`).
6.  The transformation only occurs if such a sequence (non-white/non-blue color -> white gap -> blue) exists.

```yaml

components:
  - type: pixel
    id: boundary_pixel

      - position: (variable column index, row index 0 if 1xN)
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: gap_block
    description: A sequence of one or more white pixels (0) immediately preceding the boundary_pixel (leftwards).
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

      - position: adjacent (left) to boundary_pixel
  - type: pixel
    id: source_pixel
    description: The pixel immediately preceding the gap_block (leftwards).
    properties:
      - color: (variable, must not be white (0) or blue (1))
      - position: adjacent (left) to gap_block
relationship:
  - type: spatial_sequence
    description: The relevant pattern is formed by the `source_pixel`, `gap_block`, and `boundary_pixel` appearing consecutively from left to right. `... -> source_pixel -> gap_block -> boundary_pixel -> ...`
action:
  - type: replace_color_in_block
    target: gap_block
    description: Replace the color of all pixels within the gap_block with the color of the source_pixel.
    condition: The sequence `source_pixel` (non-white, non-blue), `gap_block` (white, length >= 1), `boundary_pixel` (blue) must exist, using the first occurrence of the blue pixel.
    effect: The white gap is filled with the source color, effectively extending the visual block represented by the source color up to the blue boundary pixel.
constraints:
  - The transformation is triggered by the first blue pixel found.
  - A gap of at least one white pixel must exist immediately before the blue pixel.
  - The pixel immediately before the white gap must be non-white and non-blue.
  - All other pixels outside the identified gap_block remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Inspect the input grid. Treat it as a single row (sequence) of pixels, even if represented as a 1xN array.
2.  Locate the index (column index) of the *first* blue pixel (`1`). If no blue pixel exists, or if the blue pixel is at the very beginning (index 0), make no changes and return the original grid.
3.  Starting from the pixel immediately to the left of the blue pixel, scan leftwards to identify the contiguous block of white pixels (`0`). Determine the starting index and ending index (which is just before the blue pixel) of this white 'gap'.
4.  If no white pixels are found immediately before the blue pixel (i.e., the gap has zero length), make no changes and return the original grid.
5.  Identify the pixel immediately to the left of the identified white gap. Let its color be `C` and its index be `source_idx`.
6.  Check if the `source_idx` is valid (i.e., not less than 0) and if the color `C` is neither white (`0`) nor blue (`1`).
7.  If both conditions in step 6 are met, change the color of all pixels within the white gap (identified in step 3) to the color `C`.
8.  If the conditions in step 6 are not met (e.g., the gap starts at the beginning of the grid, or the preceding pixel is white or blue), make no changes.
9.  Return the modified grid.
