**Perception**

The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (or single-row grids). Each grid contains sequences of pixels of different colors. The key elements appear to be:
1.  A contiguous block of a single, non-white color (e.g., magenta `6`, red `2`, azure `8`).
2.  A single blue pixel (`1`).
3.  A contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) located immediately between the non-white block and the blue pixel.

The transformation involves extending the non-white color block to the right, replacing the white pixels that lie between it and the blue pixel. The blue pixel acts as a boundary, stopping the extension. The number of white pixels being replaced determines the extent of the extension. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: source_block
    description: A sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: (variable, not white)
      - length: (variable, >= 1)
      - position: (variable)
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: gap_block
    description: A sequence of white pixels (0) immediately to the right of the source_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: (variable, >= 0)
      - position: immediately follows source_block
  - type: single_pixel
    id: boundary_pixel
    description: A single blue pixel (1) immediately to the right of the gap_block.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: immediately follows gap_block
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_block, gap_block, and boundary_pixel appear consecutively from left to right. `source_block -> gap_block -> boundary_pixel`
action:
  - type: replace_color
    target: gap_block
    description: Replace the color of all pixels within the gap_block with the color of the source_block.
    condition: The sequence source_block, gap_block, boundary_pixel must exist.
    effect: The length of the source_block effectively increases by the length of the gap_block. The gap_block disappears, replaced by the extended source_block. The boundary_pixel remains unchanged and marks the end of the extended block.
constraints:
  - The source color is never white (0) or blue (1).
  - The boundary pixel is always blue (1).
  - The gap block consists only of white pixels (0).
  - All other pixels outside this identified sequence remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single blue pixel (`1`) in the input grid.
2.  Scan the grid to the left of the blue pixel.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) immediately preceding the blue pixel. Record the number of these white pixels (let this be `N`). If there are no white pixels immediately preceding the blue pixel (`N=0`), no change occurs in this step.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-blue pixels immediately preceding the block of white pixels (or immediately preceding the blue pixel if `N=0`). Record the color of this block (let this be `C`).
5.  Modify the input grid: Change the color of the `N` white pixels identified in step 3 to color `C`.
6.  Leave all other pixels in the grid unchanged.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.

**General Assessment**

The previous attempt failed consistently across all training examples, returning the input grid unchanged instead of the expected transformed output. Tracing the code logic against the examples suggests the core algorithm (find first blue pixel, find preceding white gap, find pixel left of gap, fill gap with that pixel's color) correctly reflects the transformation observed. The failure implies either a subtle misunderstanding of the required conditions/pattern, an edge case not covered, or an issue related to input/output data types or the execution environment interaction (e.g., how array modifications were handled or returned).

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-verify the pattern identification steps (blue pixel, white gap, source pixel) using code execution for precision.
2.  Refine the description of the components and the transformation logic to ensure accuracy.
3.  Simplify the implementation assumption to strictly use the standard ARC format (`List[List[int]]`) for input and output, removing the potentially problematic handling of flat lists, to minimize type-related errors.
4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language program accordingly.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the indices, gap lengths, and source colors for each example based on the assumed logic.

The analysis confirms the identification of the key components (blue pixel, gap, source pixel/color) aligns with the transformation seen in the examples. The failure wasn't due to misidentifying these components based on the logic used. The issue likely lies elsewhere, possibly in implementation details or assumptions outside this core logic.

**Updated Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
input_format: List[List[int]] (1 row, N columns)
output_format: List[List[int]] (1 row, N columns)
components:
  - type: target_pixel
    id: boundary_pixel
    description: The first occurrence of a blue pixel (1) when scanning from left to right.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - required: true (if not present, no transformation occurs)
      - position: index `blue_idx`
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: gap_block
    description: A sequence of one or more white pixels (0) located immediately to the left of the boundary_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: (variable, >= 1)
      - position: ends at index `blue_idx - 1`, starts at `gap_start_idx`
      - required: true (if no such gap exists, no transformation occurs)
  - type: source_pixel
    id: color_source
    description: The single pixel located immediately to the left of the gap_block.
    properties:
      - color: (variable, must not be white(0) or blue(1))
      - position: index `gap_start_idx - 1`
      - required: true (must exist and have a valid color, otherwise no transformation occurs)
relationship:
  - type: spatial_sequence
    description: The required pattern is `... -> color_source -> gap_block -> boundary_pixel -> ...` appearing consecutively.
action:
  - type: fill_color
    target: gap_block
    description: Replace the color of all pixels within the gap_block with the color of the color_source pixel.
    condition: The full sequence (color_source with valid color, gap_block, boundary_pixel) must be identified.
    effect: The gap_block's pixels change color. All other pixels remain unchanged.
constraints:
  - The transformation only applies if the specific sequence is found.
  - Only the first occurrence of the blue pixel matters.
  - The gap must contain only white pixels and be immediately left of the blue pixel.
  - The pixel left of the gap must exist and be neither white nor blue.

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid as a list containing a single list of integers (representing one row).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the index of the *first* blue pixel (`1`). Let this index be `blue_idx`.
4.  If no blue pixel is found, or if `blue_idx` is 0, return the unmodified output grid.
5.  Starting from the index `blue_idx - 1`, scan leftwards to identify the contiguous block of white pixels (`0`). Determine the starting index of this block, `gap_start_idx`.
6.  If no white pixels are found immediately to the left of `blue_idx` (i.e., the pixel at `blue_idx - 1` is not white, or `blue_idx` was 0), return the unmodified output grid. The length of the gap is `gap_length = blue_idx - gap_start_idx`.
7.  Check if a pixel exists immediately to the left of the gap block, i.e., check if `gap_start_idx - 1` is a valid index (>= 0). If not, return the unmodified output grid.
8.  Get the color of the pixel at index `gap_start_idx - 1`. Let this be `source_color`.
9.  Check if `source_color` is neither white (`0`) nor blue (`1`). If it is white or blue, return the unmodified output grid.
10. If all checks passed, modify the output grid: Change the color of all pixels from index `gap_start_idx` up to (but not including) `blue_idx` to `source_color`.
11. Return the modified output grid.
