**Perception**

The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (or single-row grids). Each grid contains sequences of pixels of different colors. The key elements appear to be:
1.  A contiguous block of a single, non-white color (e.g., magenta `6`, red `2`, azure `8`).
2.  A single blue pixel (`1`).
3.  A contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) located immediately between the non-white block and the blue pixel.

The transformation involves extending the non-white color block to the right, replacing the white pixels that lie between it and the blue pixel. The blue pixel acts as a boundary, stopping the extension. The number of white pixels being replaced determines the extent of the extension. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

    condition: The sequence source_block, gap_block, boundary_pixel must exist.
    effect: The length of the source_block effectively increases by the length of the gap_block. The gap_block disappears, replaced by the extended source_block. The boundary_pixel remains unchanged and marks the end of the extended block.
constraints:
  - The source color is never white (0) or blue (1).
  - The boundary pixel is always blue (1).
  - The gap block consists only of white pixels (0).
  - All other pixels outside this identified sequence remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single blue pixel (`1`) in the input grid.
2.  Scan the grid to the left of the blue pixel.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) immediately preceding the blue pixel. Record the number of these white pixels (let this be `N`). If there are no white pixels immediately preceding the blue pixel (`N=0`), no change occurs in this step.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white, non-blue pixels immediately preceding the block of white pixels (or immediately preceding the blue pixel if `N=0`). Record the color of this block (let this be `C`).
5.  Modify the input grid: Change the color of the `N` white pixels identified in step 3 to color `C`.
6.  Leave all other pixels in the grid unchanged.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed because it returned the input unchanged for all training examples. A detailed trace suggested the core logic for identifying the blue pixel, the preceding white gap, and the source color pixel was correct for a 1D list input. However, the observed failure (returning the original input) strongly implies that the code might have incorrectly processed the input grid format. Specifically, if the input was treated as a 1xN 2D array instead of a 1D array, the blue pixel index finding (`np.where(grid == 1)[0]`) would return the row index (0), leading the code to exit early via the `if blue_idx == 0:` check.

The strategy is to modify the code to explicitly handle both 1D list inputs and potential 1xN list-of-lists or numpy array inputs. This involves adjusting how indices are extracted and used. The YAML description and Natural Language Program will be refined to reflect this potential input structure and clarify the exact sequence pattern being targeted.

**Metrics**

| Example | Input Shape (assumed 1xN) | Blue Index (col) | Gap Indices (col) | Gap Length | Source Index (col) | Source Color | Pixels Changed | Expected Output Matches Pattern? |
| :------ | :------------------------ | :--------------- | :---------------- | :--------- | :----------------- | :----------- | :------------- | :----------------------------- |

| 2       | 1x15                      | 6                | [4, 5]            | 2          | 3                  | 2 (Red)      | 2              | Yes                            |
| 3       | 1x15                      | 9                | [6, 7, 8]         | 3          | 5                  | 8 (Azure)    | 3              | Yes                            |

**Assumptions based on metrics:**
1.  Inputs are effectively 1D sequences, potentially represented as 1xN grids.
2.  There is exactly one blue pixel (`1`) relevant to the transformation.
3.  The transformation involves filling a gap of white pixels (`0`) located immediately to the left of the blue pixel.
4.  The color used for filling is determined by the pixel immediately to the left of the white gap.
5.  The source color pixel must be non-white (`0`) and non-blue (`1`).
6.  The transformation only occurs if such a sequence (non-white/non-blue color -> white gap -> blue) exists.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Inspect the input grid. Treat it as a single row (sequence) of pixels, even if represented as a 1xN array.
2.  Locate the index (column index) of the *first* blue pixel (`1`). If no blue pixel exists, or if the blue pixel is at the very beginning (index 0), make no changes and return the original grid.
3.  Starting from the pixel immediately to the left of the blue pixel, scan leftwards to identify the contiguous block of white pixels (`0`). Determine the starting index and ending index (which is just before the blue pixel) of this white 'gap'.
4.  If no white pixels are found immediately before the blue pixel (i.e., the gap has zero length), make no changes and return the original grid.
5.  Identify the pixel immediately to the left of the identified white gap. Let its color be `C` and its index be `source_idx`.
6.  Check if the `source_idx` is valid (i.e., not less than 0) and if the color `C` is neither white (`0`) nor blue (`1`).
7.  If both conditions in step 6 are met, change the color of all pixels within the white gap (identified in step 3) to the color `C`.
8.  If the conditions in step 6 are not met (e.g., the gap starts at the beginning of the grid, or the preceding pixel is white or blue), make no changes.
9.  Return the modified grid.
