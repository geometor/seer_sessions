task_type: array_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: source_block
    description: A sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: (variable, not white)
      - length: (variable, >= 1)
      - position: (variable)
  - type: contiguous_block
    id: gap_block
    description: A sequence of white pixels (0) immediately to the right of the source_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: (variable, >= 0)
      - position: immediately follows source_block
  - type: single_pixel
    id: boundary_pixel
    description: A single blue pixel (1) immediately to the right of the gap_block.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: immediately follows gap_block
relationship:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_block, gap_block, and boundary_pixel appear consecutively from left to right. `source_block -> gap_block -> boundary_pixel`
action:
  - type: replace_color
    target: gap_block
    description: Replace the color of all pixels within the gap_block with the color of the source_block.
    condition: The sequence source_block, gap_block, boundary_pixel must exist.
    effect: The length of the source_block effectively increases by the length of the gap_block. The gap_block disappears, replaced by the extended source_block. The boundary_pixel remains unchanged and marks the end of the extended block.
constraints:
  - The source color is never white (0) or blue (1).
  - The boundary pixel is always blue (1).
  - The gap block consists only of white pixels (0).
  - All other pixels outside this identified sequence remain unchanged.
