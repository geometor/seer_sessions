The key elements appear to be:\n1.  A contiguous block of a single, non-white color (e.g., magenta `6`, red `2`, azure `8`).\n2.  A single blue pixel (`1`).\n3.  A contiguous block of white pixels (`0`) located immediately between the non-white block and the blue pixel.\n\nThe transformation involves extending the non-white color block to the right, replacing the white pixels that lie between it and the blue pixel. The blue pixel acts as a boundary, stopping the extension. The number of white pixels being replaced determines the extent of the extension. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
