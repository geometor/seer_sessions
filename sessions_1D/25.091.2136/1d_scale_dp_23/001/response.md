"""
Identifies the first contiguous block of a single non-white (0), non-gray (5) color and the first gray (5) pixel that appears after this block. 
If the pixels between the end of the color block and the gray pixel are all white (0), these white pixels are changed to the color of the identified block. 
Otherwise, the grid remains unchanged.
