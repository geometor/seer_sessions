*   **Perception**:
    *   The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or grids of height 1).
    *   Each example contains a contiguous block of a single non-white, non-gray color (green in examples 1 & 2, yellow in example 3).
    *   Each example contains a single gray pixel (color 5).
    *   In all examples, the block of color appears before the gray pixel in the sequence.
    *   There are white pixels (color 0) located between the color block and the gray pixel.
    *   The transformation involves changing the color of these intermediate white pixels.
    *   The white pixels are changed to the color of the block that immediately precedes them.
    *   White pixels located before the color block or after the gray pixel remain unchanged.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: fill_gap
    dimensionality: 1D
    objects:
      - type: color_block
        description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white, non-gray pixels.
        properties:
          - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., green, yellow).
          - location: Index range within the array.
      - type: gray_pixel
        description: A single pixel with the gray color (value 5).
        properties:
          - color: gray (5)
          - location: Index within the array.
      - type: white_pixel
        description: A pixel with the white color (value 0).
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - location: Index within the array.
      - type: gap
        description: A sequence of one or more white pixels located between the color_block and the gray_pixel.
        properties:
          - location: Index range within the array.
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The color_block appears before the gray_pixel in the sequence.
      - type: containment
        description: The gap exists spatially between the end of the color_block and the start of the gray_pixel.
    actions:
      - name: identify_elements
        description: Locate the color_block, the gray_pixel, and any white pixels between them.
      - name: fill_gap
        description: Change the color of all white pixels within the identified gap to the color of the preceding color_block.
    constraints:
      - The transformation only applies if a color_block exists, a gray_pixel exists after it, and there are only white pixels between them.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Scan the input array from left to right.
    2.  Identify the first contiguous block of pixels having the same non-white, non-gray color. Record its color (let's call it `fill_color`) and the index of its last pixel (`end_color_block_index`). If no such block is found, stop and return the input unchanged.
    3.  Continue scanning from `end_color_block_index + 1` to find the first occurrence of a gray pixel (color 5). Record its index (`gray_pixel_index`). If no gray pixel is found after the color block, stop and return the input unchanged.
    4.  Examine the pixels in the range between `end_color_block_index + 1` and `gray_pixel_index - 1`.
    5.  If all pixels in this range are white (color 0), change their color to `fill_color`.
    6.  If any pixel in this range is not white, make no changes to the input array in this step.
    7.  Return the modified (or original, if no changes were made) array.
