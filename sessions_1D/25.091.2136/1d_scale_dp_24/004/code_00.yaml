task_type: array_modification_1d
description: Modifies a 1D array (represented as a single-row grid) by filling a gap.
components:
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    description: A single pixel marking the end of the region to modify.
  - type: source_block
    color: non-white (varies: red, orange, gray in examples)
    location: To the left of the marker_pixel.
    property: contiguous
    description: A sequence of identical non-white pixels defining the color to use for filling.
  - type: gap_pixels
    color: white (0)
    location: Between the rightmost pixel of the source_block and the marker_pixel.
    description: A sequence of zero or more white pixels to be replaced.
  - type: other_pixels
    color: any
    location: Before the source_block or after the marker_pixel.
    description: Pixels outside the main interaction zone, which remain unchanged.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_block is to the left of the marker_pixel, potentially separated by gap_pixels.
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: marker_pixel (maroon 9)
    result: marker_index
  - action: identify
    target: rightmost pixel of the source_block (first non-white pixel scanning left from marker_index)
    result: block_end_index, block_color
  - action: identify
    target: gap_pixels (indices from block_end_index + 1 to marker_index - 1)
    result: gap_indices
  - action: modify
    target: input array copy
    operation: replace_color
    details: For each index in gap_indices, change the pixel color from white (0) to block_color.
  - constraint: Pixels at indices 0 to block_end_index remain unchanged.
  - constraint: Pixel at marker_index remains unchanged (maroon 9).
  - constraint: Pixels at indices marker_index + 1 to the end remain unchanged.
output_derivation: The modified array copy becomes the output array.
