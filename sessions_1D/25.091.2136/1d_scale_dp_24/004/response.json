            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis incorrectly perceived the transformation as moving the maroon pixel. Re-examination of the input-output pairs reveals that the core transformation involves identifying a contiguous block of non-white color to the left of a single maroon (9) pixel, and then filling the gap of white (0) pixels between them with the color of the block. The maroon pixel itself, and all pixels to its right, retain their original positions relative to the start of the array. The Python code error reported (\"The truth value of an array...\") seems unrelated to the core logic flaw identified and is likely an artifact of the testing environment or comparison method, but correcting the underlying transformation logic is the primary goal.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nExample 1:\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   Maroon Index: 20\n*   Block End Index (Red, 2): 17\n*   Gap Indices (White, 0): 18, 19\n*   Action: Fill indices 18, 19 with color 2.\n\nExample 2:\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]`\n*   Output: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]`\n*   Maroon Index: 23\n*   Block End Index (Orange, 7): 19\n*   Gap Indices (White, 0): 20, 21, 22\n*   Action: Fill indices 20, 21, 22 with color 7.\n\nExample 3:\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   Output: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   Maroon Index: 20\n*   Block End Index (Gray, 5): 17\n*   Gap Indices (White, 0): 18, 19\n*   Action: Fill indices 18, 19 with color 5.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
