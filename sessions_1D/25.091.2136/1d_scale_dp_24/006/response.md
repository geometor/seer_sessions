**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt failed due to a mismatch between the implemented logic and the observed transformation, compounded by a likely type mismatch (expecting Python lists but receiving NumPy arrays from the execution environment). The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests that a NumPy array was used in a context expecting a single boolean value, which happens when comparing arrays or using them directly in conditionals without `.any()` or `.all()`.

The initial interpretation of the task (moving the maroon pixel leftwards to be adjacent to the colored block and shifting the intervening white pixels) appears correct based on re-examining the examples. The code provided for testing implemented a *different* logic (filling the gap with the block's color), which was incorrect.

The strategy is to:
1.  Revert to the original, correct transformation logic: move the maroon pixel and shift the white pixels.
2.  Ensure the implementation correctly handles potential NumPy array inputs, using appropriate methods for searching and array manipulation (e.g., `np.where`, `np.concatenate`).
3.  Verify assumptions about the input structure (1D, single maroon pixel, single block) using code execution.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the structure of the inputs and outputs.


``` python
import numpy as np

examples = [
    {"input": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),
     "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])},
    {"input": np.array([[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]]),
     "output": np.array([[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]])},
    {"input": np.array([[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),
     "output": np.array([[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])}
]

results = []
for i, ex in enumerate(examples):
    inp = ex["input"]
    out = ex["output"]
    
    inp_shape = inp.shape
    out_shape = out.shape
    
    inp_row = inp[0]
    maroon_indices = np.where(inp_row == 9)[0]
    maroon_count = len(maroon_indices)
    
    if maroon_count != 1:
        results.append(f"Example {i+1}: Input has {maroon_count} maroon pixels (expected 1).")
        continue
        
    maroon_idx = maroon_indices[0]
    
    # Find block end index
    block_end_idx = -1
    for j in range(maroon_idx - 1, -1, -1):
        if inp_row[j] != 0:
            block_end_idx = j
            break
            
    if block_end_idx == -1:
        results.append(f"Example {i+1}: No non-white block found left of maroon pixel.")
        continue
        
    # Check pixels between block end and maroon
    gap_pixels = inp_row[block_end_idx + 1 : maroon_idx]
    all_white_in_gap = np.all(gap_pixels == 0)
    
    results.append(f"Example {i+1}: Input shape={inp_shape}, Output shape={out_shape}, Maroon index={maroon_idx}, Block end index={block_end_idx}, Gap pixels={gap_pixels.tolist()}, All white in gap={all_white_in_gap}")

print("\n".join(results))
```
```
Example 1: Input shape=(1, 26), Output shape=(1, 26), Maroon index=20, Block end index=17, Gap pixels=[0, 0], All white in gap=True
Example 2: Input shape=(1, 26), Output shape=(1, 26), Maroon index=23, Block end index=19, Gap pixels=[0, 0, 0], All white in gap=True
Example 3: Input shape=(1, 26), Output shape=(1, 26), Maroon index=20, Block end index=17, Gap pixels=[0, 0], All white in gap=True

```
The metrics confirm:
*   All inputs and outputs are 1xN arrays.
*   Each input contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel.
*   There is always a non-white block ending immediately to the left of a sequence of white pixels, which precedes the maroon pixel.
*   The pixels between the end of the colored block and the maroon pixel are always white (0).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a single row (1D array).
2.  Locate the index of the single maroon (9) pixel (`marker_index`).
3.  Scan leftwards from the index immediately preceding the maroon pixel (`marker_index - 1`) to find the index of the first non-white pixel encountered. This is the rightmost pixel of the colored block (`block_end_index`).
4.  Identify the segment of the input array containing the white pixels originally between the block and the marker (from index `block_end_index + 1` up to, but not including, `marker_index`). Call this the `gap_segment`.
5.  Construct the output row by concatenating the following parts in order:
    a.  The segment of the input row from the beginning up to and including `block_end_index`.
    b.  The maroon (9) pixel.
    c.  The `gap_segment`.
    d.  The segment of the input row starting from the index immediately after the original marker position (`marker_index + 1`) to the end of the row.
6.  Return the constructed row as the single row of the output grid.
