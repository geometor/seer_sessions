            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous attempt failed due to a mismatch between the implemented logic and the observed transformation, compounded by a likely type mismatch (expecting Python lists but receiving NumPy arrays from the execution environment). The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly suggests that a NumPy array was used in a context expecting a single boolean value, which happens when comparing arrays or using them directly in conditionals without `.any()` or `.all()`.\n\nThe initial interpretation of the task (moving the maroon pixel leftwards to be adjacent to the colored block and shifting the intervening white pixels) appears correct based on re-examining the examples. The code provided for testing implemented a *different* logic (filling the gap with the block's color), which was incorrect.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Revert to the original, correct transformation logic: move the maroon pixel and shift the white pixels.\n2.  Ensure the implementation correctly handles potential NumPy array inputs, using appropriate methods for searching and array manipulation (e.g., `np.where`, `np.concatenate`).\n3.  Verify assumptions about the input structure (1D, single maroon pixel, single block) using code execution.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the structure of the inputs and outputs.\n\n"
