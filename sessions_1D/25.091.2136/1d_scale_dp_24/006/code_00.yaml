task_type: array_manipulation_1d
grid_properties:
  - dimension: 1
  - height: 1
  - width: variable
input_components:
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    count: 1
  - object: marker
    description: A single pixel used as a reference point.
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of white (0) pixels.
    location: Situated immediately between the right end of the 'block' and the 'marker'.
    count: 1
    length: variable (can be zero or more)
  - object: background
    description: White (0) pixels located outside the block, gap, and marker.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_sequence
    description: From left to right, the relevant components appear as [optional background], block, gap, marker, [optional background].
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: marker (maroon pixel)
    result: marker_index
  - action: identify
    target: rightmost pixel of the block
    reference: Scan leftwards starting from marker_index - 1
    result: block_end_index
  - action: identify
    target: gap pixels
    location: Between block_end_index + 1 and marker_index - 1
    result: gap_segment
  - action: construct_output
    description: Reassemble the array segments in a new order.
    order:
      1. Input segment from start up to and including block_end_index.
      2. The marker pixel (maroon 9).
      3. The identified gap_segment (sequence of white pixels).
      4. Input segment from marker_index + 1 to the end.
output_properties:
  - The marker pixel is now immediately adjacent to the right end of the block.
  - The gap pixels are now immediately to the right of the moved marker pixel.
  - The length and all pixel values (just rearranged) are preserved from the input.
