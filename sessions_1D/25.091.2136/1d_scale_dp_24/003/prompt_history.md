*   **Perception:** The task operates on a 1-dimensional array of pixels. Each example contains a single maroon (9) pixel and a contiguous block of another non-white color (red, orange, or gray). There are white (0) pixels separating the colored block and the maroon pixel. The transformation involves moving the maroon pixel leftwards until it is immediately adjacent to the right end of the colored block. The white pixels originally between the block and the maroon pixel are shifted to the right, filling the space vacated by the maroon pixel and ending up immediately to its right. The relative order and position of all other pixels remain unchanged.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous Python code failed with a NumPy-related error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") on all training examples. This error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a context expecting a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`). Given that the provided `transform` function primarily uses standard Python lists and operations, it's highly probable that the error occurred *outside* this function, likely within the testing harness when comparing the function's list-based output with an expected output stored or processed as a NumPy array. The comparison logic (e.g., `result == expected`) needs to handle arrays explicitly (e.g., `np.array_equal(result, expected)`).

The core logic described in the previous natural language program and implemented in the Python function (finding the maroon pixel, finding the end of the colored block to its left, and rearranging the segments) appears to correctly match the transformation shown in the examples.

**Strategy:**
1.  Re-confirm the understanding of the transformation by analyzing the correctly parsed input/output pairs.
2.  Gather metrics on the parsed data.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to ensure clarity and accuracy, explicitly mentioning the grid structure (even for 1D data) and the sequence manipulation.
4.  Assume the transformation logic itself is sound and the error was external. The focus remains on accurately describing the *intended* transformation.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a grid containing a single row of pixels. Let this row be `input_row`.
2.  Find the index (`maroon_index`) of the single maroon (9) pixel within `input_row`.
3.  Find the index (`block_end_index`) of the rightmost non-white (non-zero) pixel that is located at an index less than `maroon_index`. Scan backwards from `maroon_index - 1` towards the start of the row.
4.  Create a new list, `output_row`.
5.  Append the segment of `input_row` from the beginning (index 0) up to and including `block_end_index` to `output_row`.
6.  Append the maroon (9) pixel to `output_row`.
7.  Append the segment of `input_row` containing the white (0) pixels that were originally between the block and the maroon pixel (from index `block_end_index + 1` up to, but not including, `maroon_index`) to `output_row`.
8.  Append the segment of `input_row` starting from the index immediately after the original position of the maroon pixel (`maroon_index + 1`) to the end of the row to `output_row`.
9.  Return the final `output_row` enclosed in a list, representing the output grid `[[output_row]]`.
