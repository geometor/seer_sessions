Modifies a 1D array (represented as a single-row grid) by filling a gap.
It locates the single maroon (9) pixel and the rightmost non-white pixel 
to its left. The color of this non-white pixel is determined. Then, all 
white (0) pixels located between this non-white pixel and the maroon pixel 
are replaced with the determined color. All other pixels remain unchanged.
