"""
Transforms a 1D array (represented as a single-row grid) by moving a 
marker pixel (maroon 9) and shifting an adjacent gap of white pixels. 
It locates the single maroon (9) pixel and the rightmost non-white pixel 
to its left (the end of a colored block). The maroon pixel is moved to 
be immediately adjacent to the right of this block-end pixel. The sequence 
of white pixels originally situated between the block-end and the maroon 
pixel (the gap) is then placed immediately to the right of the moved 
maroon pixel. All other pixels retain their original relative order.
