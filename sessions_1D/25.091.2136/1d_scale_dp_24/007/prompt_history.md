*   **Perception:** The task operates on a 1-dimensional array of pixels. Each example contains a single maroon (9) pixel and a contiguous block of another non-white color (red, orange, or gray). There are white (0) pixels separating the colored block and the maroon pixel. The transformation involves moving the maroon pixel leftwards until it is immediately adjacent to the right end of the colored block. The white pixels originally between the block and the maroon pixel are shifted to the right, filling the space vacated by the maroon pixel and ending up immediately to its right. The relative order and position of all other pixels remain unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts:**

      - type: background_pixels
        color: white (0)
        location: Outside the block, separator, and target region.
        description: Pixels forming the rest of the array.
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The target_pixel is initially located to the right of the contiguous_block, potentially separated by separator_pixels.

        result: block_end_index
      - action: move
        target: target_pixel
        destination: position immediately right of block_end_index (index = block_end_index + 1)
      - action: move
        target: separator_pixels (originally between block_end_index and target_index)
        destination: positions immediately right of the new target_pixel location.

    1.  Locate the index of the single maroon (9) pixel (`maroon_index`).
    2.  Scan leftwards from the position just before the maroon pixel (`maroon_index - 1`) to find the index of the first non-white (non-zero) pixel encountered. This is the rightmost boundary of the contiguous colored block (`block_end_index`).
    3.  Construct the output array by concatenating the following segments:
        a.  The portion of the input array from the beginning up to and including `block_end_index`.
        b.  The maroon (9) pixel.
        c.  The sequence of white (0) pixels that were originally located in the input array between `block_end_index` and `maroon_index` (specifically, from index `block_end_index + 1` to `maroon_index - 1`).
        d.  The portion of the input array starting from the position immediately after the original maroon pixel (`maroon_index + 1`) to the end of the array.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt failed due to a mismatch between the implemented logic and the observed transformation, compounded by a likely type mismatch (expecting Python lists but receiving NumPy arrays from the execution environment). The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests that a NumPy array was used in a context expecting a single boolean value, which happens when comparing arrays or using them directly in conditionals without `.any()` or `.all()`.

The initial interpretation of the task (moving the maroon pixel leftwards to be adjacent to the colored block and shifting the intervening white pixels) appears correct based on re-examining the examples. The code provided for testing implemented a *different* logic (filling the gap with the block's color), which was incorrect.

The strategy is to:
1.  Revert to the original, correct transformation logic: move the maroon pixel and shift the white pixels.
2.  Ensure the implementation correctly handles potential NumPy array inputs, using appropriate methods for searching and array manipulation (e.g., `np.where`, `np.concatenate`).
3.  Verify assumptions about the input structure (1D, single maroon pixel, single block) using code execution.

Example 3: Input shape=(1, 26), Output shape=(1, 26), Maroon index=20, Block end index=17, Gap pixels=[0, 0], All white in gap=True

```
The metrics confirm:
*   All inputs and outputs are 1xN arrays.
*   Each input contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel.
*   There is always a non-white block ending immediately to the left of a sequence of white pixels, which precedes the maroon pixel.
*   The pixels between the end of the colored block and the maroon pixel are always white (0).

grid_properties:
  - dimension: 1
  - height: 1
  - width: variable
input_components:
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    count: 1
  - object: marker
    description: A single pixel used as a reference point.
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of white (0) pixels.
    location: Situated immediately between the right end of the 'block' and the 'marker'.
    count: 1
    length: variable (can be zero or more)
  - object: background
    description: White (0) pixels located outside the block, gap, and marker.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_sequence
    description: From left to right, the relevant components appear as [optional background], block, gap, marker, [optional background].
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: marker (maroon pixel)
    result: marker_index
  - action: identify
    target: rightmost pixel of the block
    reference: Scan leftwards starting from marker_index - 1
    result: block_end_index
  - action: identify
    target: gap pixels
    location: Between block_end_index + 1 and marker_index - 1
    result: gap_segment
  - action: construct_output
    description: Reassemble the array segments in a new order.
    order:
      1. Input segment from start up to and including block_end_index.
      2. The marker pixel (maroon 9).
      3. The identified gap_segment (sequence of white pixels).
      4. Input segment from marker_index + 1 to the end.
output_properties:
  - The marker pixel is now immediately adjacent to the right end of the block.
  - The gap pixels are now immediately to the right of the moved marker pixel.
  - The length and all pixel values (just rearranged) are preserved from the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a single row (1D array).
2.  Locate the index of the single maroon (9) pixel (`marker_index`).
3.  Scan leftwards from the index immediately preceding the maroon pixel (`marker_index - 1`) to find the index of the first non-white pixel encountered. This is the rightmost pixel of the colored block (`block_end_index`).
4.  Identify the segment of the input array containing the white pixels originally between the block and the marker (from index `block_end_index + 1` up to, but not including, `marker_index`). Call this the `gap_segment`.
5.  Construct the output row by concatenating the following parts in order:
    a.  The segment of the input row from the beginning up to and including `block_end_index`.
    b.  The maroon (9) pixel.
    c.  The `gap_segment`.
    d.  The segment of the input row starting from the index immediately after the original marker position (`marker_index + 1`) to the end of the row.
6.  Return the constructed row as the single row of the output grid.
