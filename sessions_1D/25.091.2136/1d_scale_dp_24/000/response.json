Each example contains a single maroon (9) pixel and a contiguous block of another non-white color (red, orange, or gray). There are white (0) pixels separating the colored block and the maroon pixel. The transformation involves moving the maroon pixel leftwards until it is immediately adjacent to the right end of the colored block. The white pixels originally between the block and the maroon pixel are shifted to the right, filling the space vacated by the maroon pixel and ending up immediately to its right. The relative order and position of all other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
