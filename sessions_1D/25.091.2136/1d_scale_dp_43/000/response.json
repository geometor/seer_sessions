A contiguous block of a single color (let's call this the 'primary color'), which is not white (0) or gray (5).\n2.  A single gray pixel (5).\n3.  Some white pixels (0), potentially located between the primary color block and the gray pixel.\n\nThe transformation involves extending the primary color block to fill any white pixels that lie directly between the end of the primary block and the gray pixel. The filling stops just before the gray pixel. The primary color block itself, the gray pixel, and any white pixels not between the block and the gray pixel remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
