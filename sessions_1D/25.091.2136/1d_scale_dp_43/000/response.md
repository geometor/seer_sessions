**Perception:**

The input is always a single row (1D array) of colored pixels. Each input contains:
1.  A contiguous block of a single color (let's call this the 'primary color'), which is not white (0) or gray (5).
2.  A single gray pixel (5).
3.  Some white pixels (0), potentially located between the primary color block and the gray pixel.

The transformation involves extending the primary color block to fill any white pixels that lie directly between the end of the primary block and the gray pixel. The filling stops just before the gray pixel. The primary color block itself, the gray pixel, and any white pixels not between the block and the gray pixel remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Fill the gap between a colored block and a gray pixel.

Input:
  - type: 1D array (single row grid)
  - contains:
    - object_1:
        property: contiguous block
        property: single color (not white=0, not gray=5) - referred to as 'primary_color'
        count: 1
    - object_2:
        property: single pixel
        property: color gray=5
        count: 1
    - object_3:
        property: pixel
        property: color white=0
        count: variable (can be zero or more)
        location: some may be situated between object_1 and object_2

Output:
  - type: 1D array (single row grid)
  - structure: same dimensions as input

Transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: object_1 (primary_color block)
    result: primary_color value and index range
  - action: identify
    target: object_2 (gray pixel)
    result: gray pixel index
  - action: identify
    target: object_3 (white pixels) located between the boundary of object_1 closest to object_2 and object_2 itself.
  - action: change_color
    target: identified white pixels (object_3 between object_1 and object_2)
    new_color: primary_color value
  - relationship: The gray pixel acts as a boundary or stop signal for the color filling process.
  - rule: Fill white pixels between the primary color block and the gray pixel with the primary color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output array.
2.  Identify the primary color: Find the color that forms a contiguous block and is not white (0) or gray (5).
3.  Find the start and end indices of the primary color block.
4.  Find the index of the gray pixel (5).
5.  Determine if the gray pixel is to the right or left of the primary color block.
6.  If the gray pixel's index is greater than the end index of the primary block:
    *   Iterate through the indices starting from `end_index + 1` up to (but not including) the gray pixel's index.
    *   For each index in this range, if the pixel in the output array is white (0), change its color to the primary color.
7.  If the gray pixel's index is less than the start index of the primary block:
    *   Iterate through the indices starting from `start_index - 1` down to (but not including) the gray pixel's index.
    *   For each index in this range, if the pixel in the output array is white (0), change its color to the primary color.
8.  Return the modified output array.
