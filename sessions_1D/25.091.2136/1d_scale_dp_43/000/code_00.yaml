Task: Fill the gap between a colored block and a gray pixel.

Input:
  - type: 1D array (single row grid)
  - contains:
    - object_1:
        property: contiguous block
        property: single color (not white=0, not gray=5) - referred to as 'primary_color'
        count: 1
    - object_2:
        property: single pixel
        property: color gray=5
        count: 1
    - object_3:
        property: pixel
        property: color white=0
        count: variable (can be zero or more)
        location: some may be situated between object_1 and object_2

Output:
  - type: 1D array (single row grid)
  - structure: same dimensions as input

Transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: object_1 (primary_color block)
    result: primary_color value and index range
  - action: identify
    target: object_2 (gray pixel)
    result: gray pixel index
  - action: identify
    target: object_3 (white pixels) located between the boundary of object_1 closest to object_2 and object_2 itself.
  - action: change_color
    target: identified white pixels (object_3 between object_1 and object_2)
    new_color: primary_color value
  - relationship: The gray pixel acts as a boundary or stop signal for the color filling process.
  - rule: Fill white pixels between the primary color block and the gray pixel with the primary color.
