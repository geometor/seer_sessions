**Perception:**

The input is always a single row (1D array) of colored pixels. Each input contains:
1.  A contiguous block of a single color (let's call this the 'primary color'), which is not white (0) or gray (5).
2.  A single gray pixel (5).
3.  Some white pixels (0), potentially located between the primary color block and the gray pixel.

The transformation involves extending the primary color block to fill any white pixels that lie directly between the end of the primary block and the gray pixel. The filling stops just before the gray pixel. The primary color block itself, the gray pixel, and any white pixels not between the block and the gray pixel remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Fill the gap between a colored block and a gray pixel.

Input:
  - type: 1D array (single row grid)
  - contains:
    - object_1:
        property: contiguous block
        property: single color (not white=0, not gray=5) - referred to as 'primary_color'
        count: 1
    - object_2:
        property: single pixel
        property: color gray=5
        count: 1
    - object_3:
        property: pixel
        property: color white=0
        count: variable (can be zero or more)
        location: some may be situated between object_1 and object_2

Output:
  - type: 1D array (single row grid)
  - structure: same dimensions as input

Transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: object_1 (primary_color block)
    result: primary_color value and index range
  - action: identify
    target: object_2 (gray pixel)
    result: gray pixel index
  - action: identify
    target: object_3 (white pixels) located between the boundary of object_1 closest to object_2 and object_2 itself.
  - action: change_color
    target: identified white pixels (object_3 between object_1 and object_2)
    new_color: primary_color value
  - relationship: The gray pixel acts as a boundary or stop signal for the color filling process.
  - rule: Fill white pixels between the primary color block and the gray pixel with the primary color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the output array.
2.  Identify the primary color: Find the color that forms a contiguous block and is not white (0) or gray (5).
3.  Find the start and end indices of the primary color block.
4.  Find the index of the gray pixel (5).
5.  Determine if the gray pixel is to the right or left of the primary color block.
6.  If the gray pixel's index is greater than the end index of the primary block:
    *   Iterate through the indices starting from `end_index + 1` up to (but not including) the gray pixel's index.
    *   For each index in this range, if the pixel in the output array is white (0), change its color to the primary color.
7.  If the gray pixel's index is less than the start index of the primary block:
    *   Iterate through the indices starting from `start_index - 1` down to (but not including) the gray pixel's index.
    *   For each index in this range, if the pixel in the output array is white (0), change its color to the primary color.
8.  Return the modified output array.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: filling the white space between a block of 'primary' color and a gray 'boundary' pixel with the primary color. The provided training examples are consistent with this rule. The Python code implements this logic.

The error `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` strongly suggests that the testing environment is using NumPy arrays, and either the input is passed as a NumPy array and not handled correctly, or the comparison between the function's output (list of lists) and the expected output (potentially a NumPy array in the test harness) is causing the issue. The error is not indicative of a flaw in the *transformation logic* itself, but rather in the *implementation's handling of data types* or the *interaction with the testing environment*.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the properties of inputs and outputs across all examples.
2.  Refine the understanding of the objects and actions.
3.  Maintain the core logic in the Natural Language Program, as it appears correct based on the visual transformation shown in the examples.
4.  Acknowledge the likely data type issue (NumPy vs. list) as a key point for the Coder phase to address during implementation/debugging.

Task: Fill the gap between a colored block and a gray pixel in a 1D array.

Input:
  - type: 1D array (single row grid, 1xN)
  - dimensions: Observed as 1x15 in examples.
  - contains:
    - object_1:
        property: contiguous block
        property: single color (not white=0, not gray=5) - referred to as 'primary_color'
        count: 1
        location: Can start at index 0 or later.

Output:
  - type: 1D array (single row grid)
  - structure: Same dimensions as input (1xN).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid (assumed to be a single row, potentially represented as a list of lists or a compatible array format). Create a modifiable copy of this row for the output.
2.  Identify the 'primary color' by finding the first pixel in the row that is neither white (0) nor gray (5).
3.  Locate the contiguous block of this 'primary color'. Determine its start index (`start_idx`) and end index (`end_idx`).
4.  Find the index (`gray_idx`) of the single gray pixel (5).
5.  Check if both a primary block and a gray pixel were found. If not, return the unmodified copy of the input row (wrapped as a list of lists).
6.  Determine the range of indices that constitute the 'gap' between the primary block and the gray pixel:
    *   If the gray pixel is to the right of the block (`gray_idx > end_idx`), the gap indices range from `end_idx + 1` up to (but not including) `gray_idx`.
    *   If the gray pixel is to the left of the block (`gray_idx < start_idx`), the gap indices range from `gray_idx + 1` up to (but not including) `start_idx`.
    *   If there is no space between them (e.g., `gray_idx == end_idx + 1` or `gray_idx == start_idx - 1`), or if the gray pixel is within the block (which shouldn't happen based on problem constraints but good to consider), the gap is empty.
7.  Iterate through the indices identified as being within the 'gap'.
8.  For each index in the gap, if the pixel at that index in the (copied) output row is white (0), change its value to the 'primary color'.
9.  Return the modified output row, ensuring it is formatted as a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[modified_row]]`).
