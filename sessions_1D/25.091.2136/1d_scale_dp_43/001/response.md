```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a 1D input grid (represented as a single row) by finding a contiguous block of a 'primary' color (not white=0, not gray=5) and a single gray=5 pixel. It then fills any white=0 pixels located directly between the primary color block and the gray pixel with the primary color. The filling stops adjacent to the gray pixel.
