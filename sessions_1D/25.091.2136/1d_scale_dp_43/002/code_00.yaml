Task: Fill the gap between a colored block and a gray pixel in a 1D array.

Input:
  - type: 1D array (single row grid, 1xN)
  - dimensions: Observed as 1x15 in examples.
  - contains:
    - object_1:
        property: contiguous block
        property: single color (not white=0, not gray=5) - referred to as 'primary_color'
        count: 1
        location: Can start at index 0 or later.
    - object_2:
        property: single pixel
        property: color gray=5
        count: 1
        location: Observed to the right of object_1 in examples.
    - object_3:
        property: pixel
        property: color white=0
        count: variable (can be zero or more)
        location: Some may be situated spatially between the boundary of object_1 and object_2. Others may exist outside this gap.

Output:
  - type: 1D array (single row grid)
  - structure: Same dimensions as input (1xN).

Transformation:
  - define: 'gap' as the sequence of pixels strictly between the index boundary of object_1 (primary_color block) and the index of object_2 (gray pixel).
  - action: identify
    target: object_1 (primary_color block)
    result: primary_color value, start index, end index
  - action: identify
    target: object_2 (gray pixel)
    result: gray pixel index
  - action: identify
    target: object_3 (white pixels) located within the 'gap'.
  - action: change_color
    target: identified white pixels within the 'gap'.
    new_color: primary_color value.
  - rule: All white pixels located strictly between the primary color block and the gray pixel are changed to the primary color.
  - invariant: The primary color block itself, the gray pixel, and any white pixels outside the gap remain unchanged.
