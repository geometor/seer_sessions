The provided training examples are consistent with this rule. The Python code implements this logic.\n\nThe error `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` strongly suggests that the testing environment is using NumPy arrays, and either the input is passed as a NumPy array and not handled correctly, or the comparison between the function's output (list of lists) and the expected output (potentially a NumPy array in the test harness) is causing the issue. The error is not indicative of a flaw in the *transformation logic* itself, but rather in the *implementation's handling of data types* or the *interaction with the testing environment*.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the properties of inputs and outputs across all examples.\n2.  Refine the understanding of the objects and actions.\n3.  Maintain the core logic in the Natural Language Program, as it appears correct based on the visual transformation shown in the examples.\n4.  Acknowledge the likely data type issue (NumPy vs. list) as a key point for the Coder phase to address during implementation/debugging.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and components of each example:\n"
