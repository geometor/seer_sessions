task_description: "Fill the gap between a colored block and a marker pixel with the block's color."
grid_dimensionality: "1D (or 1xN)"
elements:
  - element: "background"
    color_code: 0
    color_name: "white"
    role: "Represents empty space, potentially fillable."
  - element: "colored_block"
    properties:
      - "contiguous sequence of identical pixels"
      - "color is not white (0) and not azure (8)"
    role: "The primary object that expands."
  - element: "gap"
    properties:
      - "contiguous sequence of white (0) pixels"
      - "located between the 'colored_block' and the 'marker'"
    role: "The area to be filled."
  - element: "marker"
    color_code: 8
    color_name: "azure"
    properties:
      - "single pixel"
    role: "Acts as a boundary or endpoint for the fill operation."
transformation:
  action: "fill"
  source_object: "colored_block"
  target_area: "gap"
  fill_color: "color of the 'colored_block'"
  boundary: "position immediately before the 'marker' pixel"
invariants:
  - "position and color of the 'marker' pixel"
  - "pixels before the start of the 'colored_block'"
  - "pixels after the 'marker' pixel"
  - "color of the 'colored_block' itself (used for filling)"
