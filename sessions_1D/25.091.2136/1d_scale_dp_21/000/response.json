Each grid contains:\n1.  **Background Pixels:** Represented by the color white (0).\n2.  **A Contiguous Block:** A sequence of identical, non-white, non-azure pixels. The color varies between examples (orange, gray, magenta).\n3.  **A Marker Pixel:** A single azure pixel (8).\n4.  **Gap Pixels:** Zero or more white pixels (0) located between the contiguous block and the marker pixel.\n\nThe transformation involves modifying the gap pixels. Specifically, the contiguous block appears to \"expand\" or \"fill\" the space occupied by the white gap pixels, extending rightwards until it reaches the position just before the azure marker pixel. The color used for filling is the color of the contiguous block itself. The marker pixel and any pixels before the block or after the marker remain unchanged.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
