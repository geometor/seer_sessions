## Perception of Task Elements

The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or can be viewed as 1xN 2D grids). Each grid contains:
1.  **Background Pixels:** Represented by the color white (0).
2.  **A Contiguous Block:** A sequence of identical, non-white, non-azure pixels. The color varies between examples (orange, gray, magenta).
3.  **A Marker Pixel:** A single azure pixel (8).
4.  **Gap Pixels:** Zero or more white pixels (0) located between the contiguous block and the marker pixel.

The transformation involves modifying the gap pixels. Specifically, the contiguous block appears to "expand" or "fill" the space occupied by the white gap pixels, extending rightwards until it reaches the position just before the azure marker pixel. The color used for filling is the color of the contiguous block itself. The marker pixel and any pixels before the block or after the marker remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify the location (index) of the azure marker pixel (8) in the input grid. Let this be `marker_index`.
3.  Identify the main contiguous block of a single non-white (0), non-azure (8) color. Determine its color value (let it be `fill_color`) and the index of its last pixel (let it be `block_end_index`).
4.  Iterate through the grid indices from `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `marker_index`.
5.  For each index in this range, change the pixel value in the output grid to `fill_color`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
