Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) of pixels.
2.  **Key Colors:** The colors involved are white (`0`), yellow (`4`), and one other non-white color per example (magenta `6`, azure `8`, orange `7`).
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** In each example, there's a contiguous block of a non-white color, followed by one or more white pixels, followed by a single yellow pixel.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve extending the non-white color block to the right, replacing the intermediate white pixels until it reaches the position immediately preceding the yellow pixel. The yellow pixel itself and all other pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_gap
description: Fill a gap of white pixels between a colored block and a specific target pixel (yellow) with the color of the block.

elements:
  - object: source_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of pixels with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) or yellow (4).
      - location: Immediately precedes a gap of white pixels.
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: Situated between the source_block and the target_pixel.
      - size: Variable (1 or more pixels).
  - object: target_pixel
    description: A single specific pixel acting as a boundary marker.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - location: Immediately follows the gap.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_block, gap, and target_pixel appear sequentially from left to right. source_block -> gap -> target_pixel.

actions:
  - action: fill
    subject: gap
    details: All pixels within the gap change their color from white (0) to the color of the source_block.
  - action: boundary
    subject: target_pixel
    details: The target_pixel acts as the right boundary for the fill action; its own color and position remain unchanged.

invariants:
  - The position and color of the target_pixel (yellow).
  - The color of the source_block (used for filling).
  - All pixels outside the source_block -> gap -> target_pixel sequence.
  - The dimensions of the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the location (index) of the single yellow (`4`) pixel in the input grid.
2.  Scan leftwards from the position immediately before the yellow pixel.
3.  Identify the sequence of white (`0`) pixels (the gap) encountered while scanning leftwards.
4.  Continue scanning leftwards until the first non-white pixel is found. This marks the end of the gap and the start of the source color block. Note the color of this pixel (the source color).
5.  Modify the input grid: Change the color of all pixels within the identified gap (the white pixels between the source color block and the yellow pixel) to the source color.
6.  Keep all other pixels, including the yellow pixel and the original source block pixels, unchanged.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.
