task_type: fill_gap
description: Fill a gap of white pixels between a colored block and a specific target pixel (yellow) with the color of the block.

elements:
  - object: source_block
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of pixels with the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) or yellow (4).
      - location: Immediately precedes a gap of white pixels.
  - object: gap
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: Situated between the source_block and the target_pixel.
      - size: Variable (1 or more pixels).
  - object: target_pixel
    description: A single specific pixel acting as a boundary marker.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - location: Immediately follows the gap.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The source_block, gap, and target_pixel appear sequentially from left to right. source_block -> gap -> target_pixel.

actions:
  - action: fill
    subject: gap
    details: All pixels within the gap change their color from white (0) to the color of the source_block.
  - action: boundary
    subject: target_pixel
    details: The target_pixel acts as the right boundary for the fill action; its own color and position remain unchanged.

invariants:
  - The position and color of the target_pixel (yellow).
  - The color of the source_block (used for filling).
  - All pixels outside the source_block -> gap -> target_pixel sequence.
  - The dimensions of the grid.
