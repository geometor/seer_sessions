The yellow pixel itself and all other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Continue scanning leftwards until the first non-white pixel is found. This marks the end of the gap and the start of the source color block. Note the color of this pixel (the source color).\n5.  Modify the input grid: Change the color of all pixels within the identified gap (the white pixels between the source color block and the yellow pixel) to the source color.\n6.  Keep all other pixels, including the yellow pixel and the original source block pixels, unchanged.\n7.  The resulting grid is the output."
