**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a single-row grid (1D array) based on the relationship between a contiguous block of colored pixels and a single magenta pixel.

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid is a single row. It contains:
    *   Leading white (0) pixels.
    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white color (e.g., green, gray, blue).
    *   A gap of one or more white (0) pixels.
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel.
    *   Trailing white (0) pixels.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is also a single row, derived from the input.
3.  **Transformation:** The primary change is the extension of the colored block. The gap between the end of the colored block and the magenta pixel is filled with the same color as the block. The magenta pixel itself remains in its position but is now adjacent to the extended block.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_type: Transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
objects:
  - type: Contiguous Block
    properties:
      - color: Variable (non-white, non-magenta, e.g., green, gray, blue)
      - location: Starts after initial white pixels, ends before a gap.
      - relationship: Precedes the Magenta Marker, separated by a White Gap.
  - type: White Gap
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - location: Between the Contiguous Block and the Magenta Marker.
      - size: Variable (one or more pixels).
  - type: Magenta Marker
    properties:
      - color: Magenta (6)
      - count: Exactly one per grid.
      - location: After the White Gap.
      - role: Acts as a boundary or target for the extension.
actions:
  - name: Identify Objects
    inputs: Input grid
    outputs: Contiguous Block, White Gap, Magenta Marker, Block Color
  - name: Fill Gap
    inputs: Input grid, Block Color, White Gap location, Magenta Marker location
    description: Change the color of pixels within the White Gap to the Block Color.
    outputs: Modified grid
relationship: The transformation extends the Contiguous Block rightwards, filling the White Gap with the Block's color, up to the position immediately before the Magenta Marker.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single row containing the data.
2.  Scan the row from left to right to find the first contiguous sequence of non-white, non-magenta pixels (the "Block"). Note its color (the "Fill Color") and the index of its last pixel (the "End Index").
3.  Continue scanning from the "End Index" to find the index of the single magenta pixel (the "Marker Index").
4.  Iterate through the indices from "End Index + 1" up to (but not including) "Marker Index".
5.  For each index in this range, change the pixel's color to the "Fill Color".
6.  Leave all other pixels in the row unchanged. The resulting row is the output.
