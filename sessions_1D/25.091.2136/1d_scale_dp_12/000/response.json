It contains:\n    *   Leading white (0) pixels.\n    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white color (e.g., green, gray, blue).\n    *   A gap of one or more white (0) pixels.\n    *   A single magenta (6) pixel.\n    *   Trailing white (0) pixels.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is also a single row, derived from the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The primary change is the extension of the colored block. The gap between the end of the colored block and the magenta pixel is filled with the same color as the block. The magenta pixel itself remains in its position but is now adjacent to the extended block.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
