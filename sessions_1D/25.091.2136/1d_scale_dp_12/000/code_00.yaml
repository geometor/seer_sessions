task_type: Transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
objects:
  - type: Contiguous Block
    properties:
      - color: Variable (non-white, non-magenta, e.g., green, gray, blue)
      - location: Starts after initial white pixels, ends before a gap.
      - relationship: Precedes the Magenta Marker, separated by a White Gap.
  - type: White Gap
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - location: Between the Contiguous Block and the Magenta Marker.
      - size: Variable (one or more pixels).
  - type: Magenta Marker
    properties:
      - color: Magenta (6)
      - count: Exactly one per grid.
      - location: After the White Gap.
      - role: Acts as a boundary or target for the extension.
actions:
  - name: Identify Objects
    inputs: Input grid
    outputs: Contiguous Block, White Gap, Magenta Marker, Block Color
  - name: Fill Gap
    inputs: Input grid, Block Color, White Gap location, Magenta Marker location
    description: Change the color of pixels within the White Gap to the Block Color.
    outputs: Modified grid
relationship: The transformation extends the Contiguous Block rightwards, filling the White Gap with the Block's color, up to the position immediately before the Magenta Marker.
