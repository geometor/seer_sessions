task_type: grid_transformation_1d
components:
  - type: grid
    dimensionality: 1
  - type: pixel
    attributes: [color, position]
  - type: block
    definition: contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color
    attributes: [color, start_index, end_index, length]
objects:
  - object: white_block
    description: A block where the color of all pixels is white (0).
  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is not white (1-9).
relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: Pixels or blocks being next to each other horizontally.
    properties: [precedes, follows]
actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    target: white_block
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of white pixels in the input grid.
  - action: conditional_replace
    target: white_block
    condition: |
      The white block must be immediately preceded by a non-white pixel
      AND immediately followed by a non-white pixel within the grid boundaries.
    effect: Replace the color of all pixels within the identified white block with the color of the preceding non-white pixel.
