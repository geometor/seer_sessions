            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task operates on 1-dimensional grids (rows of pixels). Each example shows an input row and a corresponding output row. The core transformation seems to involve modifying sequences of white pixels (color 0) based on their neighbors.\n\n*   **Example 1:** `7 7 7 0 0 4 0` becomes `7 7 7 7 7 4 0`. The `0 0` sequence, which is between `7` and `4`, is replaced by `7`s (the color to the left). The final `0`, which is only preceded by `4`, remains unchanged.\n*   **Example 2:** `3 3 3 0 0 4 0` becomes `3 3 3 3 3 4 0`. Similar to Example 1, the `0 0` between `3` and `4` is replaced by `3`s. The final `0` is unchanged.\n*   **Example 3:** `8 8 8 0 0 0 4` becomes `8 8 8 8 8 8 4`. The `0 0 0` sequence between `8` and `4` is replaced by `8`s.\n\nThe pattern suggests that contiguous blocks of white pixels (0) are replaced by the color of the pixel immediately preceding the block, but *only* if the block is also immediately followed by a non-white pixel. White blocks at the end of the grid, or followed by another white pixel, are not changed by this rule.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the input grid from the second pixel (index 1) to the second-to-last pixel (index length-2).\n3.  For each pixel at the current `index`:\n    a. Check if the current pixel's color is white (0).\n    b. Check if the pixel to the left (at `index - 1`) is *not* white (0).\n    c. Check if the pixel to the right (at `index + 1`) is *not* white (0).\n    d. If all three conditions (a, b, c) are true, it means the current white pixel is part of a \"sandwiched\" block. Change the color of the pixel at `index` in the *output* grid to the color of the pixel at `index - 1` in the *input* grid.\n4.  After checking all relevant pixels, return the modified output grid.\n\n*Self-Correction during thought process:* Initially, I considered replacing the *entire* white block at once. However, iterating pixel by pixel and checking its immediate neighbors (left and right) achieves the same result for contiguous blocks and correctly handles single sandwiched white pixels. The iteration range needs to avoid the first and last pixels as they cannot be simultaneously preceded and followed by neighbors within the grid. Let's refine the program slightly to handle blocks identified first.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n2.  Initialize a pointer `i` to 0.\n3.  While `i` is less than the length of the grid:\n    a. If the pixel at index `i` is white (0):\n        i.  Find the end index `j` of the contiguous block of white pixels starting at `i`.\n        ii. Check if the block is preceded by a non-white pixel: Does `i > 0` and is the color at `i-1` not white?\n        iii. Check if the block is followed by a non-white pixel: Does `j < length - 1` and is the color at `j+1` not white?\n        iv. If both conditions (ii and iii) are true, get the color `c` from index `i-1`. Fill the pixels from index `i` to `j` (inclusive) in the *output* grid with color `c`.\n        v.  Update `i` to `j + 1` to move past this processed block.\n    b. Else (the pixel at index `i` is not white):\n        i.  Increment `i` by 1.\n4.  Return the modified output grid."
