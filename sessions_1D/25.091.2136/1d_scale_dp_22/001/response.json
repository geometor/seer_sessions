It iterates through the input sequence from left to right.\n2.  It maintains an 'active fill color', initially set to white (0).\n3.  If it encounters a color that is neither white (0) nor azure (8), it updates \n    the 'active fill color' to this new color.\n4.  If it encounters a white (0) pixel, it changes that pixel to the current \n    'active fill color'.\n5.  This process continues until an azure (8) pixel is encountered. \n6.  Once the azure (8) pixel is found, the filling process stops, and all \n    subsequent pixels retain their original colors from the input sequence.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Define color constants for clarity\nWHITE = 0\nAZURE = 8\n\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a fill transformation to a 1D sequence, stopping at an azure boundary.\n\n    Args:\n        input_sequence: A list or 1D numpy array representing the input sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list or 1D numpy array representing the transformed sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a numpy array for easier handling, although list works too\n    if not isinstance(input_sequence, np.ndarray):\n        input_sequence = np.array(input_sequence)\n\n    # Create a copy of the input sequence to modify and return as the output\n    output_sequence = np.copy(input_sequence)\n\n    # Initialize the active fill color to white\n    active_fill_color = WHITE\n    # Initialize the boundary flag\n    boundary_encountered = False\n\n    # Iterate through the sequence by index\n    for i in range(len(input_sequence)):\n        # Get the color of the current cell from the original input\n        current_color = input_sequence[i]\n\n        # If the boundary has already been encountered, do nothing further\n        if boundary_encountered:\n            continue # Skips to the next iteration, leaving the pixel as is in the output copy\n\n        # Check for the boundary color (Azure 8)\n        if current_color == AZURE:\n            boundary_encountered = True\n            # The azure pixel itself remains azure in the output\n            continue # Move to the next pixel\n\n        # Check for a fill source color (not white, not azure)\n        elif current_color != WHITE and current_color != AZURE:\n            # Update the active fill color\n            active_fill_color = current_color\n            # The source pixel itself remains its original color in the output\n            continue # Move to the next pixel\n\n        # Check for a fill target color (White 0)\n        elif current_color == WHITE:\n            # Change the corresponding cell in the output sequence to the active fill color\n            output_sequence[i] = active_fill_color\n            # Continue to the next pixel\n\n    # Return the modified sequence\n    # Convert back to list if the original input was a list (optional, depends on expected output type)\n    # if isinstance(input_sequence_orig, list): # Need to store original type if conversion is strict\n    #    return output_sequence.tolist()\n    return output_sequence # Return as numpy array by default\n```"
