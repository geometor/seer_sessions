            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D sequence and iterated incorrectly over what was actually a 2D NumPy array (specifically, a 1x14 grid). The `ValueError` arose from comparing a whole row (an array) to a single integer value (the `AZURE` color code).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge the input is a 2D grid.\n2.  Modify the iteration logic to traverse the grid pixel by pixel, typically in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\n3.  Maintain the core fill logic: track the `active_fill_color` seen so far and use it to overwrite white pixels, stopping this process entirely once the `AZURE` boundary pixel is encountered in the traversal order.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nThe following metrics were confirmed using `tool_code`:\n\n*   **Input/Output Shape:** All training examples use a (1, 14) grid shape.\n*   **Azure Pixel:** Each input grid contains exactly one Azure (8) pixel.\n    *   Example 1: Location (0, 7)\n    *   Example 2: Location (0, 12)\n    *   Example 3: Location (0, 12)\n*   **Fill Colors:** The colors used to initiate filling (distinct from White=0 and Azure=8) were Green (3) and Orange (7).\n*   **Transformation:** White pixels (0) appearing *before* the Azure pixel (8) in row-major order are replaced by the most recently seen non-white, non-azure color. Pixels at or after the Azure pixel remain unchanged.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

            "text": "```yaml\nGridProperties:\n  - Shape: Input and output grids are 2D numpy arrays with shape (1, 14).\n  - TraversalOrder: Pixels are processed sequentially in row-major order (row 0, column 0 to 13).\n\nPixelTypes:\n  - Background: White (0). Represents empty space to be potentially filled.\n  - FillSource: Any color other than White (0) or Azure (8). Examples use Green (3) and Orange (7). The *last* encountered FillSource determines the fill color.\n  - Boundary: Azure (8). Acts as a terminal boundary for the fill process. Exactly one instance per grid.\n\nState Variables:\n  - ActiveFillColor: Stores the color value of the most recently encountered FillSource pixel during traversal. Initialized to White (0).\n  - BoundaryEncountered: A boolean flag, initially false. Set to true when the Boundary pixel is processed.\n\nActions:\n  - Iterate: Process grid pixels one by one according to TraversalOrder.\n  - UpdateActiveFillColor: When a FillSource pixel is encountered *before* the Boundary, update the ActiveFillColor state variable.\n  - FillBackground: When a Background pixel (White 0) is encountered *before* the Boundary, change its color in the output grid to the current ActiveFillColor.\n  - HaltOnBoundary: When the Boundary pixel (Azure 8) is encountered, set the BoundaryEncountered flag to true.\n  - CopyPostBoundary: For all pixels processed *after* the BoundaryEncountered flag is true, copy their color directly from the input to the output without modification.\n\nTransformationRule:\n  - Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n  - Initialize ActiveFillColor to White (0) and BoundaryEncountered to false.\n  - Iterate through each pixel (row, col) of the input grid in row-major order.\n  - If BoundaryEncountered is true, skip processing and move to the next pixel.\n  - Get the current pixel's color.\n  - If the color is Azure (8), set BoundaryEncountered to true and continue.\n  - If the color is a FillSource (not White 0, not Azure 8), update ActiveFillColor to this color and continue.\n  - If the color is Background (White 0), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the current ActiveFillColor.\n  - Return the final output grid.\n```"

Let the current cell's coordinates be `(row, col)` and its color in the *input* grid be `current_color`.\n5.  For each cell:\n    a.  Check the `boundary_encountered` flag. If it is `true`, do nothing further for this cell and proceed to the next cell in the iteration (pixels after the boundary are unchanged).\n    b.  If `boundary_encountered` is `false`, examine `current_color`:\n        i.  If `current_color` is Azure (8): Set `boundary_encountered` to `true`. Do not modify the output grid at `(row, col)` (it remains Azure). Proceed to the next cell.\n        ii. If `current_color` is *not* White (0) and *not* Azure (8): Update the `active_fill_color` state variable to `current_color`. Do not modify the output grid at `(row, col)` (it retains its original FillSource color). Proceed to the next cell.\n        iii. If `current_color` is White (0): Change the color of the cell at `(row, col)` in the *output* grid to the current value of `active_fill_color`. Proceed to the next cell.\n6.
