"""
This program transforms a 1D sequence of colored pixels based on a fill rule 
bounded by a specific color.

1.  It iterates through the input sequence from left to right.
2.  It maintains an 'active fill color', initially set to white (0).
3.  If it encounters a color that is neither white (0) nor azure (8), it updates 
    the 'active fill color' to this new color.
4.  If it encounters a white (0) pixel, it changes that pixel to the current 
    'active fill color'.
5.  This process continues until an azure (8) pixel is encountered. 
6.  Once the azure (8) pixel is found, the filling process stops, and all 
    subsequent pixels retain their original colors from the input sequence.
