## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples are presented as flattened 1D arrays of length 14. This strongly suggests the grids are either 1x14 or 14x1. Given the transformation logic observed, treating them as a linear sequence makes sense.
2.  **Colors:** Three types of colors are involved:
    *   **Background:** White (0) pixels act as empty space that can be filled.
    *   **Fill Colors:** Non-white, non-azure colors (green=3, orange=7 in examples) initiate a fill process.
    *   **Boundary Color:** Azure (8) acts as a hard stop or boundary for the fill process. There is exactly one azure pixel in each input.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a "fill" or "propagation" process. A non-white, non-azure color expands sequentially (left-to-right or top-to-bottom depending on the grid orientation) into adjacent white pixels.
4.  **Boundary Interaction:** The expansion stops immediately upon encountering the azure (8) pixel. Any pixels *after* the azure pixel in the sequence remain unchanged from the input.
5.  **Statefulness:** The process requires remembering the last non-white, non-azure color encountered, as this color is used to fill subsequent white pixels.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
GridProperties:
  - Dimensions: Input and output grids have identical dimensions (likely 1x14 or 14x1 based on flattened examples).
  - Flattening: Examples are presented flattened, implying a linear processing order (e.g., row-major).

PixelTypes:
  - Background: White (0). Acts as empty space.
  - FillSource: Any color other than white (0) or azure (8). Initiates fill.
  - Boundary: Azure (8). Stops the fill process. Exactly one instance per grid.

Objects:
  - FillBlock: Contiguous sequence of FillSource pixels in the input.
  - WhiteSpace: Contiguous sequence(s) of Background pixels.
  - BoundaryPixel: The single Azure (8) pixel.

Relationships:
  - Sequence: Pixels are processed in a fixed linear order.
  - Proximity: Fill action affects adjacent WhiteSpace pixels *before* the BoundaryPixel in the sequence.

Actions:
  - IdentifyFillColor: Determine the color to use for filling based on the last encountered FillSource pixel.
  - Fill: Change WhiteSpace pixels to the identified FillColor.
  - Stop: Halt the Fill action upon reaching the BoundaryPixel.

TransformationRule:
  - State: Maintain the 'active fill color', initially White (0).
  - Iteration: Process pixels sequentially.
  - UpdateState: If a FillSource pixel is encountered, update the 'active fill color'.
  - ApplyFill: If a Background pixel (White 0) is encountered, change it to the 'active fill color'.
  - BoundaryCheck: If the BoundaryPixel (Azure 8) is encountered, stop filling; subsequent pixels are copied directly.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Initialize a variable `active_fill_color` to white (0).
3.  Initialize a boolean flag `boundary_encountered` to `false`.
4.  Iterate through the grid cells in a linear sequence (e.g., row by row, then column by column within each row).
5.  For each cell:
    a.  If `boundary_encountered` is `true`, continue to the next cell without making changes (the pixel was already copied in step 1).
    b.  Read the color of the current cell from the input grid (`current_color`).
    c.  **Check for Boundary:** If `current_color` is azure (8), set `boundary_encountered` to `true`. Do not modify the cell in the output grid.
    d.  **Check for Fill Source:** If `current_color` is not white (0) and not azure (8), update `active_fill_color` to `current_color`. Do not modify the cell in the output grid (it already has the correct color).
    e.  **Check for Fill Target:** If `current_color` is white (0), change the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid to `active_fill_color`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
```python

"""
This program transforms a 1D sequence of colored pixels based on a fill rule 
bounded by a specific color.

1.  It iterates through the input sequence from left to right.
2.  It maintains an 'active fill color', initially set to white (0).
3.  If it encounters a color that is neither white (0) nor azure (8), it updates 
    the 'active fill color' to this new color.
4.  If it encounters a white (0) pixel, it changes that pixel to the current 
    'active fill color'.
5.  This process continues until an azure (8) pixel is encountered. 
6.  Once the azure (8) pixel is found, the filling process stops, and all 
    subsequent pixels retain their original colors from the input sequence.
