## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D sequence and iterated incorrectly over what was actually a 2D NumPy array (specifically, a 1x14 grid). The `ValueError` arose from comparing a whole row (an array) to a single integer value (the `AZURE` color code).

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge the input is a 2D grid.
2.  Modify the iteration logic to traverse the grid pixel by pixel, typically in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
3.  Maintain the core fill logic: track the `active_fill_color` seen so far and use it to overwrite white pixels, stopping this process entirely once the `AZURE` boundary pixel is encountered in the traversal order.

## Metrics and Verification

The following metrics were confirmed using `tool_code`:

*   **Input/Output Shape:** All training examples use a (1, 14) grid shape.
*   **Azure Pixel:** Each input grid contains exactly one Azure (8) pixel.
    *   Example 1: Location (0, 7)
    *   Example 2: Location (0, 12)
    *   Example 3: Location (0, 12)
*   **Fill Colors:** The colors used to initiate filling (distinct from White=0 and Azure=8) were Green (3) and Orange (7).
*   **Transformation:** White pixels (0) appearing *before* the Azure pixel (8) in row-major order are replaced by the most recently seen non-white, non-azure color. Pixels at or after the Azure pixel remain unchanged.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
GridProperties:
  - Shape: Input and output grids are 2D numpy arrays with shape (1, 14).
  - TraversalOrder: Pixels are processed sequentially in row-major order (row 0, column 0 to 13).

PixelTypes:
  - Background: White (0). Represents empty space to be potentially filled.
  - FillSource: Any color other than White (0) or Azure (8). Examples use Green (3) and Orange (7). The *last* encountered FillSource determines the fill color.
  - Boundary: Azure (8). Acts as a terminal boundary for the fill process. Exactly one instance per grid.

State Variables:
  - ActiveFillColor: Stores the color value of the most recently encountered FillSource pixel during traversal. Initialized to White (0).
  - BoundaryEncountered: A boolean flag, initially false. Set to true when the Boundary pixel is processed.

Actions:
  - Iterate: Process grid pixels one by one according to TraversalOrder.
  - UpdateActiveFillColor: When a FillSource pixel is encountered *before* the Boundary, update the ActiveFillColor state variable.
  - FillBackground: When a Background pixel (White 0) is encountered *before* the Boundary, change its color in the output grid to the current ActiveFillColor.
  - HaltOnBoundary: When the Boundary pixel (Azure 8) is encountered, set the BoundaryEncountered flag to true.
  - CopyPostBoundary: For all pixels processed *after* the BoundaryEncountered flag is true, copy their color directly from the input to the output without modification.

TransformationRule:
  - Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - Initialize ActiveFillColor to White (0) and BoundaryEncountered to false.
  - Iterate through each pixel (row, col) of the input grid in row-major order.
  - If BoundaryEncountered is true, skip processing and move to the next pixel.
  - Get the current pixel's color.
  - If the color is Azure (8), set BoundaryEncountered to true and continue.
  - If the color is a FillSource (not White 0, not Azure 8), update ActiveFillColor to this color and continue.
  - If the color is Background (White 0), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the current ActiveFillColor.
  - Return the final output grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an exact copy of the input 2D grid; this will be modified to become the output grid.
2.  Initialize a state variable `active_fill_color` to White (0).
3.  Initialize a boolean state variable `boundary_encountered` to `false`.
4.  Iterate through each cell of the grid, proceeding row by row, and within each row, column by column (row-major order). Let the current cell's coordinates be `(row, col)` and its color in the *input* grid be `current_color`.
5.  For each cell:
    a.  Check the `boundary_encountered` flag. If it is `true`, do nothing further for this cell and proceed to the next cell in the iteration (pixels after the boundary are unchanged).
    b.  If `boundary_encountered` is `false`, examine `current_color`:
        i.  If `current_color` is Azure (8): Set `boundary_encountered` to `true`. Do not modify the output grid at `(row, col)` (it remains Azure). Proceed to the next cell.
        ii. If `current_color` is *not* White (0) and *not* Azure (8): Update the `active_fill_color` state variable to `current_color`. Do not modify the output grid at `(row, col)` (it retains its original FillSource color). Proceed to the next cell.
        iii. If `current_color` is White (0): Change the color of the cell at `(row, col)` in the *output* grid to the current value of `active_fill_color`. Proceed to the next cell.
6.  After iterating through all cells, return the modified output grid.
