GridProperties:
  - Shape: Input and output grids are 2D numpy arrays with shape (1, 14).
  - TraversalOrder: Pixels are processed sequentially in row-major order (row 0, column 0 to 13).

PixelTypes:
  - Background: White (0). Represents empty space to be potentially filled.
  - FillSource: Any color other than White (0) or Azure (8). Examples use Green (3) and Orange (7). The *last* encountered FillSource determines the fill color.
  - Boundary: Azure (8). Acts as a terminal boundary for the fill process. Exactly one instance per grid.

State Variables:
  - ActiveFillColor: Stores the color value of the most recently encountered FillSource pixel during traversal. Initialized to White (0).
  - BoundaryEncountered: A boolean flag, initially false. Set to true when the Boundary pixel is processed.

Actions:
  - Iterate: Process grid pixels one by one according to TraversalOrder.
  - UpdateActiveFillColor: When a FillSource pixel is encountered *before* the Boundary, update the ActiveFillColor state variable.
  - FillBackground: When a Background pixel (White 0) is encountered *before* the Boundary, change its color in the output grid to the current ActiveFillColor.
  - HaltOnBoundary: When the Boundary pixel (Azure 8) is encountered, set the BoundaryEncountered flag to true.
  - CopyPostBoundary: For all pixels processed *after* the BoundaryEncountered flag is true, copy their color directly from the input to the output without modification.

TransformationRule:
  - Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - Initialize ActiveFillColor to White (0) and BoundaryEncountered to false.
  - Iterate through each pixel (row, col) of the input grid in row-major order.
  - If BoundaryEncountered is true, skip processing and move to the next pixel.
  - Get the current pixel's color.
  - If the color is Azure (8), set BoundaryEncountered to true and continue.
  - If the color is a FillSource (not White 0, not Azure 8), update ActiveFillColor to this color and continue.
  - If the color is Background (White 0), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the current ActiveFillColor.
  - Return the final output grid.
