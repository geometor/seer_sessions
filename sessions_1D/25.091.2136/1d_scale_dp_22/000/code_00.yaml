GridProperties:
  - Dimensions: Input and output grids have identical dimensions (likely 1x14 or 14x1 based on flattened examples).
  - Flattening: Examples are presented flattened, implying a linear processing order (e.g., row-major).

PixelTypes:
  - Background: White (0). Acts as empty space.
  - FillSource: Any color other than white (0) or azure (8). Initiates fill.
  - Boundary: Azure (8). Stops the fill process. Exactly one instance per grid.

Objects:
  - FillBlock: Contiguous sequence of FillSource pixels in the input.
  - WhiteSpace: Contiguous sequence(s) of Background pixels.
  - BoundaryPixel: The single Azure (8) pixel.

Relationships:
  - Sequence: Pixels are processed in a fixed linear order.
  - Proximity: Fill action affects adjacent WhiteSpace pixels *before* the BoundaryPixel in the sequence.

Actions:
  - IdentifyFillColor: Determine the color to use for filling based on the last encountered FillSource pixel.
  - Fill: Change WhiteSpace pixels to the identified FillColor.
  - Stop: Halt the Fill action upon reaching the BoundaryPixel.

TransformationRule:
  - State: Maintain the 'active fill color', initially White (0).
  - Iteration: Process pixels sequentially.
  - UpdateState: If a FillSource pixel is encountered, update the 'active fill color'.
  - ApplyFill: If a Background pixel (White 0) is encountered, change it to the 'active fill color'.
  - BoundaryCheck: If the BoundaryPixel (Azure 8) is encountered, stop filling; subsequent pixels are copied directly.
