## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples are presented as flattened 1D arrays of length 14. This strongly suggests the grids are either 1x14 or 14x1. Given the transformation logic observed, treating them as a linear sequence makes sense.
2.  **Colors:** Three types of colors are involved:
    *   **Background:** White (0) pixels act as empty space that can be filled.
    *   **Fill Colors:** Non-white, non-azure colors (green=3, orange=7 in examples) initiate a fill process.
    *   **Boundary Color:** Azure (8) acts as a hard stop or boundary for the fill process. There is exactly one azure pixel in each input.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a "fill" or "propagation" process. A non-white, non-azure color expands sequentially (left-to-right or top-to-bottom depending on the grid orientation) into adjacent white pixels.
4.  **Boundary Interaction:** The expansion stops immediately upon encountering the azure (8) pixel. Any pixels *after* the azure pixel in the sequence remain unchanged from the input.
5.  **Statefulness:** The process requires remembering the last non-white, non-azure color encountered, as this color is used to fill subsequent white pixels.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
GridProperties:
  - Dimensions: Input and output grids have identical dimensions (likely 1x14 or 14x1 based on flattened examples).
  - Flattening: Examples are presented flattened, implying a linear processing order (e.g., row-major).

PixelTypes:
  - Background: White (0). Acts as empty space.
  - FillSource: Any color other than white (0) or azure (8). Initiates fill.
  - Boundary: Azure (8). Stops the fill process. Exactly one instance per grid.

Objects:
  - FillBlock: Contiguous sequence of FillSource pixels in the input.
  - WhiteSpace: Contiguous sequence(s) of Background pixels.
  - BoundaryPixel: The single Azure (8) pixel.

Relationships:
  - Sequence: Pixels are processed in a fixed linear order.
  - Proximity: Fill action affects adjacent WhiteSpace pixels *before* the BoundaryPixel in the sequence.

Actions:
  - IdentifyFillColor: Determine the color to use for filling based on the last encountered FillSource pixel.
  - Fill: Change WhiteSpace pixels to the identified FillColor.
  - Stop: Halt the Fill action upon reaching the BoundaryPixel.

TransformationRule:
  - State: Maintain the 'active fill color', initially White (0).
  - Iteration: Process pixels sequentially.
  - UpdateState: If a FillSource pixel is encountered, update the 'active fill color'.
  - ApplyFill: If a Background pixel (White 0) is encountered, change it to the 'active fill color'.
  - BoundaryCheck: If the BoundaryPixel (Azure 8) is encountered, stop filling; subsequent pixels are copied directly.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Initialize a variable `active_fill_color` to white (0).
3.  Initialize a boolean flag `boundary_encountered` to `false`.
4.  Iterate through the grid cells in a linear sequence (e.g., row by row, then column by column within each row).
5.  For each cell:
    a.  If `boundary_encountered` is `true`, continue to the next cell without making changes (the pixel was already copied in step 1).
    b.  Read the color of the current cell from the input grid (`current_color`).
    c.  **Check for Boundary:** If `current_color` is azure (8), set `boundary_encountered` to `true`. Do not modify the cell in the output grid.
    d.  **Check for Fill Source:** If `current_color` is not white (0) and not azure (8), update `active_fill_color` to `current_color`. Do not modify the cell in the output grid (it already has the correct color).
    e.  **Check for Fill Target:** If `current_color` is white (0), change the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid to `active_fill_color`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
