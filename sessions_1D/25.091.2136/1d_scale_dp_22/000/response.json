This strongly suggests the grids are either 1x14 or 14x1. Given the transformation logic observed, treating them as a linear sequence makes sense.\n2.  **Colors:** Three types of colors are involved:\n    *   **Background:** White (0) pixels act as empty space that can be filled.\n    *   **Fill Colors:** Non-white, non-azure colors (green=3, orange=7 in examples) initiate a fill process.\n    *   **Boundary Color:** Azure (8) acts as a hard stop or boundary for the fill process. There is exactly one azure pixel in each input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a \"fill\" or \"propagation\" process. A non-white, non-azure color expands sequentially (left-to-right or top-to-bottom depending on the grid orientation) into adjacent white pixels.\n4.  **Boundary Interaction:** The expansion stops immediately upon encountering the azure (8) pixel. Any pixels *after* the azure pixel in the sequence remain unchanged from the input.\n5.  **Statefulness:** The process requires remembering the last non-white, non-azure color encountered, as this color is used to fill subsequent white pixels.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Acts as empty space.\n  - FillSource: Any color other than white (0) or azure (8). Initiates fill.\n  - Boundary: Azure (8). Stops the fill process. Exactly one instance per grid.\n\nObjects:\n  - FillBlock: Contiguous sequence of FillSource pixels in the input.\n  - WhiteSpace: Contiguous sequence(s) of Background pixels.\n  - BoundaryPixel: The single Azure (8) pixel.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Sequence: Pixels are processed in a fixed linear order.\n  - Proximity: Fill action affects adjacent WhiteSpace pixels *before* the BoundaryPixel in the sequence.\n\nActions:\n  - IdentifyFillColor: Determine the color to use for filling based on the last encountered FillSource pixel.\n  - Fill: Change WhiteSpace pixels to the identified FillColor.\n  - Stop: Halt the Fill action upon reaching the BoundaryPixel.\n\nTransformationRule:\n  - State: Maintain the 'active fill color', initially White (0).\n  - Iteration: Process pixels sequentially.\n  - UpdateState: If a FillSource pixel is encountered, update the 'active fill color'.\n  - ApplyFill: If a Background pixel (White 0) is encountered, change it to the 'active fill color'.\n  - BoundaryCheck: If the BoundaryPixel (Azure 8) is encountered, stop filling; subsequent pixels are copied directly.\n```"
