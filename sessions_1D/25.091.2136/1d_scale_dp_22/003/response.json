Iterates through the grid cells in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\n2.  Maintains an 'active fill color', initialized to White (0).\n3.  If a cell contains a color that is neither White (0) nor Azure (8), \n    the 'active fill color' is updated to this cell's color.\n4.  If a cell contains White (0), its color is changed in the output grid to \n    the current 'active fill color'.\n5.  This process continues until a cell containing Azure (8) is encountered.\n6.  Once the Azure (8) boundary cell is found, the filling process stops. \n    All subsequent cells processed in the iteration order retain their \n    original colors from the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define color constants for clarity\nWHITE = 0\nAZURE = 8\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a sequential fill transformation to a 2D grid, stopping at an \n    azure boundary.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A 2D numpy array representing the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify and return as the output\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Get grid dimensions\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Initialize the active fill color to white\n    active_fill_color = WHITE\n    # Initialize the boundary flag\n    boundary_encountered = False\n\n    # Iterate through the grid cells in row-major order\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # If the boundary has already been encountered, do nothing further for this cell\n            # The output_grid already has the correct value from the initial copy\n            if boundary_encountered:\n                continue \n\n            # Get the color of the current cell from the original input grid\n            current_color = input_grid[r, c]\n\n            # Check for the boundary color (Azure 8)\n            if current_color == AZURE:\n                boundary_encountered = True\n                # The azure pixel itself remains azure in the output (already copied)\n                continue # Move to the next pixel\n\n            # Check for a fill source color (not white, not azure)\n            elif current_color != WHITE: # We already handled AZURE above\n                # Update the active fill color\n                active_fill_color = current_color\n                # The source pixel itself remains its original color in the output (already copied)\n                continue # Move to the next pixel\n\n            # Check for a fill target color (White 0)\n            elif current_color == WHITE:\n                # Change the corresponding cell in the output grid to the active fill color\n                output_grid[r, c] = active_fill_color\n                # Continue to the next pixel (this continue is logically redundant but can stay for clarity)\n                continue \n                \n    # Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
