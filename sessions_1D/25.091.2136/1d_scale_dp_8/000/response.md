**Perception:**

The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids). Each grid contains blocks of colors separated by white pixels (color 0). A consistent feature across all examples is the presence of a single yellow pixel (color 4) towards the right end of the grid. The transformation involves changing the color of some white pixels. Specifically, the white pixels located between a contiguous block of a non-white, non-yellow color and the yellow pixel are changed to match the color of that preceding block. The yellow pixel seems to act as a right boundary marker for the fill operation.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_gap
grid_dimensionality: 1D
objects:
  - type: color_block
    description: Contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels. In the examples, these are blocks of red (2) or azure (8).
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: A single yellow pixel (4). Acts as a boundary.
  - type: gap_pixels
    description: Contiguous sequence of white pixels (0) located between a color_block and the marker_pixel.
properties:
  - grid_width: Varies (9 in all examples)
  - fill_color: The color of the color_block immediately preceding the gap_pixels.
actions:
  - fill: Change the color of gap_pixels to the fill_color.
relationships:
  - spatial: The gap_pixels are located spatially *between* the end of a color_block and the marker_pixel. The order is color_block -> gap_pixels -> marker_pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the grid as a 1-dimensional array of pixels.
2.  Scan the grid from left to right.
3.  Find the first contiguous block of a single color (Color C) that is not white (0) and not yellow (4). Note the index of the last pixel in this block.
4.  Continue scanning from the end of this block to find the first yellow pixel (4). Note its index.
5.  Identify all pixels between the end of the block of Color C and the yellow pixel.
6.  Change the color of any white pixels (0) found in this identified range to Color C.
7.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.
8.  Return the modified grid.
