A consistent feature across all examples is the presence of a single yellow pixel (color 4) towards the right end of the grid. The transformation involves changing the color of some white pixels. Specifically, the white pixels located between a contiguous block of a non-white, non-yellow color and the yellow pixel are changed to match the color of that preceding block. The yellow pixel seems to act as a right boundary marker for the fill operation.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
