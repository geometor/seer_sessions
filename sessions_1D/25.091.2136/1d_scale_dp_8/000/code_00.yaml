task_type: fill_gap
grid_dimensionality: 1D
objects:
  - type: color_block
    description: Contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels. In the examples, these are blocks of red (2) or azure (8).
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: A single yellow pixel (4). Acts as a boundary.
  - type: gap_pixels
    description: Contiguous sequence of white pixels (0) located between a color_block and the marker_pixel.
properties:
  - grid_width: Varies (9 in all examples)
  - fill_color: The color of the color_block immediately preceding the gap_pixels.
actions:
  - fill: Change the color of gap_pixels to the fill_color.
relationships:
  - spatial: The gap_pixels are located spatially *between* the end of a color_block and the marker_pixel. The order is color_block -> gap_pixels -> marker_pixel.
