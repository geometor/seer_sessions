Task: Fill gap between a colored block and a maroon marker.
Input_Type: 1D grid (1xN)
Output_Type: 1D grid (1xN)
Grid_Dimensions_Change: No
Objects:
  - type: Block
    color: Variable (non-white, non-maroon) - e.g., blue(1), gray(5), yellow(4)
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color. The relevant block is the rightmost one preceding the marker.
  - type: Marker
    color: Maroon(9)
    description: A single pixel acting as a boundary. The relevant marker is the first one found to the right of the block.
  - type: Gap
    color: White(0)
    description: One or more contiguous white pixels located between the 'Block' and the 'Marker'.
Actions:
  - name: Identify
    target: Rightmost block of non-white/non-maroon color.
    result: Store its color ('fill_color') and the index of its rightmost pixel ('block_end_index').
  - name: Identify
    target: First maroon(9) pixel to the right of 'block_end_index'.
    result: Store its index ('marker_index').
  - name: Fill
    target: All white(0) pixels located between 'block_end_index' and 'marker_index'.
    using: 'fill_color'.
Relationships:
  - type: Spatial
    description: The 'Gap' (white pixels) is located spatially between the 'Block' and the 'Marker'.
  - type: Conditional
    description: The 'Fill' action only occurs if a 'Block', a 'Marker', and a 'Gap' are found in the specified spatial relationship.
