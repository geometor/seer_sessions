The length of the grid remains the same after the transformation.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved seem to be white (`0`), maroon (`9`), and one other dominant color which varies between examples (blue `1`, gray `5`, yellow `4`).\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to involve filling in white (`0`) pixels that are situated between a block of the dominant color and a maroon (`9`) pixel.\n4.  **Key Markers:** The maroon (`9`) pixel seems to act as a right boundary or marker. The block of the dominant color acts as a left boundary and source of the fill color.\n5.  **Filling Action:** The white pixels (`0`) located *between* the rightmost pixel of the dominant color block and the leftmost maroon (`9`) pixel (to the right of the block) are replaced with the dominant color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
