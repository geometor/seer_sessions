Task: Fill gap between a colored block and a maroon marker in a single-row grid.
Input_Type: 2D grid (NumPy array or list of lists) with exactly one row.
Output_Type: 2D grid (matching input type) with exactly one row.
Grid_Dimensions_Change: No. Shape remains (1, N).
Objects:
  - type: GridRow
    description: The single row contained within the input grid. This is the primary target for analysis and modification.
    source: input_grid[0]
  - type: Block
    color: Variable (non-white(0), non-maroon(9))
    location: Within the GridRow.
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color. The relevant block is the one whose rightmost pixel immediately precedes the gap to be filled.
  - type: Marker
    color: Maroon(9)
    location: Within the GridRow, to the right of the Block.
    description: The first single maroon pixel encountered after the Block. Acts as the right boundary for the fill operation.
  - type: Gap
    color: White(0)
    location: Within the GridRow, between the Block and the Marker.
    description: One or more contiguous white pixels.
Actions:
  - name: ExtractRow
    input: input_grid (2D array/list)
    output: row (1D list or array)
    description: Get the first (and only) row from the input grid. Create a modifiable copy.
  - name: LocateMarker
    input: row
    output: marker_index (integer)
    description: Find the index of the first maroon(9) pixel in the row. Return -1 if not found.
  - name: LocateBlock
    input: row, marker_index
    output: block_end_index (integer), fill_color (integer)
    description: Scan leftwards from marker_index - 1. Find the first pixel that is not white(0) or maroon(9). Record its index and color. Return (-1, -1) if not found.
  - name: FillGap
    input: row (modifiable copy), block_end_index, marker_index, fill_color
    output: modified row
    description: Iterate from block_end_index + 1 to marker_index - 1. Change any white(0) pixels found to fill_color.
  - name: FormatOutput
    input: modified row, original input_grid type/shape
    output: output_grid (matching input format)
    description: Place the modified row back into the original data structure (e.g., wrap in a list or reshape NumPy array).
Conditions:
  - If Marker is not found, return the original input grid.
  - If Block is not found (before the Marker), return the original input grid.
  - Fill action only occurs if Marker, Block, and a Gap (implicitly, indices between block_end_index and marker_index exist) are found in the correct spatial relationship.
