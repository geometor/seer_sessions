Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1D grids (or 1xN grids). The length of the grid remains the same after the transformation.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved seem to be white (`0`), maroon (`9`), and one other dominant color which varies between examples (blue `1`, gray `5`, yellow `4`).
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to involve filling in white (`0`) pixels that are situated between a block of the dominant color and a maroon (`9`) pixel.
4.  **Key Markers:** The maroon (`9`) pixel seems to act as a right boundary or marker. The block of the dominant color acts as a left boundary and source of the fill color.
5.  **Filling Action:** The white pixels (`0`) located *between* the rightmost pixel of the dominant color block and the leftmost maroon (`9`) pixel (to the right of the block) are replaced with the dominant color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Fill gap between a colored block and a maroon marker.
Input_Type: 1D grid (1xN)
Output_Type: 1D grid (1xN)
Grid_Dimensions_Change: No
Objects:
  - type: Block
    color: Variable (non-white, non-maroon) - e.g., blue(1), gray(5), yellow(4)
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color. The relevant block is the rightmost one preceding the marker.
  - type: Marker
    color: Maroon(9)
    description: A single pixel acting as a boundary. The relevant marker is the first one found to the right of the block.
  - type: Gap
    color: White(0)
    description: One or more contiguous white pixels located between the 'Block' and the 'Marker'.
Actions:
  - name: Identify
    target: Rightmost block of non-white/non-maroon color.
    result: Store its color ('fill_color') and the index of its rightmost pixel ('block_end_index').
  - name: Identify
    target: First maroon(9) pixel to the right of 'block_end_index'.
    result: Store its index ('marker_index').
  - name: Fill
    target: All white(0) pixels located between 'block_end_index' and 'marker_index'.
    using: 'fill_color'.
Relationships:
  - type: Spatial
    description: The 'Gap' (white pixels) is located spatially between the 'Block' and the 'Marker'.
  - type: Conditional
    description: The 'Fill' action only occurs if a 'Block', a 'Marker', and a 'Gap' are found in the specified spatial relationship.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid from left to right.
2.  Identify the index of the first maroon (`9`) pixel encountered. If no maroon pixel is found, return the input grid unchanged. Let this index be `maroon_index`.
3.  Scan the input grid from `maroon_index - 1` backwards towards the left.
4.  Find the first pixel encountered whose color is neither white (`0`) nor maroon (`9`). Let the color of this pixel be `fill_color` and its index be `block_end_index`. If no such pixel is found before reaching the beginning of the grid, return the input grid unchanged.
5.  Iterate through the grid from index `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `maroon_index`.
6.  For each pixel within this range, if its color is white (`0`), change its color to `fill_color`.
7.  Return the modified grid.
