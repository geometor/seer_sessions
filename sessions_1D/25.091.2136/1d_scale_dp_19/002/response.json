            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe execution errors (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...\") strongly indicate that the input `input_grid` is not a simple Python list as initially assumed in some parts of the logic (specifically, how the input was checked and copied), but rather a NumPy array, likely a 2D array even if it only contains one row. The ARC environment typically uses NumPy arrays.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge the input is likely a NumPy array (or potentially a list of lists).\n2.  Ensure the code correctly accesses and manipulates the elements, assuming a 2D structure (e.g., `input_grid[0]` to get the first row).\n3.  Make a proper copy of the relevant row to avoid modifying the original input directly.\n4.  Apply the transformation logic to the copied row.\n5.  Return the modified data in the same format as the input (e.g., if the input was a 2D NumPy array `[[...]]`, the output should also be `[[...]]`).\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nSince I cannot directly execute code on the *exact* input objects passed during the failed execution, I will infer the structure based on the error message and common ARC practices. The error implies boolean evaluation of a multi-element array, which often happens when checking `if input_grid:` or similar on a NumPy array.\n\n*   **Assumption:** The input `input_grid` in the execution environment is a NumPy array of shape `(1, N)`, where N is the number of columns (12 in these examples).\n*   **Example 1:** Input shape `(1, 12)`. Expected Output shape `(1, 12)`.\n*   **Example 2:** Input shape `(1, 12)`. Expected Output shape `(1, 12)`.\n*   **Example 3:** Input shape `(1, 12)`. Expected Output shape `(1, 12)`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find the first pixel whose color is neither white (`0`) nor maroon (`9`).\n5.  If such a pixel is found, store its color as `fill_color` and its index as `block_end_index`.
