**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The execution errors ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly indicate that the input `input_grid` is not a simple Python list as initially assumed in some parts of the logic (specifically, how the input was checked and copied), but rather a NumPy array, likely a 2D array even if it only contains one row. The ARC environment typically uses NumPy arrays.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge the input is likely a NumPy array (or potentially a list of lists).
2.  Ensure the code correctly accesses and manipulates the elements, assuming a 2D structure (e.g., `input_grid[0]` to get the first row).
3.  Make a proper copy of the relevant row to avoid modifying the original input directly.
4.  Apply the transformation logic to the copied row.
5.  Return the modified data in the same format as the input (e.g., if the input was a 2D NumPy array `[[...]]`, the output should also be `[[...]]`).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Since I cannot directly execute code on the *exact* input objects passed during the failed execution, I will infer the structure based on the error message and common ARC practices. The error implies boolean evaluation of a multi-element array, which often happens when checking `if input_grid:` or similar on a NumPy array.

*   **Assumption:** The input `input_grid` in the execution environment is a NumPy array of shape `(1, N)`, where N is the number of columns (12 in these examples).
*   **Example 1:** Input shape `(1, 12)`. Expected Output shape `(1, 12)`.
*   **Example 2:** Input shape `(1, 12)`. Expected Output shape `(1, 12)`.
*   **Example 3:** Input shape `(1, 12)`. Expected Output shape `(1, 12)`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Fill gap between a colored block and a maroon marker in a single-row grid.
Input_Type: 2D grid (NumPy array or list of lists) with exactly one row.
Output_Type: 2D grid (matching input type) with exactly one row.
Grid_Dimensions_Change: No. Shape remains (1, N).
Objects:
  - type: GridRow
    description: The single row contained within the input grid. This is the primary target for analysis and modification.
    source: input_grid[0]
  - type: Block
    color: Variable (non-white(0), non-maroon(9))
    location: Within the GridRow.
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color. The relevant block is the one whose rightmost pixel immediately precedes the gap to be filled.
  - type: Marker
    color: Maroon(9)
    location: Within the GridRow, to the right of the Block.
    description: The first single maroon pixel encountered after the Block. Acts as the right boundary for the fill operation.
  - type: Gap
    color: White(0)
    location: Within the GridRow, between the Block and the Marker.
    description: One or more contiguous white pixels.
Actions:
  - name: ExtractRow
    input: input_grid (2D array/list)
    output: row (1D list or array)
    description: Get the first (and only) row from the input grid. Create a modifiable copy.
  - name: LocateMarker
    input: row
    output: marker_index (integer)
    description: Find the index of the first maroon(9) pixel in the row. Return -1 if not found.
  - name: LocateBlock
    input: row, marker_index
    output: block_end_index (integer), fill_color (integer)
    description: Scan leftwards from marker_index - 1. Find the first pixel that is not white(0) or maroon(9). Record its index and color. Return (-1, -1) if not found.
  - name: FillGap
    input: row (modifiable copy), block_end_index, marker_index, fill_color
    output: modified row
    description: Iterate from block_end_index + 1 to marker_index - 1. Change any white(0) pixels found to fill_color.
  - name: FormatOutput
    input: modified row, original input_grid type/shape
    output: output_grid (matching input format)
    description: Place the modified row back into the original data structure (e.g., wrap in a list or reshape NumPy array).
Conditions:
  - If Marker is not found, return the original input grid.
  - If Block is not found (before the Marker), return the original input grid.
  - Fill action only occurs if Marker, Block, and a Gap (implicitly, indices between block_end_index and marker_index exist) are found in the correct spatial relationship.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a 2D structure (like a list containing one list, or a 2D NumPy array) with a single row.
2.  Create a modifiable copy of the first (and only) row from the input grid. Let this be `working_row`.
3.  Scan `working_row` from left to right to find the index of the first maroon (`9`) pixel. If no maroon pixel exists, stop and return the original input grid. Store the index as `maroon_index`.
4.  Scan `working_row` backwards from index `maroon_index - 1` towards the beginning. Find the first pixel whose color is neither white (`0`) nor maroon (`9`).
5.  If such a pixel is found, store its color as `fill_color` and its index as `block_end_index`. If no such pixel is found before reaching the start of the row, stop and return the original input grid.
6.  Iterate through `working_row` from index `block_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `maroon_index`.
7.  For each pixel examined in this range, if its current color is white (`0`), change its color to `fill_color`.
8.  Construct the output grid by placing the `working_row` (which may have been modified) back into the original 2D structure (e.g., `[working_row]` if the input was a list of lists, or reshape if it was a NumPy array).
9.  Return the output grid.
