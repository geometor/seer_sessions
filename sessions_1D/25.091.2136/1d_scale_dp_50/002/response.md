## Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: extending a colored block rightwards until an orange boundary marker. However, it failed due to a data type mismatch. The error "unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'" indicates that the code attempted to use a NumPy array (likely representing the input grid or a row from it) in a context requiring a hashable type, such as a set element or dictionary key.

ARC task inputs are typically provided as 2D structures (NumPy arrays or lists of lists). Even though the examples visually represent a single row, the data structure is likely `(1, N)`. The original code assumed the input `input_grid` was already a 1D list, which led to errors when it received a 2D NumPy array.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the input `input_grid` is a 2D structure (e.g., NumPy array) with dimensions `(1, N)`.
2.  **Extract Row:** Modify the process to explicitly extract the first (and only) row from the 2D input grid into a 1D list or array suitable for element-wise processing.
3.  **Apply Logic:** Apply the previously defined logic (identify source block, boundary, fill gap) to this extracted 1D row.
4.  **Reconstruct Output:** Ensure the final output matches the expected format, likely reconstructing a `(1, N)` 2D grid from the modified 1D row.

## Metrics

Based on the tool output and task description:

*   **Input Format:** The input for each example is a 2D grid with shape `(1, Width)`, where Width varies. It can be represented as a NumPy array or a list containing one inner list.
*   **Output Format:** The output should also be a 2D grid with the same shape `(1, Width)`.
*   **Data Types:** Elements within the grid are integers (0-9). If using NumPy, these might be `np.int64` or similar, which are compatible with set/dict operations. The container (the grid itself or extracted rows if using NumPy slicing without conversion to list) is *not* hashable.
*   **Example 1:** Input shape (1, 19), Output shape (1, 19). Source color: 6 (magenta), Boundary: 7 (orange). Fills 3 white pixels.
*   **Example 2:** Input shape (1, 19), Output shape (1, 19). Source color: 2 (red), Boundary: 7 (orange). Fills 6 white pixels.
*   **Example 3:** Input shape (1, 19), Output shape (1, 19). Source color: 6 (magenta), Boundary: 7 (orange). Fills 5 white pixels.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: 1D array transformation within a 2D grid context
input_format: 2D grid (likely NumPy array or list of lists) with shape (1, N)
output_format: 2D grid with shape (1, N)
components:
  - type: grid_row
    description: The single row contained within the input 2D grid.
    role: Container for pixels to be processed.
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: Empty space within the grid row, potentially filled during transformation.
  - type: source_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels within the grid row, all having the same color, excluding white (0) and orange (7).
    properties:
      - color: variable (e.g., magenta '6', red '2')
      - location: identifiable start and end column indices within the row.
    role: The color source for filling. Expands rightwards.
  - type: boundary_pixel
    color: orange (7)
    location: Located somewhere to the right of the source_block within the grid row.
    role: Marks the rightmost limit (exclusive) for the expansion of the source_block.
relationships:
  - The source_block is always to the left of the boundary_pixel within the grid row.
  - White (0) pixels may exist between the source_block's right edge and the boundary_pixel.
actions:
  - extract: Get the single row (as a 1D list or array) from the input 2D grid.
  - identify: Within the extracted row, locate the source_block (find its color, start index, end index).
  - identify: Within the extracted row, locate the boundary_pixel (find its index).
  - fill: Modify a copy of the extracted row. Change the color of all pixels originally white (0) located between the source_block's end index (exclusive) and the boundary_pixel's index (exclusive) to the source_block's color.
  - reconstruct: Create the output 2D grid using the modified row.
constraints:
  - The input grid always has exactly one row.
  - There is exactly one source_block per row.
  - There is exactly one boundary_pixel (orange '7') per row, located after the source_block.
  - The source_block color is preserved during filling.
  - The boundary_pixel is never overwritten.
  - Pixels to the left of the source_block and pixels at or after the boundary_pixel remain unchanged in the row.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input 2D grid, which has dimensions `(1, N)`.
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid into a 1D sequence (e.g., a list). Let's call this `working_row`.
3.  Create a mutable copy of `working_row` to store modifications. Let's call this `output_row`.
4.  Initialize `source_color`, `source_start_index`, `source_end_index`, and `boundary_index` to indicate they haven't been found yet.
5.  Iterate through `working_row` using an index `i` and value `pixel`:
    a.  If `source_color` has not been found yet AND `pixel` is not white (0) and not orange (7):
        i.  Set `source_color = pixel`.
        ii. Set `source_start_index = i`.
        iii.Set `source_end_index = i`.
    b.  Else if `source_color` *has* been found AND `pixel == source_color` AND `i == source_end_index + 1`:
        i.  Update `source_end_index = i`. (Extend the contiguous block).
    c.  Else if `pixel` is orange (7) AND `source_color` *has* been found:
        i.  Set `boundary_index = i`.
        ii. Stop scanning the row (or continue if other elements after the boundary might be relevant, though examples suggest not).
6.  Check if both a valid `source_end_index` and `boundary_index` were found.
7.  If found, iterate through the indices `j` from `source_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `boundary_index`.
8.  For each index `j`, set the value in `output_row` at index `j` to `source_color`.
9.  Construct the final 2D output grid by placing the `output_row` as the single row within it (e.g., `[output_row]` or `np.array([output_row])`).
10. Return the final 2D output grid.
