task_type: 1D array transformation within a 2D grid context
input_format: 2D grid (likely NumPy array or list of lists) with shape (1, N)
output_format: 2D grid with shape (1, N)
components:
  - type: grid_row
    description: The single row contained within the input 2D grid.
    role: Container for pixels to be processed.
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: Empty space within the grid row, potentially filled during transformation.
  - type: source_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels within the grid row, all having the same color, excluding white (0) and orange (7).
    properties:
      - color: variable (e.g., magenta '6', red '2')
      - location: identifiable start and end column indices within the row.
    role: The color source for filling. Expands rightwards.
  - type: boundary_pixel
    color: orange (7)
    location: Located somewhere to the right of the source_block within the grid row.
    role: Marks the rightmost limit (exclusive) for the expansion of the source_block.
relationships:
  - The source_block is always to the left of the boundary_pixel within the grid row.
  - White (0) pixels may exist between the source_block's right edge and the boundary_pixel.
actions:
  - extract: Get the single row (as a 1D list or array) from the input 2D grid.
  - identify: Within the extracted row, locate the source_block (find its color, start index, end index).
  - identify: Within the extracted row, locate the boundary_pixel (find its index).
  - fill: Modify a copy of the extracted row. Change the color of all pixels originally white (0) located between the source_block's end index (exclusive) and the boundary_pixel's index (exclusive) to the source_block's color.
  - reconstruct: Create the output 2D grid using the modified row.
constraints:
  - The input grid always has exactly one row.
  - There is exactly one source_block per row.
  - There is exactly one boundary_pixel (orange '7') per row, located after the source_block.
  - The source_block color is preserved during filling.
  - The boundary_pixel is never overwritten.
  - Pixels to the left of the source_block and pixels at or after the boundary_pixel remain unchanged in the row.
