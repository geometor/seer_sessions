            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: extending a colored block rightwards until an orange boundary marker. However, it failed due to a data type mismatch. The error \"unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'\" indicates that the code attempted to use a NumPy array (likely representing the input grid or a row from it) in a context requiring a hashable type, such as a set element or dictionary key.\n\nARC task inputs are typically provided as 2D structures (NumPy arrays or lists of lists). Even though the examples visually represent a single row, the data structure is likely `(1, N)`. The original code assumed the input `input_grid` was already a 1D list, which led to errors when it received a 2D NumPy array.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the input `input_grid` is a 2D structure (e.g., NumPy array) with dimensions `(1, N)`.\n2.  **Extract Row:** Modify the process to explicitly extract the first (and only) row from the 2D input grid into a 1D list or array suitable for element-wise processing.\n3.  **Apply Logic:** Apply the previously defined logic (identify source block, boundary, fill gap) to this extracted 1D row.\n4.  **Reconstruct Output:** Ensure the final output matches the expected format, likely reconstructing a `(1, N)` 2D grid from the modified 1D row.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the tool output and task description:\n\n*   **Input Format:** The input for each example is a 2D grid with shape `(1, Width)`, where Width varies. It can be represented as a NumPy array or a list containing one inner list.\n*   **Output Format:** The output should also be a 2D grid with the same shape `(1, Width)`.\n*   **Data Types:** Elements within the grid are integers (0-9). If using NumPy, these might be `np.int64` or similar, which are compatible with set/dict operations. The container (the grid itself or extracted rows if using NumPy slicing without conversion to list) is *not* hashable.\n*   **Example 1:** Input shape (1, 19), Output shape (1, 19). Source color: 6 (magenta), Boundary: 7 (orange). Fills 3 white pixels.\n*   **Example 2:** Input shape (1, 19), Output shape (1, 19). Source color: 2 (red), Boundary: 7 (orange). Fills 6 white pixels.\n*   **Example 3:** Input shape (1, 19), Output shape (1, 19). Source color: 6 (magenta), Boundary: 7 (orange). Fills 5 white pixels.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
