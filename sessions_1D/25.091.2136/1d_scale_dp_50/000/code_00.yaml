task_type: 1D array transformation
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: empty space, potentially filled
  - type: source_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and orange (7).
    properties:
      - color: variable (magenta '6' or red '2' in examples)
      - location: identifiable start and end indices
    role: expands to fill space
  - type: boundary_pixel
    color: orange (7)
    role: marks the rightmost limit for the expansion of the source_block
relationships:
  - source_block is always to the left of the boundary_pixel.
  - white (0) pixels may exist between the source_block and the boundary_pixel.
actions:
  - identify: locate the source_block and determine its color and rightmost index.
  - identify: locate the boundary_pixel and determine its index.
  - fill: change the color of all white (0) pixels located between the rightmost index of the source_block and the index of the boundary_pixel to the color of the source_block.
constraints:
  - The source_block color is preserved during filling.
  - The boundary_pixel is never overwritten.
  - Pixels to the left of the source_block and pixels at or after the boundary_pixel remain unchanged.
