Let's call this the \"source color block\".\n2.  An orange pixel ('7'). Let's call this the \"boundary pixel\".\n3.  White pixels ('0') acting as background, potentially surrounding the source color block and separating it from the boundary pixel.\n\nThe transformation involves extending the source color block to the right. The extension fills the white pixels ('0') between the original right edge of the source color block and the boundary pixel ('7') with the source color. The extension stops immediately before the boundary pixel. All other pixels, including those before the source color block, the boundary pixel itself, and any pixels after the boundary pixel, remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n"
