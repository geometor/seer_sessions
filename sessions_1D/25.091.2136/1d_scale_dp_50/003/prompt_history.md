## Perception
The input and output are single rows of pixels (1D grids).
Each input row contains:
1.  A contiguous block of a single color (e.g., magenta '6' or red '2'). Let's call this the "source color block".
2.  An orange pixel ('7'). Let's call this the "boundary pixel".
3.  White pixels ('0') acting as background, potentially surrounding the source color block and separating it from the boundary pixel.

The transformation involves extending the source color block to the right. The extension fills the white pixels ('0') between the original right edge of the source color block and the boundary pixel ('7') with the source color. The extension stops immediately before the boundary pixel. All other pixels, including those before the source color block, the boundary pixel itself, and any pixels after the boundary pixel, remain unchanged.

## Facts

```yaml
task_type: 1D array transformation
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: empty space, potentially filled
  - type: source_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, excluding white (0) and orange (7).
    properties:
      - color: variable (magenta '6' or red '2' in examples)
      - location: identifiable start and end indices
    role: expands to fill space
  - type: boundary_pixel
    color: orange (7)
    role: marks the rightmost limit for the expansion of the source_block
relationships:
  - source_block is always to the left of the boundary_pixel.
  - white (0) pixels may exist between the source_block and the boundary_pixel.
actions:
  - identify: locate the source_block and determine its color and rightmost index.
  - identify: locate the boundary_pixel and determine its index.
  - fill: change the color of all white (0) pixels located between the rightmost index of the source_block and the index of the boundary_pixel to the color of the source_block.
constraints:
  - The source_block color is preserved during filling.
  - The boundary_pixel is never overwritten.
  - Pixels to the left of the source_block and pixels at or after the boundary_pixel remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program
1.  Scan the input row from left to right.
2.  Identify the first pixel that is not white (0) and not orange (7). This marks the start of the source color block. Note its color (let's call it `source_color`) and its index.
3.  Continue scanning to find the end of this contiguous block of `source_color`. Note the index of the last pixel in this block (let's call it `source_end_index`).
4.  Continue scanning from `source_end_index + 1` to find the index of the orange (7) pixel (let's call it `boundary_index`).
5.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
6.  Iterate through the indices from `source_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `boundary_index`.
7.  For each index in this range, change the pixel value in the output row to `source_color`.
8.  Return the modified output row.

## Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: extending a colored block rightwards until an orange boundary marker. However, it failed due to a data type mismatch. The error "unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'" indicates that the code attempted to use a NumPy array (likely representing the input grid or a row from it) in a context requiring a hashable type, such as a set element or dictionary key.

ARC task inputs are typically provided as 2D structures (NumPy arrays or lists of lists). Even though the examples visually represent a single row, the data structure is likely `(1, N)`. The original code assumed the input `input_grid` was already a 1D list, which led to errors when it received a 2D NumPy array.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the input `input_grid` is a 2D structure (e.g., NumPy array) with dimensions `(1, N)`.
2.  **Extract Row:** Modify the process to explicitly extract the first (and only) row from the 2D input grid into a 1D list or array suitable for element-wise processing.
3.  **Apply Logic:** Apply the previously defined logic (identify source block, boundary, fill gap) to this extracted 1D row.
4.  **Reconstruct Output:** Ensure the final output matches the expected format, likely reconstructing a `(1, N)` 2D grid from the modified 1D row.

## Metrics

Based on the tool output and task description:

*   **Input Format:** The input for each example is a 2D grid with shape `(1, Width)`, where Width varies. It can be represented as a NumPy array or a list containing one inner list.
*   **Output Format:** The output should also be a 2D grid with the same shape `(1, Width)`.
*   **Data Types:** Elements within the grid are integers (0-9). If using NumPy, these might be `np.int64` or similar, which are compatible with set/dict operations. The container (the grid itself or extracted rows if using NumPy slicing without conversion to list) is *not* hashable.
*   **Example 1:** Input shape (1, 19), Output shape (1, 19). Source color: 6 (magenta), Boundary: 7 (orange). Fills 3 white pixels.
*   **Example 2:** Input shape (1, 19), Output shape (1, 19). Source color: 2 (red), Boundary: 7 (orange). Fills 6 white pixels.
*   **Example 3:** Input shape (1, 19), Output shape (1, 19). Source color: 6 (magenta), Boundary: 7 (orange). Fills 5 white pixels.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input 2D grid, which has dimensions `(1, N)`.
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid into a 1D sequence (e.g., a list). Let's call this `working_row`.
3.  Create a mutable copy of `working_row` to store modifications. Let's call this `output_row`.
4.  Initialize `source_color`, `source_start_index`, `source_end_index`, and `boundary_index` to indicate they haven't been found yet.
5.  Iterate through `working_row` using an index `i` and value `pixel`:
    a.  If `source_color` has not been found yet AND `pixel` is not white (0) and not orange (7):
        i.  Set `source_color = pixel`.
        ii. Set `source_start_index = i`.
        iii.Set `source_end_index = i`.
    b.  Else if `source_color` *has* been found AND `pixel == source_color` AND `i == source_end_index + 1`:
        i.  Update `source_end_index = i`. (Extend the contiguous block).
    c.  Else if `pixel` is orange (7) AND `source_color` *has* been found:
        i.  Set `boundary_index = i`.
        ii. Stop scanning the row (or continue if other elements after the boundary might be relevant, though examples suggest not).
6.  Check if both a valid `source_end_index` and `boundary_index` were found.
7.  If found, iterate through the indices `j` from `source_end_index + 1` up to (but not including) `boundary_index`.
8.  For each index `j`, set the value in `output_row` at index `j` to `source_color`.
9.  Construct the final 2D output grid by placing the `output_row` as the single row within it (e.g., `[output_row]` or `np.array([output_row])`).
10. Return the final 2D output grid.
