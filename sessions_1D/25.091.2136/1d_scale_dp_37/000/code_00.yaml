  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      - color
colors:
  - name: white
    value: 0

    value: 2
    role: boundary / end_marker
  - name: non_white_non_red
    value: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # Example colors seen: 1, 3, 6
    role: source_color / start_block
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: A sequence of one or more pixels of the same non-white, non-red color (C).
  - type: gap
    description: A sequence of one or more white (0) pixels.
  - type: marker
    description: A single red (2) pixel.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The block of color C is immediately followed by the gap, which is immediately followed by the red marker.
    pattern: [C, ..., C, 0, ..., 0, 2]
actions:
  - type: fill
    description: Change the color of pixels within the gap.
    source_color: The color (C) of the block preceding the gap.
    target_pixels: All white (0) pixels located between the end of the block (C) and the red marker (2).
    condition: The pattern [block_C, gap_0, marker_2] must exist sequentially.
