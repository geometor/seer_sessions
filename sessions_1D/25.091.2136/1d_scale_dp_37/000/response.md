Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (rows).
2.  **Key Colors:** Three colors seem particularly important:
    *   White (0): Acts as a fillable background or gap.
    *   Red (2): Acts as a boundary or endpoint for the transformation.
    *   Other Colors (Green=3, Magenta=6, Blue=1): These form blocks and provide the color used for filling.
3.  **Pattern:** The core pattern in the input involves a contiguous block of a non-white, non-red color, followed by one or more white pixels, followed by a red pixel.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves "filling" the gap of white pixels between the initial color block and the red pixel, using the color of the initial block.

**YAML Facts:**

  - type: fill
    description: Change the color of pixels within the gap.
    source_color: The color (C) of the block preceding the gap.
    target_pixels: All white (0) pixels located between the end of the block (C) and the red marker (2).
    condition: The pattern [block_C, gap_0, marker_2] must exist sequentially.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to modify; this will become the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid from left to right to find the end position (`i`) of the first contiguous block of pixels whose color (`C`) is not white (0) and not red (2).
3.  Starting from the position immediately after the block (`i + 1`), scan forward to find the position (`j`) of the first red (2) pixel.
4.  Verify that all pixels in the input grid strictly between position `i` and position `j` (i.e., from index `i + 1` to `j - 1`) are white (0).
5.  If such positions `i` and `j` are found and the intervening pixels are all white, then fill the corresponding pixels in the output grid (from index `i + 1` to `j - 1`) with the color `C`.
6.  Return the modified grid.
