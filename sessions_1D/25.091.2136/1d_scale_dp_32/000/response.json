Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single color (other than white or green) and a single green pixel located somewhere to the right of the block. There are typically white pixels separating the block and the green pixel. The transformation extends the colored block to the right, filling the gap of white pixels between the original end of the block and the position just before the green pixel. The green pixel acts as a boundary marker, stopping the extension. The color of the block being extended varies between examples.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
