*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays).
    *   Each input row contains a sequence of pixels of a single non-white color, followed by one or more white (0) pixels, then a single maroon (9) pixel, and finally a white (0) pixel. There might be leading white pixels before the main color block.
    *   The output row is identical to the input row, except that the white (0) pixels located between the main color block and the maroon (9) pixel are replaced with the color of the main block.
    *   The main color varies across examples (orange, magenta, gray).
    *   The core transformation is a 'fill' operation within a specific segment of the row, delimited by the main color block and the maroon pixel.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: fill_segment
    dimensionality: 1D
    elements:
      - object: main_color_block
        description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of a single non-white color (e.g., orange, magenta, gray). Its position and length vary.
        properties:
          - color: The specific non-white color of the block. This color is used for filling.
          - location: Appears before the white gap and the maroon marker. Can have leading white pixels before it.
      - object: white_gap
        description: A contiguous sequence of one or more white (0) pixels.
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - location: Located immediately after the main_color_block and immediately before the maroon_marker.
      - object: maroon_marker
        description: A single maroon (9) pixel.
        properties:
          - color: maroon (9)
          - location: Located immediately after the white_gap. Acts as a right boundary for the fill operation.
      - object: trailing_white
        description: A single white (0) pixel.
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - location: Located at the very end of the row, immediately after the maroon_marker. Seems constant and unaffected by the transformation.
      - object: leading_white (optional)
        description: Zero or more white (0) pixels at the beginning of the row.
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - location: Before the main_color_block. Unaffected by the transformation.
    transformation:
      - action: identify_fill_color
        description: Determine the color of the main_color_block.
        input: main_color_block
        output: fill_color (e.g., orange, magenta, gray)
      - action: identify_fill_segment
        description: Locate the sequence of white (0) pixels between the end of the main_color_block and the maroon_marker.
        inputs: main_color_block, white_gap, maroon_marker
        output: segment_indices (list of indices to be filled)
      - action: fill_segment
        description: Change the color of the pixels within the identified fill_segment to the fill_color.
        inputs: input_grid, segment_indices, fill_color
        output: modified_grid
    relationships:
      - spatial: The elements appear in a specific order (optional leading_white, main_color_block, white_gap, maroon_marker, trailing_white).
      - dependency: The color used for filling (fill_color) depends on the color of the main_color_block. The segment to be filled is defined by the positions of the main_color_block and the maroon_marker.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input row from left to right to find the last non-white pixel before the maroon (9) pixel. Let this color be the `fill_color`. Let the index of this pixel be `last_color_index`.
    2.  Find the index of the maroon (9) pixel. Let this be `maroon_index`.
    3.  Iterate through the pixels in the input row from index `last_color_index + 1` up to (but not including) `maroon_index`.
    4.  For each pixel in this range, if its color is white (0), change its color to the `fill_color`.
    5.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.
    6.  The resulting row is the output.
