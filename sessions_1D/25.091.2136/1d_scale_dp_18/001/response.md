Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the input grid, which is expected to be a single row (1D array).
2. Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
3. Locate the index of the maroon (9) pixel in the row (`maroon_index`).
4. Scan the row backwards starting from the position just before the maroon pixel (`maroon_index - 1`).
5. Find the index (`last_color_index`) and color (`fill_color`) of the first non-white (non-zero) pixel encountered during this backward scan. This color represents the main color block.
6. Iterate through the output row from the position immediately after the main color block (`last_color_index + 1`) up to, but not including, the maroon pixel (`maroon_index`).
7. For each pixel in this range, if its current color is white (0), change its color to the `fill_color` identified in step 5.
8. Keep all other pixels in the output row the same as the input row.
9. Return the modified row, wrapped in a list to match the grid format.
