Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.\n3. Locate the index of the maroon (9) pixel in the row (`maroon_index`).\n4. Scan the row backwards starting from the position just before the maroon pixel (`maroon_index - 1`).\n5. Find the index (`last_color_index`) and color (`fill_color`) of the first non-white (non-zero) pixel encountered during this backward scan. This color represents the main color block.\n6. Iterate through the output row from the position immediately after the main color block (`last_color_index + 1`) up to, but not including, the maroon pixel (`maroon_index`).\n7. For each pixel in this range, if its current color is white (0), change its color to the `fill_color` identified in step 5.\n8. Keep all other pixels in the output row the same as the input row.\n9. Return the modified row, wrapped in a list to match the grid format.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills the white (0) gap between the last non-white block and the maroon (9) marker \n    with the color of that last non-white block in a single-row grid.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list containing a single list representing the input row.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing a single list representing the transformed output row.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Ensure input is a single row grid\n    if len(input_grid) != 1:\n        # Or handle error appropriately\n        return input_grid \n        \n    input_row = input_grid[0]\n    # Make a copy to modify for the output\n    output_row = list(input_row)\n    \n    # --- Find Key Indices and Color ---\n    \n    maroon_index = -1\n    # Find the index of the maroon marker (9)\n    for i, pixel in enumerate(input_row):\n        if pixel == 9:\n            maroon_index = i\n            break\n            \n    # If no maroon marker is found, return the original grid (or handle error)\n    if maroon_index == -1:\n        return input_grid\n        \n    last_color_index = -1\n    fill_color = 0 # Default to white if no color is found before maroon\n    # Scan backwards from before the maroon marker to find the last non-white pixel\n    for i in range(maroon_index - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_row[i] != 0:\n            last_color_index = i\n            fill_color = input_row[i]\n            break\n            \n    # If no non-white color is found before maroon, nothing needs to be filled.\n    # The loop below will simply not execute if last_color_index remains -1.\n            \n    # --- Fill the Gap ---\n    \n    # Iterate from the position after the last color block up to the maroon marker\n    # Note: range's stop index is exclusive, so it correctly stops *before* maroon_index\n    if last_color_index != -1: # Check if a fill color was actually found\n        for i in range(last_color_index + 1, maroon_index):\n            # If the pixel in the gap is white (0), fill it with the fill_color\n            if output_row[i] == 0:\n                output_row[i] = fill_color\n                \n    # Return the modified row within a list\n    return [output_row]\n\n```"
