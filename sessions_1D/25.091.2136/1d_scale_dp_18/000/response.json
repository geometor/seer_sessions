There might be leading white pixels before the main color block.\n    *   The output row is identical to the input row, except that the white (0) pixels located between the main color block and the maroon (9) pixel are replaced with the color of the main block.\n    *   The main color varies across examples (orange, magenta, gray).\n    *   The core transformation is a 'fill' operation within a specific segment of the row, delimited by the main color block and the maroon pixel.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
