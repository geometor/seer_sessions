components:
  - object: fill_block
    attributes:
      - type: contiguous_subsequence
      - color: non-white (value changes per example, e.g., 2, 5)
      - location: last contiguous non-white block occurring before the marker
      - role: defines fill color and start boundary for the gap
  - object: marker
    attributes:
      - type: single_element
      - value: 6 (magenta)
      - location: first occurrence in the sequence
      - role: defines end boundary for the gap
  - object: gap
    attributes:
      - type: subsequence
      - composition: contains only white (0) elements in the input
      - location: between the end index of fill_block and the index of the marker
      - role: area to be modified
relationships:
  - type: spatial_sequential
    description: The fill_block appears before the gap, and the gap appears before the marker in the sequence. The gap may have zero length if the fill_block is immediately adjacent to the marker.
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker
    details: Find the index of the first occurrence of the value 6.
  - action: locate
    target: fill_block
    details: Scan backwards from the position before the marker index. Find the index of the first non-zero element encountered (this is the block's end index). Record its value (the fill color).
  - action: identify
    target: gap
    details: Define the subsequence between the index immediately after the fill_block's end index and the marker index.
  - action: modify
    target: gap
    details: Iterate through the elements within the identified gap subsequence. Change the value of each element that is 0 (white) to the fill color recorded from the fill_block.
invariants:
  - The input and output sequences have the same length.
  - The marker element (6) always exists and its position and value remain unchanged.
  - Elements before the end of the fill_block remain unchanged.
  - Elements at or after the marker index remain unchanged.
  - Non-white elements within the gap (if any, though none observed in examples) remain unchanged.
  - The value (color) of the fill_block determines the value used to modify the white elements in the gap.
