Transforms an input 1D sequence (list) of integers based on the rule:
1. Find the first occurrence of the marker value 6 (magenta).
2. Find the last non-zero value (fill color) that occurs before this marker. Record its index (block_end_index).
3. Identify the sequence segment (gap) strictly between block_end_index and the marker index.
4. Change all zero values (white pixels) within this gap to the identified fill color.
