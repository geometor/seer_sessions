**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input and output data appear to be one-dimensional arrays or flattened representations of grid rows/columns.
*   Each input contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color (e.g., red '2' or gray '5').
*   Each input also contains a single magenta '6' pixel located *after* the colored block.
*   Between the colored block and the magenta '6' pixel, there are one or more white '0' pixels.
*   The transformation involves changing the color of the white '0' pixels situated between the colored block and the magenta '6' pixel.
*   The white pixels are changed to the same color as the preceding colored block.
*   All other pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_gap
components:
  - object: fill_block
    attributes:
      - type: contiguous_pixels
      - color: non-white (changes per example, e.g., red, gray)
      - role: defines fill color and start boundary
  - object: marker
    attributes:
      - type: single_pixel
      - color: magenta (6)
      - role: defines end boundary
  - object: gap
    attributes:
      - type: contiguous_pixels
      - color: white (0)
      - location: between fill_block and marker
      - role: area to be filled
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The fill_block appears before the gap, and the gap appears before the marker in the sequence.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: fill_block
    details: Find the last contiguous block of a single non-white color that occurs before the marker.
  - action: identify
    target: marker
    details: Find the first occurrence of the magenta (6) pixel.
  - action: identify
    target: gap
    details: Find all white (0) pixels located between the end of the fill_block and the marker.
  - action: fill
    target: gap
    details: Change the color of all pixels within the identified gap to the color of the fill_block.
invariants:
  - The marker pixel (magenta 6) always exists and its position is unchanged.
  - Pixels before the start of the fill_block remain unchanged.
  - Pixels after the marker pixel remain unchanged.
  - The color of the fill_block determines the color used to fill the gap.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to locate the magenta ('6') pixel (the marker).
2.  Scan the input sequence from the position *before* the marker backwards (right to left) to find the first non-white pixel encountered. This marks the end of the 'fill block'.
3.  Continue scanning backwards from this position to find the first white ('0') pixel or the beginning of the sequence. This marks the start of the 'fill block'.
4.  Identify the color of the pixels within the 'fill block'.
5.  Identify the segment of pixels located strictly between the end of the 'fill block' and the position of the marker.
6.  Change the color of all white ('0') pixels within this identified segment to the color of the 'fill block'.
7.  Keep all other pixels unchanged.
8.  Output the modified sequence.
