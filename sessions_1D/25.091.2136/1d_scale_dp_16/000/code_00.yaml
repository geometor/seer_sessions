task_type: fill_gap
components:
  - object: fill_block
    attributes:
      - type: contiguous_pixels
      - color: non-white (changes per example, e.g., red, gray)
      - role: defines fill color and start boundary
  - object: marker
    attributes:
      - type: single_pixel
      - color: magenta (6)
      - role: defines end boundary
  - object: gap
    attributes:
      - type: contiguous_pixels
      - color: white (0)
      - location: between fill_block and marker
      - role: area to be filled
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The fill_block appears before the gap, and the gap appears before the marker in the sequence.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: fill_block
    details: Find the last contiguous block of a single non-white color that occurs before the marker.
  - action: identify
    target: marker
    details: Find the first occurrence of the magenta (6) pixel.
  - action: identify
    target: gap
    details: Find all white (0) pixels located between the end of the fill_block and the marker.
  - action: fill
    target: gap
    details: Change the color of all pixels within the identified gap to the color of the fill_block.
invariants:
  - The marker pixel (magenta 6) always exists and its position is unchanged.
  - Pixels before the start of the fill_block remain unchanged.
  - Pixels after the marker pixel remain unchanged.
  - The color of the fill_block determines the color used to fill the gap.
