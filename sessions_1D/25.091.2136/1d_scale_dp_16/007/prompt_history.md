**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input and output data appear to be one-dimensional arrays or flattened representations of grid rows/columns.
*   Each input contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color (e.g., red '2' or gray '5').
*   Each input also contains a single magenta '6' pixel located *after* the colored block.
*   Between the colored block and the magenta '6' pixel, there are one or more white '0' pixels.
*   The transformation involves changing the color of the white '0' pixels situated between the colored block and the magenta '6' pixel.
*   The white pixels are changed to the same color as the preceding colored block.
*   All other pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.

**Facts:**

    description: The fill_block appears before the gap, and the gap appears before the marker in the sequence.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: fill_block
    details: Find the last contiguous block of a single non-white color that occurs before the marker.
  - action: identify
    target: marker
    details: Find the first occurrence of the magenta (6) pixel.
  - action: identify

    details: Change the color of all pixels within the identified gap to the color of the fill_block.
invariants:
  - The marker pixel (magenta 6) always exists and its position is unchanged.
  - Pixels before the start of the fill_block remain unchanged.
  - Pixels after the marker pixel remain unchanged.
  - The color of the fill_block determines the color used to fill the gap.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to locate the magenta ('6') pixel (the marker).
2.  Scan the input sequence from the position *before* the marker backwards (right to left) to find the first non-white pixel encountered. This marks the end of the 'fill block'.
3.  Continue scanning backwards from this position to find the first white ('0') pixel or the beginning of the sequence. This marks the start of the 'fill block'.
4.  Identify the color of the pixels within the 'fill block'.
5.  Identify the segment of pixels located strictly between the end of the 'fill block' and the position of the marker.
6.  Change the color of all white ('0') pixels within this identified segment to the color of the 'fill block'.
7.  Keep all other pixels unchanged.
8.  Output the modified sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The provided examples demonstrate a pattern involving filling a gap between a colored block and a specific marker pixel. The previous code attempted to implement this logic but failed, indicated by the transformed output being identical to the input. The analysis suggests the core logic (finding the marker, finding the preceding non-zero color, filling the gap) is sound and should have produced the correct output based on a manual trace and code-based metric gathering. The discrepancy likely arose from an issue in the execution or reporting phase rather than a fundamental flaw in the devised algorithm.

The strategy is to reaffirm the identified logic, refine the descriptive elements (YAML Facts and Natural Language Program) for clarity, and proceed with the assumption that the refined logic, correctly implemented, will pass the examples.

**Metrics:**

| Example | Length | Marker (6) Index | Last Non-Zero Index Before Marker | Fill Color | Gap Indices      | Gap Input Values | Expected Gap Values |

**Observations from Metrics:**
*   All inputs are 1D sequences of length 22.
*   A single magenta pixel (6) acts as a right boundary marker.
*   There is always at least one non-white (non-zero) pixel before the marker.
*   The color used for filling is determined by the value of the *last* non-white pixel encountered when scanning backwards from the marker.
*   The gap consists of one or more white (0) pixels located strictly between the last non-white pixel and the marker pixel.
*   The transformation fills these specific white pixels in the gap with the determined fill color.

    description: The fill_source pixel appears at some index `i`. The marker pixel appears at index `j`, where `j > i`. The gap exists over indices `k` such that `i < k < j`.
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker
    details: Find the index `j` of the first occurrence of value 6.
  - action: locate
    target: fill_source
    details: Scan backwards from index `j-1`. Find the index `i` and value `c` of the first non-zero pixel encountered.
  - action: identify
    target: gap
    details: Determine the range of indices `k` from `i+1` up to, but not including, `j`.
  - action: modify
    target: sequence
    details: For each index `k` in the gap, if the value at `sequence[k]` is 0, change it to the fill color `c`.
invariants:
  - The marker pixel (6) value and position remain unchanged.
  - Pixels before the fill_source index `i` (inclusive) remain unchanged.
  - Pixels after the marker index `j` (inclusive) remain unchanged.
  - Non-white pixels within the identified gap (if any) remain unchanged (though examples only show white pixels in the gap).
  - The fill color is always derived from the last non-zero pixel preceding the marker.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to find the index of the first magenta pixel (value 6). Let this be `marker_index`. If no marker is found, return the unmodified output sequence.
3.  Scan the input sequence backwards, starting from the index immediately *before* `marker_index` (`marker_index - 1`), down to the beginning of the sequence.
4.  Identify the index and value of the first non-white (non-zero) pixel encountered during this backward scan. Let the index be `fill_source_index` and the value be `fill_color`. If no non-white pixel is found before the marker, return the unmodified output sequence.
5.  Iterate through the indices `k` starting from `fill_source_index + 1` up to (but not including) `marker_index`.
6.  For each index `k` in this range, check if the value in the output sequence at `output_sequence[k]` is white (0).
7.  If `output_sequence[k]` is 0, update its value to `fill_color`.
8.  Return the modified output sequence.
