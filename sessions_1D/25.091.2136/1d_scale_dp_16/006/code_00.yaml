    description: The fill_source pixel appears at some index `i`. The marker pixel appears at index `j`, where `j > i`. The gap exists over indices `k` such that `i < k < j`.
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker
    details: Find the index `j` of the first occurrence of value 6.
  - action: locate
    target: fill_source
    details: Scan backwards from index `j-1`. Find the index `i` and value `c` of the first non-zero pixel encountered.
  - action: identify
    target: gap
    details: Determine the range of indices `k` from `i+1` up to, but not including, `j`.
  - action: modify
    target: sequence
    details: For each index `k` in the gap, if the value at `sequence[k]` is 0, change it to the fill color `c`.
invariants:
  - The marker pixel (6) value and position remain unchanged.
  - Pixels before the fill_source index `i` (inclusive) remain unchanged.
  - Pixels after the marker index `j` (inclusive) remain unchanged.
  - Non-white pixels within the identified gap (if any) remain unchanged (though examples only show white pixels in the gap).
  - The fill color is always derived from the last non-zero pixel preceding the marker.
