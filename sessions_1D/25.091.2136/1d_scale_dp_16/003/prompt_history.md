**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input and output data appear to be one-dimensional arrays or flattened representations of grid rows/columns.
*   Each input contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color (e.g., red '2' or gray '5').
*   Each input also contains a single magenta '6' pixel located *after* the colored block.
*   Between the colored block and the magenta '6' pixel, there are one or more white '0' pixels.
*   The transformation involves changing the color of the white '0' pixels situated between the colored block and the magenta '6' pixel.
*   The white pixels are changed to the same color as the preceding colored block.
*   All other pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.

**Facts:**

    description: The fill_block appears before the gap, and the gap appears before the marker in the sequence.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: fill_block
    details: Find the last contiguous block of a single non-white color that occurs before the marker.
  - action: identify
    target: marker
    details: Find the first occurrence of the magenta (6) pixel.
  - action: identify
    target: gap
    details: Find all white (0) pixels located between the end of the fill_block and the marker.

invariants:
  - The marker pixel (magenta 6) always exists and its position is unchanged.
  - Pixels before the start of the fill_block remain unchanged.
  - Pixels after the marker pixel remain unchanged.
  - The color of the fill_block determines the color used to fill the gap.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to locate the magenta ('6') pixel (the marker).
2.  Scan the input sequence from the position *before* the marker backwards (right to left) to find the first non-white pixel encountered. This marks the end of the 'fill block'.
3.  Continue scanning backwards from this position to find the first white ('0') pixel or the beginning of the sequence. This marks the start of the 'fill block'.
4.  Identify the color of the pixels within the 'fill block'.
5.  Identify the segment of pixels located strictly between the end of the 'fill block' and the position of the marker.
6.  Change the color of all white ('0') pixels within this identified segment to the color of the 'fill block'.
7.  Keep all other pixels unchanged.
8.  Output the modified sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The primary issue causing the errors is a mismatch between the expected input format of the `transform` function (a Python list) and the actual format provided during testing (likely a string representation of the grid). The core logic described in the initial perception and natural language program appears correct when applied manually to the examples after converting the string representation to a list of integers.

The strategy is to clarify that the transformation operates on a 1D sequence (list) of integers. The natural language program and facts should assume this list format as the input to the core transformation logic. The surrounding execution environment would be responsible for parsing the raw input string into this list format before calling the `transform` function.

**Metrics:**

Let's gather metrics assuming the inputs are correctly parsed into 1D lists of integers:

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_modification # Changed from fill_gap to be more generic
input_format: list_of_integers # Clarified format
output_format: list_of_integers # Clarified format
components:
  - object: fill_block
    attributes:
      - type: contiguous_subsequence
      - color: non-white (value changes per example, e.g., 2, 5)
      - location: last contiguous non-white block occurring before the marker
      - role: defines fill color and start boundary for the gap
  - object: marker
    attributes:
      - type: single_element
      - value: 6 (magenta)
      - location: first occurrence in the sequence
      - role: defines end boundary for the gap
  - object: gap
    attributes:
      - type: subsequence
      - composition: contains only white (0) elements in the input
      - location: between the end index of fill_block and the index of the marker
      - role: area to be modified
relationships:
  - type: spatial_sequential
    description: The fill_block appears before the gap, and the gap appears before the marker in the sequence. The gap may have zero length if the fill_block is immediately adjacent to the marker.
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: marker
    details: Find the index of the first occurrence of the value 6.
  - action: locate
    target: fill_block
    details: Scan backwards from the position before the marker index. Find the index of the first non-zero element encountered (this is the block's end index). Record its value (the fill color).
  - action: identify
    target: gap
    details: Define the subsequence between the index immediately after the fill_block's end index and the marker index.
  - action: modify
    target: gap
    details: Iterate through the elements within the identified gap subsequence. Change the value of each element that is 0 (white) to the fill color recorded from the fill_block.
invariants:
  - The input and output sequences have the same length.
  - The marker element (6) always exists and its position and value remain unchanged.
  - Elements before the end of the fill_block remain unchanged.
  - Elements at or after the marker index remain unchanged.
  - Non-white elements within the gap (if any, though none observed in examples) remain unchanged.
  - The value (color) of the fill_block determines the value used to modify the white elements in the gap.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 1D sequence (list) of integers.
2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to store the output.
3.  Scan the input sequence to find the index of the first occurrence of the integer 6 (the marker). If no marker is found, return the original sequence.
4.  Scan the input sequence backwards, starting from the index immediately preceding the marker's index. Find the index of the first non-zero element encountered. This index marks the end of the 'fill block'. Record the value of this element as the 'fill color'. If no non-zero element is found before the start of the sequence, return the original sequence.
5.  Identify the segment (subsequence) of the sequence located strictly between the end index of the 'fill block' and the index of the marker.
6.  Iterate through the elements within this identified segment in the output sequence copy.
7.  For each element in the segment, if its value is 0 (white), change its value in the output sequence copy to the recorded 'fill color'.
8.  Keep all other elements in the output sequence copy unchanged (elements before the segment start, elements at or after the marker, and any non-zero elements originally within the segment).
9.  Return the modified output sequence.
