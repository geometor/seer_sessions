However, the provided code execution results show that the `transform` function failed to modify the input grids for all training examples, resulting in the output being identical to the input. This indicates that while the conceptual understanding might be close, the implementation failed to execute the intended modification. The strategy should be to re-verify the logic using the examples, confirm the key indices and colors involved, and refine the natural language program to be precise about the boundaries and actions, providing a clear specification for the coder phase to implement correctly.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the indices and colors identified by the intended logic for each training example.\n"
