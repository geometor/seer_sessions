task_type: array_manipulation_1d
grid_dimensions: 1xN (single row, N=30 in examples)
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-green (3) # e.g., magenta (6), blue (1), gray (5)
      location: contiguous sequence of pixels strictly to the left of the boundary_pixel
      shape: horizontal line segment
      identifier: fill_block
  - object_type: single_pixel
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      location: single occurrence in the row
      role: defines the right boundary for the fill action
      identifier: boundary_pixel
  - object_type: background_pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: pixels between the fill_block and the boundary_pixel
      role: target for the fill action
      identifier: fill_target_pixels
actions:
  - action_type: fill
    actor: fill_block (specifically, its color)
    target: fill_target_pixels
    result: fill_target_pixels change color from white (0) to the color of fill_block
    condition: fill action applies only to pixels between the rightmost pixel of fill_block and the boundary_pixel
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    subject: fill_block
    relation: left_of

    relation: between
    object1: fill_block
    object2: boundary_pixel
  - type: boundary_condition
    subject: boundary_pixel
    role: stops the fill action; its own position and color remain unchanged
invariants:
  - position and color of the boundary_pixel (green, 3)
  - color and position of the fill_block (except for its implicit rightward extension via filling)
  - color and position of all pixels to the right of the boundary_pixel
  - color and position of all pixels to the left of the fill_block's original starting position
