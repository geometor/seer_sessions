task_type: array_manipulation_1d_fill
grid_dimensions: 1xN (single row, variable length N)
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    identifier: fill_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-green (3) # e.g., magenta (6), blue (1), gray (5)
      location: Variable, always starts before the boundary_pixel.
      shape: horizontal line segment
      extent: Defined by its color and contiguity. Let its rightmost column index be `fill_block_end_col`.
  - object_type: single_pixel
    identifier: boundary_pixel
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      location: Single occurrence in the row. Let its column index be `green_col`. Always located to the right of the fill_block.
  - object_type: gap_pixels
    identifier: fill_target
    properties:
      color: white (0) initially
      location: Columns between `fill_block_end_col + 1` and `green_col - 1`.
      existence: May not exist if `fill_block_end_col + 1 == green_col`.
actions:
  - action_type: fill
    actor: fill_block
    target: gap_pixels
    parameters:
      fill_color: The color of the fill_block.
      start_column: `fill_block_end_col + 1`
      end_column: `green_col - 1` (inclusive)
    result: All pixels in the target columns change color to `fill_color`.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    subject: fill_block
    relation: left_of
    object: boundary_pixel
  - type: boundary_condition
    subject: boundary_pixel
    role: Defines the rightmost limit (exclusive) for the fill action.
invariants:
  - Color and position of `boundary_pixel`.
  - Color and position of pixels to the right of `boundary_pixel`.
  - Color and position of pixels to the left of the original `fill_block`.
  - The color of the `fill_block` itself (used as the `fill_color`).
derived_values:
  - name: green_col
    description: Column index of the green (3) boundary pixel.
  - name: fill_color
    description: Color of the first contiguous block of non-white, non-green pixels found to the left of green_col.
  - name: fill_block_end_col
    description: Column index of the rightmost pixel belonging to the identified fill_block in the input.
