task_type: array_manipulation_1d
grid_dimensions: 1xN (single row)
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block
    identifier: fill_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-green (3) # e.g., magenta (6), blue (1), gray (5)
      location: left of boundary_pixel
      shape: horizontal line segment
      cardinality: exactly one such block exists to the left of the boundary_pixel
  - object_type: single_pixel
    identifier: boundary_pixel
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      location: right of fill_block
      cardinality: exactly one in the row
  - object_type: background_pixels
    identifier: gap_pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0) # Inferred from examples
      location: between fill_block and boundary_pixel
actions:
  - action_type: fill_region
    actor: fill_block # The color property of this block is used
    target_region: gap_pixels # The pixels between fill_block's end and boundary_pixel's start
    result: pixels in target_region change color to match fill_block's color
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    subject: fill_block
    relation: left_of
    object: boundary_pixel
  - type: boundary
    subject: boundary_pixel
    role: defines the rightmost extent (exclusive) of the fill_region action
invariants:
  - position and color of boundary_pixel
  - color and position of pixels to the right of boundary_pixel
  - color and position of pixels within the original fill_block
  - color and position of pixels to the left of the original fill_block
  - the color value used for filling (derived from fill_block)
