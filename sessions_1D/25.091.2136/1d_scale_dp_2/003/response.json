Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.\n2. Locate the column index of the single green pixel (color 3) in the input row. \n   Let this be `green_col`.\n3. Scan the input row from left to right, up to (but not including) `green_col`, \n   to find the *first* contiguous block of pixels with a color that is neither \n   white (0) nor green (3).\n4. Identify the color of this block (`fill_color`) and the column index of its \n   rightmost pixel (`fill_end_col`).\n5. If such a block is found:\n   a. Iterate through the columns from `fill_end_col + 1` up to `green_col - 1`.\n   b. For each column index in this range, set the corresponding pixel in the \n      *output* row to `fill_color`.\n6.
