"""
Transforms a 1D grid (represented as a list) by finding the first contiguous block 
of a non-white (0), non-green (3) color located to the left of a single green (3) 
pixel. This block's color is then used to fill the gap (initially typically white pixels) 
between the end of the block and the green pixel. Pixels to the left of the block, 
the green pixel itself, and pixels to its right remain unchanged.
