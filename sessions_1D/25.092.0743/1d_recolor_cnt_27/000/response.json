The locations and shapes previously occupied by yellow pixels are now filled with different colors: red (2), magenta (6), or maroon (9).\n3.  **Object Preservation:** The shapes and positions of the objects are preserved between input and output.\n4.  **Color Change:** The core transformation is a change in color for the yellow objects.\n5.  **Pattern:** The new color seems correlated with the size (number of pixels) of the original yellow object.\n    *   Yellow objects with 1 pixel become maroon (9).\n    *   Yellow objects with 2 pixels become magenta (6).\n    *   Yellow objects with 3 pixels become red (2).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
