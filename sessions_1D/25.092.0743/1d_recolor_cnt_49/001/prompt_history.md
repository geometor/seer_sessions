Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data appear to be 1-dimensional arrays or single-row grids. The length seems consistent across examples (31 cells).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and green (3) in the input. The output introduces red (2), yellow (4), and maroon (9), while retaining white (0). Green (3) is absent in the output.
3.  **Objects:** The relevant objects seem to be contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of green (3) pixels within the 1D array.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation acts specifically on these green blocks. The white (0) background pixels remain unchanged. The color used to replace a green block depends on the length of that block.

**Detailed Analysis (Example 1):**

*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Mapping green blocks:
*   `[3, 3, 3]` (length 3) -> `[9, 9, 9]` (maroon)
*   `[3]` (length 1) -> `[4]` (yellow)
*   `[3, 3]` (length 2) -> `[2, 2]` (red)
*   `[3, 3, 3]` (length 3) -> `[9, 9, 9]` (maroon)
*   `[3, 3]` (length 2) -> `[2, 2]` (red)

**Hypothesis:** The rule maps the length of a contiguous green block to a specific output color:
*   Length 1 -> Yellow (4)
*   Length 2 -> Red (2)
*   Length 3 -> Maroon (9)

This hypothesis holds true for all three training examples.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Type: 1D array or single-row grid
Background_Color: White (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block
    Properties:
      - Color: Green (3)
      - Length: Number of pixels in the block (observed lengths: 1, 2, 3)
Actions:
  - Identify all contiguous blocks of Green (3) pixels in the input.
  - For each identified Green block:
      - Measure its length.
      - Replace the entire block with pixels of a new color, determined by the block's length.
  - Preserve all other pixels (White (0)) in their original positions.
Relationships:
  - The output color for a transformed block is solely dependent on the length of the original Green (3) block.
Color_Transformation_Map:
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 1 => Output_Block: Yellow (4), Length 1
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 2 => Output_Block: Red (2), Length 2
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 3 => Output_Block: Maroon (9), Length 3
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output array/grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled initially with the background color (white/0) or as a copy of the input.
2.  Iterate through the input array/grid from left to right.
3.  If a green (3) pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet (i.e., it's the start of a new green block):
    a.  Measure the length of the contiguous block of green (3) pixels starting from the current position.
    b.  Determine the replacement color based on the measured length:
        *   If length is 1, the replacement color is yellow (4).
        *   If length is 2, the replacement color is red (2).
        *   If length is 3, the replacement color is maroon (9).
    c.  In the output array/grid, replace the pixels corresponding to the identified green block with the determined replacement color.
    d.  Advance the iteration index past the processed green block.
4.  If a non-green pixel (white/0) is encountered, copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output array/grid (if not already done in step 1).
5.  Continue iterating until the end of the input array/grid is reached.
6.  Return the final output array/grid.
