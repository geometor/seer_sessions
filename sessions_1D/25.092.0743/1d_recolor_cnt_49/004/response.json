            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: replacing contiguous blocks of green pixels (3) with a new color based on the block's length (1->yellow/4, 2->red/2, 3->maroon/9), while leaving white pixels (0) unchanged. However, the provided code failed to implement this transformation, returning the input grid unmodified for all examples. This indicates a flaw in the code's execution flow, likely related to how it iterates and checks for green blocks, rather than a misunderstanding of the rule itself. The strategy is to correct the implementation logic to accurately reflect the observed transformation rule. Specifically, the iteration should check the *original input* to identify the start of green blocks, measure their length from the input, and then modify the *output grid* accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples to confirm the pattern and identify potential issues missed.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Green Blocks (Input): `(index=3, length=3)`, `(index=8, length=1)`, `(index=10, length=2)`, `(index=13, length=3)`, `(index=19, length=2)`\n    *   Corresponding Output Colors: `maroon (9)`, `yellow (4)`, `red (2)`, `maroon (9)`, `red (2)`\n    *   Mapping: Length 3 -> 9, Length 1 -> 4, Length 2 -> 2. Consistent.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Green Blocks (Input): `(index=3, length=1)`, `(index=7, length=3)`, `(index=13, length=2)`, `(index=17, length=3)`, `(index=23, length=2)`\n    *   Corresponding Output Colors: `yellow (4)`, `maroon (9)`, `red (2)`, `maroon (9)`, `red (2)`\n    *   Mapping: Length 1 -> 4, Length 3 -> 9, Length 2 -> 2. Consistent.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Green Blocks (Input): `(index=3, length=2)`, `(index=7, length=1)`, `(index=11, length=3)`, `(index=16, length=2)`, `(index=19, length=3)`\n    *   Corresponding Output Colors: `red (2)`, `yellow (4)`, `maroon (9)`, `red (2)`, `maroon (9)`\n    *   Mapping: Length 2 -> 2, Length 1 -> 4, Length 3 -> 9. Consistent.\n\nThe analysis confirms the transformation rule holds across all examples. The issue lies purely in the previous code's implementation.\n\n"
