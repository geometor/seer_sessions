Grid_Type: 1D array (represented as 1xN grid)
Background_Color: White (0)
Input_Object:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block
    Properties:
      - Color: Green (3)
      - Length: Number of pixels in the block (observed lengths: 1, 2, 3)
      - Location: Defined by start index within the row.
Output_Object:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block
    Properties:
      - Color: Determined by the length of the corresponding input block (Yellow/4 for length 1, Red/2 for length 2, Maroon/9 for length 3)
      - Length: Same as the corresponding input block.
      - Location: Same start index as the corresponding input block.
Actions:
  - Iterate through the single row of the input grid.
  - Identify all contiguous blocks of Green (3) pixels.
  - For each identified Green block:
      - Measure its length.
      - Determine the replacement color based on the block's length using the specified mapping.
      - Replace the pixels corresponding to the identified green block with the determined replacement color in the output grid.
  - Preserve all other pixels (White (0)) in their original positions.
Relationships:
  - The output color for a transformed block depends only on the length of the original Green (3) block.
  - The size and position of the transformed block match the original Green (3) block.
  - White (0) pixels are unchanged.

  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 1 => Output_Block: Yellow (4)
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 2 => Output_Block: Red (2)
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 3 => Output_Block: Maroon (9)
