**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: replacing contiguous blocks of green pixels (3) with a new color based on the block's length (1->yellow/4, 2->red/2, 3->maroon/9), while leaving white pixels (0) unchanged. However, the provided code failed to implement this transformation, returning the input grid unmodified for all examples. This indicates a flaw in the code's execution flow, likely related to how it iterates and checks for green blocks, rather than a misunderstanding of the rule itself. The strategy is to correct the implementation logic to accurately reflect the observed transformation rule. Specifically, the iteration should check the *original input* to identify the start of green blocks, measure their length from the input, and then modify the *output grid* accordingly.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's re-examine the examples to confirm the pattern and identify potential issues missed.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Green Blocks (Input): `(index=3, length=3)`, `(index=8, length=1)`, `(index=10, length=2)`, `(index=13, length=3)`, `(index=19, length=2)`
    *   Corresponding Output Colors: `maroon (9)`, `yellow (4)`, `red (2)`, `maroon (9)`, `red (2)`
    *   Mapping: Length 3 -> 9, Length 1 -> 4, Length 2 -> 2. Consistent.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Green Blocks (Input): `(index=3, length=1)`, `(index=7, length=3)`, `(index=13, length=2)`, `(index=17, length=3)`, `(index=23, length=2)`
    *   Corresponding Output Colors: `yellow (4)`, `maroon (9)`, `red (2)`, `maroon (9)`, `red (2)`
    *   Mapping: Length 1 -> 4, Length 3 -> 9, Length 2 -> 2. Consistent.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Green Blocks (Input): `(index=3, length=2)`, `(index=7, length=1)`, `(index=11, length=3)`, `(index=16, length=2)`, `(index=19, length=3)`
    *   Corresponding Output Colors: `red (2)`, `yellow (4)`, `maroon (9)`, `red (2)`, `maroon (9)`
    *   Mapping: Length 2 -> 2, Length 1 -> 4, Length 3 -> 9. Consistent.

The analysis confirms the transformation rule holds across all examples. The issue lies purely in the previous code's implementation.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Type: 1D array (represented as 1xN grid)
Background_Color: White (0)
Input_Object:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block
    Properties:
      - Color: Green (3)
      - Length: Number of pixels in the block (observed lengths: 1, 2, 3)
      - Location: Defined by start index within the row.
Output_Object:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block
    Properties:
      - Color: Determined by the length of the corresponding input block (Yellow/4 for length 1, Red/2 for length 2, Maroon/9 for length 3)
      - Length: Same as the corresponding input block.
      - Location: Same start index as the corresponding input block.
Actions:
  - Iterate through the single row of the input grid.
  - Identify all contiguous blocks of Green (3) pixels.
  - For each identified Green block:
      - Measure its length.
      - Determine the replacement color based on the block's length using the specified mapping.
      - Replace the pixels corresponding to the identified green block with the determined replacement color in the output grid.
  - Preserve all other pixels (White (0)) in their original positions.
Relationships:
  - The output color for a transformed block depends only on the length of the original Green (3) block.
  - The size and position of the transformed block match the original Green (3) block.
  - White (0) pixels are unchanged.
Color_Transformation_Map:
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 1 => Output_Block: Yellow (4)
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 2 => Output_Block: Red (2)
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 3 => Output_Block: Maroon (9)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid (which is a 1xN grid). Extract the single row for processing.
2.  Iterate through the *input row* using an index, `i`, starting from 0 up to the length of the row.
3.  At each index `i`, check the color in the *input row*:
    a.  If the color is Green (3):
        i.  Record the current index as the `start_index` of the block.
        ii. Measure the `length` of the contiguous block of Green (3) pixels starting from `start_index` by checking subsequent pixels in the *input row*.
        iii. Advance the main loop index `i` to the position *immediately after* the identified green block.
        iv. Determine the `replacement_color` based on the measured `length`: Yellow (4) if length is 1, Red (2) if length is 2, Maroon (9) if length is 3.
        v. If a valid `replacement_color` was determined (i.e., length was 1, 2, or 3), replace the pixels in the *output row* from `start_index` up to (`start_index + length - 1`) with the `replacement_color`.
    b.  If the color is *not* Green (3) (i.e., it's White (0)), simply advance the main loop index `i` by 1. (The white pixel is already correctly placed in the output row due to the initial copy).
4.  After iterating through the entire input row, the output row contains the transformed result.
5.  Return the output row, formatted as a 1xN grid (i.e., wrapped in a list).
