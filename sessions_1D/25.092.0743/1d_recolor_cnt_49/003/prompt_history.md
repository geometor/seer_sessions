Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output data appear to be 1-dimensional arrays or single-row grids. The length seems consistent across examples (31 cells).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and green (3) in the input. The output introduces red (2), yellow (4), and maroon (9), while retaining white (0). Green (3) is absent in the output.
3.  **Objects:** The relevant objects seem to be contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of green (3) pixels within the 1D array.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation acts specifically on these green blocks. The white (0) background pixels remain unchanged. The color used to replace a green block depends on the length of that block.

**Detailed Analysis (Example 1):**

*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Mapping green blocks:
*   `[3, 3, 3]` (length 3) -> `[9, 9, 9]` (maroon)
*   `[3]` (length 1) -> `[4]` (yellow)
*   `[3, 3]` (length 2) -> `[2, 2]` (red)
*   `[3, 3, 3]` (length 3) -> `[9, 9, 9]` (maroon)
*   `[3, 3]` (length 2) -> `[2, 2]` (red)

**Hypothesis:** The rule maps the length of a contiguous green block to a specific output color:
*   Length 1 -> Yellow (4)
*   Length 2 -> Red (2)
*   Length 3 -> Maroon (9)

This hypothesis holds true for all three training examples.

**Facts:**

    Properties:
      - Color: Green (3)

Actions:
  - Identify all contiguous blocks of Green (3) pixels in the input.
  - For each identified Green block:
      - Measure its length.
      - Replace the entire block with pixels of a new color, determined by the block's length.
  - Preserve all other pixels (White (0)) in their original positions.
Relationships:
  - The output color for a transformed block is solely dependent on the length of the original Green (3) block.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output array/grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled initially with the background color (white/0) or as a copy of the input.
2.  Iterate through the input array/grid from left to right.
3.  If a green (3) pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet (i.e., it's the start of a new green block):
    a.  Measure the length of the contiguous block of green (3) pixels starting from the current position.
    b.  Determine the replacement color based on the measured length:
        *   If length is 1, the replacement color is yellow (4).
        *   If length is 2, the replacement color is red (2).
        *   If length is 3, the replacement color is maroon (9).
    c.  In the output array/grid, replace the pixels corresponding to the identified green block with the determined replacement color.
    d.  Advance the iteration index past the processed green block.
4.  If a non-green pixel (white/0) is encountered, copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output array/grid (if not already done in step 1).
5.  Continue iterating until the end of the input array/grid is reached.
6.  Return the final output array/grid.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The errors encountered ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") clearly indicate that the input data, previously interpreted as a 1D list, is actually being handled by the execution framework as a 2D structure, specifically a grid with a single row (shape 1xN, where N is the number of elements). The previous code failed because it tried to perform comparisons like `list == integer` instead of accessing the element within the row (`list[0][index] == integer`).

The core transformation logic identified earlier – finding contiguous horizontal blocks of green (3) and replacing them with yellow (4), red (2), or maroon (9) based on block lengths of 1, 2, or 3 respectively – was validated by the metrics gathered using `tool_code` and holds true for all training examples.

The strategy is to adapt the implementation to correctly handle the 1xN grid structure. This involves:
1.  Accessing the single row of the input grid.
2.  Performing the block detection and replacement logic on this row.
3.  Ensuring the final output is returned in the same 1xN grid format (a list containing one list).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input, which is a list containing a single inner list (the grid row). Let's call the inner list `input_row`.
2.  Create a copy of `input_row` called `output_row`. This preserves original non-green pixels and serves as the basis for modification.
3.  Initialize an index `i` to 0 to track the current position within the row.
4.  While `i` is less than the length of `input_row`:
    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `input_row[i]`.
    b.  If the pixel color is Green (3):
        i.  Record the starting position `start_index = i`.
        ii. Initialize a counter `length = 0`.
        iii. While `i` is within the bounds of the row and `input_row[i]` is Green (3):
            Increment `length` by 1.
            Increment `i` by 1.
        iv. Determine the `replacement_color`:
            If `length` is 1, `replacement_color` is Yellow (4).
            If `length` is 2, `replacement_color` is Red (2).
            If `length` is 3, `replacement_color` is Maroon (9).
            (Assume no other lengths require action based on examples).
        v. If a `replacement_color` was determined (i.e., length was 1, 2, or 3), loop from `j = start_index` up to `start_index + length` (exclusive) and set `output_row[j] = replacement_color`.
        vi. The index `i` is now positioned at the pixel immediately following the processed green block, so the outer loop will continue correctly.
    c.  If the pixel color is *not* Green (3):
        i.  Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next pixel. (No action needed on `output_row` as it was initialized as a copy).
5.  Once the loop finishes, wrap the modified `output_row` in a list to create the final 2D grid structure: `final_output_grid = [output_row]`.
6.  Return `final_output_grid`.
