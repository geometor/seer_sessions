Grid_Type: 2D grid with a single row (shape 1xN, N=31 in examples).
Background_Color: White (0). Remains unchanged in the output.
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal sequence (block) of pixels within the single row.
    Relevant_Object_Color: Green (3).
    Properties:
      - Length: The number of contiguous Green pixels (observed lengths: 1, 2, 3).
      - Position: Start index within the row.
Transformation: Replace Green blocks based on their length.
Actions:
  - Iterate through the single row of the input grid.
  - Identify each contiguous block of Green (3) pixels.
  - For each Green block found:
      - Measure its length.
      - Determine the output color using a fixed mapping based on length.
      - Replace all pixels of the original Green block in the output row with the determined output color.
  - Copy all non-Green pixels (specifically White (0)) directly to the output row.
Relationships:
  - The transformation is local to contiguous Green blocks.
  - The output color depends solely on the length of the Green block.
Color_Transformation_Map:
  - Input_Color: Green (3)
  - Block_Length: 1 => Output_Color: Yellow (4)
  - Block_Length: 2 => Output_Color: Red (2)
  - Block_Length: 3 => Output_Color: Maroon (9)
Output_Format: Must be a 2D grid with a single row (list containing one list), identical in shape to the input.
