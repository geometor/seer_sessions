**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The errors encountered ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") clearly indicate that the input data, previously interpreted as a 1D list, is actually being handled by the execution framework as a 2D structure, specifically a grid with a single row (shape 1xN, where N is the number of elements). The previous code failed because it tried to perform comparisons like `list == integer` instead of accessing the element within the row (`list[0][index] == integer`).

The core transformation logic identified earlier – finding contiguous horizontal blocks of green (3) and replacing them with yellow (4), red (2), or maroon (9) based on block lengths of 1, 2, or 3 respectively – was validated by the metrics gathered using `tool_code` and holds true for all training examples.

The strategy is to adapt the implementation to correctly handle the 1xN grid structure. This involves:
1.  Accessing the single row of the input grid.
2.  Performing the block detection and replacement logic on this row.
3.  Ensuring the final output is returned in the same 1xN grid format (a list containing one list).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Type: 2D grid with a single row (shape 1xN, N=31 in examples).
Background_Color: White (0). Remains unchanged in the output.
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal sequence (block) of pixels within the single row.
    Relevant_Object_Color: Green (3).
    Properties:
      - Length: The number of contiguous Green pixels (observed lengths: 1, 2, 3).
      - Position: Start index within the row.
Transformation: Replace Green blocks based on their length.
Actions:
  - Iterate through the single row of the input grid.
  - Identify each contiguous block of Green (3) pixels.
  - For each Green block found:
      - Measure its length.
      - Determine the output color using a fixed mapping based on length.
      - Replace all pixels of the original Green block in the output row with the determined output color.
  - Copy all non-Green pixels (specifically White (0)) directly to the output row.
Relationships:
  - The transformation is local to contiguous Green blocks.
  - The output color depends solely on the length of the Green block.
Color_Transformation_Map:
  - Input_Color: Green (3)
  - Block_Length: 1 => Output_Color: Yellow (4)
  - Block_Length: 2 => Output_Color: Red (2)
  - Block_Length: 3 => Output_Color: Maroon (9)
Output_Format: Must be a 2D grid with a single row (list containing one list), identical in shape to the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input, which is a list containing a single inner list (the grid row). Let's call the inner list `input_row`.
2.  Create a copy of `input_row` called `output_row`. This preserves original non-green pixels and serves as the basis for modification.
3.  Initialize an index `i` to 0 to track the current position within the row.
4.  While `i` is less than the length of `input_row`:
    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `input_row[i]`.
    b.  If the pixel color is Green (3):
        i.  Record the starting position `start_index = i`.
        ii. Initialize a counter `length = 0`.
        iii. While `i` is within the bounds of the row and `input_row[i]` is Green (3):
            Increment `length` by 1.
            Increment `i` by 1.
        iv. Determine the `replacement_color`:
            If `length` is 1, `replacement_color` is Yellow (4).
            If `length` is 2, `replacement_color` is Red (2).
            If `length` is 3, `replacement_color` is Maroon (9).
            (Assume no other lengths require action based on examples).
        v. If a `replacement_color` was determined (i.e., length was 1, 2, or 3), loop from `j = start_index` up to `start_index + length` (exclusive) and set `output_row[j] = replacement_color`.
        vi. The index `i` is now positioned at the pixel immediately following the processed green block, so the outer loop will continue correctly.
    c.  If the pixel color is *not* Green (3):
        i.  Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next pixel. (No action needed on `output_row` as it was initialized as a copy).
5.  Once the loop finishes, wrap the modified `output_row` in a list to create the final 2D grid structure: `final_output_grid = [output_row]`.
6.  Return `final_output_grid`.
