The previous code failed because it tried to perform comparisons like `list == integer` instead of accessing the element within the row (`list[0][index] == integer`).\n\nThe core transformation logic identified earlier \u2013 finding contiguous horizontal blocks of green (3) and replacing them with yellow (4), red (2), or maroon (9) based on block lengths of 1, 2, or 3 respectively \u2013 was validated by the metrics gathered using `tool_code` and holds true for all training examples.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the implementation to correctly handle the 1xN grid structure. This involves:\n1.  Accessing the single row of the input grid.\n2.  Performing the block detection and replacement logic on this row.\n3.  Ensuring the final output is returned in the same 1xN grid format (a list containing one list).\n\n**Metrics:**\n"

Create a copy of `input_row` called `output_row`. This preserves original non-green pixels and serves as the basis for modification.\n3.  Initialize an index `i` to 0 to track the current position within the row.\n4.  While `i` is less than the length of `input_row`:\n    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `input_row[i]`.\n    b.  If the pixel color is Green (3):\n        i.  Record the starting position `start_index = i`.\n        ii. Initialize a counter `length = 0`.\n        iii. While `i` is within the bounds of the row and `input_row[i]` is Green (3):\n            Increment `length` by 1.\n            Increment `i` by 1.\n        iv. Determine the `replacement_color`:\n            If `length` is 1, `replacement_color` is Yellow (4).\n            If `length` is 2, `replacement_color` is Red (2).\n            If `length` is 3, `replacement_color` is Maroon (9).\n            (Assume no other lengths require action based on examples).\n        v. If a `replacement_color` was determined (i.e., length was 1, 2, or 3), loop from `j = start_index` up to `start_index + length` (exclusive) and set `output_row[j] = replacement_color`.\n        vi. The index `i` is now positioned at the pixel immediately following the processed green block, so the outer loop will continue correctly.\n    c.  If the pixel color is *not* Green (3):\n        i.  Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next pixel. (No action needed on `output_row` as it was initialized as a copy).\n5.  Once the loop finishes, wrap the modified `output_row` in a list to create the final 2D grid structure: `final_output_grid = [output_row]`.\n6.  Return `final_output_grid`."
