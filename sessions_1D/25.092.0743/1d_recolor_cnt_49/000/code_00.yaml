Grid_Type: 1D array or single-row grid
Background_Color: White (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block
    Properties:
      - Color: Green (3)
      - Length: Number of pixels in the block (observed lengths: 1, 2, 3)
Actions:
  - Identify all contiguous blocks of Green (3) pixels in the input.
  - For each identified Green block:
      - Measure its length.
      - Replace the entire block with pixels of a new color, determined by the block's length.
  - Preserve all other pixels (White (0)) in their original positions.
Relationships:
  - The output color for a transformed block is solely dependent on the length of the original Green (3) block.
Color_Transformation_Map:
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 1 => Output_Block: Yellow (4), Length 1
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 2 => Output_Block: Red (2), Length 2
  - Input_Block: Green (3), Length 3 => Output_Block: Maroon (9), Length 3
