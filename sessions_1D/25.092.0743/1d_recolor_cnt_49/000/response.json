The length seems consistent across examples (31 cells).\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and green (3) in the input. The output introduces red (2), yellow (4), and maroon (9), while retaining white (0). Green (3) is absent in the output.\n3.  **Objects:** The relevant objects seem to be contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of green (3) pixels within the 1D array.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation acts specifically on these green blocks. The white (0) background pixels remain unchanged. The color used to replace a green block depends on the length of that block.\n\n**Detailed Analysis (Example 1):**\n\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nMapping green blocks:\n*   `[3, 3, 3]` (length 3) -> `[9, 9, 9]` (maroon)\n*   `[3]` (length 1) -> `[4]` (yellow)\n*   `[3, 3]` (length 2) -> `[2, 2]` (red)\n*   `[3, 3, 3]` (length 3) -> `[9, 9, 9]` (maroon)\n*   `[3, 3]` (length 2) -> `[2, 2]` (red)\n\n**Hypothesis:** The rule maps the length of a contiguous green block to a specific output color:\n*   Length 1 -> Yellow (4)\n*   Length 2 -> Red (2)\n*   Length 3 -> Maroon (9)\n\nThis hypothesis holds true for all three training examples.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
