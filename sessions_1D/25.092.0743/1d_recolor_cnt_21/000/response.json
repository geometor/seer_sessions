The transformation operates along this single dimension.\n2.  **Colors:**\n    *   The input uses white (0) as the background and yellow (4) for foreground elements.\n    *   The output retains the white (0) background but replaces yellow (4) with other colors: orange (7), blue (1), and green (3).\n3.  **Objects:** The core elements in the input are contiguous horizontal segments (runs) of yellow pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies these yellow segments and recolors them based on their length. The positions and extent of the segments remain the same; only the color changes.\n5.  **Pattern:** There's a clear mapping between the length of a yellow segment and its resulting color in the output:\n    *   Length 1 yellow segment (4) becomes green (3).\n    *   Length 2 yellow segment (4 4) becomes orange (7 7).\n    *   Length 3 yellow segment (4 4 4) becomes blue (1 1 1).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
