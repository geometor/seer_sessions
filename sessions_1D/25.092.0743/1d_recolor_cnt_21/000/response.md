Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples appear to represent 1-dimensional grids or single rows from a 2D grid. The transformation operates along this single dimension.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   The input uses white (0) as the background and yellow (4) for foreground elements.
    *   The output retains the white (0) background but replaces yellow (4) with other colors: orange (7), blue (1), and green (3).
3.  **Objects:** The core elements in the input are contiguous horizontal segments (runs) of yellow pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies these yellow segments and recolors them based on their length. The positions and extent of the segments remain the same; only the color changes.
5.  **Pattern:** There's a clear mapping between the length of a yellow segment and its resulting color in the output:
    *   Length 1 yellow segment (4) becomes green (3).
    *   Length 2 yellow segment (4 4) becomes orange (7 7).
    *   Length 3 yellow segment (4 4 4) becomes blue (1 1 1).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: Likely 1D or operates row-wise independently on 2D grids. Examples show 1x17 grids.
  colors_involved:
    - background: white (0)
    - input_foreground: yellow (4)
    - output_foreground: green (3), blue (1), orange (7)
  background_preservation: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    input_color: yellow (4)
    description: Contiguous sequences of one or more yellow pixels along a row.
properties:
  - name: length
    applies_to: horizontal_segment (yellow)
    description: The number of contiguous yellow pixels in the segment.
actions:
  - name: recolor_segment
    target: horizontal_segment (yellow)
    description: Replace the yellow color of the segment with a new color based on its properties.
relationships:
  - type: length_to_color_mapping
    description: The color used to replace a yellow segment depends on its length.
    mapping:
      - input_length: 1
        output_color: green (3)
      - input_length: 2
        output_color: orange (7)
      - input_length: 3
        output_color: blue (1)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid (or the single row if it's 1D).
3.  Within each row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments (runs) composed solely of yellow (4) pixels. Keep track of the starting position and length of each segment.
4.  For each identified yellow segment:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  Select the new color based on the length:
        *   If the length is 1, choose green (3).
        *   If the length is 2, choose orange (7).
        *   If the length is 3, choose blue (1).
    c.  In the output grid, replace the pixels corresponding to this segment (using its starting position and length) with the selected new color.
5.  After processing all yellow segments in all rows, return the modified output grid.
