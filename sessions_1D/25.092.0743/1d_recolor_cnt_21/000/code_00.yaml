task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: Likely 1D or operates row-wise independently on 2D grids. Examples show 1x17 grids.
  colors_involved:
    - background: white (0)
    - input_foreground: yellow (4)
    - output_foreground: green (3), blue (1), orange (7)
  background_preservation: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    input_color: yellow (4)
    description: Contiguous sequences of one or more yellow pixels along a row.
properties:
  - name: length
    applies_to: horizontal_segment (yellow)
    description: The number of contiguous yellow pixels in the segment.
actions:
  - name: recolor_segment
    target: horizontal_segment (yellow)
    description: Replace the yellow color of the segment with a new color based on its properties.
relationships:
  - type: length_to_color_mapping
    description: The color used to replace a yellow segment depends on its length.
    mapping:
      - input_length: 1
        output_color: green (3)
      - input_length: 2
        output_color: orange (7)
      - input_length: 3
        output_color: blue (1)
