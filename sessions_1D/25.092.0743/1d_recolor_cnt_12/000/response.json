These shapes are simple horizontal line segments of varying lengths.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids maintain the same dimensions and the white background pixels remain unchanged. The magenta shapes from the input are replaced with shapes of the same size and position but different colors: azure (8), orange (7), and green (3).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying each contiguous horizontal segment of magenta pixels and recoloring it based on some property.\n4.  **Color Mapping Rule:** By comparing the input and output shapes across the examples, a pattern emerges based on the *width* of the horizontal magenta segments:\n    *   Magenta segments of width 1 are replaced with azure (8).\n    *   Magenta segments of width 2 are replaced with orange (7).\n    *   Magenta segments of width 3 are replaced with green (3).\n5.  **Object Persistence:** The shapes (segments) persist in terms of location and extent, but their color attribute changes. No shapes are added or removed, only recolored. The background remains static.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
