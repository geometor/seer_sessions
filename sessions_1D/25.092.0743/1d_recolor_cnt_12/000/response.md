Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a white (0) background and several distinct shapes made of magenta (6) pixels. These shapes are simple horizontal line segments of varying lengths.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids maintain the same dimensions and the white background pixels remain unchanged. The magenta shapes from the input are replaced with shapes of the same size and position but different colors: azure (8), orange (7), and green (3).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying each contiguous horizontal segment of magenta pixels and recoloring it based on some property.
4.  **Color Mapping Rule:** By comparing the input and output shapes across the examples, a pattern emerges based on the *width* of the horizontal magenta segments:
    *   Magenta segments of width 1 are replaced with azure (8).
    *   Magenta segments of width 2 are replaced with orange (7).
    *   Magenta segments of width 3 are replaced with green (3).
5.  **Object Persistence:** The shapes (segments) persist in terms of location and extent, but their color attribute changes. No shapes are added or removed, only recolored. The background remains static.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Recolor horizontal magenta segments based on their width."
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static_canvas
  - type: object
    identifier: magenta_segment
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - shape: horizontal_line_segment
      - width: integer (1, 2, or 3 based on examples)
      - location: grid_coordinates
    role: input_feature
  - type: object
    identifier: recolored_segment
    properties:
      - shape: horizontal_line_segment (same as corresponding input segment)
      - width: integer (same as corresponding input segment)
      - location: grid_coordinates (same as corresponding input segment)
      - color: determined_by_rule
    role: output_feature
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: magenta_segment
    output: recolored_segment
    rule: |
      The color of the output segment depends on the width of the input magenta_segment:
      - If width = 1, output color is azure (8).
      - If width = 2, output color is orange (7).
      - If width = 3, output color is green (3).
  - type: preservation
    element: background (white pixels)
    rule: Remain unchanged between input and output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  Within each row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments composed entirely of magenta (6) pixels.
4.  For each identified magenta segment:
    a.  Determine its width (the number of pixels in the segment).
    b.  Determine the starting column index of the segment.
    c.  Based on the segment's width:
        i.  If the width is 1, change the color of the corresponding pixel(s) in the output grid to azure (8).
        ii. If the width is 2, change the color of the corresponding pixels in the output grid to orange (7).
        iii. If the width is 3, change the color of the corresponding pixels in the output grid to green (3).
5.  Ensure that pixels belonging to already processed segments are not re-evaluated.
6.  Pixels that were not part of any magenta segment in the input remain unchanged in the output grid (preserving the white background).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
