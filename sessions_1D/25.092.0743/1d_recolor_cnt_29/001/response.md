"""
Transforms an input grid by changing the color of contiguous horizontal blocks of red pixels (2) based on their length.
- White pixels (0) remain unchanged.
- Red blocks of length 1 become maroon (9).
- Red blocks of length 2 become blue (1).
- Red blocks of length 3 become yellow (4).
The transformation applies only to the first row as the input grids are 1xN.
