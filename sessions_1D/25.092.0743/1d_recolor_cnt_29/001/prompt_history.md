**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input grid (represented as a 1xN grid) into an output grid of the same dimensions. The input grids primarily consist of white pixels (0) and red pixels (2). The output grids retain the white pixels in their original positions but replace the red pixels with other colors: blue (1), yellow (4), or maroon (9).

The core transformation rule seems to depend on the length of contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of red pixels in the input.
- Single red pixels (length 1) are replaced by maroon pixels (9).
- Sequences of two adjacent red pixels (length 2) are replaced by blue pixels (1).
- Sequences of three adjacent red pixels (length 3) are replaced by yellow pixels (4).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Color Transformation Based on Block Length

Input_Grid:
  - type: Grid
  - properties:
    - dimensions: 1xN (where N varies, e.g., 1x19)
    - pixels:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: red (2)
  - objects:
    - type: Pixel
      - color: white (0)
      - color: red (2)
    - type: Horizontal Block
      - description: Contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color along a row.
      - properties:
        - color: red (2)
        - length: integer (1, 2, 3 observed)

Output_Grid:
  - type: Grid
  - properties:
    - dimensions: Same as input grid (1xN)
    - pixels:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: blue (1)
      - color: yellow (4)
      - color: maroon (9)

Transformation:
  - type: Recoloring
  - scope: Applied only to red pixels (2) in the input grid.
  - rule: The replacement color depends on the length of the contiguous horizontal block of red pixels the pixel belongs to.
    - Input red block length 1 -> Output color maroon (9)
    - Input red block length 2 -> Output color blue (1)
    - Input red block length 3 -> Output color yellow (4)
  - preservation: White pixels (0) remain unchanged in their original positions.

Relationships:
  - The output color of a position previously occupied by a red pixel is determined solely by the length of the contiguous horizontal block of red pixels it was part of in the input.
  - The position of pixels remains the same; only the color changes according to the rule.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid, scanning horizontally from left to right.
3.  If a white pixel (0) is encountered, copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output grid.
4.  If a red pixel (2) is encountered:
    a.  Determine the starting position of the contiguous horizontal block of red pixels it belongs to.
    b.  Measure the length of this contiguous red block.
    c.  Based on the measured length:
        i.  If the length is 1, fill the corresponding position(s) in the output grid with maroon (9).
        ii. If the length is 2, fill the corresponding position(s) in the output grid with blue (1).
        iii. If the length is 3, fill the corresponding position(s) in the output grid with yellow (4).
    d.  Advance the iteration past the currently processed red block to avoid re-processing its pixels.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
