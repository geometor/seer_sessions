Task: Color Transformation Based on Block Length

Input_Grid:
  - type: Grid
  - properties:
    - dimensions: 1xN (where N varies, e.g., 1x19)
    - pixels:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: red (2)
  - objects:
    - type: Pixel
      - color: white (0)
      - color: red (2)
    - type: Horizontal Block
      - description: Contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color along a row.
      - properties:
        - color: red (2)
        - length: integer (1, 2, 3 observed)

Output_Grid:
  - type: Grid
  - properties:
    - dimensions: Same as input grid (1xN)
    - pixels:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: blue (1)
      - color: yellow (4)
      - color: maroon (9)

Transformation:
  - type: Recoloring
  - scope: Applied only to red pixels (2) in the input grid.
  - rule: The replacement color depends on the length of the contiguous horizontal block of red pixels the pixel belongs to.
    - Input red block length 1 -> Output color maroon (9)
    - Input red block length 2 -> Output color blue (1)
    - Input red block length 3 -> Output color yellow (4)
  - preservation: White pixels (0) remain unchanged in their original positions.

Relationships:
  - The output color of a position previously occupied by a red pixel is determined solely by the length of the contiguous horizontal block of red pixels it was part of in the input.
  - The position of pixels remains the same; only the color changes according to the rule.
