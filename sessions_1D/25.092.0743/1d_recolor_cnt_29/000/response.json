The input grids primarily consist of white pixels (0) and red pixels (2). The output grids retain the white pixels in their original positions but replace the red pixels with other colors: blue (1), yellow (4), or maroon (9).\n\nThe core transformation rule seems to depend on the length of contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of red pixels in the input.\n- Single red pixels (length 1) are replaced by maroon pixels (9).\n- Sequences of two adjacent red pixels (length 2) are replaced by blue pixels (1).\n- Sequences of three adjacent red pixels (length 3) are replaced by yellow pixels (4).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
