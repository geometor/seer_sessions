Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are presented as single rows of numbers, suggesting 1-dimensional grids or 1xN grids.
*   **Colors:** The input primarily uses white (0) and magenta (6). The output uses white (0), maroon (9), green (3), and yellow (4).
*   **Structure Preservation:** The white pixels (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output at the same positions.
*   **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to target the magenta pixels (6).
*   **Objects:** The key objects appear to be contiguous horizontal segments (runs) of magenta pixels.
*   **Property:** The length (number of consecutive pixels) of these magenta segments seems crucial.
*   **Color Mapping:** There's a clear mapping between the length of a magenta segment in the input and the color used to replace it in the output:
    *   Segments of length 1 (single `6`) become maroon (`9`).
    *   Segments of length 2 (`6 6`) become green (`3 3`).
    *   Segments of length 3 (`6 6 6`) become yellow (`4 4 4`).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal segments of magenta pixels based on their length.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or effectively 1D processing if 2D)
components:
  - type: background_pixel
    color_value: 0
    color_name: white
    behavior: remains unchanged in the output.
  - type: segment
    input_color_value: 6
    input_color_name: magenta
    definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more magenta pixels.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
    behavior: Pixels within the segment are recolored in the output based on the segment's length.
relationships:
  - magenta segments are separated by one or more background (white) pixels.
transformation_rules:
  - condition: A magenta segment has length 1.
    action: Recolor the segment pixel(s) to maroon (9).
  - condition: A magenta segment has length 2.
    action: Recolor the segment pixel(s) to green (3).
  - condition: A magenta segment has length 3.
    action: Recolor the segment pixel(s) to yellow (4).
output_grid: Same dimensions as the input grid, containing recolored segments and preserved background pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy it directly to the corresponding position in the new grid.
4.  If the current pixel is magenta (6), identify the full contiguous horizontal segment of magenta pixels it belongs to.
5.  Determine the length of this magenta segment.
6.  Determine the output color based on the segment length:
    *   If length is 1, the output color is maroon (9).
    *   If length is 2, the output color is green (3).
    *   If length is 3, the output color is yellow (4).
7.  Fill the positions in the new grid corresponding to the entire identified magenta segment with the determined output color.
8.  Skip forward in the iteration past the segment just processed to avoid reprocessing its pixels.
9.  Continue iterating until the end of the input grid is reached.
10. The new grid is the final output.
