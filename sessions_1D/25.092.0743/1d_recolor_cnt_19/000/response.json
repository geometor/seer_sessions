The output uses white (0), maroon (9), green (3), and yellow (4).\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The white pixels (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output at the same positions.\n*   **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to target the magenta pixels (6).\n*   **Objects:** The key objects appear to be contiguous horizontal segments (runs) of magenta pixels.\n*   **Property:** The length (number of consecutive pixels) of these magenta segments seems crucial.\n*   **Color Mapping:** There's a clear mapping between the length of a magenta segment in the input and the color used to replace it in the output:\n    *   Segments of length 1 (single `6`) become maroon (`9`).\n    *   Segments of length 2 (`6 6`) become green (`3 3`).\n    *   Segments of length 3 (`6 6 6`) become yellow (`4 4 4`).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
