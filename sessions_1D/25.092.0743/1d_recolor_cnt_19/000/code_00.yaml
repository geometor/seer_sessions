task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal segments of magenta pixels based on their length.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (or effectively 1D processing if 2D)
components:
  - type: background_pixel
    color_value: 0
    color_name: white
    behavior: remains unchanged in the output.
  - type: segment
    input_color_value: 6
    input_color_name: magenta
    definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more magenta pixels.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
    behavior: Pixels within the segment are recolored in the output based on the segment's length.
relationships:
  - magenta segments are separated by one or more background (white) pixels.
transformation_rules:
  - condition: A magenta segment has length 1.
    action: Recolor the segment pixel(s) to maroon (9).
  - condition: A magenta segment has length 2.
    action: Recolor the segment pixel(s) to green (3).
  - condition: A magenta segment has length 3.
    action: Recolor the segment pixel(s) to yellow (4).
output_grid: Same dimensions as the input grid, containing recolored segments and preserved background pixels.
