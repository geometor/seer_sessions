            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Contents**: The input grids primarily consist of a white (0) background and several distinct \"objects\" composed of contiguous red (2) pixels. These objects vary in size (number of connected pixels).\n2.  **Output Grid Contents**: The output grids retain the white (0) background in the same positions. The locations previously occupied by red (2) pixels are now filled with different colors: blue (1), green (3), or orange (7).\n3.  **Transformation Observation**: The core transformation appears to be a recoloring of the red objects based on their size. The white background remains unchanged.\n4.  **Color Mapping Rule**: By comparing the input and output across the examples, a consistent pattern emerges:\n    *   Red objects consisting of a single pixel (size 1) are transformed into orange (7).\n    *   Red objects consisting of two contiguous pixels (size 2) are transformed into green (3).\n    *   Red objects consisting of three contiguous pixels (size 3) are transformed into blue (1).\n5.  **Object Definition**: An \"object\" is defined as a group of one or more red (2) pixels that are connected either horizontally or vertically (adjacent sides). Diagonal connections do not seem to constitute a single object based on the examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

For each identified red object:\n    a.  Calculate the size of the object (the number of red pixels it contains).\n    b.  Determine the target color based on the object's size:\n        *   If the size is 1, the target color is orange (7).\n        *   If the size is 2, the target color is green (3).\n        *   If the size is 3, the target color is blue (1).\n    c.
