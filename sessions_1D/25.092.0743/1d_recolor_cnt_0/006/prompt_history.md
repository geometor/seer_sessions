Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and red (2) in the input, and white (0), blue (1), azure (8), and gray (5) in the output.
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels in the input form contiguous horizontal segments of red (2). These segments vary in length.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the red segments. The background white pixels remain unchanged. The key observation is that the *new* color of a segment depends entirely on its *length* (number of contiguous red pixels).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
background_color: white (0)
input_objects:
  description: Contiguous horizontal segments of red (2) pixels.
  properties:
    - color: red (2)
    - length: variable (1, 2, or 3 pixels in examples)
    - position: unchanged between input and output
transformation_rule:
  target: input_objects (red segments)
  action: recolor based on segment length
  mapping:
    - input_length: 1
      output_color: blue (1)
    - input_length: 2
      output_color: azure (8)
    - input_length: 3
      output_color: gray (5)
  unaffected_elements: background_color (white=0) pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments consisting only of red (2) pixels within the input row.
2.  For each identified red segment:
    a.  Determine the length of the segment (number of pixels).
    b.  If the length is 1, change the color of the segment's pixel(s) to blue (1) in the output.
    c.  If the length is 2, change the color of the segment's pixels to azure (8) in the output.
    d.  If the length is 3, change the color of the segment's pixels to gray (5) in the output.
3.  All pixels that were originally white (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output at the same positions.
4.  Construct the final output row based on these color changes.
