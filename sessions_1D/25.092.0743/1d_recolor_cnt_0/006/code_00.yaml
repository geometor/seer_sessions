task_type: color_transformation_by_segment_length
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row presented within a 2D grid structure)
grid_size: Fixed width of 19 columns, height of 1 row for all examples.
background_color: white (0)
input_objects:
  description: Contiguous horizontal segments of red (2) pixels.
  properties:
    - color: red (2)
    - length: Variable (observed lengths are 1, 2, and 3 pixels).
    - location: Defined by start index and length within the row.
output_objects:
  description: Recolored segments corresponding to input red segments, based on original length.
  properties:
    - color: Depends on the length of the original red segment (1->blue(1), 2->azure(8), 3->gray(5)).
    - length: Same as the original red segment.
    - location: Same as the original red segment.
transformation_rule:
  scope: Applies only to pixels within contiguous red (2) segments.
  action: Recolor based on segment length.
  conditions:
    - If a red segment has length 1, change its color to blue (1).
    - If a red segment has length 2, change its color to azure (8).
    - If a red segment has length 3, change its color to gray (5).
  unaffected_elements: Pixels with color white (0) remain unchanged. Red segments with lengths other than 1, 2, or 3 (if they were to occur) would presumably remain red (based on lack of transformation rule).
