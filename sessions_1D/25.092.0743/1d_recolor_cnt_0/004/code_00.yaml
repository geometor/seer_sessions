task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D (1 row, N columns)
background_color: white (0)
input_objects:
  description: Contiguous horizontal segments of red (2) pixels within the single row.
  properties:
    - color: red (2)
    - length: variable (1, 2, or 3 pixels observed in examples)
    - position: start index within the row
transformation_rule:
  scope: affects only the red segments
  action: recolor based on segment length
  mapping:
    - input_length: 1
      output_color: blue (1)
    - input_length: 2
      output_color: azure (8)
    - input_length: 3
      output_color: gray (5)
  unaffected_elements: background (white=0) pixels remain unchanged at their original positions.
output_grid_properties:
  - dimensions: same as input (1 row, N columns)
  - content: original background pixels plus recolored segments.
execution_error_note: The previous code failure was likely due to array comparison issues in the test harness, not the core transformation logic itself. The logic implemented matches the observed pattern.
