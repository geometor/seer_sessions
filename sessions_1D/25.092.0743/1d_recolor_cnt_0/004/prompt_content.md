"""
Transforms the input grid by operating on its single row. It identifies contiguous
horizontal segments of red (2) pixels. Each identified red segment is then recolored
based on its length:
- Segments of length 1 are changed to blue (1).
- Segments of length 2 are changed to azure (8).
- Segments of length 3 are changed to gray (5).
Pixels that were originally white (0) and not part of a red segment remain unchanged.
The output is a 2D grid containing the single transformed row.
