These segments vary in length.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the red segments. The background white pixels remain unchanged. The key observation is that the *new* color of a segment depends entirely on its *length* (number of contiguous red pixels).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
