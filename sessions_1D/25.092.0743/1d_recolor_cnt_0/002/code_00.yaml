task_type: color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D (single row)
background_color: white (0)
input_objects:
  description: Contiguous horizontal segments of red (2) pixels within the single row of the grid.
  properties:
    - color: red (2)
    - length: variable (1, 2, or 3 pixels observed)
    - position: unchanged between input and output relative to the row
transformation_rule:
  scope: Operates on the single row of the input grid.
  target: input_objects (red segments)
  action: recolor based on segment length
  mapping:
    - input_length: 1
      output_color: blue (1)
    - input_length: 2
      output_color: azure (8)
    - input_length: 3
      output_color: gray (5)
  unaffected_elements: background_color (white=0) pixels remain unchanged.
output_structure: 2D grid containing the single transformed row.
