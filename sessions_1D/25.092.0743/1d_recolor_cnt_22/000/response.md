*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input grids consist of a single row containing white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
    *   The gray pixels form distinct, horizontally contiguous objects separated by white pixels.
    *   The output grids retain the same dimensions and the positions of the white pixels.
    *   The gray pixels in the input are replaced by other colors (blue, yellow, maroon) in the output.
    *   The color used for replacement depends on the size (number of pixels) of the contiguous gray object in the input.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row in a 2D grid)
      colors_present_input: [white, gray]
      colors_present_output: [white, blue, yellow, maroon]
      background_color: white
      input_object_color: gray
    objects:
      - type: contiguous segment of pixels
        color: gray
        properties:
          - size (number of pixels)
          - location (start and end column indices)
    actions:
      - identify gray objects (contiguous segments)
      - calculate the size of each gray object
      - map the size of each gray object to a specific output color
      - replace the pixels of each gray object with its corresponding mapped output color
    relationships:
      - The color of pixels in the output depends on the size of the contiguous gray object they belonged to in the input.
      - Size 1 maps to maroon (9).
      - Size 2 maps to yellow (4).
      - Size 3 maps to blue (1).
      - White pixels remain unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous segments (objects) of gray (5) pixels. Consider only horizontal adjacency for contiguity.
    3.  For each identified gray object:
        a.  Count the number of pixels (size) in the object.
        b.  Determine the output color based on the object's size:
            *   If size is 1, the output color is maroon (9).
            *   If size is 2, the output color is yellow (4).
            *   If size is 3, the output color is blue (1).
        c.  In the output grid, replace all pixels corresponding to the positions of the current gray object with the determined output color.
    4.  Leave all white (0) pixels unchanged.
    5.  Return the modified output grid.
