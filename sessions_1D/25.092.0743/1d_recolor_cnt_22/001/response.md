```python
import numpy as np

"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal segments of gray pixels (5) in the input grid (which is a single row).
Calculates the size (length) of each gray segment.
Replaces the gray pixels in the output grid with a new color based on the segment size:
- Size 1 becomes maroon (9).
- Size 2 becomes yellow (4).
- Size 3 becomes blue (1).
White pixels (0) remain unchanged.
