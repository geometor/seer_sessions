*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a 1D array (or potentially a 1xN grid) containing white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The output array has the same dimensions, with white pixels remaining unchanged. The gray pixels are replaced by different colors (maroon=9, blue=1, red=2) based on the characteristics of the contiguous groups they form. Specifically, the color seems to depend on the *length* of the contiguous horizontal segment of gray pixels.

*   **Facts YAML:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_representation: Assumed 1D sequence based on examples.
      input_colors: [white (0), gray (5)]
      output_colors: [white (0), blue (1), red (2), maroon (9)]
      background_color: white (0)
      transformation_type: object_recoloring_by_size

    objects:
      - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
        color: gray (5)
        properties:
          - length: number of pixels in the segment

    actions:
      - identify: find all contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels in the input.
      - measure: determine the length of each identified segment.
      - recolor: replace the pixels of each segment in the output based on its length.
      - preserve: keep white (0) pixels unchanged.

    relationships:
      - mapping:
          segment_length_1: maps_to_color_maroon (9)
          segment_length_2: maps_to_color_blue (1)
          segment_length_3: maps_to_color_red (2)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array.
    2.  Iterate through the input array from left to right.
    3.  If a gray (5) pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet:
        a.  Identify the contiguous horizontal segment of gray (5) pixels starting at this position.
        b.  Measure the length of this segment.
        c.  Determine the replacement color based on the segment length:
            *   If length is 1, the replacement color is maroon (9).
            *   If length is 2, the replacement color is blue (1).
            *   If length is 3, the replacement color is red (2).
        d.  Replace all gray (5) pixels within this segment in the output array with the determined replacement color.
        e.  Mark the pixels of this segment as processed to avoid re-evaluating them.
    4.  If a white (0) pixel is encountered, leave it unchanged in the output array.
    5.  Return the modified output array.
