The output array has the same dimensions, with white pixels remaining unchanged. The gray pixels are replaced by different colors (maroon=9, blue=1, red=2) based on the characteristics of the contiguous groups they form. Specifically, the color seems to depend on the *length* of the contiguous horizontal segment of gray pixels.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "
