            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN 2D grids). The size (length) remains constant from input to output (1x30).\n2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0) in both input and output grids, and it remains unchanged.\n3.  **Input Objects:** The input grids contain multiple \"objects\", which are contiguous horizontal blocks of orange (7) pixels. These blocks vary in size (length).\n4.  **Output Objects:** The output grids contain objects in the *same locations* and with the *same shapes/sizes* as the input orange blocks, but their colors are different.\n5.  **Color Transformation:** The key transformation seems to be a change in color of the orange blocks. Observing the examples:\n    *   In `train_1`:\n        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).\n        *   `7` (size 1) becomes `2` (red).\n        *   `7 7` (size 2) becomes `5 5` (gray).\n        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).\n        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).\n    *   In `train_2`:\n        *   `7` (size 1) becomes `2` (red).\n        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).\n        *   `7 7` (size 2) becomes `5 5` (gray).\n        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).\n        *   `7 7` (size 2) becomes `5 5` (gray).\n    *   In `train_3`:\n        *   `7` (size 1) becomes `2` (red).\n        *   `7 7` (size 2) becomes `5 5` (gray).\n        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).\n        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).\n        *   `7` (size 1) becomes `2` (red).\n6.  **Rule Derivation:** The transformation rule appears to depend solely on the *size* (number of contiguous pixels) of each orange block in the input.\n    *   Orange blocks of size 1 are transformed into red (2) blocks.\n    *   Orange blocks of size 2 are transformed into gray (5) blocks.\n    *   Orange blocks of size 3 are transformed into magenta (6) blocks.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
