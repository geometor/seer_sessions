"""
Transforms the input grid based on the size of contiguous horizontal orange (7) blocks.
- Identifies contiguous horizontal blocks of orange (7) pixels in the input grid (assumed to be 1xN).
- Determines the size (length) of each orange block.
- Replaces each orange block in the output grid with a new color based on its size:
    - Size 1: Replaced with red (2).
    - Size 2: Replaced with gray (5).
    - Size 3: Replaced with magenta (6).
- All other pixels (non-orange or orange blocks of sizes other than 1, 2, or 3) remain unchanged.
