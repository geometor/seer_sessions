Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN 2D grids). The size (length) remains constant from input to output (1x30).
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0) in both input and output grids, and it remains unchanged.
3.  **Input Objects:** The input grids contain multiple "objects", which are contiguous horizontal blocks of orange (7) pixels. These blocks vary in size (length).
4.  **Output Objects:** The output grids contain objects in the *same locations* and with the *same shapes/sizes* as the input orange blocks, but their colors are different.
5.  **Color Transformation:** The key transformation seems to be a change in color of the orange blocks. Observing the examples:
    *   In `train_1`:
        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).
        *   `7` (size 1) becomes `2` (red).
        *   `7 7` (size 2) becomes `5 5` (gray).
        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).
        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).
    *   In `train_2`:
        *   `7` (size 1) becomes `2` (red).
        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).
        *   `7 7` (size 2) becomes `5 5` (gray).
        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).
        *   `7 7` (size 2) becomes `5 5` (gray).
    *   In `train_3`:
        *   `7` (size 1) becomes `2` (red).
        *   `7 7` (size 2) becomes `5 5` (gray).
        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).
        *   `7 7 7` (size 3) becomes `6 6 6` (magenta).
        *   `7` (size 1) becomes `2` (red).
6.  **Rule Derivation:** The transformation rule appears to depend solely on the *size* (number of contiguous pixels) of each orange block in the input.
    *   Orange blocks of size 1 are transformed into red (2) blocks.
    *   Orange blocks of size 2 are transformed into gray (5) blocks.
    *   Orange blocks of size 3 are transformed into magenta (6) blocks.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimension: 1xN (effectively 1D)
    - background_color: white (0)
    - preservation: Grid dimensions and background color are preserved from input to output.
  input_elements:
    - type: object
    - definition: Contiguous horizontal blocks of orange (7) pixels.
    - properties:
        - color: orange (7)
        - size: Variable (1, 2, or 3 pixels in the examples)
        - location: Variable
        - count: Multiple per input grid.
  output_elements:
    - type: object
    - definition: Contiguous horizontal blocks of pixels corresponding to input orange blocks.
    - properties:
        - color: Variable (red (2), gray (5), or magenta (6))
        - size: Same as the corresponding input orange block.
        - location: Same as the corresponding input orange block.
        - count: Same as the number of input orange blocks.
  transformation:
    - type: color_change
    - scope: Applies only to orange (7) pixels.
    - rule: The new color depends on the size of the contiguous orange block the pixel belongs to.
    - mapping:
        - input_color: orange (7)
        - condition: block_size == 1
        - output_color: red (2)
        - condition: block_size == 2
        - output_color: gray (5)
        - condition: block_size == 3
        - output_color: magenta (6)
    - non_transformed_pixels: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous horizontal blocks (objects) composed solely of orange (7) pixels. Keep track of the starting position and the size (number of pixels) of each block.
3.  For each identified orange block:
    a.  Determine its size (count the number of pixels in the block).
    b.  Based on the size, determine the target color:
        *   If the size is 1, the target color is red (2).
        *   If the size is 2, the target color is gray (5).
        *   If the size is 3, the target color is magenta (6).
    c.  In the output grid, replace the pixels corresponding to this orange block (using its starting position and size) with the determined target color.
4.  Return the modified output grid. All non-orange pixels remain unchanged from the input.
