Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output grids are single rows (1D arrays of pixels).
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Inputs primarily use white (0) and gray (5).
    *   Outputs use white (0), blue (1), red (2), and magenta (6).
3.  **Key Transformation Element:** The transformation appears to operate on contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels in the input. White (0) pixels act as separators and remain unchanged in the output.
4.  **Object Identification:** The contiguous segments of gray pixels can be considered distinct objects.
5.  **Property Focus:** The crucial property of these gray objects seems to be their length (number of pixels).
6.  **Color Mapping:** The color of the gray segments changes in the output based on their length in the input:
    *   Gray segments of length 1 become red (2).
    *   Gray segments of length 2 become magenta (6).
    *   Gray segments of length 3 become blue (1).
7.  **Conservation:** The positions of non-white pixels are preserved from input to output. The overall grid dimensions remain the same.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Recolor horizontal segments based on their length.

Input_Features:
  - Grid_Dimensions: 1 row, variable columns (e.g., 1x29).
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Object_Color: gray (5).
  - Objects: Defined as contiguous horizontal sequences of gray (5) pixels.
  - Separator: white (0) pixels separate gray objects.

Output_Features:
  - Grid_Dimensions: Same as input.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Output_Colors: blue (1), red (2), magenta (6).
  - Transformation: Recolor input gray objects based on their properties.

Relationships:
  - Object_Property: The length (number of pixels) of a gray object determines its output color.
  - Color_Mapping:
    - Input gray (5) object of length 1 -> Output red (2) object.
    - Input gray (5) object of length 2 -> Output magenta (6) object.
    - Input gray (5) object of length 3 -> Output blue (1) object.
  - Spatial_Conservation: The positions and extent of the transformed objects remain the same as the original gray objects. White pixels remain white and in the same positions.

Assumptions:
  - Only gray pixels are transformed.
  - Only horizontal contiguity matters (as grids are 1D).
  - The lengths observed (1, 2, 3) cover all possibilities in the test cases.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally, pixel by pixel.
3.  Identify contiguous segments (objects) composed solely of gray (5) pixels. Note the starting position and length of each segment.
4.  For each identified gray segment:
    a.  Determine its length (number of pixels).
    b.  Based on the length, select the corresponding output color:
        i.  If length is 1, the output color is red (2).
        ii. If length is 2, the output color is magenta (6).
        iii.If length is 3, the output color is blue (1).
    c.  Fill the corresponding pixels in the output grid (same positions as the input gray segment) with the selected output color.
5.  Pixels in the input grid that were white (0) remain white (0) in the output grid (this is handled by the initialization and selective updating).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms the input grid by recoloring contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels based on their length.
- Segments of length 1 become red (2).
- Segments of length 2 become magenta (6).
- Segments of length 3 become blue (1).
- White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
The transformation assumes the input grid is essentially a single row (1xN dimension).
