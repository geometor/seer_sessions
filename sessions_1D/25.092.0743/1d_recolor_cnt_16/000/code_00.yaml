Task: Recolor horizontal segments based on their length.

Input_Features:
  - Grid_Dimensions: 1 row, variable columns (e.g., 1x29).
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Object_Color: gray (5).
  - Objects: Defined as contiguous horizontal sequences of gray (5) pixels.
  - Separator: white (0) pixels separate gray objects.

Output_Features:
  - Grid_Dimensions: Same as input.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Output_Colors: blue (1), red (2), magenta (6).
  - Transformation: Recolor input gray objects based on their properties.

Relationships:
  - Object_Property: The length (number of pixels) of a gray object determines its output color.
  - Color_Mapping:
    - Input gray (5) object of length 1 -> Output red (2) object.
    - Input gray (5) object of length 2 -> Output magenta (6) object.
    - Input gray (5) object of length 3 -> Output blue (1) object.
  - Spatial_Conservation: The positions and extent of the transformed objects remain the same as the original gray objects. White pixels remain white and in the same positions.

Assumptions:
  - Only gray pixels are transformed.
  - Only horizontal contiguity matters (as grids are 1D).
  - The lengths observed (1, 2, 3) cover all possibilities in the test cases.
