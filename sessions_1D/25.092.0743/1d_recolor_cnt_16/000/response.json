White (0) pixels act as separators and remain unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The contiguous segments of gray pixels can be considered distinct objects.\n5.  **Property Focus:** The crucial property of these gray objects seems to be their length (number of pixels).\n6.  **Color Mapping:** The color of the gray segments changes in the output based on their length in the input:\n    *   Gray segments of length 1 become red (2).\n    *   Gray segments of length 2 become magenta (6).\n    *   Gray segments of length 3 become blue (1).\n7.  **Conservation:** The positions of non-white pixels are preserved from input to output. The overall grid dimensions remain the same.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

White pixels remain white and in the same positions.\n\nAssumptions:\n  - Only gray pixels are transformed.\n  - Only horizontal contiguity matters (as grids are 1D).\n  - The lengths observed (1, 2, 3) cover all possibilities in the test cases.\n```"

If length is 2, the output color is magenta (6).\n        iii.If length is 3, the output color is blue (1).\n    c.  Fill the corresponding pixels in the output grid (same positions as the input gray segment) with the selected output color.\n5.  Pixels in the input grid that were white (0) remain white (0) in the output grid (this is handled by the initialization and selective updating).\n6.  Return the completed output grid."
