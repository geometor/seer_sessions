"""
Transforms the input grid by recoloring contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels based on their length.
- Segments of length 1 become red (2).
- Segments of length 2 become magenta (6).
- Segments of length 3 become blue (1).
- White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
The transformation assumes the input grid is a single row (1xN dimension) represented as a NumPy array.
