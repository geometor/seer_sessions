**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays represented as 2D). The length of the row is the same in both input and output for each example.
2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), maroon (9), orange (7), and magenta (6) pixels.
3.  **Objects:** The red (2) pixels in the input form contiguous horizontal blocks (objects). These objects vary in size: 1 pixel, 2 pixels, or 3 pixels wide.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   White (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) in the output.
    *   Red (2) pixels in the input change color in the output.
    *   The specific output color depends on the size (width) of the contiguous red object the pixel belongs to.
5.  **Pattern:**
    *   Single red pixels (1x1 objects) are transformed into orange (7).
    *   Two adjacent red pixels (1x2 objects) are transformed into maroon (9).
    *   Three adjacent red pixels (1x3 objects) are transformed into magenta (6).
    *   The position of the transformed objects remains the same as the original red objects.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 2D with height 1)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - color: red (2)
    description: Contiguous horizontal segments of red pixels.
    properties:
      - size (number of pixels in the segment)
    actions:
      - recolor: Based on the size of the segment the pixel belongs to.
relationships:
  - rule: Mapping between red segment size and output color
    details:
      - size: 1 pixel -> output_color: orange (7)
      - size: 2 pixels -> output_color: maroon (9)
      - size: 3 pixels -> output_color: magenta (6)
invariance:
  - background pixels (white) remain unchanged.
  - position and extent of objects remain unchanged (only color changes).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
3.  If a pixel is red (2):
    a.  Determine the contiguous horizontal segment of red pixels it belongs to.
    b.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of this segment.
    c.  Based on the segment size:
        i.  If the size is 1, change the color of the corresponding pixel(s) in the output grid to orange (7).
        ii. If the size is 2, change the color of the corresponding pixel(s) in the output grid to maroon (9).
        iii. If the size is 3, change the color of the corresponding pixel(s) in the output grid to magenta (6).
    d.  Ensure that each red segment is processed only once (e.g., by skipping pixels already processed as part of a segment).
4.  If a pixel is white (0), leave the corresponding pixel in the output grid unchanged (it will remain white).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
