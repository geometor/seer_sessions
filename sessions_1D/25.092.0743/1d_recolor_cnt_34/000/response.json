The length of the row is the same in both input and output for each example.\n2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), maroon (9), orange (7), and magenta (6) pixels.\n3.  **Objects:** The red (2) pixels in the input form contiguous horizontal blocks (objects). These objects vary in size: 1 pixel, 2 pixels, or 3 pixels wide.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   White (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) in the output.\n    *   Red (2) pixels in the input change color in the output.\n    *   The specific output color depends on the size (width) of the contiguous red object the pixel belongs to.\n5.  **Pattern:**\n    *   Single red pixels (1x1 objects) are transformed into orange (7).\n    *   Two adjacent red pixels (1x2 objects) are transformed into maroon (9).\n    *   Three adjacent red pixels (1x3 objects) are transformed into magenta (6).\n    *   The position of the transformed objects remains the same as the original red objects.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
