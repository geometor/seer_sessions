task_type: object_color_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 2D with height 1)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - color: red (2)
    description: Contiguous horizontal segments of red pixels.
    properties:
      - size (number of pixels in the segment)
    actions:
      - recolor: Based on the size of the segment the pixel belongs to.
relationships:
  - rule: Mapping between red segment size and output color
    details:
      - size: 1 pixel -> output_color: orange (7)
      - size: 2 pixels -> output_color: maroon (9)
      - size: 3 pixels -> output_color: magenta (6)
invariance:
  - background pixels (white) remain unchanged.
  - position and extent of objects remain unchanged (only color changes).
