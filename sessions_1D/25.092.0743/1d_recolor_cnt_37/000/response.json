            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format**: The inputs and outputs are presented as single rows (1D arrays) of numbers, representing pixel colors. All examples have a consistent length of 14 pixels.\n2.  **Color Palette**:\n    *   Inputs primarily use white (0) and yellow (4).\n    *   Outputs use white (0), red (2), orange (7), and maroon (9).\n3.  **Key Observation**: The white (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) in the output, preserving their positions. The transformation affects only the yellow (4) pixels.\n4.  **Pattern Identification**: The transformation of yellow (4) pixels depends on the *length* of the contiguous sequence (block) of yellow pixels they belong to.\n    *   A single yellow pixel (`4`) transforms into an orange pixel (`7`).\n    *   A sequence of two yellow pixels (`4 4`) transforms into two maroon pixels (`9 9`).\n    *   A sequence of three yellow pixels (`4 4 4`) transforms into three red pixels (`2 2 2`).\n5.  **Object Recognition**: The relevant \"objects\" in the input are contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow pixels and individual white pixels. The transformation rule operates based on the properties (specifically, the length) of these yellow blocks.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
