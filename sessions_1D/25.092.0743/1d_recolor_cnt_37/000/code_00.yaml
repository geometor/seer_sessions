task_description: Replace contiguous blocks of yellow pixels based on their length, keeping white pixels unchanged.

input_features:
  - type: pixel_grid
    dimensionality: 1D (row)
    colors_present: [white (0), yellow (4)]
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: yellow (4)
        properties:
          - length: varies (1, 2, or 3 in examples)
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)

output_features:
  - type: pixel_grid
    dimensionality: 1D (row)
    colors_present: [white (0), red (2), orange (7), maroon (9)]
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: red (2)
        derived_from: yellow block of length 3
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: orange (7)
        derived_from: yellow block of length 1
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: maroon (9)
        derived_from: yellow block of length 2
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)
        derived_from: white pixel (unchanged)

transformation_rules:
  - input_object: white (0) pixel
    action: keep unchanged
    output_object: white (0) pixel
  - input_object: contiguous block of yellow (4) pixels
    action: replace based on length
    conditions:
      - if length == 1:
          replace_with: block of orange (7) pixels of same length
      - if length == 2:
          replace_with: block of maroon (9) pixels of same length
      - if length == 3:
          replace_with: block of red (2) pixels of same length

relationships:
  - The color of the output block replacing a yellow input block is determined solely by the length of that yellow input block.
  - The position and number of white pixels remain constant between input and output.
  - The total length of the row remains constant.
