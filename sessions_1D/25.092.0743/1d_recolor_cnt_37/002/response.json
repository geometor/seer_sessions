            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: replacing contiguous blocks of yellow (4) pixels based on their length (1 -> 7, 2 -> 9, 3 -> 2), while leaving white (0) pixels unchanged. The Python code implemented this logic.\n\nHowever, the execution failed with a NumPy-specific error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.\" This strongly suggests that the `transform` function received a 2D NumPy array (likely 1xN, representing a single row grid) as input, rather than the assumed 1D Python list. When the code attempted `if input_grid[i] == 4:`, `input_grid[i]` accessed a whole row (if `i=0`), leading to an element-wise comparison (`[row_data] == 4`) resulting in a boolean array. Using this boolean array directly in an `if` condition causes the error.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the code to explicitly handle a 1xN NumPy array input, accessing elements correctly (e.g., `input_grid[0, i]`) and determining the grid width from the array's shape.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nWe don't need code execution to diagnose this specific error, as it points directly to a data type mismatch (using a NumPy array where a single boolean is expected). The error occurred consistently across all three examples, confirming the issue is fundamental to how the input is processed, not specific to a particular data pattern within the examples.\n\n*   **Input Data Type Assumption:** The initial code assumed `input_grid` was a 1D list.\n*   **Actual Input Data Type (Inferred):** The error indicates `input_grid` was likely a 2D NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[0, 0, ...]])`).\n*   **Code Point of Failure:** `if input_grid[i] == 4:` (and potentially the similar check in `find_yellow_block_length`) and potentially `len(input_grid)` and `output_grid = list(input_grid)`.\n*   **Resolution:** Access elements using 2D indexing (`grid[0, i]`), get length via `.shape[1]`, and initialize the output array correctly. Ensure the output format matches the examples (1D list).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
