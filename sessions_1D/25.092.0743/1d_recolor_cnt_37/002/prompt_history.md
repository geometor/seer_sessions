Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format**: The inputs and outputs are presented as single rows (1D arrays) of numbers, representing pixel colors. All examples have a consistent length of 14 pixels.
2.  **Color Palette**:
    *   Inputs primarily use white (0) and yellow (4).
    *   Outputs use white (0), red (2), orange (7), and maroon (9).
3.  **Key Observation**: The white (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) in the output, preserving their positions. The transformation affects only the yellow (4) pixels.
4.  **Pattern Identification**: The transformation of yellow (4) pixels depends on the *length* of the contiguous sequence (block) of yellow pixels they belong to.
    *   A single yellow pixel (`4`) transforms into an orange pixel (`7`).
    *   A sequence of two yellow pixels (`4 4`) transforms into two maroon pixels (`9 9`).
    *   A sequence of three yellow pixels (`4 4 4`) transforms into three red pixels (`2 2 2`).
5.  **Object Recognition**: The relevant "objects" in the input are contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow pixels and individual white pixels. The transformation rule operates based on the properties (specifically, the length) of these yellow blocks.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Replace contiguous blocks of yellow pixels based on their length, keeping white pixels unchanged.

input_features:
  - type: pixel_grid
    dimensionality: 1D (row)
    colors_present: [white (0), yellow (4)]
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: yellow (4)
        properties:
          - length: varies (1, 2, or 3 in examples)
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)

output_features:
  - type: pixel_grid
    dimensionality: 1D (row)
    colors_present: [white (0), red (2), orange (7), maroon (9)]
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: red (2)
        derived_from: yellow block of length 3
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: orange (7)
        derived_from: yellow block of length 1
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: maroon (9)
        derived_from: yellow block of length 2
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)
        derived_from: white pixel (unchanged)

transformation_rules:
  - input_object: white (0) pixel
    action: keep unchanged
    output_object: white (0) pixel
  - input_object: contiguous block of yellow (4) pixels
    action: replace based on length
    conditions:
      - if length == 1:
          replace_with: block of orange (7) pixels of same length
      - if length == 2:
          replace_with: block of maroon (9) pixels of same length
      - if length == 3:
          replace_with: block of red (2) pixels of same length

relationships:
  - The color of the output block replacing a yellow input block is determined solely by the length of that yellow input block.
  - The position and number of white pixels remain constant between input and output.
  - The total length of the row remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output row with the same length as the input row.
2.  Iterate through the input row from left to right.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output row.
4.  If the current pixel is yellow (4):
    a.  Determine the length of the contiguous block of yellow pixels starting at the current position.
    b.  Based on the length of this block:
        i.  If the length is 1, fill the corresponding position(s) in the output row with orange (7).
        ii. If the length is 2, fill the corresponding position(s) in the output row with maroon (9).
        iii.If the length is 3, fill the corresponding position(s) in the output row with red (2).
    c.  Advance the iteration index past the identified yellow block.
5.  Return the completed output row.
