task_description: Replace contiguous blocks of yellow pixels in a single-row grid based on their length, keeping white pixels unchanged. Input is likely provided as a 1xN 2D NumPy array.

input_features:
  - type: pixel_grid
    dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN)
    representation: NumPy array
    colors_present: [white (0), yellow (4)]
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
        color: yellow (4)
        properties:
          - length: varies (1, 2, or 3 in examples)
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)

output_features:
  - type: pixel_grid
    dimensionality: 1D (row)
    representation: List or 1D NumPy array (examples show 1D list-like structure)
    colors_present: [white (0), red (2), orange (7), maroon (9)]
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
        color: red (2)
        derived_from: yellow block of length 3
      - type: contiguous_horizontal_block # Changed from pixel to block for consistency
        color: orange (7)
        derived_from: yellow block of length 1
      - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
        color: maroon (9)
        derived_from: yellow block of length 2
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)
        derived_from: white pixel (unchanged)

transformation_rules:
  - input_condition: Pixel at (0, i) is white (0).
    action: Copy white (0) to output position i.
    index_update: Advance processing index i by 1.
  - input_condition: Pixel at (0, i) is yellow (4).
    action:
      1. Determine length (`L`) of the contiguous horizontal block of yellow (4) starting at (0, i).
      2. Determine replacement color based on `L`:
         - If L=1, color=orange (7).
         - If L=2, color=maroon (9).
         - If L=3, color=red (2).
         - (Assume other lengths don't occur based on examples).
      3. Fill output positions i to i+L-1 with the determined replacement color.
    index_update: Advance processing index i by `L`.

relationships:
  - The color of the output block replacing a yellow input block is determined solely by the length of that yellow input block.
  - The position and number of white pixels remain constant between input and output.
  - The grid width remains constant.
  - Input format is likely 1xN NumPy array, output format should be 1D list or array.
