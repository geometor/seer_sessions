task_description: "Transform contiguous horizontal runs of yellow pixels based on their length."
elements:
  - element: background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
    properties:
      - unchanged in the output
      - acts as a separator
  - element: object
    color_name: yellow
    color_value: 4
    properties:
      - forms contiguous horizontal runs (sequences)
      - these runs are the primary units being transformed
      - the transformation depends on the length of the run
relationships:
  - relation: transformation_rule
    applies_to: yellow runs
    details:
      - if length(run) == 1: replace yellow (4) with azure (8)
      - if length(run) == 2: replace yellow (4) with red (2)
      - if length(run) == 3: replace yellow (4) with magenta (6)
    preserves:
      - length of the run
      - position of the run
      - surrounding white pixels
