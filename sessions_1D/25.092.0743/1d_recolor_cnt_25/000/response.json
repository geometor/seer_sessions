These yellow pixels are transformed into different colors in the output.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The yellow pixels form contiguous horizontal groups (runs). These runs seem to be the primary objects being manipulated.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation rule appears to depend on the *length* of the contiguous run of yellow pixels:\n    *   A run of one yellow pixel (`4`) becomes one azure pixel (`8`). (Example 1, 2, 3)\n    *   A run of two yellow pixels (`4 4`) becomes two red pixels (`2 2`). (Example 1, 2, 3)\n    *   A run of three yellow pixels (`4 4 4`) becomes three magenta pixels (`6 6 6`). (Example 1, 2, 3)\n6.  **Preservation:** The positions and lengths of the runs are preserved; only the color changes based on the length. White pixels remain in their original positions.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the start of a contiguous sequence (run) of yellow pixels (color `4`).\n4.  Measure the length of this yellow run.\n5.  Determine the replacement color based on the run's length:\n    *   If the length is 1, the replacement color is azure (`8`).\n    *   If the length is 2, the replacement color is red (`2`).\n    *   If the length is 3, the replacement color is magenta (`6`).\n6.  Replace all yellow pixels within that identified run in the output grid with the determined replacement color.\n7.  Continue iterating through the grid from the position immediately after the identified run, skipping over the pixels already processed as part of that run.\n8.  Leave all non-yellow pixels (specifically white, `0`) unchanged in the output grid.\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
