task_description: "Transform contiguous horizontal runs of yellow pixels within a single-row grid based on their length."
grid_properties:
  - input_shape: 1 row, N columns (represented as a 2D NumPy array)
  - output_shape: Same as input (1 row, N columns)
elements:
  - element: background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
    properties:
      - located in the first row
      - unchanged in the output
      - acts as a separator between yellow runs
  - element: object_run
    color_name: yellow
    color_value: 4
    properties:
      - forms contiguous horizontal sequences (runs) in the first row
      - these runs are the primary units being transformed
      - the transformation depends solely on the length of the run
relationships:
  - relation: transformation_rule
    applies_to: yellow runs in the first row
    details:
      - find contiguous horizontal runs of yellow (4) pixels.
      - measure the length of each run.
      - replace the pixels in the run with a new color based on length:
        - if length(run) == 1: replace yellow (4) with azure (8)
        - if length(run) == 2: replace yellow (4) with red (2)
        - if length(run) == 3: replace yellow (4) with magenta (6)
    preserves:
      - length of the run (number of pixels)
      - position of the run within the row
      - surrounding white (0) pixels
