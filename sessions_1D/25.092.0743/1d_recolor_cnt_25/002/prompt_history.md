Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional arrays (or single-row grids) of pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Background Color:** The white pixel (`0`) appears to act as a background or separator and remains unchanged in the output.
3.  **Active Color:** The yellow pixel (`4`) is the only color other than white in the inputs. These yellow pixels are transformed into different colors in the output.
4.  **Object Identification:** The yellow pixels form contiguous horizontal groups (runs). These runs seem to be the primary objects being manipulated.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation rule appears to depend on the *length* of the contiguous run of yellow pixels:
    *   A run of one yellow pixel (`4`) becomes one azure pixel (`8`). (Example 1, 2, 3)
    *   A run of two yellow pixels (`4 4`) becomes two red pixels (`2 2`). (Example 1, 2, 3)
    *   A run of three yellow pixels (`4 4 4`) becomes three magenta pixels (`6 6 6`). (Example 1, 2, 3)
6.  **Preservation:** The positions and lengths of the runs are preserved; only the color changes based on the length. White pixels remain in their original positions.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Transform contiguous horizontal runs of yellow pixels based on their length."
elements:
  - element: background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
    properties:
      - unchanged in the output
      - acts as a separator
  - element: object
    color_name: yellow
    color_value: 4
    properties:
      - forms contiguous horizontal runs (sequences)
      - these runs are the primary units being transformed
      - the transformation depends on the length of the run
relationships:
  - relation: transformation_rule
    applies_to: yellow runs
    details:
      - if length(run) == 1: replace yellow (4) with azure (8)
      - if length(run) == 2: replace yellow (4) with red (2)
      - if length(run) == 3: replace yellow (4) with magenta (6)
    preserves:
      - length of the run
      - position of the run
      - surrounding white pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally, from left to right.
3.  Identify the start of a contiguous sequence (run) of yellow pixels (color `4`).
4.  Measure the length of this yellow run.
5.  Determine the replacement color based on the run's length:
    *   If the length is 1, the replacement color is azure (`8`).
    *   If the length is 2, the replacement color is red (`2`).
    *   If the length is 3, the replacement color is magenta (`6`).
6.  Replace all yellow pixels within that identified run in the output grid with the determined replacement color.
7.  Continue iterating through the grid from the position immediately after the identified run, skipping over the pixels already processed as part of that run.
8.  Leave all non-yellow pixels (specifically white, `0`) unchanged in the output grid.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
"""
Transforms a 1D grid by changing the color of contiguous horizontal runs of yellow (4) pixels based on their length.
- Runs of length 1 become azure (8).
- Runs of length 2 become red (2).
- Runs of length 3 become magenta (6).
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
