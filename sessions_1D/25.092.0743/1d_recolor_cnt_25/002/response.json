            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D Python list, while the testing environment likely provides a 2D NumPy array, even if the grid only has one row. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" often arises when NumPy arrays are used in boolean contexts improperly, but in this specific case, it strongly suggests the input structure was misinterpreted.\n\nThe core logic of identifying horizontal runs of yellow (4) and replacing them based on length (1->8, 2->2, 3->6) appears correct based on the visual examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input structure (assume 2D NumPy array).\n2.  Modify the code to correctly handle 2D NumPy array indexing, focusing processing on the first (and likely only) row.\n3.  Ensure the output format matches the input format (2D NumPy array).\n4.  Update the documentation (facts and natural language program) to reflect this understanding.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nSince I cannot directly execute code against the specific test harness environment data types, I will simulate based on the assumption that the inputs are 1xN NumPy arrays.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input: `[[0 0 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 0]]` (Shape: 1x13)\n*   Output: `[[0 0 6 6 6 0 0 2 2 0 0 8 0]]`\n*   Yellow Runs: Length 3 (indices 2-4), Length 2 (indices 7-8), Length 1 (index 11)\n*   Transformations: 444 -> 666, 44 -> 22, 4 -> 8\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input: `[[0 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 4 0 4 0 0]]` (Shape: 1x13)\n*   Output: `[[0 6 6 6 0 0 0 2 2 0 8 0 0]]`\n*   Yellow Runs: Length 3 (indices 1-3), Length 2 (indices 7-8), Length 1 (index 10)\n*   Transformations: 444 -> 666, 44 -> 22, 4 -> 8\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input: `[[0 0 4 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 4]]` (Shape: 1x13)\n*   Output: `[[0 0 8 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 6 6 6]]`\n*   Yellow Runs: Length 1 (index 2), Length 2 (indices 6-7), Length 3 (indices 10-12)\n*   Transformations: 4 -> 8, 44 -> 22, 444 -> 666\n\nThe transformation logic based on run length consistently applies across all examples. The primary issue was the data structure handling.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Calculate the `run_length` (`j - i`).\n    c.  Look up the `replacement_color` using the `run_length` in the defined mapping. If the length is not found in the mapping (e.g., length > 3), keep the original yellow color (this case isn't shown in examples but handles potential edge cases).\n    d.  In the *output grid's first row*, replace the pixels from index `i` to `j-1` with the `replacement_color`.\n    e.  Advance the main iteration index `i` to `j` to continue searching after the processed run.\n7.  If the pixel at `input_grid[0, i]` is not yellow:\n    a.  Leave the corresponding pixel in the output grid unchanged.\n    b.  Increment the main iteration index `i` by 1.\n8.  Continue iterating until all columns in the first row have been processed.\n9.  Return the modified output grid (which is a 2D NumPy array)."
