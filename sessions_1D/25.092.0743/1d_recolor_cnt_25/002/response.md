## Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D Python list, while the testing environment likely provides a 2D NumPy array, even if the grid only has one row. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" often arises when NumPy arrays are used in boolean contexts improperly, but in this specific case, it strongly suggests the input structure was misinterpreted.

The core logic of identifying horizontal runs of yellow (4) and replacing them based on length (1->8, 2->2, 3->6) appears correct based on the visual examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input structure (assume 2D NumPy array).
2.  Modify the code to correctly handle 2D NumPy array indexing, focusing processing on the first (and likely only) row.
3.  Ensure the output format matches the input format (2D NumPy array).
4.  Update the documentation (facts and natural language program) to reflect this understanding.

## Metrics and Observations

Since I cannot directly execute code against the specific test harness environment data types, I will simulate based on the assumption that the inputs are 1xN NumPy arrays.

**Example 1:**
*   Input: `[[0 0 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 0]]` (Shape: 1x13)
*   Output: `[[0 0 6 6 6 0 0 2 2 0 0 8 0]]`
*   Yellow Runs: Length 3 (indices 2-4), Length 2 (indices 7-8), Length 1 (index 11)
*   Transformations: 444 -> 666, 44 -> 22, 4 -> 8

**Example 2:**
*   Input: `[[0 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 4 0 4 0 0]]` (Shape: 1x13)
*   Output: `[[0 6 6 6 0 0 0 2 2 0 8 0 0]]`
*   Yellow Runs: Length 3 (indices 1-3), Length 2 (indices 7-8), Length 1 (index 10)
*   Transformations: 444 -> 666, 44 -> 22, 4 -> 8

**Example 3:**
*   Input: `[[0 0 4 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 4]]` (Shape: 1x13)
*   Output: `[[0 0 8 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 6 6 6]]`
*   Yellow Runs: Length 1 (index 2), Length 2 (indices 6-7), Length 3 (indices 10-12)
*   Transformations: 4 -> 8, 44 -> 22, 444 -> 666

The transformation logic based on run length consistently applies across all examples. The primary issue was the data structure handling.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: "Transform contiguous horizontal runs of yellow pixels within a single-row grid based on their length."
grid_properties:
  - input_shape: 1 row, N columns (represented as a 2D NumPy array)
  - output_shape: Same as input (1 row, N columns)
elements:
  - element: background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
    properties:
      - located in the first row
      - unchanged in the output
      - acts as a separator between yellow runs
  - element: object_run
    color_name: yellow
    color_value: 4
    properties:
      - forms contiguous horizontal sequences (runs) in the first row
      - these runs are the primary units being transformed
      - the transformation depends solely on the length of the run
relationships:
  - relation: transformation_rule
    applies_to: yellow runs in the first row
    details:
      - find contiguous horizontal runs of yellow (4) pixels.
      - measure the length of each run.
      - replace the pixels in the run with a new color based on length:
        - if length(run) == 1: replace yellow (4) with azure (8)
        - if length(run) == 2: replace yellow (4) with red (2)
        - if length(run) == 3: replace yellow (4) with magenta (6)
    preserves:
      - length of the run (number of pixels)
      - position of the run within the row
      - surrounding white (0) pixels
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, expected to be a 2D NumPy array with one row.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Define the mapping for run length to replacement color: {1: 8, 2: 2, 3: 6}.
4.  Iterate through the columns of the *first row* of the input grid, from left to right, using an index `i`.
5.  Check if the pixel at `input_grid[0, i]` is yellow (4).
6.  If it is yellow:
    a.  Determine the end index `j` of the contiguous horizontal run of yellow pixels starting at `i`.
    b.  Calculate the `run_length` (`j - i`).
    c.  Look up the `replacement_color` using the `run_length` in the defined mapping. If the length is not found in the mapping (e.g., length > 3), keep the original yellow color (this case isn't shown in examples but handles potential edge cases).
    d.  In the *output grid's first row*, replace the pixels from index `i` to `j-1` with the `replacement_color`.
    e.  Advance the main iteration index `i` to `j` to continue searching after the processed run.
7.  If the pixel at `input_grid[0, i]` is not yellow:
    a.  Leave the corresponding pixel in the output grid unchanged.
    b.  Increment the main iteration index `i` by 1.
8.  Continue iterating until all columns in the first row have been processed.
9.  Return the modified output grid (which is a 2D NumPy array).
