Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are consistently 1x16 arrays (single rows).
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Input grids primarily use White (0) and Red (2).
    *   Output grids use White (0), Blue (1), Azure (8), and Maroon (9). The Red (2) pixels from the input are replaced.
3.  **Background Preservation:** White (0) pixels in the input remain White (0) in the output in the same positions.
4.  **Object Identification:** The core objects undergoing transformation are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of Red (2) pixels.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation seems to depend on the *length* of these contiguous Red blocks.
    *   A Red block of length 1 is transformed into a Maroon (9) block of length 1.
    *   A Red block of length 2 is transformed into a Blue (1) block of length 2.
    *   A Red block of length 3 is transformed into an Azure (8) block of length 3.
6.  **Transformation Scope:** Only the Red (2) pixels are changed; their color is determined by the properties (length) of the contiguous block they belong to. The size and position of the block remain the same, only the color changes.

## Facts

  - input: [White (0), Red (2)]
  - output: [White (0), Blue (1), Azure (8), Maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: pixel_segment
    color: Red (2)
    properties:
      - length: The number of contiguous Red pixels horizontally.
      - orientation: horizontal
actions:
  - name: map_color_by_length
    input_object: Red (2) pixel_segment
    output_object: pixel_segment of the same length and position
    rule: |
      The output color depends on the length of the input Red segment:
      - Length 1 -> Maroon (9)
      - Length 2 -> Blue (1)
      - Length 3 -> Azure (8)
  - name: preserve_color
    input_color: White (0)
    output_color: White (0)
    rule: Pixels with this color remain unchanged.
relationships:
  - type: positional_invariance
    description: White pixels retain their original positions. Transformed blocks retain their original positions and lengths.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (1x16).
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally.
3.  If the current pixel is White (0), copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output grid.
4.  If the current pixel is Red (2):
    a.  Determine the length of the contiguous horizontal block of Red (2) pixels starting at the current position.
    b.  Based on the determined length, choose the output color:
        *   If the length is 1, the output color is Maroon (9).
        *   If the length is 2, the output color is Blue (1).
        *   If the length is 3, the output color is Azure (8).
    c.  Fill the corresponding segment in the output grid (same starting position and length as the identified Red block) with the chosen output color.
    d.  Advance the iteration past the identified Red block.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
