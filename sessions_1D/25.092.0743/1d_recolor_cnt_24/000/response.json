The Red (2) pixels from the input are replaced.\n3.  **Background Preservation:** White (0) pixels in the input remain White (0) in the output in the same positions.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The core objects undergoing transformation are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of Red (2) pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation seems to depend on the *length* of these contiguous Red blocks.\n    *   A Red block of length 1 is transformed into a Maroon (9) block of length 1.\n    *   A Red block of length 2 is transformed into a Blue (1) block of length 2.\n    *   A Red block of length 3 is transformed into an Azure (8) block of length 3.\n6.  **Transformation Scope:** Only the Red (2) pixels are changed; their color is determined by the properties (length) of the contiguous block they belong to. The size and position of the block remain the same, only the color changes.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
