task_description: Transform pixels based on the length of contiguous horizontal blocks of a specific color.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  - input_size: 1x16
  - output_size: 1x16
color_palette:
  - input: [White (0), Red (2)]
  - output: [White (0), Blue (1), Azure (8), Maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: pixel_segment
    color: Red (2)
    properties:
      - length: The number of contiguous Red pixels horizontally.
      - orientation: horizontal
actions:
  - name: map_color_by_length
    input_object: Red (2) pixel_segment
    output_object: pixel_segment of the same length and position
    rule: |
      The output color depends on the length of the input Red segment:
      - Length 1 -> Maroon (9)
      - Length 2 -> Blue (1)
      - Length 3 -> Azure (8)
  - name: preserve_color
    input_color: White (0)
    output_color: White (0)
    rule: Pixels with this color remain unchanged.
relationships:
  - type: positional_invariance
    description: White pixels retain their original positions. Transformed blocks retain their original positions and lengths.
