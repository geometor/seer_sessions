**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays).
2.  **Color Palette**:
    *   Input uses white (0) and yellow (4).
    *   Output uses white (0), gray (5), orange (7), and maroon (9).
3.  **Transformation Focus**: The transformation acts exclusively on the yellow (4) pixels. White (0) pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color.
4.  **Object Identification**: The key objects in the input are contiguous horizontal blocks (sequences) of yellow (4) pixels, separated by white (0) pixels.
5.  **Pattern Recognition**: The color of the pixels in the output grid depends on the *length* of the contiguous block of yellow pixels they belonged to in the input grid.
    *   A block of one yellow pixel (`[4]`) transforms into one maroon pixel (`[9]`).
    *   A block of two yellow pixels (`[4, 4]`) transforms into two gray pixels (`[5, 5]`).
    *   A block of three yellow pixels (`[4, 4, 4]`) transforms into three orange pixels (`[7, 7, 7]`).
6.  **Consistency**: This length-to-color mapping rule is consistent across all provided training examples. The size and position of the transformed blocks remain the same as the original yellow blocks.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous blocks of yellow pixels based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    input_color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - length: integer (count of pixels in the block)
    output_colors:
      - condition: length == 1
        color: maroon (9)
      - condition: length == 2
        color: gray (5)
      - condition: length == 3
        color: orange (7)
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    action: remains unchanged
transformation:
  - action: identify_blocks
    target: yellow (4) pixels
    grouping: contiguous horizontal sequence
  - action: measure_length
    target: identified yellow blocks
  - action: recolor_block
    source: yellow block
    target: output block (same position and size)
    rule: apply output color based on measured length (1->9, 2->5, 3->7)
  - action: preserve_pixels
    target: white (0) pixels
relationships:
  - The output color of a pixel depends on the length of the contiguous block of yellow pixels it belonged to in the input.
  - White pixels act as separators and are unaffected by the transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid identical in size to the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy it directly to the corresponding position in the output grid.
4.  If the current pixel is yellow (4), identify the full contiguous block (sequence) of yellow pixels it belongs to.
5.  Determine the length (number of pixels) of this yellow block.
6.  Based on the length of the block:
    *   If the length is 1, change the color of all pixels in this block to maroon (9) in the output grid.
    *   If the length is 2, change the color of all pixels in this block to gray (5) in the output grid.
    *   If the length is 3, change the color of all pixels in this block to orange (7) in the output grid.
7.  Continue iterating through the input grid, skipping over the yellow pixels that were already processed as part of a block, until the end of the grid is reached.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
