task_description: Recolor contiguous blocks of yellow pixels based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - type: 1D array (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    input_color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - length: integer (count of pixels in the block)
    output_colors:
      - condition: length == 1
        color: maroon (9)
      - condition: length == 2
        color: gray (5)
      - condition: length == 3
        color: orange (7)
  - type: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    action: remains unchanged
transformation:
  - action: identify_blocks
    target: yellow (4) pixels
    grouping: contiguous horizontal sequence
  - action: measure_length
    target: identified yellow blocks
  - action: recolor_block
    source: yellow block
    target: output block (same position and size)
    rule: apply output color based on measured length (1->9, 2->5, 3->7)
  - action: preserve_pixels
    target: white (0) pixels
relationships:
  - The output color of a pixel depends on the length of the contiguous block of yellow pixels it belonged to in the input.
  - White pixels act as separators and are unaffected by the transformation.
