White (0) pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color.\n4.  **Object Identification**: The key objects in the input are contiguous horizontal blocks (sequences) of yellow (4) pixels, separated by white (0) pixels.\n5.  **Pattern Recognition**: The color of the pixels in the output grid depends on the *length* of the contiguous block of yellow pixels they belonged to in the input grid.\n    *   A block of one yellow pixel (`[4]`) transforms into one maroon pixel (`[9]`).\n    *   A block of two yellow pixels (`[4, 4]`) transforms into two gray pixels (`[5, 5]`).\n    *   A block of three yellow pixels (`[4, 4, 4]`) transforms into three orange pixels (`[7, 7, 7]`).\n6.  **Consistency**: This length-to-color mapping rule is consistent across all provided training examples. The size and position of the transformed blocks remain the same as the original yellow blocks.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
