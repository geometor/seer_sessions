The azure pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of varying lengths, separated by white pixels. The output grids retain the same dimensions and the positions of the white pixels. The azure pixels in the input are replaced by other colors in the output. The replacement color depends solely on the length of the contiguous segment of azure pixels the pixel belongs to.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Segments of length 1 (single azure pixel) are replaced with maroon (9).\n- Segments of length 2 are replaced with green (3).\n- Segments of length 3 are replaced with red (2).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
