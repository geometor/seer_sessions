**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 1-dimensional grid (represented as a 1xN array). The input grids contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The azure pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of varying lengths, separated by white pixels. The output grids retain the same dimensions and the positions of the white pixels. The azure pixels in the input are replaced by other colors in the output. The replacement color depends solely on the length of the contiguous segment of azure pixels the pixel belongs to.

Specifically:
- Segments of length 1 (single azure pixel) are replaced with maroon (9).
- Segments of length 2 are replaced with green (3).
- Segments of length 3 are replaced with red (2).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Replace contiguous segments of azure pixels with different colors based on the segment's length.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  input_colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
  output_colors: [white (0), red (2), green (3), maroon (9)]
  background_color: white (0)
  background_preservation: True
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    input_color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - length: number of pixels in the segment
    relationship_to_output: Each pixel within an input segment is replaced by a new color determined by the segment's length.
transformation_rule:
  - condition: Input pixel is azure (8) and part of a segment of length 1.
    action: Change pixel color to maroon (9).
  - condition: Input pixel is azure (8) and part of a segment of length 2.
    action: Change pixel color to green (3).
  - condition: Input pixel is azure (8) and part of a segment of length 3.
    action: Change pixel color to red (2).
  - condition: Input pixel is white (0).
    action: Keep pixel color white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through the input grid to identify contiguous horizontal segments of azure (8) pixels. Keep track of the start position, end position, and length of each segment.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  For each identified azure segment in the input grid:
    *   Determine the length of the segment.
    *   If the length is 1, fill the corresponding position(s) in the output grid with maroon (9).
    *   If the length is 2, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with green (3).
    *   If the length is 3, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with red (2).
4.  Ensure all positions in the output grid corresponding to white (0) pixels in the input grid remain white (0).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
