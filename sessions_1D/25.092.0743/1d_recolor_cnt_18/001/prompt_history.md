Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids maintain the same dimensions (5x5 in all examples).
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0) and remains unchanged in the output.
3.  **Active Color:** The input grids feature objects composed solely of azure (8) pixels.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects the azure (8) pixels.
5.  **Object Identification:** The azure pixels form distinct, contiguous groups (objects). Contiguity appears to be based on side-by-side adjacency (not diagonal).
6.  **Output Colors:** The output grids replace the azure pixels with blue (1), green (3), or orange (7).
7.  **Pattern:** There's a clear correlation between the *size* (number of pixels) of an azure object in the input and the color it becomes in the output.
    *   An azure object of size 1 becomes orange (7).
    *   An azure object of size 2 becomes green (3).
    *   An azure object of size 3 becomes blue (1).
8.  **Object Integrity:** The shape and position of the original azure objects are preserved; only their color changes.

## Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  - dimensions: constant between input and output.
  - background_color: white (0), remains unchanged.
Objects:
  - type: contiguous groups of pixels.
  - input_color: azure (8).
  - properties:
    - size: number of pixels in the group.
    - shape: spatial arrangement of pixels.
    - position: location within the grid.
Transformation:
  - action: recolor azure (8) objects based on their size.
  - scope: only affects azure (8) pixels.
  - rules:
    - if size == 1: change color to orange (7).
    - if size == 2: change color to green (3).
    - if size == 3: change color to blue (1).
  - preservation: shape, position, and background pixels are preserved.
Relationships:
  - size_to_color_mapping: defines the output color based on the input object's size.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. (Consider pixels adjacent horizontally or vertically as part of the same object).
3.  For each identified azure object:
    a.  Calculate its size (the total number of azure pixels it contains).
    b.  Determine the replacement color based on the object's size:
        *   If the size is 1, the replacement color is orange (7).
        *   If the size is 2, the replacement color is green (3).
        *   If the size is 3, the replacement color is blue (1).
    c.  In the output grid, change the color of all pixels belonging to this object to the determined replacement color.
4.  Leave all non-azure (white, 0) pixels unchanged in the output grid.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
