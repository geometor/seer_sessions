Grid:
  - dimensions: constant between input and output.
  - background_color: white (0), remains unchanged.
Objects:
  - type: contiguous groups of pixels.
  - input_color: azure (8).
  - properties:
    - size: number of pixels in the group.
    - shape: spatial arrangement of pixels.
    - position: location within the grid.
Transformation:
  - action: recolor azure (8) objects based on their size.
  - scope: only affects azure (8) pixels.
  - rules:
    - if size == 1: change color to orange (7).
    - if size == 2: change color to green (3).
    - if size == 3: change color to blue (1).
  - preservation: shape, position, and background pixels are preserved.
Relationships:
  - size_to_color_mapping: defines the output color based on the input object's size.
