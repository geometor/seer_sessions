Contiguity appears to be based on side-by-side adjacency (not diagonal).\n6.  **Output Colors:** The output grids replace the azure pixels with blue (1), green (3), or orange (7).\n7.  **Pattern:** There's a clear correlation between the *size* (number of pixels) of an azure object in the input and the color it becomes in the output.\n    *   An azure object of size 1 becomes orange (7).\n    *   An azure object of size 2 becomes green (3).\n    *   An azure object of size 3 becomes blue (1).\n8.  **Object Integrity:** The shape and position of the original azure objects are preserved; only their color changes.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
