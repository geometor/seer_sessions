```python
"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by identifying contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) 
of gray (5) pixels. The gray pixels within each block are replaced with a new 
color based on the block's length:
- Length 1: Replaced with yellow (4)
- Length 2: Replaced with blue (1)
- Length 3: Replaced with green (3)
Pixels of other colors (specifically white (0) in the examples) remain unchanged. 
Gray blocks with lengths other than 1, 2, or 3 also remain unchanged (gray, 5).
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
