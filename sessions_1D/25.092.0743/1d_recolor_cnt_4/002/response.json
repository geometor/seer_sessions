            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed across all training examples with the same error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array is used in a boolean context (like an `if` statement) where a single `True` or `False` value is expected. While the provided code attempts input validation *before* explicitly creating a NumPy array within the main logic, it's possible that:\n\n1.  The test environment passes the input grids as NumPy arrays rather than standard Python lists of lists, causing the initial validation check (`if not input_grid_nested[0]`) to operate on a NumPy array, thus triggering the error.\n2.  There's another location in the code (perhaps implicitly through operations) where this condition arises, although it's less likely given the simplicity of the logic.\n\nThe core transformation logic (identifying gray blocks and mapping their length to a specific color) appears sound based on the initial analysis and the examples themselves. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Verify the Core Logic:** Use code execution to meticulously analyze each example, confirming the dimensions, the locations and lengths of gray blocks, and the corresponding output colors.\n2.  **Refine Input Handling:** Adjust the natural language program (and subsequently the code) to be more robust regarding the input type (list of lists vs. NumPy array) and to ensure boolean checks are performed correctly, avoiding the ambiguity error. Assume the core task logic (mapping block length to color) is correct and focus on implementation details.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the confirmed logic and necessary refinements.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
