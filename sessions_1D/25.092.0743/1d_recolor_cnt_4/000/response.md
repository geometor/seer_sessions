Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and develop the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples use 1-dimensional grids (single rows). The width varies, but the height is always 1.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Input grids contain only white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
    *   Output grids contain white (0), blue (1), green (3), and yellow (4) pixels. White pixels in the input remain white in the output. Gray pixels in the input are replaced by other colors in the output.
3.  **Objects:** The primary objects of interest are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves identifying these gray blocks, determining their length (size), and replacing the gray pixels within each block with a new color based solely on the block's length.
5.  **Color Mapping Rule:** Based on the examples, the mapping from gray block length to output color is:
    *   Length 1 -> Yellow (4)
    *   Length 2 -> Blue (1)
    *   Length 3 -> Green (3)
6.  **Preservation:** White pixels (0) are preserved in their original positions. The grid dimensions remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_replacement
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
input_colors:
  - white (0)
  - gray (5)
output_colors:
  - white (0)
  - blue (1)
  - green (3)
  - yellow (4)
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - length (number of contiguous pixels)
      - horizontal_contiguity
actions:
  - identify: Locate contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels.
  - measure: Determine the length of each identified gray segment.
  - replace: Substitute the gray (5) pixels within each segment with a new color.
relationships:
  - mapping: The replacement color depends directly on the length of the gray segment.
    rules:
      - length: 1 => color: yellow (4)
      - length: 2 => color: blue (1)
      - length: 3 => color: green (3)
  - preservation: Pixels with color white (0) remain unchanged in the output.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Unchanged between input and output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid from left to right.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy its color (white, 0) to the corresponding position in the new grid.
4.  If the current pixel is gray (5):
    a.  Initiate a search starting from the current position to find the end of the contiguous horizontal block of gray (5) pixels.
    b.  Measure the length (number of pixels) of this gray block.
    c.  Determine the replacement color based on the measured length:
        *   If the length is 1, the replacement color is yellow (4).
        *   If the length is 2, the replacement color is blue (1).
        *   If the length is 3, the replacement color is green (3).
    d.  Fill the corresponding positions in the new grid, covering the entire length of the identified block, with the determined replacement color.
    e.  Advance the iteration position past the end of the just-processed gray block to avoid reprocessing its pixels.
5.  Return the new grid as the output.
