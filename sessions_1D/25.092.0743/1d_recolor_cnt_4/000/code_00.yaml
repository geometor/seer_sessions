task_type: color_replacement
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
input_colors:
  - white (0)
  - gray (5)
output_colors:
  - white (0)
  - blue (1)
  - green (3)
  - yellow (4)
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - length (number of contiguous pixels)
      - horizontal_contiguity
actions:
  - identify: Locate contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels.
  - measure: Determine the length of each identified gray segment.
  - replace: Substitute the gray (5) pixels within each segment with a new color.
relationships:
  - mapping: The replacement color depends directly on the length of the gray segment.
    rules:
      - length: 1 => color: yellow (4)
      - length: 2 => color: blue (1)
      - length: 3 => color: green (3)
  - preservation: Pixels with color white (0) remain unchanged in the output.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Unchanged between input and output.
