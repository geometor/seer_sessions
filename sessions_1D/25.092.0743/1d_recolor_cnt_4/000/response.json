            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and develop the requested deliverables.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples use 1-dimensional grids (single rows). The width varies, but the height is always 1.\n2.  **Colors:**\n    *   Input grids contain only white (0) and gray (5) pixels.\n    *   Output grids contain white (0), blue (1), green (3), and yellow (4) pixels. White pixels in the input remain white in the output. Gray pixels in the input are replaced by other colors in the output.\n3.  **Objects:** The primary objects of interest are contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves identifying these gray blocks, determining their length (size), and replacing the gray pixels within each block with a new color based solely on the block's length.\n5.  **Color Mapping Rule:** Based on the examples, the mapping from gray block length to output color is:\n    *   Length 1 -> Yellow (4)\n    *   Length 2 -> Blue (1)\n    *   Length 3 -> Green (3)\n6.  **Preservation:** White pixels (0) are preserved in their original positions. The grid dimensions remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
