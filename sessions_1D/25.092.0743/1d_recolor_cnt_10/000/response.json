            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 1D grids (represented as a single row).\n2.  **Colors:** The primary color in the input is magenta (6), set against a white (0) background. The output introduces new colors: azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4), while retaining the white (0) background.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation operates exclusively on the magenta (6) pixels. The white (0) pixels remain unchanged in their positions.\n4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The magenta pixels appear in contiguous horizontal groups (or blocks) of varying lengths, separated by white pixels.\n5.  **Color Change Logic:** The color replacing the magenta pixels in the output depends on the *length* (number of pixels) of the contiguous magenta block in the input.\n    *   Blocks of length 1 (`6`) are replaced by yellow (`4`). (Seen in train_2, train_3, and implicitly in train_1's `6 0 6` becoming `4 0 4`)\n    *   Blocks of length 2 (`6 6`) are replaced by azure (`8 8`). (Seen in train_1, train_3)\n    *   Blocks of length 3 (`6 6 6`) are replaced by red (`2 2 2`). (Seen in train_1, train_2, train_3)\n6.  **Object Identification:** The core objects are the contiguous horizontal blocks of magenta pixels. The white background acts as a separator and remains static.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
