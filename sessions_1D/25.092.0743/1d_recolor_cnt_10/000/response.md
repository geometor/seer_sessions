Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 1D grids (represented as a single row).
2.  **Colors:** The primary color in the input is magenta (6), set against a white (0) background. The output introduces new colors: azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4), while retaining the white (0) background.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation operates exclusively on the magenta (6) pixels. The white (0) pixels remain unchanged in their positions.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The magenta pixels appear in contiguous horizontal groups (or blocks) of varying lengths, separated by white pixels.
5.  **Color Change Logic:** The color replacing the magenta pixels in the output depends on the *length* (number of pixels) of the contiguous magenta block in the input.
    *   Blocks of length 1 (`6`) are replaced by yellow (`4`). (Seen in train_2, train_3, and implicitly in train_1's `6 0 6` becoming `4 0 4`)
    *   Blocks of length 2 (`6 6`) are replaced by azure (`8 8`). (Seen in train_1, train_3)
    *   Blocks of length 3 (`6 6 6`) are replaced by red (`2 2 2`). (Seen in train_1, train_2, train_3)
6.  **Object Identification:** The core objects are the contiguous horizontal blocks of magenta pixels. The white background acts as a separator and remains static.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid identical to the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally from left to right.
3.  When a magenta (6) pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet:
    a.  Start counting the length of the contiguous horizontal block of magenta pixels starting from this position.
    b.  Keep track of the start and end indices of this block.
    c.  Determine the `block_length`.
    d.  Based on the `block_length`, select the corresponding output color:
        *   If `block_length` is 1, the output color is yellow (4).
        *   If `block_length` is 2, the output color is azure (8).
        *   If `block_length` is 3, the output color is red (2).
    e.  In the output grid, replace all the pixels within the identified block's indices (from start to end) with the selected output color.
    f.  Mark these pixels as processed (e.g., by advancing the main iteration index past the end of the block).
4.  If the pixel encountered is white (0) or an already processed magenta pixel, continue to the next pixel.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
