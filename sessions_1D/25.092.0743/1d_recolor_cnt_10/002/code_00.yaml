task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of magenta pixels in a single-row grid based on their length.
elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D numpy.ndarray
      - shape: (1, N) where N is grid width (variable)
      - content: pixels with integer values representing colors
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - value: color_code (0-9)
      - role: background (white, 0) or foreground (magenta, 6 in input; various in output)
  - element: object
    type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    properties:
      - located_in_row: 0
      - color: magenta (6) in input
      - length: number of pixels in the block (1, 2, or 3 observed)
      - output_color: determined by length (yellow/4 for 1, azure/8 for 2, red/2 for 3)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Magenta blocks are contiguous horizontally within the single row, separated by one or more white pixels.
  - type: transformation
    input_element: magenta_block (object)
    output_element: block_of_new_color (same location and shape)
    rule: The output color depends solely on the length of the input magenta block.
actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    input: input_grid (shape 1xN)
    output: list of magenta blocks (each with start column index, end column index, length)
  - action: determine_output_color
    input: block_length
    output: corresponding_output_color
    mapping:
      - length: 1, color: yellow (4)
      - length: 2, color: azure (8)
      - length: 3, color: red (2)
  - action: replace_pixels
    input: input_grid, identified_blocks, color_mapping
    output: output_grid (shape 1xN)
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. For each identified magenta block, replace the pixels within the block's column indices (in row 0) with the determined output color. Keep white pixels unchanged.
constants:
  - name: background_color
    value: white (0)
  - name: input_target_color
    value: magenta (6)
  - name: output_color_map
    value: {1: 4, 2: 8, 3: 2} # length -> color code
