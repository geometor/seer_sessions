            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code attempt failed with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.` across all training examples. This error typically occurs in Python when a boolean condition involves a NumPy array containing multiple elements, often because of implicit broadcasting or incorrect assumptions about the array's shape or type during comparisons or logical operations.\n\nThe core logic identified\u2014mapping contiguous horizontal blocks of magenta (6) pixels to different colors based on block length (1->4, 2->8, 3->2)\u2014appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples. The error likely stems from how the input grid data structure (list vs. NumPy array, 1D vs. 2D) is handled within the Python function, particularly in the `if` condition and potentially during initialization/copying.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Assume Input is NumPy Array:** ARC tasks typically use NumPy arrays. The error strongly suggests this is the case.\n2.  **Assume 2D Structure:** Even though visually represented as 1D, ARC grids are fundamentally 2D. A single row is likely represented as a 2D NumPy array with shape `(1, N)`.\n3.  **Adjust Indexing:** Modify the code to use 2D indexing (e.g., `grid[0, i]`) instead of 1D indexing (`grid[i]`).\n4.  **Use NumPy Operations:** Utilize NumPy functions for copying (`np.copy`) and potentially other operations for efficiency and correctness.\n5.  **Verify Logic:** Re-confirm the block identification and color mapping logic remains sound under the NumPy/2D assumption.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's simulate the input format based on the first example and check its likely properties if it were a NumPy array.\n\n"

The input grids are most likely 2D NumPy arrays with shape `(1, N)`, where N is the number of elements in the row (e.g., `(1, 33)` for `train_1`).\n2.  The error simulation confirms that comparing a NumPy array (like a slice or a row) directly to a scalar using `==` results in a boolean array, which cannot be evaluated directly in an `if` statement, causing the observed `ValueError`.\n3.  Crucially, the `list(input_grid)` operation used in the previous code, when applied to a `(1, N)` NumPy array, creates a Python list containing *one element*, which is the *entire NumPy row array*. Subsequent indexing like `output_grid[i]` would then fail or return the entire row array (if `i=0`), leading to the error when compared to `target_color`.\n4.  The correct approach is to work directly with the NumPy array using `np.copy()` and 2D indexing `grid[0, i]`.\n\n**Updated YAML Facts:**\n\n"
