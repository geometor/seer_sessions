Two adjacent yellow pixels become azure (8). Three adjacent yellow pixels become gray (5).\n*   This pattern holds true for all yellow objects in all three examples.\n*   Objects of size 1 (one yellow pixel) consistently become red (2).\n*   Objects of size 2 (two contiguous yellow pixels) consistently become azure (8).\n*   Objects of size 3 (three contiguous yellow pixels) consistently become gray (5).\n*   The white background pixels remain unchanged.\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying each distinct yellow object, determining its size, and then recoloring all pixels within that object based on a size-to-color mapping.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
