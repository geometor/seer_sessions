elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    relation: remains unchanged in the output
  - type: object
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: variable (contiguous blocks)
    properties:
      - size: number of pixels in the contiguous block
    action:
      - find_contiguous_objects: Identify all distinct groups of connected yellow pixels.
      - measure_size: Count the number of pixels in each identified object.
      - recolor_by_size: Change the color of all pixels within each object based on its size.
        mapping:
          - size: 1
            output_color: red (2)
          - size: 2
            output_color: azure (8)
          - size: 3
            output_color: gray (5)
relationships:
  - The transformation applies independently to each yellow object.
  - The final color of an object depends solely on its pixel count (size).
  - The relative positions of the objects remain the same.
