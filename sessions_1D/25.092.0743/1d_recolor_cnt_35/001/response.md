"""
Replace contiguous horizontal segments of red pixels (2) with a new color based on the length of the segment.
- Segments of length 1 become blue (1).
- Segments of length 2 become yellow (4).
- Segments of length 3 become gray (5).
White pixels (0) remain unchanged.
The transformation operates linearly along the sequence (assuming 1D or row-by-row for 2D).
