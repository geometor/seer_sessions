Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The examples provided seem to represent 1-dimensional sequences of pixels (colors). Although ARC grids are typically 2D, these examples are presented as single lines. It's possible they represent a single row or a flattened grid, but the transformation logic appears to operate linearly along the sequence.
2.  **Colors:** The input primarily uses white (0) and red (2). The output uses white (0), blue (1), yellow (4), and gray (5).
3.  **Objects:** The key objects in the input are contiguous horizontal segments (or blocks) of red pixels. These segments vary in length.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the color of the red segments. The white background pixels remain unchanged. The new color assigned to a segment depends directly on the length of that segment in the input.
5.  **Pattern:**
    *   A red segment of length 1 (`[2]`) is transformed into a blue segment of length 1 (`[1]`).
    *   A red segment of length 2 (`[2, 2]`) is transformed into a yellow segment of length 2 (`[4, 4]`).
    *   A red segment of length 3 (`[2, 2, 2]`) is transformed into a gray segment of length 3 (`[5, 5, 5]`).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Replace contiguous horizontal segments of red pixels with a new color based on the length of the segment.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: Assumed 1D based on example format, but could be a single row of a 2D grid.
  size_preservation: Output grid dimensions are the same as the input grid dimensions.
  background_color: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
objects:
  - type: segment
    input_color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length: The number of contiguous red pixels.
      - position: Location within the sequence.
    actions:
      - color_transformation: The color of the segment is changed in the output.
relationships:
  - type: color_mapping
    based_on: length of the red segment
    rules:
      - input_length: 1
        output_color: blue (1)
      - input_length: 2
        output_color: yellow (4)
      - input_length: 3
        output_color: gray (5)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence (or grid) identical to the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right (or start to end).
3.  Identify the start of a contiguous segment of red (2) pixels.
4.  Measure the length of this contiguous red segment.
5.  Determine the new color for this segment based on its length:
    *   If the length is 1, the new color is blue (1).
    *   If the length is 2, the new color is yellow (4).
    *   If the length is 3, the new color is gray (5).
6.  Replace the pixels corresponding to this red segment in the output sequence with the determined new color.
7.  Continue iterating from the position immediately after the identified segment.
8.  If a pixel is not red (i.e., it is white, 0), leave it unchanged in the output sequence.
9.  Return the modified output sequence.
