            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The examples provided seem to represent 1-dimensional sequences of pixels (colors). Although ARC grids are typically 2D, these examples are presented as single lines. It's possible they represent a single row or a flattened grid, but the transformation logic appears to operate linearly along the sequence.\n2.  **Colors:** The input primarily uses white (0) and red (2). The output uses white (0), blue (1), yellow (4), and gray (5).\n3.  **Objects:** The key objects in the input are contiguous horizontal segments (or blocks) of red pixels. These segments vary in length.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the color of the red segments. The white background pixels remain unchanged. The new color assigned to a segment depends directly on the length of that segment in the input.\n5.  **Pattern:**\n    *   A red segment of length 1 (`[2]`) is transformed into a blue segment of length 1 (`[1]`).\n    *   A red segment of length 2 (`[2, 2]`) is transformed into a yellow segment of length 2 (`[4, 4]`).\n    *   A red segment of length 3 (`[2, 2, 2]`) is transformed into a gray segment of length 3 (`[5, 5, 5]`).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
