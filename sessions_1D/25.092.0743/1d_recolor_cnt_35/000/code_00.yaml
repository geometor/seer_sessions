task_description: Replace contiguous horizontal segments of red pixels with a new color based on the length of the segment.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: Assumed 1D based on example format, but could be a single row of a 2D grid.
  size_preservation: Output grid dimensions are the same as the input grid dimensions.
  background_color: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
objects:
  - type: segment
    input_color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length: The number of contiguous red pixels.
      - position: Location within the sequence.
    actions:
      - color_transformation: The color of the segment is changed in the output.
relationships:
  - type: color_mapping
    based_on: length of the red segment
    rules:
      - input_length: 1
        output_color: blue (1)
      - input_length: 2
        output_color: yellow (4)
      - input_length: 3
        output_color: gray (5)
