"""
Identifies contiguous objects of orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
Determines the size (number of pixels) of each orange object.
Replaces the orange pixels of each object in the output grid with a new color based on the object's size:
- Size 1: Replace with green (3).
- Size 3: Replace with magenta (6).
- Size 4: Replace with red (2).
All other pixels (including white background) remain unchanged.
