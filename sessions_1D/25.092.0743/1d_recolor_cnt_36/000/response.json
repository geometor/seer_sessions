            "text": "Okay, analyzing the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\nThe input grids contain white pixels (0) and orange pixels (7). The orange pixels form distinct, non-overlapping objects (contiguous groups). The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids. The white pixels remain unchanged. The orange pixels in the input are replaced by different colors in the output: green (3), magenta (6), or red (2). The color used for replacement seems to depend on the properties of the original orange object.\n\nObserving the examples:\n- In `train_1`, single orange pixels become green, a 1x3 horizontal line becomes magenta, and a 2x2 square becomes red.\n- In `train_2`, the same pattern holds: single orange becomes green, 1x3 lines become magenta, 2x2 squares become red.\n- In `train_3`, the pattern confirms: 2x2 squares become red, a 1x3 line becomes magenta, and a single orange pixel becomes green.\n\nIt appears the transformation rule is based on the *size* (number of pixels) of each distinct orange object:\n- Objects of size 1 become green (3).\n- Objects of size 3 become magenta (6).\n- Objects of size 4 become red (2).\n\n**Facts:**\n"
