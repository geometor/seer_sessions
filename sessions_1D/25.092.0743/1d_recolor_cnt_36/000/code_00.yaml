task_context:
  - The input grid contains white (0) and orange (7) pixels.
  - The output grid retains the white (0) pixels in their original positions.
  - Orange (7) pixels in the input are replaced by other colors in the output.
objects:
  - type: contiguous_group
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - size: number of pixels in the group
transformations:
  - action: identify_objects
    input_color: orange (7)
    output: set of distinct orange objects
  - action: for_each_object
    condition: object size == 1
    result: change all pixels of the object to green (3)
  - action: for_each_object
    condition: object size == 3
    result: change all pixels of the object to magenta (6)
  - action: for_each_object
    condition: object size == 4
    result: change all pixels of the object to red (2)
grid_properties:
  - dimensions remain unchanged.
  - background (white pixels) remains unchanged.
relationships:
  - The output color of a transformed object depends solely on the size of the corresponding input object.
