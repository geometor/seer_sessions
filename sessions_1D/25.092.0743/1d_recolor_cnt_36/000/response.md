Okay, analyzing the task examples.

**Perception:**
The input grids contain white pixels (0) and orange pixels (7). The orange pixels form distinct, non-overlapping objects (contiguous groups). The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids. The white pixels remain unchanged. The orange pixels in the input are replaced by different colors in the output: green (3), magenta (6), or red (2). The color used for replacement seems to depend on the properties of the original orange object.

Observing the examples:
- In `train_1`, single orange pixels become green, a 1x3 horizontal line becomes magenta, and a 2x2 square becomes red.
- In `train_2`, the same pattern holds: single orange becomes green, 1x3 lines become magenta, 2x2 squares become red.
- In `train_3`, the pattern confirms: 2x2 squares become red, a 1x3 line becomes magenta, and a single orange pixel becomes green.

It appears the transformation rule is based on the *size* (number of pixels) of each distinct orange object:
- Objects of size 1 become green (3).
- Objects of size 3 become magenta (6).
- Objects of size 4 become red (2).

**Facts:**

```yaml
task_context:
  - The input grid contains white (0) and orange (7) pixels.
  - The output grid retains the white (0) pixels in their original positions.
  - Orange (7) pixels in the input are replaced by other colors in the output.
objects:
  - type: contiguous_group
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - size: number of pixels in the group
transformations:
  - action: identify_objects
    input_color: orange (7)
    output: set of distinct orange objects
  - action: for_each_object
    condition: object size == 1
    result: change all pixels of the object to green (3)
  - action: for_each_object
    condition: object size == 3
    result: change all pixels of the object to magenta (6)
  - action: for_each_object
    condition: object size == 4
    result: change all pixels of the object to red (2)
grid_properties:
  - dimensions remain unchanged.
  - background (white pixels) remains unchanged.
relationships:
  - The output color of a transformed object depends solely on the size of the corresponding input object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**
1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct contiguous objects composed of orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified orange object:
    a.  Calculate the size of the object (the number of pixels it contains).
    b.  Determine the target color based on the object's size:
        i.  If the size is 1, the target color is green (3).
        ii. If the size is 3, the target color is magenta (6).
        iii. If the size is 4, the target color is red (2).
    c.  In the output grid, replace all pixels corresponding to the locations of the current orange object with the determined target color.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
