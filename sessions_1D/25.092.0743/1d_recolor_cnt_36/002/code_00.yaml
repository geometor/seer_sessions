task_context:
  - The input grid contains white (0) and orange (7) pixels.
  - The output grid retains the white (0) pixels in their original positions.
  - Orange (7) pixels in the input are replaced by other colors in the output based on the properties of the orange object they belong to.
objects:
  - type: contiguous_group
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - size: number of pixels in the group (determined by 4-way adjacency)
transformations:
  - action: identify_objects
    input_color: orange (7)
    algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar connected components algorithm on the 2D grid representation.
    output: set of distinct orange objects, each represented by the coordinates of its pixels.
  - action: for_each_object
    input: orange object coordinates
    process:
      - calculate the size (number of coordinates) of the object.
      - determine the target color based on size:
          - size 1 -> green (3)
          - size 2 -> red (2)
          - size 3 -> magenta (6)
      - if a target color is determined, replace the pixels at the object's coordinates in the output grid with the target color.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions remain unchanged.
  - background (white pixels) remains unchanged.
relationships:
  - The output color replacing an orange object depends solely on the size (pixel count) of that orange object in the input.
