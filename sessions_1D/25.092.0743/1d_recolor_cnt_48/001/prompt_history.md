**Perception**

The input grids are single rows containing white (0) and orange (7) pixels. The orange pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of varying lengths, separated by one or more white pixels.

The output grids have the same dimensions as the inputs. The white pixels remain unchanged in their positions. The segments of orange pixels in the input are replaced by segments of other colors in the output. The color used for replacement depends on the length (number of pixels) of the original orange segment.

Observing the examples:
- A single orange pixel (length 1) is replaced by a single maroon (9) pixel.
- A segment of two orange pixels (length 2) is replaced by a segment of two gray (5) pixels.
- A segment of three orange pixels (length 3) is replaced by a segment of three yellow (4) pixels.

The transformation rule appears to be: identify contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels, determine their length, and replace each segment with a new segment of the same length, using a color determined by the original segment's length (1->maroon, 2->gray, 3->yellow). Background white pixels are preserved.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_color_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  input_colors: [white, orange]
  output_colors: [white, maroon, yellow, gray]
  background_color: white
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: orange
    properties:
      - contiguous: horizontally
      - length: variable (observed lengths: 1, 2, 3)
actions:
  - identify: contiguous segments of orange pixels in the input grid.
  - measure: the length (number of pixels) of each identified orange segment.
  - replace: each orange segment in the input with a segment of the same length in the output grid.
  - map_color: The color of the replacement segment is determined by the length of the original orange segment according to the following rule:
      - length 1: replace with maroon (9)
      - length 2: replace with gray (5)
      - length 3: replace with yellow (4)
  - preserve: white (0) pixels; their positions remain unchanged in the output grid.
relationships:
  - The output color of a segment is directly determined by the length of the corresponding input orange segment.
  - The position and extent of non-orange pixels (white background) are preserved between input and output.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white).
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally, column by column.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy it to the corresponding position in the output grid and move to the next pixel.
4.  If the current pixel is orange (7):
    a.  Identify the end of the contiguous horizontal segment of orange pixels starting at the current position.
    b.  Calculate the length of this orange segment.
    c.  Determine the replacement color based on the segment length:
        i.  If length is 1, the replacement color is maroon (9).
        ii. If length is 2, the replacement color is gray (5).
        iii. If length is 3, the replacement color is yellow (4).
    d.  Fill the corresponding segment (same start position and length) in the output grid with the determined replacement color.
    e.  Advance the iteration position to the pixel immediately following the identified orange segment.
5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all pixels in the input grid have been processed.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
