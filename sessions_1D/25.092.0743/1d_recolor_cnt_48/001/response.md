"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels (7) in a 1D input grid.
Measures the length of each segment.
Replaces each orange segment with a segment of the same length using a color determined by the original segment's length:
- Length 1: Replace with maroon (9)
- Length 2: Replace with gray (5)
- Length 3: Replace with yellow (4)
White pixels (0) are preserved.
