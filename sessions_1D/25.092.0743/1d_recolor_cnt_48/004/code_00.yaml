task_type: object_color_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN grid)
  input_colors: [white, orange]
  output_colors: [white, maroon, yellow, gray] # Colors observed in outputs
  background_color: white
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: orange
    properties:
      - contiguous: horizontally
      - length: variable (observed lengths: 1, 2, 3)
      - separation: separated by one or more white pixels
actions:
  - identify: contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels in the input grid.
  - measure: the length (number of pixels) of each identified orange segment.
  - replace: each orange segment in the input with a segment of the same length and at the same position in the output grid.
  - map_color: The color of the replacement segment is determined solely by the length of the original orange segment according to the following rule:
      - length 1: replace with maroon (9)
      - length 2: replace with gray (5)
      - length 3: replace with yellow (4)
      # Note: Behavior for other lengths is implicitly defined by copying input first - they remain orange.
  - preserve: white (0) pixels; their positions and color remain unchanged in the output grid.
relationships:
  - The output color of a segment is functionally dependent on the length of the corresponding input orange segment.
  - The position, length, and color of non-orange pixels (white background) are preserved.
