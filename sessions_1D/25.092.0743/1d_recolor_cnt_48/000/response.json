            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe input grids are single rows containing white (0) and orange (7) pixels. The orange pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (objects) of varying lengths, separated by one or more white pixels.\n\nThe output grids have the same dimensions as the inputs. The white pixels remain unchanged in their positions. The segments of orange pixels in the input are replaced by segments of other colors in the output. The color used for replacement depends on the length (number of pixels) of the original orange segment.\n\nObserving the examples:\n- A single orange pixel (length 1) is replaced by a single maroon (9) pixel.\n- A segment of two orange pixels (length 2) is replaced by a segment of two gray (5) pixels.\n- A segment of three orange pixels (length 3) is replaced by a segment of three yellow (4) pixels.\n\nThe transformation rule appears to be: identify contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels, determine their length, and replace each segment with a new segment of the same length, using a color determined by the original segment's length (1->maroon, 2->gray, 3->yellow). Background white pixels are preserved.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
