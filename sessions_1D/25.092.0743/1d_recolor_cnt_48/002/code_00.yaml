task_type: object_color_transformation # Based on segment properties
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D # Represented as 1xN grid
  input_colors: [white, orange]
  output_colors: [white, maroon, yellow, gray] # Colors observed in output
  background_color: white
objects:
  - type: segment # Contiguous horizontal block of non-background color
    properties:
      - color: orange # Input segments are always orange (7)
      - length: variable (observed: 1, 2, 3)
      - contiguity: horizontal
actions:
  - identify: contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels in the input grid row.
  - measure: the length (number of pixels) of each identified orange segment.
  - replace: each identified orange segment in the input with a segment of the identical length and position in the output grid.
  - map_color: The color of the replacement segment is determined solely by the length of the original orange segment using the rule: {1: maroon(9), 2: gray(5), 3: yellow(4)}.
  - preserve: white (0) pixels; their positions remain unchanged in the output grid.
relationships:
  - The output color of a segment depends only on the length of the corresponding input orange segment.
  - The structure (position and length of segments, position of background pixels) is preserved between input and output.
uncertainties:
  - Behavior for orange segments with lengths other than 1, 2, or 3 is undefined by the examples. (Code assumes they remain orange).
  - Cause of the 'list index out of range' error during previous execution attempt is unclear, as the code logic seems robust for standard ARC input formats.
