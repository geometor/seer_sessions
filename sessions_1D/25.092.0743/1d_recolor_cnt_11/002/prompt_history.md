Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

The input is a one-dimensional sequence (or a 1xN grid) of pixels, consisting primarily of white (0) and maroon (9). The output is a sequence of the same length, where the white (0) pixels remain unchanged. The key transformation involves the maroon (9) pixels. Contiguous blocks of maroon pixels in the input are replaced by blocks of the same length in the output, but with a different color. The color used for replacement depends on the length of the contiguous maroon block:

*   A block of length 1 (single maroon pixel) is replaced by orange (7).
*   A block of length 2 (two adjacent maroon pixels) is replaced by magenta (6).
*   A block of length 3 (three adjacent maroon pixels) is replaced by gray (5).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: color_replacement
grid_dimensions: 1D sequence (or 1xN grid)
background_color: white (0)
input_objects:
  - type: pixel_segment
    color: maroon (9)
    properties:
      - length: variable (1, 2, or 3 observed in examples)
      - contiguity: horizontal
output_objects:
  - type: pixel_segment
    color: derived (orange(7), magenta(6), or gray(5))
    properties:
      - length: same as corresponding input segment
      - contiguity: horizontal
transformation:
  - action: identify_segments
    target: maroon (9) pixels
    condition: horizontal contiguity
  - action: replace_color
    target: identified maroon (9) segments
    mapping:
      - input_length: 1
        output_color: orange (7)
      - input_length: 2
        output_color: magenta (6)
      - input_length: 3
        output_color: gray (5)
    preserves:
      - segment_length
      - segment_position
unchanged_elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
relationships:
  - The output color of a segment is determined solely by the length of the corresponding input maroon segment.
  - The position and length of the transformed segments match the original maroon segments.
  - White pixels act as separators and remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right.
2.  If a white (0) pixel is encountered, copy it directly to the output sequence at the same position.
3.  If a maroon (9) pixel is encountered, determine the length of the contiguous block of maroon pixels starting at this position.
4.  Based on the length of the maroon block:
    *   If the length is 1, replace the maroon pixel with an orange (7) pixel in the output sequence.
    *   If the length is 2, replace the two maroon pixels with two magenta (6) pixels in the output sequence.
    *   If the length is 3, replace the three maroon pixels with three gray (5) pixels in the output sequence.
5.  Continue iterating from the position immediately after the processed maroon block (or the single white pixel).
6.  Repeat until the entire input sequence is processed. The resulting sequence is the output.

"""
Processes a 1D sequence of pixels (represented as a list of integers).
