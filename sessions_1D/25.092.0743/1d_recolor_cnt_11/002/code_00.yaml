task_type: color_replacement_by_segment_length
grid_dimensions: 2D grid, specifically 1xN (one row, variable columns)
background_color: white (0) # Acts as background/separator within the row
input_objects:
  - type: pixel_segment
    color: maroon (9)
    location: row 0
    properties:
      - length: variable (1, 2, or 3 observed)
      - contiguity: horizontal
output_objects:
  - type: pixel_segment
    color: derived (orange(7), magenta(6), or gray(5))
    location: row 0
    properties:
      - length: same as corresponding input segment
      - contiguity: horizontal
transformation:
  - action: scan_row
    target_row: 0
    direction: left-to-right
  - action: identify_segments
    target_color: maroon (9)
    condition: horizontal contiguity within row 0
  - action: map_length_to_color
    input_lengths: [1, 2, 3]
    output_colors: [orange(7), magenta(6), gray(5)]
  - action: replace_color_in_segment
    target: identified maroon (9) segments in row 0
    replacement_rule: use color mapped from segment length
    preserves:
      - segment_length
      - segment_position (column indices)
      - segment_row (always 0)
unchanged_elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    location: row 0
relationships:
  - The output color of a segment in row 0 is determined solely by the length of the corresponding input maroon segment in row 0.
  - The position (column indices) and length of the transformed segments match the original maroon segments in row 0.
  - White pixels in row 0 remain unchanged and separate the maroon/transformed segments.
