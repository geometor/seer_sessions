"""
Transforms a 1xN grid by identifying contiguous horizontal blocks of maroon (9) pixels in the single row.
Each maroon block is replaced by a block of the same length but with a different color based on its length:
- Length 1: replaced with orange (7)
- Length 2: replaced with magenta (6)
- Length 3: replaced with gray (5)
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
