"""
Identify contiguous horizontal segments of gray (5) pixels in each row of the input grid.
Measure the length of each gray segment.
Replace the gray pixels of each segment with a new color based on its length:
- Length 1 becomes blue (1).
- Length 2 becomes azure (8).
- Length 3 becomes magenta (6).
Leave all other pixels (specifically white (0) pixels) unchanged.
