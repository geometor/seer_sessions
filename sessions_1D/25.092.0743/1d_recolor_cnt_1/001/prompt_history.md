*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output are single rows (or effectively 1D arrays) of pixels.
    *   The primary colors involved are white (0) and gray (5) in the input, and white (0), blue (1), magenta (6), and azure (8) in the output.
    *   White pixels (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output.
    *   Gray pixels (5) in the input change their color in the output based on the contiguous block they belong to.
    *   The transformation rule depends on the size (length) of contiguous horizontal segments of gray pixels.
    *   Specifically, segments of length 1 become blue (1), segments of length 2 become azure (8), and segments of length 3 become magenta (6).

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: color_transformation
    input_colors: [white, gray]
    output_colors: [white, blue, magenta, azure]
    background_color: white # Color 0 remains unchanged and acts as a separator
    target_color: gray # Color 5 is the one being transformed
    transformation_basis: object_property
    object_type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    property_measured: size # length of the segment
    size_color_mapping:
      1: blue # 1
      2: azure # 8
      3: magenta # 6
    actions:
      - identify_segments: find contiguous horizontal segments of the target_color (gray)
      - measure_segments: determine the length (size) of each segment
      - apply_mapping: replace the pixels of each segment with the color corresponding to its size based on the size_color_mapping
      - preserve_background: keep background_color (white) pixels unchanged
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through the input grid (row by row, column by column, although here it's effectively just column by column in a single row).
    3.  Identify contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) composed solely of gray (5) pixels, bounded by white (0) pixels or the grid edges.
    4.  For each identified gray segment:
        a.  Measure its length (number of pixels).
        b.  Determine the replacement color based on the segment's length:
            *   If length is 1, the replacement color is blue (1).
            *   If length is 2, the replacement color is azure (8).
            *   If length is 3, the replacement color is magenta (6).
        c.  Replace all pixels within that segment in the output grid with the determined replacement color.
    5.  Leave all white (0) pixels unchanged.
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
