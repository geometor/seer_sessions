"""
Recolors contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels in a single-row grid based on their length.
- Blocks of length 1 become azure (8).
- Blocks of length 2 become magenta (6).
- Blocks of length 3 become yellow (4).
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
The input and output are grids containing a single row (e.g., [[p1, p2, ...]]).
