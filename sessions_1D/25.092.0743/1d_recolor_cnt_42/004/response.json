            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core transformation logic: identifying contiguous blocks of blue pixels (1) in a single-row input and recoloring them based on their length (1 -> azure/8, 2 -> magenta/6, 3 -> yellow/4), while preserving white pixels (0).\n\nThe failure occurred because the code's input format handling logic raised a `ValueError`. This suggests the input format provided during testing did not match either the primary expected format (`list[list[int]]`) or the alternative flat list format (`list[int]`) that the code attempted to handle.\n\nThe strategy is to simplify the input handling, strictly adhering to the standard ARC format where grids are represented as `list[list[int]]`, even for single rows. We will assume the input `transform` function receives is `[[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]` and expect the output to be in the same format. The core block-finding and recoloring logic remains the same.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the examples:\n\n*   **Dimensionality:** All inputs and outputs represent 1D sequences (single rows).\n*   **Grid Size:** Input and output grids have the same width (19 pixels in all examples). Height is 1 for all.\n*   **Input Colors:** White (0), Blue (1).\n*   **Output Colors:** White (0), Azure (8), Magenta (6), Yellow (4).\n*   **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   White (0) -> White (0)\n    *   Blue (1) block of length 1 -> Azure (8)\n    *   Blue (1) block of length 2 -> Magenta (6)\n    *   Blue (1) block of length 3 -> Yellow (4)\n*   **Consistency:** This rule holds across all three training examples.\n\nExample 1 Breakdown:\nInput: `[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\nBlue blocks (index, length): (2, 1), (5, 2), (8, 3), (12, 3)\nOutput: `[[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Matches rule: 1->8, 2->6, 3->4, 3->4)\n\nExample 2 Breakdown:\nInput: `[[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\nBlue blocks (index, length): (1, 1), (3, 3), (8, 2), (13, 2)\nOutput: `[[0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Matches rule: 1->8, 3->4, 2->6, 2->6)\n\nExample 3 Breakdown:\nInput: `[[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\nBlue blocks (index, length): (1, 1), (3, 3), (7, 2), (12, 3)\nOutput: `[[0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Matches rule: 1->8, 3->4, 2->6, 3->4)\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
