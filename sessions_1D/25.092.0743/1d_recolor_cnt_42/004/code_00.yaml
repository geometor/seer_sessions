task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of blue pixels within a single-row grid based on the length of the block.
grid_properties:
  - structure: 2D grid (list of lists)
  - dimensionality_represented: 1D sequence
  - height: 1 row
  - width_preservation: Input and output grids have the same width.
  - input_colors: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - output_colors: [white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: blue (1)
    location: within the single row of the grid
    properties:
      - length: number of contiguous blue pixels
relationships:
  - white (0) pixels in the input row map directly to white (0) pixels in the output row at the same position.
  - blue (1) pixels in the input row are part of contiguous blocks.
actions:
  - input: Receive a grid structured as a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[p1, p2, ...]]`).
  - extract: Identify the single row list from the input grid.
  - copy: Create a mutable copy of the extracted row for the output.
  - iterate: Scan the input row to find contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels.
  - measure: For each blue block, determine its length.
  - map_length_to_color:
      - length 1: map to azure (8)
      - length 2: map to magenta (6)
      - length 3: map to yellow (4)
  - replace: For each identified blue block, replace the corresponding pixels in the output row copy with the mapped color.
  - preserve: Pixels that were originally white (0) or part of blue blocks with lengths other than 1, 2, or 3 remain unchanged in the output copy.
  - format_output: Wrap the modified output row list within another list to create the final output grid `[[p1_out, p2_out, ...]]`.
  - return: Return the formatted output grid.
