## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the core transformation logic: identifying contiguous blocks of blue pixels (1) in a single-row input and recoloring them based on their length (1 -> azure/8, 2 -> magenta/6, 3 -> yellow/4), while preserving white pixels (0).

The failure occurred because the code's input format handling logic raised a `ValueError`. This suggests the input format provided during testing did not match either the primary expected format (`list[list[int]]`) or the alternative flat list format (`list[int]`) that the code attempted to handle.

The strategy is to simplify the input handling, strictly adhering to the standard ARC format where grids are represented as `list[list[int]]`, even for single rows. We will assume the input `transform` function receives is `[[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]` and expect the output to be in the same format. The core block-finding and recoloring logic remains the same.

## Metrics

Based on the examples:

*   **Dimensionality:** All inputs and outputs represent 1D sequences (single rows).
*   **Grid Size:** Input and output grids have the same width (19 pixels in all examples). Height is 1 for all.
*   **Input Colors:** White (0), Blue (1).
*   **Output Colors:** White (0), Azure (8), Magenta (6), Yellow (4).
*   **Transformation Rule:**
    *   White (0) -> White (0)
    *   Blue (1) block of length 1 -> Azure (8)
    *   Blue (1) block of length 2 -> Magenta (6)
    *   Blue (1) block of length 3 -> Yellow (4)
*   **Consistency:** This rule holds across all three training examples.

Example 1 Breakdown:
Input: `[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
Blue blocks (index, length): (2, 1), (5, 2), (8, 3), (12, 3)
Output: `[[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Matches rule: 1->8, 2->6, 3->4, 3->4)

Example 2 Breakdown:
Input: `[[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
Blue blocks (index, length): (1, 1), (3, 3), (8, 2), (13, 2)
Output: `[[0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Matches rule: 1->8, 3->4, 2->6, 2->6)

Example 3 Breakdown:
Input: `[[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
Blue blocks (index, length): (1, 1), (3, 3), (7, 2), (12, 3)
Output: `[[0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Matches rule: 1->8, 3->4, 2->6, 3->4)

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of blue pixels within a single-row grid based on the length of the block.
grid_properties:
  - structure: 2D grid (list of lists)
  - dimensionality_represented: 1D sequence
  - height: 1 row
  - width_preservation: Input and output grids have the same width.
  - input_colors: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - output_colors: [white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: blue (1)
    location: within the single row of the grid
    properties:
      - length: number of contiguous blue pixels
relationships:
  - white (0) pixels in the input row map directly to white (0) pixels in the output row at the same position.
  - blue (1) pixels in the input row are part of contiguous blocks.
actions:
  - input: Receive a grid structured as a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[p1, p2, ...]]`).
  - extract: Identify the single row list from the input grid.
  - copy: Create a mutable copy of the extracted row for the output.
  - iterate: Scan the input row to find contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels.
  - measure: For each blue block, determine its length.
  - map_length_to_color:
      - length 1: map to azure (8)
      - length 2: map to magenta (6)
      - length 3: map to yellow (4)
  - replace: For each identified blue block, replace the corresponding pixels in the output row copy with the mapped color.
  - preserve: Pixels that were originally white (0) or part of blue blocks with lengths other than 1, 2, or 3 remain unchanged in the output copy.
  - format_output: Wrap the modified output row list within another list to create the final output grid `[[p1_out, p2_out, ...]]`.
  - return: Return the formatted output grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a list containing exactly one list (representing a single row of pixels).
2.  Extract the inner list representing the row of pixels.
3.  Create a copy of this row list to serve as the basis for the output row.
4.  Iterate through the input row from left to right to identify contiguous sequences (blocks) of blue (1) pixels. Keep track of the starting position and length of each block found.
5.  For each identified block of blue pixels:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  Select the new color based on the length:
        *   If length is 1, the new color is azure (8).
        *   If length is 2, the new color is magenta (6).
        *   If length is 3, the new color is yellow (4).
    c.  If the length is 1, 2, or 3, update the pixels in the output row copy corresponding to the block's position and length with the selected new color.
6.  Ensure that pixels originally white (0) remain white (0) in the output row copy. Blue blocks with lengths other than 1, 2, or 3 also remain unchanged (as blue).
7.  Wrap the completed output row list inside another list to match the required `list[list[int]]` grid format.
8.  Return the resulting output grid.
