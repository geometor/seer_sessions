task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of blue pixels in a single-row grid based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: Effectively 1D, represented as a grid with 1 row (e.g., shape 1xN).
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
pixel_colors:
  - input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - output: [white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length: The number of consecutive blue pixels.
      - position: The starting index of the block within the row.
relationships:
  - white (0) pixels in the input row map directly to white (0) pixels at the same position in the output row.
  - blue (1) pixels in the input row are part of contiguous blocks. The output color at these positions depends on the length of the block they belong to.
actions:
  - input_preprocessing: Extract the single row of pixels from the input grid structure (which is likely a list containing one list).
  - identify: Locate all contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels within the extracted row.
  - measure: Determine the length of each identified blue block.
  - map_length_to_color:
      - length 1 -> azure (8)
      - length 2 -> magenta (6)
      - length 3 -> yellow (4)
  - replace: For each identified blue block, replace all pixels belonging to that block in the output row with the color determined by its length according to the mapping.
  - preserve: White (0) pixels remain unchanged in their original positions.
  - output_formatting: Ensure the final output is formatted as a grid with 1 row (a list containing one list).
