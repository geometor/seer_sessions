**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt failed due to an error related to numpy array truth value ambiguity. This strongly suggests an issue with how the input data, likely a nested list representing a 2D grid even for a single row (e.g., `[[...]]`), was being processed as if it were a flat 1D list. The core logic of identifying contiguous blue blocks and mapping their lengths to specific output colors appears correct based on the examples, but the implementation needs to handle the input grid structure properly.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input structure is indeed a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[0, 1, 1, 0, ...]]`).
2.  Modify the code to extract the inner list (the actual row data) before processing it with numpy and the block-finding logic.
3.  Re-verify the block identification and color mapping logic against all training examples using the corrected input handling.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of blue pixels in a single-row grid based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: Effectively 1D, represented as a grid with 1 row (e.g., shape 1xN).
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
pixel_colors:
  - input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - output: [white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length: The number of consecutive blue pixels.
      - position: The starting index of the block within the row.
relationships:
  - white (0) pixels in the input row map directly to white (0) pixels at the same position in the output row.
  - blue (1) pixels in the input row are part of contiguous blocks. The output color at these positions depends on the length of the block they belong to.
actions:
  - input_preprocessing: Extract the single row of pixels from the input grid structure (which is likely a list containing one list).
  - identify: Locate all contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels within the extracted row.
  - measure: Determine the length of each identified blue block.
  - map_length_to_color:
      - length 1 -> azure (8)
      - length 2 -> magenta (6)
      - length 3 -> yellow (4)
  - replace: For each identified blue block, replace all pixels belonging to that block in the output row with the color determined by its length according to the mapping.
  - preserve: White (0) pixels remain unchanged in their original positions.
  - output_formatting: Ensure the final output is formatted as a grid with 1 row (a list containing one list).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a grid containing a single row of pixels (e.g., `[[p1, p2, ..., pN]]`). Extract this single row for processing.
2.  Create a copy of the extracted input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
3.  Iterate through the input row to identify the start index and length of every contiguous block of blue (1) pixels.
4.  For each identified blue block:
    a.  Get the length of the block.
    b.  Determine the new color based on the block's length:
        *   If length is 1, the new color is azure (8).
        *   If length is 2, the new color is magenta (6).
        *   If length is 3, the new color is yellow (4).
    c.  If a new color is determined (i.e., length is 1, 2, or 3), update the pixels in the output row corresponding to the block's position (from start index to start index + length) with this new color.
    d.  (Implicit) If the block length is not 1, 2, or 3, the corresponding pixels in the output row retain their original blue (1) color (as per the initial copy).
5.  Pixels that were originally white (0) in the input row remain white (0) in the output row.
6.  Format the final output row back into the grid structure (a list containing the single modified row, e.g., `[[p'1, p'2, ..., p'N]]`).
7.  Return the resulting output grid.
