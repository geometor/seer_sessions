**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 1D grid (a single row) containing white (0) and blue (1) pixels into another 1D grid of the same size. The transformation specifically targets the blue pixels, leaving the white pixels unchanged. The core logic revolves around identifying contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of blue pixels. The color used to replace the blue pixels in the output depends entirely on the length of the contiguous block they belong to in the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous blocks of blue pixels based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
pixel_colors:
  - input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - output: [white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length
relationships:
  - white (0) pixels in input map directly to white (0) pixels in output.
  - blue (1) pixels in input are part of contiguous blocks.
actions:
  - identify: contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels in the input.
  - measure: the length of each identified blue block.
  - replace:
      - if block length is 1: replace the blue (1) pixel with azure (8).
      - if block length is 2: replace the blue (1) pixels with magenta (6).
      - if block length is 3: replace the blue (1) pixels with yellow (4).
  - preserve: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels.
3.  For each identified block of blue pixels:
    a.  Determine the length of the block.
    b.  If the length is 1, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to azure (8).
    c.  If the length is 2, change the corresponding pixels in the output grid to magenta (6).
    d.  If the length is 3, change the corresponding pixels in the output grid to yellow (4).
4.  Pixels that were originally white (0) remain unchanged.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
