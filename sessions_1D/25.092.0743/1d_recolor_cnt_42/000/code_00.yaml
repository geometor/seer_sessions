task_description: Recolor contiguous blocks of blue pixels based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
pixel_colors:
  - input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - output: [white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length
relationships:
  - white (0) pixels in input map directly to white (0) pixels in output.
  - blue (1) pixels in input are part of contiguous blocks.
actions:
  - identify: contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels in the input.
  - measure: the length of each identified blue block.
  - replace:
      - if block length is 1: replace the blue (1) pixel with azure (8).
      - if block length is 2: replace the blue (1) pixels with magenta (6).
      - if block length is 3: replace the blue (1) pixels with yellow (4).
  - preserve: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
