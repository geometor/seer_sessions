The transformation specifically targets the blue pixels, leaving the white pixels unchanged. The core logic revolves around identifying contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of blue pixels. The color used to replace the blue pixels in the output depends entirely on the length of the contiguous block they belong to in the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
