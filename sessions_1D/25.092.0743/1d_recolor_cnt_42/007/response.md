"""
Recolors contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels within a 1D array (list) based on the length of the block.
- Blocks of length 1 become azure (8).
- Blocks of length 2 become magenta (6).
- Blocks of length 3 become yellow (4).
White (0) pixels and blue blocks of other lengths remain unchanged.
The input and output are 1D lists of integers.
