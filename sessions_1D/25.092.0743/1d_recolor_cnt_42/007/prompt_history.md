**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 1D grid (a single row) containing white (0) and blue (1) pixels into another 1D grid of the same size. The transformation specifically targets the blue pixels, leaving the white pixels unchanged. The core logic revolves around identifying contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of blue pixels. The color used to replace the blue pixels in the output depends entirely on the length of the contiguous block they belong to in the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous blocks of blue pixels based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
pixel_colors:
  - input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - output: [white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length
relationships:
  - white (0) pixels in input map directly to white (0) pixels in output.
  - blue (1) pixels in input are part of contiguous blocks.
actions:
  - identify: contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels in the input.
  - measure: the length of each identified blue block.
  - replace:
      - if block length is 1: replace the blue (1) pixel with azure (8).
      - if block length is 2: replace the blue (1) pixels with magenta (6).
      - if block length is 3: replace the blue (1) pixels with yellow (4).
  - preserve: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels.
3.  For each identified block of blue pixels:
    a.  Determine the length of the block.
    b.  If the length is 1, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to azure (8).
    c.  If the length is 2, change the corresponding pixels in the output grid to magenta (6).
    d.  If the length is 3, change the corresponding pixels in the output grid to yellow (4).
4.  Pixels that were originally white (0) remain unchanged.
5.  Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The previous execution failed because the `transform` function expected the input grid to be in the format `list[list[int]]` (a list containing a single row list), but the test environment appears to have provided it as a flat `list[int]`. The core logic of identifying contiguous blocks of blue pixels and recoloring them based on their length (1 -> azure, 2 -> magenta, 3 -> yellow) seems correct based on the visual inspection of the examples.

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept and process a flat list (1D array) as input and return a flat list as output, aligning with how the data seems to be passed during testing. The helper function `find_contiguous_blocks` already works correctly with a 1D array/list.

All examples conform to the same rule: identify contiguous blocks of blue (1) and replace them with a new color based on block length (1->8, 2->6, 3->4), leaving white (0) unchanged. The input/output are consistently single rows (1D arrays) of the same length.

**YAML Facts:**

    properties:

actions:
  - process_input: Treat the input as a single 1D array (list of integers).
  - identify: Find all contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels. Record their starting index and length.
  - measure: Determine the length of each identified blue block.
  - conditional_replace:
      - For each identified blue block:
          - If the length is 1, replace the blue pixel(s) in the corresponding output segment with azure (8).
          - If the length is 2, replace the blue pixel(s) in the corresponding output segment with magenta (6).
          - If the length is 3, replace the blue pixel(s) in the corresponding output segment with yellow (4).
          - (Implicit) If the length is other than 1, 2, or 3, the pixels remain blue (1) (though this case is not shown in examples).
  - preserve: White (0) pixels remain unchanged in the output.
  - return_output: Return the modified 1D array (list of integers).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a single 1D array (list) of integers.
2.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the initial output array.
3.  Iterate through the input array to identify the start index and length of all contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels.
4.  For each identified blue block:
    a.  Get the length of the block.
    b.  Determine the replacement color based on the length:
        i.  If length is 1, the color is azure (8).
        ii. If length is 2, the color is magenta (6).
        iii. If length is 3, the color is yellow (4).
    c.  If a replacement color is determined (i.e., length is 1, 2, or 3), update the pixels in the output array corresponding to the block's position (from start index to start index + length - 1) with the determined replacement color.
5.  Pixels that were originally white (0), or part of blue blocks with lengths not equal to 1, 2, or 3, remain unchanged in the output array (because it started as a copy).
6.  Return the modified output array (as a list of integers).
