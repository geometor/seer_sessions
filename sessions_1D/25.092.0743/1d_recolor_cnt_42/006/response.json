            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous execution failed because the `transform` function expected the input grid to be in the format `list[list[int]]` (a list containing a single row list), but the test environment appears to have provided it as a flat `list[int]`. The core logic of identifying contiguous blocks of blue pixels and recoloring them based on their length (1 -> azure, 2 -> magenta, 3 -> yellow) seems correct based on the visual inspection of the examples.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept and process a flat list (1D array) as input and return a flat list as output, aligning with how the data seems to be passed during testing. The helper function `find_contiguous_blocks` already works correctly with a 1D array/list.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 19)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 19)\n    *   Blue Blocks (index, length): `(2, 1)`, `(5, 2)`, `(8, 3)`, `(12, 3)`\n    *   Transformations: 1 -> 8, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 3 -> 4\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 19)\n    *   Output: `[0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 19)\n    *   Blue Blocks (index, length): `(1, 1)`, `(3, 3)`, `(8, 2)`, `(13, 2)`\n    *   Transformations: 1 -> 8, 3 -> 4, 2 -> 6, 2 -> 6\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 19)\n    *   Output: `[0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length 19)\n    *   Blue Blocks (index, length): `(1, 1)`, `(3, 3)`, `(7, 2)`, `(12, 3)`\n    *   Transformations: 1 -> 8, 3 -> 4, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4\n\nAll examples conform to the same rule: identify contiguous blocks of blue (1) and replace them with a new color based on block length (1->8, 2->6, 3->4), leaving white (0) unchanged. The input/output are consistently single rows (1D arrays) of the same length.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
