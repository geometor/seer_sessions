task_description: Recolor contiguous blocks of blue pixels in a 1D array based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row array/list)
  - size_preservation: Input and output arrays have the same length.
pixel_colors:
  - input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - output: [white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4)] # Potentially blue (1) if block length > 3
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length: The number of consecutive blue pixels.
      - start_index: The position of the first pixel in the block.
relationships:
  - white (0) pixels in the input map directly to white (0) pixels in the output at the same index.
  - blue (1) pixels in the input are part of contiguous blocks. The corresponding output pixels depend on the length of the block they belong to.
actions:
  - process_input: Treat the input as a single 1D array (list of integers).
  - identify: Find all contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels. Record their starting index and length.
  - measure: Determine the length of each identified blue block.
  - conditional_replace:
      - For each identified blue block:
          - If the length is 1, replace the blue pixel(s) in the corresponding output segment with azure (8).
          - If the length is 2, replace the blue pixel(s) in the corresponding output segment with magenta (6).
          - If the length is 3, replace the blue pixel(s) in the corresponding output segment with yellow (4).
          - (Implicit) If the length is other than 1, 2, or 3, the pixels remain blue (1) (though this case is not shown in examples).
  - preserve: White (0) pixels remain unchanged in the output.
  - return_output: Return the modified 1D array (list of integers).
