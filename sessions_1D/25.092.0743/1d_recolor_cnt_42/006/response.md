**General Assessment:**

The previous execution failed because the `transform` function expected the input grid to be in the format `list[list[int]]` (a list containing a single row list), but the test environment appears to have provided it as a flat `list[int]`. The core logic of identifying contiguous blocks of blue pixels and recoloring them based on their length (1 -> azure, 2 -> magenta, 3 -> yellow) seems correct based on the visual inspection of the examples.

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept and process a flat list (1D array) as input and return a flat list as output, aligning with how the data seems to be passed during testing. The helper function `find_contiguous_blocks` already works correctly with a 1D array/list.

All examples conform to the same rule: identify contiguous blocks of blue (1) and replace them with a new color based on block length (1->8, 2->6, 3->4), leaving white (0) unchanged. The input/output are consistently single rows (1D arrays) of the same length.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous blocks of blue pixels in a 1D array based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row array/list)
  - size_preservation: Input and output arrays have the same length.
pixel_colors:
  - input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - output: [white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4)] # Potentially blue (1) if block length > 3
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length: The number of consecutive blue pixels.
      - start_index: The position of the first pixel in the block.
relationships:
  - white (0) pixels in the input map directly to white (0) pixels in the output at the same index.
  - blue (1) pixels in the input are part of contiguous blocks. The corresponding output pixels depend on the length of the block they belong to.
actions:
  - process_input: Treat the input as a single 1D array (list of integers).
  - identify: Find all contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels. Record their starting index and length.
  - measure: Determine the length of each identified blue block.
  - conditional_replace:
      - For each identified blue block:
          - If the length is 1, replace the blue pixel(s) in the corresponding output segment with azure (8).
          - If the length is 2, replace the blue pixel(s) in the corresponding output segment with magenta (6).
          - If the length is 3, replace the blue pixel(s) in the corresponding output segment with yellow (4).
          - (Implicit) If the length is other than 1, 2, or 3, the pixels remain blue (1) (though this case is not shown in examples).
  - preserve: White (0) pixels remain unchanged in the output.
  - return_output: Return the modified 1D array (list of integers).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a single 1D array (list) of integers.
2.  Create a copy of the input array to serve as the initial output array.
3.  Iterate through the input array to identify the start index and length of all contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels.
4.  For each identified blue block:
    a.  Get the length of the block.
    b.  Determine the replacement color based on the length:
        i.  If length is 1, the color is azure (8).
        ii. If length is 2, the color is magenta (6).
        iii. If length is 3, the color is yellow (4).
    c.  If a replacement color is determined (i.e., length is 1, 2, or 3), update the pixels in the output array corresponding to the block's position (from start index to start index + length - 1) with the determined replacement color.
5.  Pixels that were originally white (0), or part of blue blocks with lengths not equal to 1, 2, or 3, remain unchanged in the output array (because it started as a copy).
6.  Return the modified output array (as a list of integers).
