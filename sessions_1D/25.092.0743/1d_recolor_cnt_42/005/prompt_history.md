**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 1D grid (a single row) containing white (0) and blue (1) pixels into another 1D grid of the same size. The transformation specifically targets the blue pixels, leaving the white pixels unchanged. The core logic revolves around identifying contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of blue pixels. The color used to replace the blue pixels in the output depends entirely on the length of the contiguous block they belong to in the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous blocks of blue pixels based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
pixel_colors:
  - input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - output: [white (0), azure (8), magenta (6), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - length
relationships:
  - white (0) pixels in input map directly to white (0) pixels in output.
  - blue (1) pixels in input are part of contiguous blocks.
actions:
  - identify: contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels in the input.
  - measure: the length of each identified blue block.
  - replace:
      - if block length is 1: replace the blue (1) pixel with azure (8).
      - if block length is 2: replace the blue (1) pixels with magenta (6).
      - if block length is 3: replace the blue (1) pixels with yellow (4).
  - preserve: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find contiguous horizontal blocks of blue (1) pixels.
3.  For each identified block of blue pixels:
    a.  Determine the length of the block.
    b.  If the length is 1, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to azure (8).
    c.  If the length is 2, change the corresponding pixels in the output grid to magenta (6).
    d.  If the length is 3, change the corresponding pixels in the output grid to yellow (4).
4.  Pixels that were originally white (0) remain unchanged.
5.  Return the modified output grid.

## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the core transformation logic: identifying contiguous blocks of blue pixels (1) in a single-row input and recoloring them based on their length (1 -> azure/8, 2 -> magenta/6, 3 -> yellow/4), while preserving white pixels (0).

The failure occurred because the code's input format handling logic raised a `ValueError`. This suggests the input format provided during testing did not match either the primary expected format (`list[list[int]]`) or the alternative flat list format (`list[int]`) that the code attempted to handle.

The strategy is to simplify the input handling, strictly adhering to the standard ARC format where grids are represented as `list[list[int]]`, even for single rows. We will assume the input `transform` function receives is `[[pixel1, pixel2, ...]]` and expect the output to be in the same format. The core block-finding and recoloring logic remains the same.

## Metrics

Based on the examples:

*   **Dimensionality:** All inputs and outputs represent 1D sequences (single rows).
*   **Grid Size:** Input and output grids have the same width (19 pixels in all examples). Height is 1 for all.
*   **Input Colors:** White (0), Blue (1).
*   **Output Colors:** White (0), Azure (8), Magenta (6), Yellow (4).
*   **Transformation Rule:**
    *   White (0) -> White (0)
    *   Blue (1) block of length 1 -> Azure (8)
    *   Blue (1) block of length 2 -> Magenta (6)
    *   Blue (1) block of length 3 -> Yellow (4)
*   **Consistency:** This rule holds across all three training examples.

Example 1 Breakdown:
Input: `[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`

Output: `[[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Matches rule: 1->8, 2->6, 3->4, 3->4)

Input: `[[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
Blue blocks (index, length): (1, 1), (3, 3), (8, 2), (13, 2)
Output: `[[0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Matches rule: 1->8, 3->4, 2->6, 2->6)

Blue blocks (index, length): (1, 1), (3, 3), (7, 2), (12, 3)
Output: `[[0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]` (Matches rule: 1->8, 3->4, 2->6, 3->4)

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a list containing exactly one list (representing a single row of pixels).
2.  Extract the inner list representing the row of pixels.
3.  Create a copy of this row list to serve as the basis for the output row.
4.  Iterate through the input row from left to right to identify contiguous sequences (blocks) of blue (1) pixels. Keep track of the starting position and length of each block found.
5.  For each identified block of blue pixels:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  Select the new color based on the length:
        *   If length is 1, the new color is azure (8).
        *   If length is 2, the new color is magenta (6).
        *   If length is 3, the new color is yellow (4).
    c.  If the length is 1, 2, or 3, update the pixels in the output row copy corresponding to the block's position and length with the selected new color.
6.  Ensure that pixels originally white (0) remain white (0) in the output row copy. Blue blocks with lengths other than 1, 2, or 3 also remain unchanged (as blue).
7.  Wrap the completed output row list inside another list to match the required `list[list[int]]` grid format.
8.  Return the resulting output grid.
