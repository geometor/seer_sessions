            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code correctly implemented the core logic derived from the examples: identify contiguous horizontal blocks of blue pixels (1) and replace them with a specific color based on the block's length (1->red(2), 2->maroon(9), 3->gray(5)), while leaving white pixels (0) unchanged. The logic was verified manually against all training examples and found to be consistent.\n\nThe execution error (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...\") strongly suggests an unexpected interaction with array-like objects, likely NumPy arrays, within the testing environment, rather than a flaw in the transformation logic itself. The code was written assuming standard Python lists, but the environment might be passing NumPy arrays.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge the potential input type mismatch (list of lists vs. NumPy array). The core algorithm remains valid.\n2.  Refine the natural language program and documentation to be clear about the algorithm, independent of the specific data structure implementation details, while noting the assumption that the input represents a single row of pixels.\n3.  Use `tool_code` to demonstrate the block identification and mapping process programmatically for one example, confirming the core logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Example: train_1):**\n"
