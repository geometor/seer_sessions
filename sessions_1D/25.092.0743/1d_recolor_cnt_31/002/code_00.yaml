Task: Color mapping based on horizontal block length in a single-row grid.

Input_Grid:
  - type: Single-row grid (represented as a sequence/array of integers).
  - colors_present: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - structure: Pixels are arranged linearly.

Output_Grid:
  - type: Single-row grid (sequence/array of integers).
  - colors_present: [white (0), red (2), gray (5), maroon (9)]
  - size: Same length as the input row.

Objects:
  - type: Contiguous horizontal block of pixels.
  - relevant_color: blue (1)
  - property: length (count of pixels in the block).
  - location: Defined by start index and end index within the row.
  - background: white (0) pixels separate the blue blocks.

Transformations:
  - identity: White (0) pixels remain white (0).
  - conditional_recolor: Blue (1) pixels are recolored based on the length of the contiguous block they belong to.
  - rules:
    - If a blue block has length 1, all pixels in that block become red (2).
    - If a blue block has length 2, all pixels in that block become maroon (9).
    - If a blue block has length 3, all pixels in that block become gray (5).
  - scope: The transformation is applied independently to each identified blue block.
  - assumption: Only block lengths 1, 2, and 3 for blue pixels require transformation; other lengths, if they occurred, are not defined by the examples.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Contiguous blue pixels form blocks.
  - Dependency: The output color of a position depends on whether the input pixel is white or blue, and if blue, on the length of the horizontal block it belongs to.
