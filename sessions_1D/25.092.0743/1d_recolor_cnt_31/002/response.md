**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code correctly implemented the core logic derived from the examples: identify contiguous horizontal blocks of blue pixels (1) and replace them with a specific color based on the block's length (1->red(2), 2->maroon(9), 3->gray(5)), while leaving white pixels (0) unchanged. The logic was verified manually against all training examples and found to be consistent.

The execution error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly suggests an unexpected interaction with array-like objects, likely NumPy arrays, within the testing environment, rather than a flaw in the transformation logic itself. The code was written assuming standard Python lists, but the environment might be passing NumPy arrays.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge the potential input type mismatch (list of lists vs. NumPy array). The core algorithm remains valid.
2.  Refine the natural language program and documentation to be clear about the algorithm, independent of the specific data structure implementation details, while noting the assumption that the input represents a single row of pixels.
3.  Use `tool_code` to demonstrate the block identification and mapping process programmatically for one example, confirming the core logic.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Color mapping based on horizontal block length in a single-row grid.

Input_Grid:
  - type: Single-row grid (represented as a sequence/array of integers).
  - colors_present: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - structure: Pixels are arranged linearly.

Output_Grid:
  - type: Single-row grid (sequence/array of integers).
  - colors_present: [white (0), red (2), gray (5), maroon (9)]
  - size: Same length as the input row.

Objects:
  - type: Contiguous horizontal block of pixels.
  - relevant_color: blue (1)
  - property: length (count of pixels in the block).
  - location: Defined by start index and end index within the row.
  - background: white (0) pixels separate the blue blocks.

Transformations:
  - identity: White (0) pixels remain white (0).
  - conditional_recolor: Blue (1) pixels are recolored based on the length of the contiguous block they belong to.
  - rules:
    - If a blue block has length 1, all pixels in that block become red (2).
    - If a blue block has length 2, all pixels in that block become maroon (9).
    - If a blue block has length 3, all pixels in that block become gray (5).
  - scope: The transformation is applied independently to each identified blue block.
  - assumption: Only block lengths 1, 2, and 3 for blue pixels require transformation; other lengths, if they occurred, are not defined by the examples.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Contiguous blue pixels form blocks.
  - Dependency: The output color of a position depends on whether the input pixel is white or blue, and if blue, on the length of the horizontal block it belongs to.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input, which represents a single row of pixels containing white (0) and blue (1).
2.  Create an output row of the same length, initially identical to the input row.
3.  Iterate through the input row pixel by pixel, keeping track of the current position (index).
4.  If the current pixel is white (0), leave the corresponding pixel in the output row as white (0) and move to the next pixel.
5.  If the current pixel is blue (1):
    a.  Identify the full contiguous horizontal block of blue (1) pixels starting at the current position. Determine its length.
    b.  Define the mapping rule for block length to output color: length 1 maps to red (2), length 2 maps to maroon (9), length 3 maps to gray (5).
    c.  Check if the determined block length has a defined mapping (1, 2, or 3).
    d.  If a mapping exists, replace all pixels in the output row corresponding to this block's positions with the mapped color (red, maroon, or gray).
    e.  Advance the iteration index past the end of the identified block (i.e., index = index + block length).
6.  If the current pixel was blue (1) but its block length did not match 1, 2, or 3 (based on the examples, this case doesn't occur, but if it did, the pixels would remain blue (1) as per the initial copy, unless a different rule applies), advance the iteration index past the end of the identified block.
7.  Continue iterating until the end of the row is reached.
8.  Return the final transformed output row.
