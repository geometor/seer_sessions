Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or sequences of numbers, likely representing single-row grids.
2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses only white (0) and blue (1). The output uses white (0), red (2), gray (5), and maroon (9).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to operate on contiguous blocks of the blue color (1). The white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions.
4.  **Block-Based Rule:** The color replacing the blue pixels depends on the length of the contiguous block of blue pixels.
    *   In `train_1`, a block of three `1`s becomes three `5`s. A block of one `1` becomes one `2`. Blocks of two `1`s become two `9`s.
    *   This pattern holds consistently across `train_2` and `train_3`.
5.  **Rule Summary:**
    *   White (0) maps to White (0).
    *   A contiguous block of one Blue (1) maps to Red (2).
    *   A contiguous block of two Blue (1)s maps to Maroon (9)s.
    *   A contiguous block of three Blue (1)s maps to Gray (5)s.

Task: Color mapping based on horizontal block length

Input_Grid:
  - type: 1D array (or single-row grid)
  - colors_present: [white (0), blue (1)]

Output_Grid:
  - type: 1D array (or single-row grid)
  - colors_present: [white (0), red (2), gray (5), maroon (9)]
  - size: Same as input

Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
  - color: blue (1)
  - property: length (number of pixels in the block)

Transformations:
  - type: color change
  - input_pixels: blue (1)
  - output_pixels: determined by the length of the blue block they belong to
  - rules:
    - white (0) pixels remain white (0).

    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 2 become maroon (9).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 3 become gray (5).

Relationships:
  - The output color for a blue pixel depends on the count of contiguous blue pixels it is part of horizontally.
  - White pixels act as separators for blue blocks.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence with the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros (or copied from the input).
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy it to the corresponding position in the output sequence and continue to the next pixel.
4.  If the current pixel is blue (1):
    a.  Determine the length of the contiguous block of blue pixels starting at the current position.
    b.  Based on the block length:
        i.  If the length is 1, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output sequence with red (2).
        ii. If the length is 2, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output sequence with maroon (9).
        iii. If the length is 3, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output sequence with gray (5).
    c.  Advance the iteration index past the processed block (by the length of the block).
5.  Return the completed output sequence.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code correctly implemented the core logic derived from the examples: identify contiguous horizontal blocks of blue pixels (1) and replace them with a specific color based on the block's length (1->red(2), 2->maroon(9), 3->gray(5)), while leaving white pixels (0) unchanged. The logic was verified manually against all training examples and found to be consistent.

The execution error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly suggests an unexpected interaction with array-like objects, likely NumPy arrays, within the testing environment, rather than a flaw in the transformation logic itself. The code was written assuming standard Python lists, but the environment might be passing NumPy arrays.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge the potential input type mismatch (list of lists vs. NumPy array). The core algorithm remains valid.
2.  Refine the natural language program and documentation to be clear about the algorithm, independent of the specific data structure implementation details, while noting the assumption that the input represents a single row of pixels.
3.  Use `tool_code` to demonstrate the block identification and mapping process programmatically for one example, confirming the core logic.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Color mapping based on horizontal block length in a single-row grid.

Input_Grid:
  - type: Single-row grid (represented as a sequence/array of integers).
  - colors_present: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - structure: Pixels are arranged linearly.

Output_Grid:
  - type: Single-row grid (sequence/array of integers).
  - colors_present: [white (0), red (2), gray (5), maroon (9)]
  - size: Same length as the input row.

Objects:
  - type: Contiguous horizontal block of pixels.
  - relevant_color: blue (1)
  - property: length (count of pixels in the block).
  - location: Defined by start index and end index within the row.
  - background: white (0) pixels separate the blue blocks.

Transformations:
  - identity: White (0) pixels remain white (0).
  - conditional_recolor: Blue (1) pixels are recolored based on the length of the contiguous block they belong to.
  - rules:
    - If a blue block has length 1, all pixels in that block become red (2).
    - If a blue block has length 2, all pixels in that block become maroon (9).
    - If a blue block has length 3, all pixels in that block become gray (5).
  - scope: The transformation is applied independently to each identified blue block.
  - assumption: Only block lengths 1, 2, and 3 for blue pixels require transformation; other lengths, if they occurred, are not defined by the examples.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Contiguous blue pixels form blocks.
  - Dependency: The output color of a position depends on whether the input pixel is white or blue, and if blue, on the length of the horizontal block it belongs to.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input, which represents a single row of pixels containing white (0) and blue (1).
2.  Create an output row of the same length, initially identical to the input row.
3.  Iterate through the input row pixel by pixel, keeping track of the current position (index).
4.  If the current pixel is white (0), leave the corresponding pixel in the output row as white (0) and move to the next pixel.
5.  If the current pixel is blue (1):
    a.  Identify the full contiguous horizontal block of blue (1) pixels starting at the current position. Determine its length.
    b.  Define the mapping rule for block length to output color: length 1 maps to red (2), length 2 maps to maroon (9), length 3 maps to gray (5).
    c.  Check if the determined block length has a defined mapping (1, 2, or 3).
    d.  If a mapping exists, replace all pixels in the output row corresponding to this block's positions with the mapped color (red, maroon, or gray).
    e.  Advance the iteration index past the end of the identified block (i.e., index = index + block length).
6.  If the current pixel was blue (1) but its block length did not match 1, 2, or 3 (based on the examples, this case doesn't occur, but if it did, the pixels would remain blue (1) as per the initial copy, unless a different rule applies), advance the iteration index past the end of the identified block.
7.  Continue iterating until the end of the row is reached.
8.  Return the final transformed output row.
