Task: Recolor horizontal blocks of blue pixels based on their length.

Input_Grid:
  - type: 1xN grid (represented as list of lists or NumPy array)
  - colors_present: [white (0), blue (1)]

Output_Grid:
  - type: 1xN grid (same dimensions and format as input)
  - colors_present: [white (0), red (2), gray (5), maroon (9)]

Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block of pixels
  - source_color: blue (1)
  - defining_property: length (count of pixels in the block)
  - boundary: Blocks are separated by non-blue (i.e., white '0') pixels or grid edges.

Transformations:
  - type: conditional color replacement
  - target: pixels within blue (1) blocks
  - condition: length of the block the pixel belongs to
  - rules:
    - white (0) pixels: remain white (0).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 1: change to red (2).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 2: change to maroon (9).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 3: change to gray (5).
    - blue (1) pixels in blocks of other lengths: remain blue (1) (inferred, as only lengths 1, 2, 3 are shown changing).

Relationships:
  - The output color of a pixel depends only on its initial color and, if blue, the length of the contiguous horizontal block of blue pixels it is part of.
  - Positional integrity is maintained; only colors are changed.
