            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly indicates that the `transform` function received an input type it wasn't fully prepared for, most likely a NumPy array instead of a standard Python list of lists. Comparisons like `if pixel_color == 1:` fail when `pixel_color` is an array object rather than a scalar integer.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the input handling within the `transform` function to correctly extract the single row of pixel data, regardless of whether the input `input_grid` is a Python `list[list[int]]` or a NumPy array (likely shape `(1, N)`). Convert the extracted row to a standard Python list for consistent processing.\n2.  Ensure all subsequent comparisons and logic operate on scalar integer values extracted from this list.\n3.  The core transformation logic (identifying blue blocks, checking length, mapping to output color) appears correct based on the examples and does not need to change conceptually. The focus is on fixing the data type/handling issue.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nThe errors prevented the code from running, so no metrics could be gathered about output differences. The core assumptions about the transformation rule, however, can be re-verified against the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`\n    *   Block `1 1 1` (length 3) -> `5 5 5`\n    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`\n    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`\n    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`\n    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`\n    *   Output: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0]` (Matches example output)\n*   **Example 2:** Input `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Block `1 1 1` (length 3) -> `5 5 5`\n    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`\n    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`\n    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`\n    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`\n    *   Output: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches example output)\n*   **Example 3:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]`\n    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`\n    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`\n    *   Block `1 1 1` (length 3) -> `5 5 5`\n    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`\n    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2]` (Matches example output)\n\nThe transformation logic holds perfectly across all examples. The issue was purely in the implementation's handling of the input data structure/type.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
