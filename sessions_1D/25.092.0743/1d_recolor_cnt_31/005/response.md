"""
Transforms a single-row input grid by identifying contiguous horizontal blocks of blue pixels (1). 
White pixels (0) remain unchanged. Blue pixels (1) are recolored based on the length of the block they belong to:
- Length 1: become red (2)
- Length 2: become maroon (9)
- Length 3: become gray (5)
Blocks of other lengths remain unchanged (blue, 1).
The input can be a list of lists or a NumPy array, but is expected to represent a 1xN grid.
The output is returned as a list of lists.
