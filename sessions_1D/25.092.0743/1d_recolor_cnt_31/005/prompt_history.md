## train_1

**input:**
```

```

```

Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or sequences of numbers, likely representing single-row grids.
2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses only white (0) and blue (1). The output uses white (0), red (2), gray (5), and maroon (9).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to operate on contiguous blocks of the blue color (1). The white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions.
4.  **Block-Based Rule:** The color replacing the blue pixels depends on the length of the contiguous block of blue pixels.
    *   In `train_1`, a block of three `1`s becomes three `5`s. A block of one `1` becomes one `2`. Blocks of two `1`s become two `9`s.
    *   This pattern holds consistently across `train_2` and `train_3`.
5.  **Rule Summary:**
    *   White (0) maps to White (0).
    *   A contiguous block of one Blue (1) maps to Red (2).
    *   A contiguous block of two Blue (1)s maps to Maroon (9)s.
    *   A contiguous block of three Blue (1)s maps to Gray (5)s.

**Facts:**

Task: Color mapping based on horizontal block length

Input_Grid:
  - type: 1D array (or single-row grid)
  - colors_present: [white (0), blue (1)]

Output_Grid:
  - type: 1D array (or single-row grid)
  - colors_present: [white (0), red (2), gray (5), maroon (9)]
  - size: Same as input

Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
  - color: blue (1)
  - property: length (number of pixels in the block)

Transformations:
  - type: color change
  - input_pixels: blue (1)
  - output_pixels: determined by the length of the blue block they belong to
  - rules:
    - white (0) pixels remain white (0).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 1 become red (2).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 2 become maroon (9).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 3 become gray (5).

Relationships:
  - The output color for a blue pixel depends on the count of contiguous blue pixels it is part of horizontally.
  - White pixels act as separators for blue blocks.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence with the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros (or copied from the input).
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy it to the corresponding position in the output sequence and continue to the next pixel.
4.  If the current pixel is blue (1):
    a.  Determine the length of the contiguous block of blue pixels starting at the current position.
    b.  Based on the block length:
        i.  If the length is 1, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output sequence with red (2).
        ii. If the length is 2, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output sequence with maroon (9).
        iii. If the length is 3, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output sequence with gray (5).
    c.  Advance the iteration index past the processed block (by the length of the block).
5.  Return the completed output sequence.

## Example 3:

**Assessment and Strategy**

The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that the `transform` function received an input type it wasn't fully prepared for, most likely a NumPy array instead of a standard Python list of lists. Comparisons like `if pixel_color == 1:` fail when `pixel_color` is an array object rather than a scalar integer.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the input handling within the `transform` function to correctly extract the single row of pixel data, regardless of whether the input `input_grid` is a Python `list[list[int]]` or a NumPy array (likely shape `(1, N)`). Convert the extracted row to a standard Python list for consistent processing.
2.  Ensure all subsequent comparisons and logic operate on scalar integer values extracted from this list.
3.  The core transformation logic (identifying blue blocks, checking length, mapping to output color) appears correct based on the examples and does not need to change conceptually. The focus is on fixing the data type/handling issue.

**Metrics Gathering**

The errors prevented the code from running, so no metrics could be gathered about output differences. The core assumptions about the transformation rule, however, can be re-verified against the examples:

*   **Example 1:** Input `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`
    *   Block `1 1 1` (length 3) -> `5 5 5`
    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`
    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`
    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`
    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`
    *   Output: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0]` (Matches example output)
*   **Example 2:** Input `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Block `1 1 1` (length 3) -> `5 5 5`
    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`
    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`
    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`
    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`
    *   Output: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches example output)
*   **Example 3:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]`
    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`
    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`
    *   Block `1 1 1` (length 3) -> `5 5 5`
    *   Block `1 1` (length 2) -> `9 9`
    *   Block `1` (length 1) -> `2`
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2]` (Matches example output)

The transformation logic holds perfectly across all examples. The issue was purely in the implementation's handling of the input data structure/type.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Task: Recolor horizontal blocks of blue pixels based on their length.

Input_Grid:
  - type: 1xN grid (represented as list of lists or NumPy array)
  - colors_present: [white (0), blue (1)]

Output_Grid:
  - type: 1xN grid (same dimensions and format as input)
  - colors_present: [white (0), red (2), gray (5), maroon (9)]

Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block of pixels
  - source_color: blue (1)
  - defining_property: length (count of pixels in the block)
  - boundary: Blocks are separated by non-blue (i.e., white '0') pixels or grid edges.

Transformations:
  - type: conditional color replacement
  - target: pixels within blue (1) blocks
  - condition: length of the block the pixel belongs to
  - rules:
    - white (0) pixels: remain white (0).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 1: change to red (2).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 2: change to maroon (9).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 3: change to gray (5).
    - blue (1) pixels in blocks of other lengths: remain blue (1) (inferred, as only lengths 1, 2, 3 are shown changing).

Relationships:
  - The output color of a pixel depends only on its initial color and, if blue, the length of the contiguous horizontal block of blue pixels it is part of.
  - Positional integrity is maintained; only colors are changed.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid, which represents a single row of pixels (potentially as a list containing one list, a flat list, or a 1xN NumPy array).
2.  Extract this single row of pixel values and store it as a standard list.
3.  Create a copy of this list to serve as the output row.
4.  Iterate through the input row list using an index, checking each pixel.
5.  If the pixel at the current index is white (0), leave the corresponding pixel in the output row unchanged and advance the index by 1.
6.  If the pixel at the current index is blue (1):
    a.  Measure the length of the contiguous block of blue (1) pixels starting from the current index.
    b.  Check the measured block length:
        i.  If the length is 1, set the corresponding pixel(s) in the output row to red (2).
        ii. If the length is 2, set the corresponding pixel(s) in the output row to maroon (9).
        iii. If the length is 3, set the corresponding pixel(s) in the output row to gray (5).
        iv. If the length is other than 1, 2, or 3, leave the corresponding blue pixel(s) in the output row unchanged.
    c.  Advance the index by the measured block length to move past the processed block.
7.  After iterating through the entire input row, return the modified output row, formatted as a list containing that single row (e.g., `[output_row]`).
