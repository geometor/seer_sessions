Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or sequences of numbers, likely representing single-row grids.
2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses only white (0) and blue (1). The output uses white (0), red (2), gray (5), and maroon (9).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to operate on contiguous blocks of the blue color (1). The white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions.
4.  **Block-Based Rule:** The color replacing the blue pixels depends on the length of the contiguous block of blue pixels.
    *   In `train_1`, a block of three `1`s becomes three `5`s. A block of one `1` becomes one `2`. Blocks of two `1`s become two `9`s.
    *   This pattern holds consistently across `train_2` and `train_3`.
5.  **Rule Summary:**
    *   White (0) maps to White (0).
    *   A contiguous block of one Blue (1) maps to Red (2).
    *   A contiguous block of two Blue (1)s maps to Maroon (9)s.
    *   A contiguous block of three Blue (1)s maps to Gray (5)s.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Color mapping based on horizontal block length

Input_Grid:
  - type: 1D array (or single-row grid)
  - colors_present: [white (0), blue (1)]

Output_Grid:
  - type: 1D array (or single-row grid)
  - colors_present: [white (0), red (2), gray (5), maroon (9)]
  - size: Same as input

Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
  - color: blue (1)
  - property: length (number of pixels in the block)

Transformations:
  - type: color change
  - input_pixels: blue (1)
  - output_pixels: determined by the length of the blue block they belong to
  - rules:
    - white (0) pixels remain white (0).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 1 become red (2).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 2 become maroon (9).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 3 become gray (5).

Relationships:
  - The output color for a blue pixel depends on the count of contiguous blue pixels it is part of horizontally.
  - White pixels act as separators for blue blocks.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence with the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros (or copied from the input).
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy it to the corresponding position in the output sequence and continue to the next pixel.
4.  If the current pixel is blue (1):
    a.  Determine the length of the contiguous block of blue pixels starting at the current position.
    b.  Based on the block length:
        i.  If the length is 1, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output sequence with red (2).
        ii. If the length is 2, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output sequence with maroon (9).
        iii. If the length is 3, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output sequence with gray (5).
    c.  Advance the iteration index past the processed block (by the length of the block).
5.  Return the completed output sequence.
