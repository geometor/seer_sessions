            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be one-dimensional arrays or sequences of numbers, likely representing single-row grids.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses only white (0) and blue (1). The output uses white (0), red (2), gray (5), and maroon (9).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to operate on contiguous blocks of the blue color (1). The white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions.\n4.  **Block-Based Rule:** The color replacing the blue pixels depends on the length of the contiguous block of blue pixels.\n    *   In `train_1`, a block of three `1`s becomes three `5`s. A block of one `1` becomes one `2`. Blocks of two `1`s become two `9`s.\n    *   This pattern holds consistently across `train_2` and `train_3`.\n5.  **Rule Summary:**\n    *   White (0) maps to White (0).\n    *   A contiguous block of one Blue (1) maps to Red (2).\n    *   A contiguous block of two Blue (1)s maps to Maroon (9)s.\n    *   A contiguous block of three Blue (1)s maps to Gray (5)s.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
