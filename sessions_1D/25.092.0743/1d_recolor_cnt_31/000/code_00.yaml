Task: Color mapping based on horizontal block length

Input_Grid:
  - type: 1D array (or single-row grid)
  - colors_present: [white (0), blue (1)]

Output_Grid:
  - type: 1D array (or single-row grid)
  - colors_present: [white (0), red (2), gray (5), maroon (9)]
  - size: Same as input

Objects:
  - type: contiguous horizontal block
  - color: blue (1)
  - property: length (number of pixels in the block)

Transformations:
  - type: color change
  - input_pixels: blue (1)
  - output_pixels: determined by the length of the blue block they belong to
  - rules:
    - white (0) pixels remain white (0).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 1 become red (2).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 2 become maroon (9).
    - blue (1) pixels in a block of length 3 become gray (5).

Relationships:
  - The output color for a blue pixel depends on the count of contiguous blue pixels it is part of horizontally.
  - White pixels act as separators for blue blocks.
