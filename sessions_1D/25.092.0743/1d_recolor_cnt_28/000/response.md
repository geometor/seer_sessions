*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input consists of a 1D array (or a 1xN grid) containing only white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
    *   The output is a 1D array of the same size as the input.
    *   The output contains white (0), yellow (4), azure (8), and maroon (9) pixels.
    *   White pixels (0) in the input remain white (0) in the output.
    *   Contiguous sequences of blue pixels (1) in the input are replaced by sequences of a single, different color in the output.
    *   The replacement color depends on the length of the contiguous blue sequence.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: color_replacement_based_on_length
    input_features:
      colors: [white (0), blue (1)]
      dimensionality: 1D array (or 1xN grid)
      objects:
        - type: background
          color: white (0)
          behavior: remains unchanged
        - type: sequence
          color: blue (1)
          property: contiguous
          attribute: length
          behavior: replaced by a new color sequence of the same length
    output_features:
      colors: [white (0), yellow (4), azure (8), maroon (9)]
      dimensionality: 1D array (or 1xN grid)
      structure: derived from input structure
    transformation_logic:
      - identify: contiguous sequences of blue (1) pixels in the input.
      - map_length_to_color:
          length_1: maroon (9)
          length_2: azure (8)
          length_3: yellow (4)
      - action: replace the entire blue sequence with the mapped color.
      - preservation: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
    relationships:
      - The length of a blue sequence in the input determines the color used for replacement in the output.
      - The position and length of the replacement sequence match the original blue sequence.
      - White pixels maintain their position and color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output array of the same dimensions as the input array, initially filled with the input values.
    2.  Iterate through the input array to find contiguous horizontal sequences of blue (1) pixels.
    3.  For each identified blue sequence:
        a.  Determine the length of the sequence.
        b.  Select a replacement color based on the sequence length:
            *   If the length is 1, the replacement color is maroon (9).
            *   If the length is 2, the replacement color is azure (8).
            *   If the length is 3, the replacement color is yellow (4).
        c.  In the output array, replace all the pixels corresponding to the identified blue sequence with the selected replacement color.
    4.  Return the modified output array. White (0) pixels are implicitly preserved as they are not part of any blue sequence modification.
