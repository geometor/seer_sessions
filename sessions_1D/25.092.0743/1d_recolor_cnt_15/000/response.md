Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.

## Perception

The input grids are single rows containing white (0) pixels and orange (7) pixels. The orange pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of varying lengths, separated by white pixels.

The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids. The white pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color. The key transformation occurs with the orange pixels. Each contiguous block of orange pixels in the input is replaced by a block of the same size but with a different color in the output. The specific output color depends solely on the *length* (number of pixels) of the original orange block.

Observing the examples:
- A single orange pixel (length 1) becomes an azure (8) pixel.
- A block of two orange pixels (length 2) becomes a block of two gray (5) pixels.
- A block of three orange pixels (length 3) becomes a block of three maroon (9) pixels.

The transformation rule seems to be: identify contiguous horizontal blocks of orange pixels, determine their length, and replace them with blocks of the same length using a color determined by that length (1->8, 2->5, 3->9). White pixels are unaffected.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of orange pixels based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (represented as 2D grid with height 1)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - contiguity: horizontal
      - length: variable (1, 2, or 3 observed)
actions:
  - identify: contiguous horizontal segments of orange (7) pixels.
  - measure: the length (number of pixels) of each identified segment.
  - map: segment length to a specific output color.
  - replace: the pixels of each orange segment with the mapped output color.
relationships:
  - mapping:
      input_color: orange (7)
      property: segment_length
      output_color_map:
        1: azure (8)
        2: gray (5)
        3: maroon (9)
  - invariance: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid identical in size to the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid from left to right.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy its value to the corresponding position in the output grid.
4.  If the current pixel is orange (7) and has not already been processed as part of a block:
    a.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of orange (7) pixels starting at the current position.
    b.  Measure the length (number of pixels) of this block.
    c.  Determine the target color based on the block length:
        *   If length is 1, the target color is azure (8).
        *   If length is 2, the target color is gray (5).
        *   If length is 3, the target color is maroon (9).
    d.  Fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with the determined target color for the entire length of the block.
    e.  Mark the pixels belonging to this block in the input as processed (to avoid re-processing).
5.  Continue iterating until all input pixels are processed.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
