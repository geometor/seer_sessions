            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\nThe input grids are single rows containing white (0) pixels and orange (7) pixels. The orange pixels form contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of varying lengths, separated by white pixels.\n\nThe output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids. The white pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color. The key transformation occurs with the orange pixels. Each contiguous block of orange pixels in the input is replaced by a block of the same size but with a different color in the output. The specific output color depends solely on the *length* (number of pixels) of the original orange block.\n\nObserving the examples:\n- A single orange pixel (length 1) becomes an azure (8) pixel.\n- A block of two orange pixels (length 2) becomes a block of two gray (5) pixels.\n- A block of three orange pixels (length 3) becomes a block of three maroon (9) pixels.\n\nThe transformation rule seems to be: identify contiguous horizontal blocks of orange pixels, determine their length, and replace them with blocks of the same length using a color determined by that length (1->8, 2->5, 3->9). White pixels are unaffected.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
