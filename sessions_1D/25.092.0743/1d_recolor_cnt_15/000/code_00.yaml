task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of orange pixels based on their length.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (represented as 2D grid with height 1)
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: segment
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - contiguity: horizontal
      - length: variable (1, 2, or 3 observed)
actions:
  - identify: contiguous horizontal segments of orange (7) pixels.
  - measure: the length (number of pixels) of each identified segment.
  - map: segment length to a specific output color.
  - replace: the pixels of each orange segment with the mapped output color.
relationships:
  - mapping:
      input_color: orange (7)
      property: segment_length
      output_color_map:
        1: azure (8)
        2: gray (5)
        3: maroon (9)
  - invariance: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
