Task: Recolor azure segments based on their length.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Represents a 1D sequence of pixels.
  - Pixels:
    - Background: White (0).
    - Active: Azure (8).
  - Objects:
    - Type: Contiguous horizontal segments of azure pixels.
    - Properties:
      - Color: Azure (8).
      - Length: Varies (1, 2, or 3 in examples).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels:
    - Background: White (0) (unchanged).
    - Transformed: Pixels corresponding to input azure segments are recolored.
  - Objects:
    - Type: Contiguous horizontal segments resulting from the transformation.
    - Properties:
      - Color: Determined by the length of the original azure segment.
        - Length 1 -> Magenta (6)
        - Length 2 -> Red (2)
        - Length 3 -> Blue (1)
      - Length: Same as the original azure segment.

Relationships:
  - Transformation: Input azure segments are mapped to output segments of the same size but different colors.
  - Rule: The color of the output segment is solely dependent on the length of the corresponding input azure segment.
  - Context: White background pixels are preserved.

Examples_Mapping:
  - Length 1 (Azure 8) -> Color Magenta (6)
  - Length 2 (Azure 8 8) -> Color Red (2 2)
  - Length 3 (Azure 8 8 8) -> Color Blue (1 1 1)
