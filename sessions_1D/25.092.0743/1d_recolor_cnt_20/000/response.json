A segment of three azure pixels (`8 8 8`) becomes blue (`1 1 1`). A segment of two azure pixels (`8 8`) becomes red (`2 2`).\n*   `train_2` and `train_3` confirm this pattern:\n    *   Azure segments of length 1 are replaced with magenta (6).\n    *   Azure segments of length 2 are replaced with red (2).\n    *   Azure segments of length 3 are replaced with blue (1).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
