Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input and output are presented as single rows (or 1xN grids).
The input consists primarily of white pixels (0) interspersed with segments of azure pixels (8).
The output maintains the same dimensions and the positions of the white pixels.
The segments of azure pixels in the input are replaced by segments of the same length but with different colors in the output.
The replacement color appears to be determined by the *length* of the azure segment.

*   In `train_1`, a single azure pixel (`8`) becomes magenta (`6`). A segment of three azure pixels (`8 8 8`) becomes blue (`1 1 1`). A segment of two azure pixels (`8 8`) becomes red (`2 2`).
*   `train_2` and `train_3` confirm this pattern:
    *   Azure segments of length 1 are replaced with magenta (6).
    *   Azure segments of length 2 are replaced with red (2).
    *   Azure segments of length 3 are replaced with blue (1).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Recolor azure segments based on their length.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: Represents a 1D sequence of pixels.
  - Pixels:
    - Background: White (0).
    - Active: Azure (8).
  - Objects:
    - Type: Contiguous horizontal segments of azure pixels.
    - Properties:
      - Color: Azure (8).
      - Length: Varies (1, 2, or 3 in examples).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels:
    - Background: White (0) (unchanged).
    - Transformed: Pixels corresponding to input azure segments are recolored.
  - Objects:
    - Type: Contiguous horizontal segments resulting from the transformation.
    - Properties:
      - Color: Determined by the length of the original azure segment.
        - Length 1 -> Magenta (6)
        - Length 2 -> Red (2)
        - Length 3 -> Blue (1)
      - Length: Same as the original azure segment.

Relationships:
  - Transformation: Input azure segments are mapped to output segments of the same size but different colors.
  - Rule: The color of the output segment is solely dependent on the length of the corresponding input azure segment.
  - Context: White background pixels are preserved.

Examples_Mapping:
  - Length 1 (Azure 8) -> Color Magenta (6)
  - Length 2 (Azure 8 8) -> Color Red (2 2)
  - Length 3 (Azure 8 8 8) -> Color Blue (1 1 1)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid identical in size to the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid, identifying contiguous horizontal segments composed solely of azure pixels (8). Keep track of the start index and length of each segment.
3.  For each identified azure segment:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  Select the replacement color based on the length:
        *   If the length is 1, use magenta (6).
        *   If the length is 2, use red (2).
        *   If the length is 3, use blue (1).
    c.  In the output grid, fill the pixels corresponding to the position and length of the original azure segment with the selected replacement color.
4.  For all pixels in the input grid that are *not* part of an azure segment (i.e., white pixels (0)), copy their value to the corresponding position in the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
