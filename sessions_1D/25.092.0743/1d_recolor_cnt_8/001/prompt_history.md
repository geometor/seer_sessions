Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input and output are single-row grids (1x12). The input consists of white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The output consists of white (0), blue (1), green (3), and maroon (9) pixels.

Observing the examples, it appears that the white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions from input to output. The gray pixels (5) are transformed into different colors based on the contiguous block they belong to.

*   In `train_1`, the input has gray blocks of length 3, 1, and 2. These correspond to output blocks of blue (1), maroon (9), and green (3) respectively.
*   In `train_2`, the input has gray blocks of length 2, 1, and 3. These correspond to output blocks of green (3), maroon (9), and blue (1) respectively.
*   In `train_3`, the input has gray blocks of length 3 and 1. These correspond to output blocks of blue (1) and maroon (9) respectively.

This suggests a mapping based on the *length* of the contiguous gray block:
*   A block of one gray pixel (length 1) transforms into one maroon pixel (9).
*   A block of two gray pixels (length 2) transforms into two green pixels (3).
*   A block of three gray pixels (length 3) transforms into three blue pixels (1).

**Facts:**

grid_dimensions: 1x12 (for all examples)
input_colors:
  - white (0)
  - gray (5)
output_colors:
  - white (0)
  - blue (1)
  - green (3)
  - maroon (9)
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: remains unchanged
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - length: varies (1, 2, or 3 in examples)
    behavior: transformed into a block of a different color, maintaining position and length
relationships:
  - description: The transformation of a gray (5) block depends on its length.
    mapping:
      - input_length: 1
        output_color: maroon (9)
      - input_length: 2
        output_color: green (3)
      - input_length: 3
        output_color: blue (1)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid identical in size to the input grid, filled with a default value (e.g., white 0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid column by column.
3.  If the current pixel is white (0), copy it to the corresponding position in the output grid.
4.  If the current pixel is gray (5) and has not been processed as part of a block yet:
    a.  Identify the contiguous block of gray (5) pixels starting at the current position.
    b.  Determine the length of this gray block.
    c.  Based on the length, determine the replacement color:
        i.  If length is 1, the replacement color is maroon (9).
        ii. If length is 2, the replacement color is green (3).
        iii.If length is 3, the replacement color is blue (1).
    d.  Fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with the determined replacement color for the entire length of the block.
    e.  Mark the pixels of this block as processed (e.g., by advancing the iteration index past the block).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
