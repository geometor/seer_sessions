            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input and output are single-row grids (1x12). The input consists of white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The output consists of white (0), blue (1), green (3), and maroon (9) pixels.\n\nObserving the examples, it appears that the white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions from input to output. The gray pixels (5) are transformed into different colors based on the contiguous block they belong to.\n\n*   In `train_1`, the input has gray blocks of length 3, 1, and 2. These correspond to output blocks of blue (1), maroon (9), and green (3) respectively.\n*   In `train_2`, the input has gray blocks of length 2, 1, and 3. These correspond to output blocks of green (3), maroon (9), and blue (1) respectively.\n*   In `train_3`, the input has gray blocks of length 3 and 1. These correspond to output blocks of blue (1) and maroon (9) respectively.\n\nThis suggests a mapping based on the *length* of the contiguous gray block:\n*   A block of one gray pixel (length 1) transforms into one maroon pixel (9).\n*   A block of two gray pixels (length 2) transforms into two green pixels (3).\n*   A block of three gray pixels (length 3) transforms into three blue pixels (1).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
