Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 1-dimensional arrays (or single-row grids). The length of the input and output arrays is the same in all examples (13).
2.  **Colors:** The input primarily uses white (0) and maroon (9). The output uses white (0), yellow (4), green (3), and orange (7).
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels (maroon/9) in the input form contiguous horizontal segments (objects).
4.  **Transformation:** The white pixels remain unchanged. The maroon segments are replaced by segments of the same length but with different colors. The new color depends on the length of the original maroon segment.

**Observed Mapping (Maroon Segment Length -> Output Color):**

*   Example 1:
    *   `9` (length 1) -> `4` (yellow)
    *   `9 9 9` (length 3) -> `3 3 3` (green)
    *   `9 9` (length 2) -> `7 7` (orange)
*   Example 2:
    *   `9 9` (length 2) -> `7 7` (orange)
    *   `9 9 9` (length 3) -> `3 3 3` (green)
    *   `9` (length 1) -> `4` (yellow)
*   Example 3:
    *   `9` (length 1) -> `4` (yellow)
    *   `9 9 9` (length 3) -> `3 3 3` (green)
    *   `9 9` (length 2) -> `7 7` (orange)

The mapping seems consistent:
*   Length 1 maroon segment -> Replaced by yellow (4)
*   Length 2 maroon segment -> Replaced by orange (7)
*   Length 3 maroon segment -> Replaced by green (3)

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  input_length: 13
  output_length: 13
  input_colors_present: [white, maroon]
  output_colors_present: [white, yellow, green, orange]

Objects:
  - type: segment
    input_color: maroon (9)
    output_color: variable
    properties:
      - contiguity: horizontal
      - length: variable (1, 2, or 3 observed)
      - position: preserved between input and output

Transformations:
  - type: color_replacement
    target: maroon (9) pixels
    conditions:
      - Based on the length of the contiguous segment the pixel belongs to.
    rules:
      - If segment length is 1, replace maroon (9) with yellow (4).
      - If segment length is 2, replace maroon (9) with orange (7).
      - If segment length is 3, replace maroon (9) with green (3).
  - type: color_preservation
    target: white (0) pixels
    conditions: Always applied.

Relationships:
  - The output color of a replaced segment is solely determined by the length of the original maroon segment.
  - The position and length of segments are preserved.
  - White pixels act as background/separators and are unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output array as a copy of the input array.
2.  Iterate through the input array from left to right.
3.  If a maroon (9) pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet (as part of a segment):
    a.  Determine the length of the contiguous segment of maroon (9) pixels starting at the current position.
    b.  Based on the determined length:
        i.  If the length is 1, set the corresponding pixel(s) in the output array to yellow (4).
        ii. If the length is 2, set the corresponding pixel(s) in the output array to orange (7).
        iii.If the length is 3, set the corresponding pixel(s) in the output array to green (3).
    c.  Mark all pixels in this segment as processed (e.g., by advancing the iteration index past the segment).
4.  If a white (0) pixel is encountered, leave the corresponding pixel in the output array unchanged (it's already copied).
5.  Return the modified output array.
