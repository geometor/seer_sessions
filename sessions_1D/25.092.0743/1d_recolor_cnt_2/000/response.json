The length of the input and output arrays is the same in all examples (13).\n2.  **Colors:** The input primarily uses white (0) and maroon (9). The output uses white (0), yellow (4), green (3), and orange (7).\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels (maroon/9) in the input form contiguous horizontal segments (objects).\n4.  **Transformation:** The white pixels remain unchanged. The maroon segments are replaced by segments of the same length but with different colors. The new color depends on the length of the original maroon segment.\n\n**Observed Mapping (Maroon Segment Length -> Output Color):**\n\n*   Example 1:\n    *   `9` (length 1) -> `4` (yellow)\n    *   `9 9 9` (length 3) -> `3 3 3` (green)\n    *   `9 9` (length 2) -> `7 7` (orange)\n*   Example 2:\n    *   `9 9` (length 2) -> `7 7` (orange)\n    *   `9 9 9` (length 3) -> `3 3 3` (green)\n    *   `9` (length 1) -> `4` (yellow)\n*   Example 3:\n    *   `9` (length 1) -> `4` (yellow)\n    *   `9 9 9` (length 3) -> `3 3 3` (green)\n    *   `9 9` (length 2) -> `7 7` (orange)\n\nThe mapping seems consistent:\n*   Length 1 maroon segment -> Replaced by yellow (4)\n*   Length 2 maroon segment -> Replaced by orange (7)\n*   Length 3 maroon segment -> Replaced by green (3)\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
