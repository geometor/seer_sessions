Grid_Properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  input_length: 13
  output_length: 13
  input_colors_present: [white, maroon]
  output_colors_present: [white, yellow, green, orange]

Objects:
  - type: segment
    input_color: maroon (9)
    output_color: variable
    properties:
      - contiguity: horizontal
      - length: variable (1, 2, or 3 observed)
      - position: preserved between input and output

Transformations:
  - type: color_replacement
    target: maroon (9) pixels
    conditions:
      - Based on the length of the contiguous segment the pixel belongs to.
    rules:
      - If segment length is 1, replace maroon (9) with yellow (4).
      - If segment length is 2, replace maroon (9) with orange (7).
      - If segment length is 3, replace maroon (9) with green (3).
  - type: color_preservation
    target: white (0) pixels
    conditions: Always applied.

Relationships:
  - The output color of a replaced segment is solely determined by the length of the original maroon segment.
  - The position and length of segments are preserved.
  - White pixels act as background/separators and are unchanged.
