Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 1-dimensional grid (or a 1xN grid). The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair.
2.  **Color Palette:** The input grids primarily feature white (0) and green (3). The output grids feature white (0), blue (1), magenta (6), and maroon (9).
3.  **Background:** The white pixels (0) remain unchanged in their positions from input to output.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects the green pixels (3).
5.  **Object Identification:** The green pixels form contiguous horizontal blocks (segments) separated by white pixels.
6.  **Pattern Recognition:** The color that replaces a green block in the output seems to depend on the *length* (number of contiguous pixels) of that green block in the input.
    *   In train_1: `3 3` (length 2) -> `1 1` (blue); `3` (length 1) -> `9` (maroon); `3 3 3` (length 3) -> `6 6 6` (magenta).
    *   In train_2: `3 3` (length 2) -> `1 1` (blue); `3` (length 1) -> `9` (maroon); `3 3 3` (length 3) -> `6 6 6` (magenta).
    *   In train_3: `3 3 3` (length 3) -> `6 6 6` (magenta); `3` (length 1) -> `9` (maroon); `3 3` (length 2) -> `1 1` (blue).
7.  **Consistent Mapping:** Across all examples, the mapping holds:
    *   Green blocks of length 1 become maroon (9).
    *   Green blocks of length 2 become blue (1).
    *   Green blocks of length 3 become magenta (6).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor contiguous horizontal blocks of a specific input color based on the block's length.
grid_properties:
  - type: input_output_relation
    property: dimensions
    value: conserved # Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - type: background_pixels
    color: white (0)
    behavior: unchanged # White pixels remain in the same position and color.
objects:
  - type: pixel_segment
    color: green (3)
    definition: Contiguous horizontal sequence of green pixels.
    properties:
      - name: length
        description: The number of pixels in the segment.
        value: variable (1, 2, or 3 observed in examples)
transformation:
  - type: recoloring
    input_object: green pixel segment
    output_object: pixel segment of the same length and position, but different color.
    rule: The output color depends on the length of the input green segment.
    color_mapping:
      - input_length: 1
        output_color: maroon (9)
      - input_length: 2
        output_color: blue (1)
      - input_length: 3
        output_color: magenta (6)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid (in this case, there's only one row).
3.  Within the row, identify contiguous horizontal segments composed solely of green pixels (color 3). Keep track of the starting position and length of each segment.
4.  For each identified green segment:
    a.  Determine its length.
    b.  Based on the length, select the corresponding output color:
        *   If length is 1, the output color is maroon (9).
        *   If length is 2, the output color is blue (1).
        *   If length is 3, the output color is magenta (6).
    c.  In the output grid, replace the pixels corresponding to the original green segment's position and length with the selected output color.
5.  Return the modified output grid. Pixels not part of any green segment remain unchanged from the input.
