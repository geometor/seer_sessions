"""
This transformation rule operates on a 1-dimensional grid (a single row).
It identifies contiguous horizontal segments of magenta pixels (color 6) against a white background (color 0).
Each magenta segment is then replaced by a segment of the same length, but with a new color determined by the length of the original magenta segment:
- Segments of length 1 are replaced with green (color 3).
- Segments of length 2 are replaced with blue (color 1).
- Segments of length 3 are replaced with yellow (color 4).
White pixels remain unchanged.
