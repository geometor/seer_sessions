Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are presented as single lines of numbers, suggesting they represent 1-dimensional grids or single rows of a 2D grid. The length appears consistent (31 cells).
2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses primarily white (0) and magenta (6). The output uses white (0), blue (1), green (3), and yellow (4).
3.  **Key Transformation:** The core change involves replacing contiguous segments (objects) of magenta (6) pixels with segments of other colors. White (0) pixels remain unchanged and act as separators.
4.  **Object Identification:** The objects of interest are horizontal sequences of one or more magenta (6) pixels bounded by white (0) pixels or the grid edges.
5.  **Pattern Recognition:** The color used to replace a magenta segment depends on the *length* (number of pixels) of that segment:
    *   Segments of length 1 (`6`) are replaced with green (`3`).
    *   Segments of length 2 (`6 6`) are replaced with blue (`1 1`).
    *   Segments of length 3 (`6 6 6`) are replaced with yellow (`4 4 4`).
6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three training examples. The relative positions of the segments and the white background are preserved.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  input_colors: [white (0), magenta (6)]
  output_colors: [white (0), blue (1), green (3), yellow (4)]
  background_color: white (0)
  preserves_background: True
  preserves_dimensions: True

objects:
  - type: segment
    color: magenta (6)
    definition: Contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more magenta pixels.
    properties:
      - length: Integer (number of pixels in the segment)

actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input_grid
    output: list of magenta segments with their positions and lengths
  - name: map_length_to_color
    input: segment_length
    output: replacement_color
    mapping:
      1: green (3)
      2: blue (1)
      3: yellow (4)
  - name: replace_segment
    input: segment_position, segment_length, replacement_color
    output: modified_grid (segment pixels replaced with the new color)

relationships:
  - The replacement color for a magenta segment is determined solely by its length.
  - White pixels are invariant under the transformation.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid identical in size to the input grid, filled with the background color (white/0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally from left to right.
3.  Maintain a state to track if currently inside a magenta segment and the starting position and length of the current segment.
4.  If a magenta (6) pixel is encountered:
    *   If not already inside a magenta segment, mark the start position and set the length to 1.
    *   If already inside a magenta segment, increment the length.
5.  If a non-magenta (0) pixel is encountered *or* the end of the grid is reached:
    *   If the previous state was inside a magenta segment:
        a.  Determine the replacement color based on the recorded segment length:
            *   Length 1 maps to green (3).
            *   Length 2 maps to blue (1).
            *   Length 3 maps to yellow (4).
        b.  Fill the corresponding segment in the output grid (from the recorded start position for the recorded length) with the determined replacement color.
        c.  Reset the state to indicate not being inside a magenta segment.
    *   Copy the non-magenta pixel (if applicable) to the corresponding position in the output grid.
6.  Return the completed output grid.

"""
This transformation rule operates on a 1-dimensional grid (a single row).
It identifies contiguous horizontal segments of magenta pixels (color 6) against a white background (color 0).
Each magenta segment is then replaced by a segment of the same length, but with a new color determined by the length of the original magenta segment:
- Segments of length 1 are replaced with green (color 3).
- Segments of length 2 are replaced with blue (color 1).
- Segments of length 3 are replaced with yellow (color 4).
White pixels remain unchanged.
