task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  input_colors: [white (0), magenta (6)]
  output_colors: [white (0), blue (1), green (3), yellow (4)]
  background_color: white (0)
  preserves_background: True
  preserves_dimensions: True

objects:
  - type: segment
    color: magenta (6)
    definition: Contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more magenta pixels.
    properties:
      - length: Integer (number of pixels in the segment)

actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input_grid
    output: list of magenta segments with their positions and lengths
  - name: map_length_to_color
    input: segment_length
    output: replacement_color
    mapping:
      1: green (3)
      2: blue (1)
      3: yellow (4)
  - name: replace_segment
    input: segment_position, segment_length, replacement_color
    output: modified_grid (segment pixels replaced with the new color)

relationships:
  - The replacement color for a magenta segment is determined solely by its length.
  - White pixels are invariant under the transformation.
