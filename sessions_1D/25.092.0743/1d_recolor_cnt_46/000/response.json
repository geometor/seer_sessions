The length appears consistent (31 cells).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses primarily white (0) and magenta (6). The output uses white (0), blue (1), green (3), and yellow (4).\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The core change involves replacing contiguous segments (objects) of magenta (6) pixels with segments of other colors. White (0) pixels remain unchanged and act as separators.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The objects of interest are horizontal sequences of one or more magenta (6) pixels bounded by white (0) pixels or the grid edges.\n5.  **Pattern Recognition:** The color used to replace a magenta segment depends on the *length* (number of pixels) of that segment:\n    *   Segments of length 1 (`6`) are replaced with green (`3`).\n    *   Segments of length 2 (`6 6`) are replaced with blue (`1 1`).\n    *   Segments of length 3 (`6 6 6`) are replaced with yellow (`4 4 4`).\n6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three training examples. The relative positions of the segments and the white background are preserved.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
