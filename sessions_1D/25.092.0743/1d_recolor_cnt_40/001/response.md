"""
Identifies connected components (objects) of magenta (6) pixels in the input grid,
considering 8-way connectivity (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
Determines the size (number of pixels) of each magenta object.
Replaces the pixels of each magenta object in the output grid with a new color 
based on its size:
- Size 1: Green (3)
- Size 2: Azure (8)
- Size 3: Maroon (9)
Leaves all other pixels (background) unchanged.
