*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grids consist of a single row.
    *   The background color is white (0).
    *   The foreground color in the input is always magenta (6).
    *   Magenta pixels form contiguous objects of varying sizes (1, 2, or 3 pixels). These objects can be horizontal or vertical (though in these 1-row examples, only size 1 or horizontal objects are possible).
    *   The output grids retain the same dimensions and background color.
    *   The magenta objects in the input are replaced by objects of the same shape and position in the output, but with different colors.
    *   The output colors are green (3), azure (8), and maroon (9).
    *   There appears to be a correlation between the *size* (number of pixels) of the input magenta object and the color of the corresponding output object.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_color_transformation
    input_features:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - objects:
          - color: magenta (6)
          - connectivity: contiguous (adjacent side-by-side or diagonal - though only side-by-side is relevant here)
          - property_determining_output: size (pixel count)
    output_features:
      - background_color: white (0) (preserved)
      - objects:
          - colors: [green (3), azure (8), maroon (9)]
          - shape: preserved from input object
          - position: preserved from input object
          - color_rule: determined by the size of the corresponding input object
    transformation_rules:
      - Identify contiguous magenta (6) objects.
      - Determine the size (number of pixels) of each object.
      - Map object size to output color:
          - Size 1 -> Green (3)
          - Size 2 -> Azure (8)
          - Size 3 -> Maroon (9)
      - Replace all pixels of the original magenta object with the determined output color.
      - Leave white (0) pixels unchanged.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all connected components (objects) formed by magenta (6) pixels in the input grid. Treat pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same object.
    3.  For each identified magenta object:
        a.  Count the number of pixels (size) in the object.
        b.  Determine the target color based on the object's size:
            *   If the size is 1, the target color is green (3).
            *   If the size is 2, the target color is azure (8).
            *   If the size is 3, the target color is maroon (9).
        c.  Iterate through all the pixel coordinates belonging to the current magenta object in the input grid.
        d.  For each coordinate, change the color in the corresponding position in the *output* grid to the determined target color.
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
