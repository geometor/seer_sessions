These objects can be horizontal or vertical (though in these 1-row examples, only size 1 or horizontal objects are possible).\n    *   The output grids retain the same dimensions and background color.\n    *   The magenta objects in the input are replaced by objects of the same shape and position in the output, but with different colors.\n    *   The output colors are green (3), azure (8), and maroon (9).\n    *   There appears to be a correlation between the *size* (number of pixels) of the input magenta object and the color of the corresponding output object.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
