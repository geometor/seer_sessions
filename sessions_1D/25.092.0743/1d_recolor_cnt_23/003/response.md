"""
Recolors contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels (7) within a single-row grid based on the length of the segment. Segments of length 1 become blue (1), length 2 become gray (5), and length 3 become red (2). White pixels (0) remain unchanged. The input and output are 2D grids, but functionally operate on a single row.
