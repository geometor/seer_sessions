task_description: "Recolor contiguous horizontal segments of orange (7) based on their length within a single-row grid."
grid_properties:
  - input_output_shape_match: true # Dimensions of input and output grids are the same.
  - grid_dimensionality: 2 # All examples are 2D grids.
  - grid_shape: [1, 22] # All examples are 1x22 grids.
pixel_colors:
  - input_colors: [0, 7] # white, orange
  - output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 5] # white, blue, red, gray
objects:
  - object_type: "horizontal_segment"
    definition: "A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of the same color within a single row."
    input_color: 7 # orange
    relevant_property: "length" # The number of pixels in the segment.

  - type: "conditional_recoloring"
    description: "Recolor orange segments based on their length."
    input_color: 7 # orange
    conditions:
      - property: "length"
        value: 1
        output_color: 1 # blue
      - property: "length"
        value: 2

    description: "Leave non-orange pixels unchanged."
    input_color: 0 # white
    output_color: 0 # white
invariants:
  - "White (0) pixels remain unchanged."
  - "The grid dimensions (1xN) remain unchanged."
  - "The relative position of segments and background pixels is preserved."
  - "All transformations occur within the single row of the grid."
