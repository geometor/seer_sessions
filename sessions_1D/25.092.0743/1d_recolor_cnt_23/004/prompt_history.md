Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception:**

The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (or single rows). The input grids contain only white (0) and orange (7) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), blue (1), red (2), and gray (5) pixels.

Comparing the inputs and outputs, the white pixels (0) remain unchanged. The orange pixels (7) change color. The key observation is that the change depends on *how many* orange pixels are grouped together contiguously.

*   A single orange pixel (7) becomes blue (1).
*   A group of two adjacent orange pixels (7, 7) becomes gray (5, 5).
*   A group of three adjacent orange pixels (7, 7, 7) becomes red (2, 2, 2).

This pattern holds across all three training examples. The transformation identifies contiguous blocks of the non-background color (orange) and replaces them with a new color based solely on the length of that block.

**Facts:**

    input_color: 0 # white
    output_color: 0 # white
invariants:
  - "White (0) pixels remain unchanged."
  - "The grid dimensions remain unchanged."
  - "The relative position of segments and background pixels is preserved."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally to find contiguous segments (blocks) of orange pixels (value 7). Keep track of the starting position and length of each segment.
3.  For each identified orange segment:
    a.  Measure its length.
    b.  Determine the replacement color based on the length:
        *   If the length is 1, the replacement color is blue (1).
        *   If the length is 2, the replacement color is gray (5).
        *   If the length is 3, the replacement color is red (2).
    c.  In the output grid, replace all the pixels corresponding to this segment's position and length with the determined replacement color.
4.  Leave all white pixels (value 0) unchanged.
5.  Return the final output grid.
