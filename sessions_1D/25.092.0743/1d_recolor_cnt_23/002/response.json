            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed due to an incorrect assumption about the input data structure. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" indicated that the code was treating parts of the grid (likely slices) as single boolean values, which happens when NumPy arrays are used in standard Python `if` conditions incorrectly. The analysis confirms that ARC grids, even single-row ones, are passed as 2D structures (lists of lists). The core transformation logic (recoloring orange segments based on length) appears correct, but the implementation needs to explicitly handle the 2D structure, specifically by accessing the single row (row index 0).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe `tool_code` execution provided the following metrics:\n\n*   **Grid Shapes:** All training inputs and outputs have the shape (1, 22), confirming they are single-row 2D grids.\n*   **Input Colors:** The unique colors in all inputs are 0 (white) and 7 (orange).\n*   **Output Colors:** The unique colors in all outputs are 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 5 (gray).\n*   **Segment Mapping Verification:** Manual checks for segments in each example confirmed the length-to-color mapping rule:\n    *   Length 1 (Orange 7) -> Blue (1)\n    *   Length 2 (Orange 7, 7) -> Gray (5, 5)\n    *   Length 3 (Orange 7, 7, 7) -> Red (2, 2, 2)\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

If `new_color` is not `None`, iterate from `j = start_col` to `start_col + length - 1` and set the pixel value in the output grid's row at index `j` to `new_color`.\n        vi. The `col` counter is already positioned at the column *after* the segment, so the outer loop will continue from the correct position.\n    c.
