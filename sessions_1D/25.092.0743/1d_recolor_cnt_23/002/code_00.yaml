task_description: "Recolor contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels (7) within a single-row grid based on the length of the segment."
grid_properties:
  - input_output_shape_match: true # Dimensions of input and output grids are the same.
  - grid_dimensionality: 2 # Inputs/Outputs are 2D grids, specifically 1xN (single row).
pixel_colors:
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - target_color: 7 # orange
  - input_colors: [0, 7] # white, orange
  - output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 5] # white, blue, red, gray
objects:
  - object_type: "segment"
    definition: "A contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more pixels of the target color (orange, 7) within the single row."
    relevant_property: "length" # The number of pixels in the segment.
transformations:
  - type: "conditional_recoloring"
    description: "Replace orange segments based on their length."
    input_color: 7 # orange
    conditions:
      - property: "length"
        value: 1
        output_color: 1 # blue
      - property: "length"
        value: 2
        output_color: 5 # gray
      - property: "length"
        value: 3
        output_color: 2 # red
  - type: "identity"
    description: "Background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged."
    input_color: 0 # white
    output_color: 0 # white
invariants:
  - "White (0) pixels remain unchanged."
  - "The grid dimensions (1xN) remain unchanged."
  - "The transformation only depends on the horizontal sequence of pixels in the single row."
  - "The relative positions of segments and background pixels are maintained, only the color of orange segments changes."
