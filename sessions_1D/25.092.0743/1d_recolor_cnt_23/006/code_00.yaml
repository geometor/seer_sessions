task_description: "Recolor contiguous horizontal segments of orange pixels based on their length within a single-row grid."
grid_properties:
  - input_output_shape_match: true
  - grid_dimensionality: 2 # Input/Output are List[List[int]]
  - effective_dimensionality: 1 # Functionally operates on a single row (1xN)
pixel_colors:
  - input_colors: [0, 7] # white, orange
  - output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 5] # white, blue, red, gray
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - target_color: 7 # orange
objects:
  - object_type: "horizontal_segment"
    definition: "A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of the target color (orange, 7) in the horizontal direction within the single row."
    relevant_property: "length" # The number of pixels in the segment.
transformations:
  - type: "conditional_recoloring"
    input_color: 7 # orange
    conditions: # Apply to all pixels within the identified segment
      - property: "length"
        value: 1
        output_color: 1 # blue
      - property: "length"
        value: 2
        output_color: 5 # gray
      - property: "length"
        value: 3
        output_color: 2 # red
  - type: "identity" # Pixels not part of a target segment remain unchanged
    input_color: 0 # white
    output_color: 0 # white
invariants:
  - "White (0) pixels remain unchanged."
  - "The grid dimensions (1xN) remain unchanged."
  - "The transformation operates independently on each identified segment."
  - "The relative order of segments and background pixels is preserved."
