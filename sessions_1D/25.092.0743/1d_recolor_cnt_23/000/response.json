            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (or single rows). The input grids contain only white (0) and orange (7) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), blue (1), red (2), and gray (5) pixels.\n\nComparing the inputs and outputs, the white pixels (0) remain unchanged. The orange pixels (7) change color. The key observation is that the change depends on *how many* orange pixels are grouped together contiguously.\n\n*   A single orange pixel (7) becomes blue (1).\n*   A group of two adjacent orange pixels (7, 7) becomes gray (5, 5).\n*   A group of three adjacent orange pixels (7, 7, 7) becomes red (2, 2, 2).\n\nThis pattern holds across all three training examples. The transformation identifies contiguous blocks of the non-background color (orange) and replaces them with a new color based solely on the length of that block.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
