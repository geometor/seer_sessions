task_description: "Recolor contiguous horizontal segments of a specific color based on their length."
grid_properties:
  - input_output_shape_match: true # Dimensions of input and output grids are the same.
  - grid_dimensionality: 1 # All examples are 1xN grids.
pixel_colors:
  - input_colors: [0, 7] # white, orange
  - output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 5] # white, blue, red, gray
objects:
  - object_type: "segment"
    definition: "A contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more pixels of the same color."
    input_color: 7 # orange
    relevant_property: "length" # The number of pixels in the segment.
transformations:
  - type: "conditional_recoloring"
    input_color: 7 # orange
    conditions:
      - property: "length"
        value: 1
        output_color: 1 # blue

invariants:
  - "White (0) pixels remain unchanged."
  - "The grid dimensions remain unchanged."
  - "The relative position of segments and background pixels is preserved."
