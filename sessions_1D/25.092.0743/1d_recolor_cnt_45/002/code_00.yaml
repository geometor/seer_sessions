task_description: Replace horizontal contiguous segments of azure pixels (8) with segments of the same size but a different color determined by the segment's length.
input_features:
  - grid_representation: 2D array
  - background_color: white (0)
  - target_color: azure (8)
  - objects:
      description: Contiguous horizontal segments of azure pixels within each row.
      properties:
        - length: Number of pixels in the segment (1, 2, or 3 observed).
        - position: Row index, starting column index.
output_features:
  - grid_representation: 2D array (same dimensions as input)
  - background_color_preservation: white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
  - segment_transformation:
      action: Replace azure segments.
      rule: The replacement color depends on the length of the original azure segment.
      mapping:
        - input_segment_length: 1
          output_color: orange (7)
        - input_segment_length: 2
          output_color: green (3)
        - input_segment_length: 3
          output_color: red (2)
      segment_size_preservation: The length of the output segment is the same as the input segment.
relationships:
  - The transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - The mapping between segment length and output color is consistent across examples 2 and 3. (Example 1's output data appears inconsistent with this rule).
