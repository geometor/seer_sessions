task_description: Change the color of contiguous red segments based on their length.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
  input_colors: [white (0), red (2)]
  output_colors: [white (0), blue (1), gray (5), maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0), red (2)
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal run of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      length: integer (count of pixels in the segment)
relationships:
  - type: positional_invariance
    description: The position and extent of segments are maintained from input to output. White pixels also maintain their position.
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input_grid
    output: list of red segments (including position, length)
    description: Find all contiguous horizontal segments composed only of red (2) pixels.
  - name: map_color_by_length
    input: red_segment
    output: new_color
    rules:
      - if segment_length == 1: output_color = blue (1)
      - if segment_length == 2: output_color = maroon (9)
      - if segment_length == 3: output_color = gray (5)
  - name: apply_transformation
    input: input_grid, identified_segments, color_mapping
    output: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input, then replacing the pixels within each identified red segment with the new color determined by its length. White pixels remain unchanged.
