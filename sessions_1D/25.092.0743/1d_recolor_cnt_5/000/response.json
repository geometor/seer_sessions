The input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grids also contain white (0) pixels but replace the red (2) pixels with blue (1), gray (5), or maroon (9).\n\nObserving the examples:\n- White pixels (0) in the input always remain white (0) in the output at the same positions.\n- Red pixels (2) in the input are transformed into different colors in the output.\n- The transformation seems to depend on contiguous groups of red pixels.\n- In Train 1:\n    - A single red pixel (`2`) becomes blue (`1`).\n    - A group of three red pixels (`2 2 2`) becomes gray (`5 5 5`).\n    - A group of two red pixels (`2 2`) becomes maroon (`9 9`).\n- In Train 2:\n    - A group of two red pixels (`2 2`) becomes maroon (`9 9`).\n    - A group of three red pixels (`2 2 2`) becomes gray (`5 5 5`).\n    - Two separate single red pixels (`2`) each become blue (`1`).\n- In Train 3:\n    - A group of two red pixels (`2 2`) becomes maroon (`9 9`).\n    - A group of three red pixels (`2 2 2`) becomes gray (`5 5 5`).\n    - A single red pixel (`2`) becomes blue (`1`).\n\nThe pattern appears consistent: Identify contiguous horizontal segments of red pixels. The color they transform into depends solely on the *length* of that contiguous segment.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
