Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output data are presented as single-row grids (1D arrays). The input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grids also contain white (0) pixels but replace the red (2) pixels with blue (1), gray (5), or maroon (9).

Observing the examples:
- White pixels (0) in the input always remain white (0) in the output at the same positions.
- Red pixels (2) in the input are transformed into different colors in the output.
- The transformation seems to depend on contiguous groups of red pixels.
- In Train 1:
    - A single red pixel (`2`) becomes blue (`1`).
    - A group of three red pixels (`2 2 2`) becomes gray (`5 5 5`).
    - A group of two red pixels (`2 2`) becomes maroon (`9 9`).
- In Train 2:
    - A group of two red pixels (`2 2`) becomes maroon (`9 9`).
    - A group of three red pixels (`2 2 2`) becomes gray (`5 5 5`).
    - Two separate single red pixels (`2`) each become blue (`1`).
- In Train 3:
    - A group of two red pixels (`2 2`) becomes maroon (`9 9`).
    - A group of three red pixels (`2 2 2`) becomes gray (`5 5 5`).
    - A single red pixel (`2`) becomes blue (`1`).

The pattern appears consistent: Identify contiguous horizontal segments of red pixels. The color they transform into depends solely on the *length* of that contiguous segment.

**YAML Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid horizontally from left to right.
3.  Identify contiguous segments (runs) of red (2) pixels. Keep track of the starting position and length of each red segment found.
4.  For each identified red segment:
    a.  Determine its length (number of pixels).
    b.  Check the length:
        i.  If the length is 1, set the target color to blue (1).
        ii. If the length is 2, set the target color to maroon (9).
        iii.If the length is 3, set the target color to gray (5).
    c.  In the output grid, replace the pixels corresponding to this segment's position and length with the determined target color.
5.  Ensure that all pixels that were originally white (0) remain white (0) in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified grid as the final output.
