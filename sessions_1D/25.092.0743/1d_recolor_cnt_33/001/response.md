```python
"""
Identifies contiguous objects composed of orange (7) pixels in a 2x11 input grid.
Calculates the size (number of pixels) of each orange object.
Replaces all pixels of an orange object with a new color based on its size:
- Size 1: Replace with azure (8).
- Size 2: Replace with magenta (6).
- Size 3: Replace with blue (1).
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
