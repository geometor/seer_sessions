task_context: Color replacement based on the size of contiguous objects.
grid_dimensions_observed: 2x11 (inferred from 22 elements and object shapes)
input_elements:
  - type: grid
    colors: [white, orange]
    pixels:
      - color: white (0)
        role: background / unchanged
      - color: orange (7)
        role: target for transformation
  - type: object
    definition: Contiguous block of orange (7) pixels (using horizontal/vertical adjacency).
    properties:
      - size: Number of pixels in the object.
output_elements:
  - type: grid
    colors: [white, blue, magenta, azure]
    pixels:
      - color: white (0)
        role: background / unchanged
      - color: blue (1)
        role: replacement color
      - color: magenta (6)
        role: replacement color
      - color: azure (8)
        role: replacement color
transformation:
  - description: Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed solely of orange pixels.
  - description: For each orange object, determine its size (pixel count).
  - description: Replace all pixels belonging to an orange object with a new color based on its size.
rules:
  - condition: Pixel is white (0).
    action: Keep pixel white (0).
  - condition: Pixel is part of an orange (7) object of size 1.
    action: Change pixel to azure (8).
  - condition: Pixel is part of an orange (7) object of size 2.
    action: Change pixel to magenta (6).
  - condition: Pixel is part of an orange (7) object of size 3.
    action: Change pixel to blue (1).
relationships:
  - The output color of a transformed pixel depends directly on the size of the contiguous orange object it belonged to in the input.
