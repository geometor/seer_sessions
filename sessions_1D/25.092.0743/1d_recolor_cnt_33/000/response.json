This strongly suggests they represent flattened 2D grids. Given 22 = 2 * 11, the most likely grid dimensions are 2x11.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Inputs contain only white (0) and orange (7).\n    *   Outputs contain white (0), blue (1), magenta (6), and azure (8).\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation exclusively targets the orange (7) pixels in the input, replacing them with other colors (1, 6, or 8) in the output. White (0) pixels remain unchanged in their positions.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The orange pixels form distinct contiguous blocks or objects within the grid. Assuming a 2x11 grid structure, these objects appear as horizontal segments of varying lengths (1, 2, or 3 pixels).\n5.  **Pattern/Rule:** There's a clear correlation between the *size* (number of pixels) of an orange object in the input and the color it's replaced with in the output:\n    *   Orange objects of size 1 are replaced with azure (8).\n    *   Orange objects of size 2 are replaced with magenta (6).\n    *   Orange objects of size 3 are replaced with blue (1).\n6.  **Consistency:** This size-to-color mapping rule is consistently applied across all three training examples.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
