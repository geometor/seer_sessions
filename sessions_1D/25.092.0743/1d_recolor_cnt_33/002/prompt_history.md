Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are presented as 1D arrays of 22 integers. This strongly suggests they represent flattened 2D grids. Given 22 = 2 * 11, the most likely grid dimensions are 2x11.
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Inputs contain only white (0) and orange (7).
    *   Outputs contain white (0), blue (1), magenta (6), and azure (8).
3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation exclusively targets the orange (7) pixels in the input, replacing them with other colors (1, 6, or 8) in the output. White (0) pixels remain unchanged in their positions.
4.  **Object Identification:** The orange pixels form distinct contiguous blocks or objects within the grid. Assuming a 2x11 grid structure, these objects appear as horizontal segments of varying lengths (1, 2, or 3 pixels).
5.  **Pattern/Rule:** There's a clear correlation between the *size* (number of pixels) of an orange object in the input and the color it's replaced with in the output:
    *   Orange objects of size 1 are replaced with azure (8).
    *   Orange objects of size 2 are replaced with magenta (6).
    *   Orange objects of size 3 are replaced with blue (1).
6.  **Consistency:** This size-to-color mapping rule is consistently applied across all three training examples.

**Facts (YAML):**

      - color: white (0)
        role: background / unchanged
      - color: orange (7)
        role: target for transformation
  - type: object
    definition: Contiguous block of orange (7) pixels (using horizontal/vertical adjacency).

      - size: Number of pixels in the object.

transformation:
  - description: Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed solely of orange pixels.
  - description: For each orange object, determine its size (pixel count).
  - description: Replace all pixels belonging to an orange object with a new color based on its size.
rules:
  - condition: Pixel is white (0).
    action: Keep pixel white (0).
  - condition: Pixel is part of an orange (7) object of size 1.
    action: Change pixel to azure (8).
  - condition: Pixel is part of an orange (7) object of size 2.
    action: Change pixel to magenta (6).
  - condition: Pixel is part of an orange (7) object of size 3.
    action: Change pixel to blue (1).
relationships:
  - The output color of a transformed pixel depends directly on the size of the contiguous orange object it belonged to in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find all distinct contiguous objects composed of orange (7) pixels. Use horizontal and vertical adjacency to determine object membership. Keep track of which pixels belong to which object and avoid re-processing pixels already assigned to an object.
3.  For each distinct orange object identified:
    a.  Calculate the size of the object (the number of orange pixels it contains).
    b.  Determine the replacement color based on the object's size:
        i.  If size is 1, the replacement color is azure (8).
        ii. If size is 2, the replacement color is magenta (6).
        iii. If size is 3, the replacement color is blue (1).
    c.  For every pixel coordinate belonging to this orange object in the input grid, set the corresponding pixel coordinate in the output grid to the determined replacement color.
4.  Ensure all pixels that were originally white (0) in the input grid remain white (0) in the output grid (this is implicitly handled by initializing the output grid to white and only updating pixels corresponding to orange objects, but can be stated for clarity).
5.  Return the final output grid.

Identifies contiguous objects composed of orange (7) pixels in a 2x11 input grid.
Calculates the size (number of pixels) of each orange object.
Replaces all pixels of an orange object with a new color based on its size:
