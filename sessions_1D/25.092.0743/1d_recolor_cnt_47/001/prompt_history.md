Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are presented as single lists of integers (colors). These likely represent flattened 1D or 2D grids. Given the transformations observed, the relevant structures appear to be contiguous horizontal sequences.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and azure (8) in the input. The output introduces yellow (4), magenta (6), and green (3).
3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation focuses exclusively on the azure (8) pixels. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Pattern Identification:** Azure pixels are grouped into contiguous blocks (sequences where azure pixels are adjacent). The transformation rule depends entirely on the *size* (length) of these contiguous blocks.
    *   A single azure pixel (`8`) is transformed into a single yellow pixel (`4`).
    *   A block of two adjacent azure pixels (`8 8`) is transformed into a block of two magenta pixels (`6 6`).
    *   A block of three adjacent azure pixels (`8 8 8`) is transformed into a block of three green pixels (`3 3 3`).
5.  **Locality:** The transformation applies independently to each identified block of azure pixels. The position of the block matters for *where* the output color appears, but the transformation rule itself only depends on the block's size.

**Facts**

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output sequence/grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with a placeholder or copied from the input.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right (or top to bottom, then left to right if it's a grid, although the logic seems 1D).
3.  Keep track of the start position and current length of any contiguous block of azure (8) pixels encountered.
4.  When a block of azure (8) pixels ends (either by encountering a white (0) pixel or reaching the end of the sequence/row):
    a.  Determine the `size` (length) of the just-ended block.
    b.  Determine the `replacement_color` based on the `size`:
        *   If `size` is 1, `replacement_color` is yellow (4).
        *   If `size` is 2, `replacement_color` is magenta (6).
        *   If `size` is 3, `replacement_color` is green (3).
        *   (Assume: If size is other than 1, 2, or 3, the original azure (8) color might be kept, or this case doesn't occur based on examples).
    c.  Update the corresponding positions in the output sequence/grid with the `replacement_color` for all pixels that were part of that block.
5.  If the current pixel is white (0), ensure the corresponding position in the output is also white (0).
6.  Continue iterating until the entire input has been processed.
7.  Return the completed output sequence/grid.
