These likely represent flattened 1D or 2D grids. Given the transformations observed, the relevant structures appear to be contiguous horizontal sequences.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and azure (8) in the input. The output introduces yellow (4), magenta (6), and green (3).\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation focuses exclusively on the azure (8) pixels. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** Azure pixels are grouped into contiguous blocks (sequences where azure pixels are adjacent). The transformation rule depends entirely on the *size* (length) of these contiguous blocks.\n    *   A single azure pixel (`8`) is transformed into a single yellow pixel (`4`).\n    *   A block of two adjacent azure pixels (`8 8`) is transformed into a block of two magenta pixels (`6 6`).\n    *   A block of three adjacent azure pixels (`8 8 8`) is transformed into a block of three green pixels (`3 3 3`).\n5.  **Locality:** The transformation applies independently to each identified block of azure pixels. The position of the block matters for *where* the output color appears, but the transformation rule itself only depends on the block's size.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
