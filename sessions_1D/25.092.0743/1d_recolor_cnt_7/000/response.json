The transformation logic centers on contiguous groups of maroon pixels. White pixels remain unchanged and act as separators. The color assigned to replace a group of maroon pixels depends entirely on the number of contiguous maroon pixels in that group.\n\n*   **Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous blocks of maroon (9) pixels. White (0) pixels form the background.\n*   **Properties:** The crucial property of the maroon blocks is their length (or size).\n*   **Transformation:** Maroon blocks are replaced by blocks of a different color, determined by their length. White pixels are preserved.\n*   **Relationships:** There's a direct mapping between the length of a maroon block and the output color:\n    *   Length 1 maps to Blue (1).\n    *   Length 2 maps to Orange (7).\n    *   Length 3 maps to Yellow (4).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
