**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 1-dimensional grid (single row) containing only white (0) and maroon (9) pixels into a new grid of the same dimensions. The transformation logic centers on contiguous groups of maroon pixels. White pixels remain unchanged and act as separators. The color assigned to replace a group of maroon pixels depends entirely on the number of contiguous maroon pixels in that group.

*   **Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous blocks of maroon (9) pixels. White (0) pixels form the background.
*   **Properties:** The crucial property of the maroon blocks is their length (or size).
*   **Transformation:** Maroon blocks are replaced by blocks of a different color, determined by their length. White pixels are preserved.
*   **Relationships:** There's a direct mapping between the length of a maroon block and the output color:
    *   Length 1 maps to Blue (1).
    *   Length 2 maps to Orange (7).
    *   Length 3 maps to Yellow (4).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Replace contiguous groups of maroon pixels with a new color based on the group's size, keeping white pixels unchanged.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  input_colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]
  output_colors: [white (0), blue (1), yellow (4), orange (7)]
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: separator, static (unchanged in output)
  - type: maroon_group
    color: maroon (9)
    definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more maroon pixels.
    properties:
      - size: The number of pixels in the sequence (length).
    role: dynamic (transformed in output)
transformations:
  - input_object: maroon_group
    action: Replace pixels based on size.
    rules:
      - condition: size == 1
        output_color: blue (1)
      - condition: size == 2
        output_color: orange (7)
      - condition: size == 3
        output_color: yellow (4)
  - input_object: background
    action: Keep pixel unchanged.
    output_color: white (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right.
3.  If a maroon (9) pixel is encountered that hasn't been processed yet (as part of a group):
    a.  Determine the length of the contiguous sequence of maroon pixels starting at this position.
    b.  Based on the length:
        i.  If the length is 1, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output grid with blue (1).
        ii. If the length is 2, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output grid with orange (7).
        iii.If the length is 3, replace the corresponding pixel(s) in the output grid with yellow (4).
    c.  Mark all pixels in this identified group as processed (e.g., by skipping ahead in the iteration).
4.  If a white (0) pixel is encountered, ensure the corresponding pixel in the output grid remains white (0).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
