White seems to be the background color.\n    *   Magenta pixels appear in contiguous horizontal blocks (objects) separated by white pixels.\n    *   The lengths of these magenta blocks vary: 1, 2, or 3 pixels.\n    *   In the output grids, the white pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   The magenta pixels in the input are replaced by different colors in the output: azure (8), green (3), or maroon (9).\n    *   The replacement color seems to depend on the length of the contiguous magenta block in the input.\n        *   A block of length 1 (a single magenta pixel) is replaced by azure (8).\n        *   A block of length 2 is replaced by green (3).\n        *   A block of length 3 is replaced by maroon (9).\n    *   The position of the blocks remains the same from input to output.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
