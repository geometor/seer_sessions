"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal segments of magenta (6) pixels in a 1D input grid.
Replaces each magenta segment with a new color based on its length:
- Length 1: Replaced with azure (8)
- Length 2: Replaced with green (3)
- Length 3: Replaced with maroon (9)
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
