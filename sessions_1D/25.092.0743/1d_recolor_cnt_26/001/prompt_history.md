*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output grids are one-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids).
    *   The input grids contain only two colors: white (0) and magenta (6). White seems to be the background color.
    *   Magenta pixels appear in contiguous horizontal blocks (objects) separated by white pixels.
    *   The lengths of these magenta blocks vary: 1, 2, or 3 pixels.
    *   In the output grids, the white pixels remain unchanged.
    *   The magenta pixels in the input are replaced by different colors in the output: azure (8), green (3), or maroon (9).
    *   The replacement color seems to depend on the length of the contiguous magenta block in the input.
        *   A block of length 1 (a single magenta pixel) is replaced by azure (8).
        *   A block of length 2 is replaced by green (3).
        *   A block of length 3 is replaced by maroon (9).
    *   The position of the blocks remains the same from input to output.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN
    background_color: 0 # white
    objects:
      - color: 6 # magenta
        property: forms contiguous horizontal segments
        attributes:
          - length: variable (1, 2, or 3 observed)
    transformation:
      type: color_replacement
      scope: affects only magenta (6) pixels
      rule: based on the length of the contiguous magenta segment
      mapping:
        - input_segment:
            color: 6
            length: 1
          output_color: 8 # azure
        - input_segment:
            color: 6
            length: 2
          output_color: 3 # green
        - input_segment:
            color: 6
            length: 3
          output_color: 9 # maroon
      unchanged_pixels: color 0 # white
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally to identify contiguous segments of magenta (6) pixels. Keep track of the start index and length of each segment.
    3.  For each identified magenta segment:
        a.  Determine the length of the segment.
        b.  Based on the length, select the corresponding output color:
            *   If the length is 1, the output color is azure (8).
            *   If the length is 2, the output color is green (3).
            *   If the length is 3, the output color is maroon (9).
        c.  In the output grid, replace all the pixels within the identified segment's range (from start index to start index + length - 1) with the selected output color.
    4.  Leave all other pixels (white, 0) unchanged.
    5.  Return the modified output grid.
