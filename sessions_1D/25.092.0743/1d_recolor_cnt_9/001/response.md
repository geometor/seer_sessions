"""
Identifies contiguous horizontal groups of green (3) pixels in the input grid (treated as a single row).
Replaces each green group with a new color based on the group's size (length):
- Size 1: Replace with magenta (6)
- Size 2: Replace with yellow (4)
- Size 3: Replace with azure (8)
White (0) pixels remain unchanged. Assumes input is a 1D list.
