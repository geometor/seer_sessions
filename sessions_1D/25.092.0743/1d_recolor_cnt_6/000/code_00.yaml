elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static, remains unchanged in the output.
  - type: object
    color: yellow (4)
    definition: contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more yellow pixels.
    properties:
      - size: the number of pixels in the sequence (length).
    actions:
      - transformed: each yellow object is replaced by an object of the same size and position but with a different color.
    transformation_rule:
      - condition: size = 1
        output_color: gray (5)
      - condition: size = 2
        output_color: orange (7)
      - condition: size = 3
        output_color: magenta (6)
relationships:
  - The transformation applies independently to each identified yellow object based solely on its size.
  - The position and size of the objects are preserved during the color transformation.
