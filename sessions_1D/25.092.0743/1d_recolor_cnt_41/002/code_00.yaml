task_description: Replace contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow pixels in a single-row grid with a new color determined by the block's length.
grid_dimensions:
  - input: 1xN (variable N)
  - output: 1xN (same dimensions as input)
color_palette:
  - input: [white (0), yellow (4)]
  - output: [white (0), green (3), magenta (6), maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - shape: [1, N] # Always a single row
      - pixels: A list containing a single list of integers (colors).
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same color within the single row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (specifically yellow (4) for input).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block.
      - start_column: The column index where the block begins.
      - end_column: The column index where the block ends (exclusive).
transformations:
  - scope: Operates only on the single row of the grid.
  - rule: Identify contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow (4) pixels.
  - action: For each identified yellow block, replace all pixels within that block in the output grid with a new color based on the block's length.
  - mapping:
      - input_block_color: yellow (4)
      - block_length: 1
        output_color: maroon (9)
      - block_length: 2
        output_color: magenta (6)
      - block_length: 3
        output_color: green (3)
  - default: Pixels that are not part of a yellow block (i.e., white (0) pixels) remain unchanged. Yellow blocks of lengths other than 1, 2, or 3 (if they were to occur) would presumably remain yellow, although only lengths 1, 2, and 3 appear in the examples.
