            "text": "**Assessment of Information and Strategy**\n\n1.  **Assessment:** The execution results show that the provided Python code failed to transform any of the input grids; it returned the input grid unchanged in all three training examples. However, the initial analysis, the YAML facts, and the Natural Language Program accurately described the transformation rule observed across all examples. The logic involves identifying contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow (4) pixels in the single-row input grid and replacing them with a new color based on the block's length (1 -> 9, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 3), while leaving white (0) pixels untouched. The Python code provided *appears* to implement this logic correctly.\n2.  **Discrepancy:** There is a significant discrepancy between the expected behavior (based on the examples and the code's apparent logic) and the reported execution results. The code seems logically sound for the task described.\n3.  **Strategy:** Assume the understanding of the transformation rule is correct, as it consistently explains all input/output pairs. Re-affirm the core logic. The failure likely lies either in a subtle implementation error missed during the trace, an issue with the execution environment/test harness, or how the input is being passed to the function in the test environment. The plan is to refine the description for maximum clarity and regenerate the code, ensuring it strictly adheres to the validated logic, potentially using a slightly simpler iteration approach if helpful, but the current logic seems robust.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three training examples:\n\n*   **Input Grid Dimensions:** All examples use a 1x26 grid.\n*   **Input Colors:** Consistently white (0) and yellow (4).\n*   **Output Colors:** Consistently white (0), green (3), magenta (6), and maroon (9).\n*   **Transformation:** Mapping of yellow block length to output color is consistent:\n    *   Length 1 -> Maroon (9)\n    *   Length 2 -> Magenta (6)\n    *   Length 3 -> Green (3)\n*   **White Pixels:** Always remain white (0).\n*   **Pixel Mismatches (based on failed execution report):**\n    *   Example 1: 11 pixels (3+2+1+3+2 yellow pixels should have changed)\n    *   Example 2: 8 pixels (2+3+1+1+1 yellow pixels should have changed)\n    *   Example 3: 9 pixels (2+1+3+1+2 yellow pixels should have changed)\n    The number of mismatched pixels exactly corresponds to the number of yellow pixels that should have been transformed according to the rule.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
