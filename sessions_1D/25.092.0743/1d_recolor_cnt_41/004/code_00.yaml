task_description: Replace contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow pixels (color 4) within a single-row grid with a new color determined by the block's length. White pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.
grid_dimensions:
  - input: 1xN (Observed N=26 in examples)
  - output: 1xN (Same as input)
color_palette:
  - input: [white (0), yellow (4)]
  - output: [white (0), green (3), magenta (6), maroon (9)]
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) # Row is always 0
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of yellow (4) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - length: Integer (Number of consecutive yellow pixels)
      - start_column: Integer (Column index of the first pixel in the block)
      - end_column: Integer (Column index of the last pixel in the block)
transformations:
  - input_pixels: White (0)
    output_pixels: White (0) # Rule: No change
  - input_pixels: Yellow (4)
    condition: Part of a contiguous horizontal block of yellow pixels.
    action: Identify the block, determine its length, and replace all pixels in that block with a new color based on the length.
    mapping:
      - block_length: 1
        output_color: Maroon (9)
      - block_length: 2
        output_color: Magenta (6)
      - block_length: 3
        output_color: Green (3)
    scope: All yellow pixels within a specific identified block are changed to the single determined output color. If a yellow block has a length other than 1, 2, or 3, its pixels remain yellow (4) (though this case is not observed in the examples).
