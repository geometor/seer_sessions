            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous code failed to produce the correct output, returning the input unchanged for all training examples. The root cause appears to be a mismatch between the expected input format (`list[list[int]]` representing a 2D grid, even if 1xN) assumed by the `transform` function's input validation and the actual format used during testing (likely a flat `list[int]` based on the example presentation). The core logic within the `find_and_replace_yellow_blocks` helper function, which identifies yellow blocks and determines the replacement color based on length, seems correct according to the task description derived from the examples. The strategy is to modify the main `transform` function to correctly handle a flat list input, apply the existing block replacement logic, and return a flat list output. The underlying perception of the task (replacing yellow blocks based on length) remains valid.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The previous execution results show:\n    *   **Example 1:** Failed (11 pixels off). Input returned instead of output.\n    *   **Example 2:** Failed (8 pixels off). Input returned instead of output.\n    *   **Example 3:** Failed (9 pixels off). Input returned instead of output.\n    *   **Common Pattern:** In all cases, the `Transformed Output` was identical to the `Input`. This strongly suggests the transformation logic was never applied, likely due to the input format validation failing and causing the function to return the input copy prematurely. The core transformation rule relating block length to color (1->9, 2->6, 3->3) was not tested.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
