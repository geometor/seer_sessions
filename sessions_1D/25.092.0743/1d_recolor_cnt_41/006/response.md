*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed to produce the correct output, returning the input unchanged for all training examples. The root cause appears to be a mismatch between the expected input format (`list[list[int]]` representing a 2D grid, even if 1xN) assumed by the `transform` function's input validation and the actual format used during testing (likely a flat `list[int]` based on the example presentation). The core logic within the `find_and_replace_yellow_blocks` helper function, which identifies yellow blocks and determines the replacement color based on length, seems correct according to the task description derived from the examples. The strategy is to modify the main `transform` function to correctly handle a flat list input, apply the existing block replacement logic, and return a flat list output. The underlying perception of the task (replacing yellow blocks based on length) remains valid.

*   **Metrics:**
    The previous execution results show:
    *   **Example 1:** Failed (11 pixels off). Input returned instead of output.
    *   **Example 2:** Failed (8 pixels off). Input returned instead of output.
    *   **Example 3:** Failed (9 pixels off). Input returned instead of output.
    *   **Common Pattern:** In all cases, the `Transformed Output` was identical to the `Input`. This strongly suggests the transformation logic was never applied, likely due to the input format validation failing and causing the function to return the input copy prematurely. The core transformation rule relating block length to color (1->9, 2->6, 3->3) was not tested.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Replace contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow pixels within a single-row list with a new color based on the block's length.
    grid_dimensions:
      - input: 1D list (representing a 1xN grid)
      - output: 1D list (same length as input)
    color_palette:
      - input: [white (0), yellow (4)]
      - output: [white (0), green (3), magenta (6), maroon (9)]
    objects:
      - type: pixel_value
        properties:
          - color: Integer (0-9)
          - index: Position within the 1D list.
      - type: block
        description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixel values in the 1D list.
        properties:
          - color: The color of the pixels in the block (specifically yellow (4) for this task's input).
          - length: The number of pixels in the block.
          - start_index: The index of the first pixel in the block.
          - end_index: The index following the last pixel in the block.
    transformations:
      - input_pixels: White (0)
        output_pixels: White (0) # No change
      - input_pixels: Yellow (4)
        condition: Part of a contiguous horizontal block of yellow pixels.
        action: Replace the entire block in the output list with a new color based on the block length.
        mapping:
          - block_length: 1
            output_color: Maroon (9)
          - block_length: 2
            output_color: Magenta (6)
          - block_length: 3
            output_color: Green (3)
        scope: All pixels within the identified block range [start_index, end_index) are changed to the determined output color in the output list. Yellow blocks of other lengths remain unchanged (kept as yellow).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept a 1D list `input_list` representing the single row grid.
    2.  Create a copy of the `input_list` called `output_list`.
    3.  Initialize an index `i` to 0.
    4.  While `i` is less than the length of `input_list`:
        a.  Check the color of the pixel at `input_list[i]`.
        b.  If the pixel is yellow (4):
            i.  Record the starting index `start_index = i`.
            ii. Initialize `block_length = 0`.
            iii. While `i` is less than the length of `input_list` AND `input_list[i]` is yellow (4):
                1.  Increment `block_length`.
                2.  Increment `i`.
            iv. Determine the `replacement_color` based on `block_length`:
                *   If `block_length` is 1, `replacement_color` is maroon (9).
                *   If `block_length` is 2, `replacement_color` is magenta (6).
                *   If `block_length` is 3, `replacement_color` is green (3).
                *   Otherwise, there is no specific replacement color defined by the examples (keep original yellow - although the code logic correctly only replaces 1, 2, 3).
            v. If a `replacement_color` was determined (i.e., length was 1, 2, or 3):
                1.  Iterate from `j = start_index` up to (but not including) `i`.
                2.  Set `output_list[j] = replacement_color`.
            vi. Continue to the next iteration of the main loop (since `i` was already advanced past the block).
        c.  If the pixel is not yellow (i.e., white (0)):
            i.  Leave `output_list[i]` unchanged (it's already a copy of the input).
            ii. Increment `i` by 1.
    5.  Return the `output_list`.
