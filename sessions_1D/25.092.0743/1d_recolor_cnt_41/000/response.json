The output grids contain white (0), green (3), magenta (6), and maroon (9) pixels. The transformation focuses on contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow pixels in the input. The white pixels remain unchanged. Each block of yellow pixels is replaced by a block of the same size but with a different color. The replacement color depends solely on the length (number of pixels) of the original yellow block.\n    *   Yellow blocks of length 1 are replaced by maroon (9).\n    *   Yellow blocks of length 2 are replaced by magenta (6).\n    *   Yellow blocks of length 3 are replaced by green (3).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
