*   **Perception:** The input and output grids are presented as single rows (or 1D arrays). The input grids contain only white (0) and yellow (4) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), green (3), magenta (6), and maroon (9) pixels. The transformation focuses on contiguous horizontal blocks of yellow pixels in the input. The white pixels remain unchanged. Each block of yellow pixels is replaced by a block of the same size but with a different color. The replacement color depends solely on the length (number of pixels) of the original yellow block.
    *   Yellow blocks of length 1 are replaced by maroon (9).
    *   Yellow blocks of length 2 are replaced by magenta (6).
    *   Yellow blocks of length 3 are replaced by green (3).

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed with a `ValueError` related to ambiguous truth values of numpy arrays. This error often occurs when trying to use a boolean condition on an entire array instead of element-wise operations or specific array methods like `.any()` or `.all()`. Given the ARC task format typically uses nested lists (even for single rows/columns, like `[[...]]`), the error likely stems from treating the input `list[list[int]]` as a simple 1D list when converting to/from numpy, or during comparison operations within the numpy logic.

The core transformation logic observed (replacing horizontal yellow blocks based on length: 1->9, 2->6, 3->3) appears consistent across all three examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Data Structure:** Assume the input/output format is `list[list[int]]` as standard for ARC tasks, even for single-row grids (e.g., `[[0, 4, 4, ...]]`).
2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the code to correctly handle the `list[list[int]]` structure. This involves accessing the single row (index 0) if the grid is 1xN.
3.  **Refine Logic:** Ensure the iteration and block identification work correctly on the single row within the nested list structure.
4.  **Verify Consistency:** Double-check that the length-to-color mapping (1->9, 2->6, 3->3) holds for all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, which is structured as a list containing a single list of pixel values (representing a 1xN grid).
2.  Create an output grid as a deep copy of the input grid to preserve the structure and initial white pixels.
3.  Extract the single row of pixels from the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the pixels of the row using a column index, scanning from left to right.
5.  If the current pixel is white (0), continue to the next pixel.
6.  If the current pixel is yellow (4):
    *   Record the starting column index of this potential yellow block.
    *   Initialize a block length counter to 0.
    *   Continue iterating forward from the current position as long as the pixels are yellow (4) and within the grid bounds, incrementing the block length counter and advancing the main column index.
    *   Once a non-yellow pixel or the end of the row is reached, the yellow block has been fully identified.
    *   Check the measured `block_length`:
        *   If `block_length` is 1, set the replacement color to maroon (9).
        *   If `block_length` is 2, set the replacement color to magenta (6).
        *   If `block_length` is 3, set the replacement color to green (3).
        *   (If other lengths occurred, no replacement color is defined by the examples, implying they might remain yellow or unchanged).
    *   If a valid replacement color was determined (maroon, magenta, or green), update the corresponding segment (from the recorded start column index to the current column index) in the single row of the *output* grid with the replacement color.
    *   Since the inner loop already advanced the main column index past the identified block, continue the outer loop from the current column index.
7.  After iterating through the entire row, return the modified output grid (still as a list containing a single list).
