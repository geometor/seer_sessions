task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # Logically 1D, represented as a 1xN list of lists
  size_preservation: True # Output grid has the same 1xN dimensions as the input
input_elements:
  - object: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    behavior: static, remains unchanged in the output grid at the same position.
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - length: variable (observed lengths are 1, 2, 3 in examples)
      - location: horizontal position within the single row
    behavior: transformed into a block of the same length but different color based on its length.
output_elements:
  - object: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    origin: copied from input white pixel.
  - object: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - length: same as the corresponding input magenta block
      - location: same horizontal position as the corresponding input magenta block
    color:
      - red (2), if the origin magenta block had length 1
      - gray (5), if the origin magenta block had length 2
      - azure (8), if the origin magenta block had length 3
transformation_rule:
  - scope: grid (specifically, the single row within the grid)
  - process:
      1. Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks composed solely of magenta (6) pixels within the input row. Record the start index and length of each block.
      2. Create a copy of the input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
      3. Iterate through the identified magenta blocks.
      4. For each magenta block:
         a. Determine its length.
         b. Select the replacement color: red (2) for length 1, gray (5) for length 2, azure (8) for length 3.
         c. In the copied row (output row), replace the pixels corresponding to the magenta block (from its start index for its determined length) with the selected replacement color.
      5. Pixels that were originally white (0) remain unchanged in the copied row because they were copied initially and not part of any magenta block replacement.
      6. Format the final modified row back into the list-of-lists structure `[[...]]`.
relationships:
  - The color of an output block is determined solely by the length of the corresponding input magenta block.
  - The position and length of blocks are preserved during the transformation.
  - White pixels act as delimiters for magenta blocks and are invariant.
assumptions:
  - Input grids will always be 1xN.
  - Input grids contain only white (0) and magenta (6) pixels.
  - Only magenta blocks of length 1, 2, or 3 need specific color transformations; behavior for other lengths is undefined by examples.
