The input grid contains only white (0) and magenta (6) pixels. The output grid contains white (0), red (2), gray (5), and azure (8) pixels.\n\nComparing the input and output grids reveals the following:\n\n1.  **Static Background:** White pixels (0) in the input remain white pixels (0) in the same positions in the output.\n2.  **Object Transformation:** Magenta pixels (6) in the input are transformed into other colors (red, gray, or azure) in the output.\n3.  **Contiguous Blocks:** The magenta pixels appear in contiguous horizontal blocks of varying lengths (1, 2, or 3 pixels in the examples).\n4.  **Length-Dependent Color Change:** The color that replaces a magenta block depends on the *length* of that contiguous block:\n    *   A magenta block of length 1 is replaced by red (2).\n    *   A magenta block of length 2 is replaced by gray (5).\n    *   A magenta block of length 3 is replaced by azure (8).\n5.  **Preservation of Structure:** The transformation preserves the position and length of the original magenta blocks; only the color changes.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
