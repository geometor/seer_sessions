task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # effectively 1D, though represented as 1xN
  size_preservation: True # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input
input_elements:
  - object: pixel
    color: white (0)
    behavior: static, remains unchanged
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - length: 1, 2, or 3 (based on examples)
    behavior: transformed based on length
output_elements:
  - object: pixel
    color: white (0)
    origin: copied from input white pixel
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length: 1
    origin: transformed from magenta block of length 1
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - length: 2
    origin: transformed from magenta block of length 2
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - length: 3
    origin: transformed from magenta block of length 3
transformation_rule:
  - scope: grid
  - condition: identify contiguous horizontal blocks of magenta (6) pixels
  - action:
      - determine the length of each identified block
      - replace the pixels of the block with a new color based on its length:
          - length 1 -> red (2)
          - length 2 -> gray (5)
          - length 3 -> azure (8)
  - condition: identify white (0) pixels
  - action:
      - keep the white pixels unchanged in their positions
relationships:
  - input_block_length determines output_block_color
  - pixel positions are preserved
