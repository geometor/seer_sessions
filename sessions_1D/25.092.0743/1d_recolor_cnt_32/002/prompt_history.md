Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception

The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids) of the same size. The input grid contains only white (0) and magenta (6) pixels. The output grid contains white (0), red (2), gray (5), and azure (8) pixels.

Comparing the input and output grids reveals the following:

1.  **Static Background:** White pixels (0) in the input remain white pixels (0) in the same positions in the output.
2.  **Object Transformation:** Magenta pixels (6) in the input are transformed into other colors (red, gray, or azure) in the output.
3.  **Contiguous Blocks:** The magenta pixels appear in contiguous horizontal blocks of varying lengths (1, 2, or 3 pixels in the examples).
4.  **Length-Dependent Color Change:** The color that replaces a magenta block depends on the *length* of that contiguous block:
    *   A magenta block of length 1 is replaced by red (2).
    *   A magenta block of length 2 is replaced by gray (5).
    *   A magenta block of length 3 is replaced by azure (8).
5.  **Preservation of Structure:** The transformation preserves the position and length of the original magenta blocks; only the color changes.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # effectively 1D, though represented as 1xN
  size_preservation: True # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input
input_elements:
  - object: pixel
    color: white (0)
    behavior: static, remains unchanged
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - length: 1, 2, or 3 (based on examples)
    behavior: transformed based on length
output_elements:
  - object: pixel
    color: white (0)
    origin: copied from input white pixel
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length: 1
    origin: transformed from magenta block of length 1
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - length: 2
    origin: transformed from magenta block of length 2
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - length: 3
    origin: transformed from magenta block of length 3
transformation_rule:
  - scope: grid
  - condition: identify contiguous horizontal blocks of magenta (6) pixels
  - action:
      - determine the length of each identified block
      - replace the pixels of the block with a new color based on its length:
          - length 1 -> red (2)
          - length 2 -> gray (5)
          - length 3 -> azure (8)
  - condition: identify white (0) pixels
  - action:
      - keep the white pixels unchanged in their positions
relationships:
  - input_block_length determines output_block_color
  - pixel positions are preserved
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid horizontally to identify contiguous blocks of magenta (6) pixels. Keep track of the starting position and length of each block.
3.  For each identified magenta block:
    a.  Determine the length of the block.
    b.  Select the replacement color based on the length:
        *   If length is 1, the replacement color is red (2).
        *   If length is 2, the replacement color is gray (5).
        *   If length is 3, the replacement color is azure (8).
    c.  In the output grid, replace the pixels corresponding to the identified magenta block (using its starting position and length) with the selected replacement color.
4.  Leave all pixels that were originally white (0) unchanged in the output grid.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
