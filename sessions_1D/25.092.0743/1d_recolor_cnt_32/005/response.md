"""
Transforms a 1D grid (represented as a 1xN list of lists) by replacing contiguous 
horizontal blocks of magenta (6) pixels with a new color based on the block's length:
- Blocks of length 1 become red (2).
- Blocks of length 2 become gray (5).
- Blocks of length 3 become azure (8).
White (0) pixels remain unchanged in their original positions. Assumes input contains
only white (0) and magenta (6).
