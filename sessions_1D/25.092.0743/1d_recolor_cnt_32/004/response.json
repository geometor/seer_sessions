            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: contiguous blocks of magenta (6) pixels are replaced by a new color based on the block's length (1->red(2), 2->gray(5), 3->azure(8)), while white (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n\nThe Python code implemented this logic using NumPy for array processing. The errors encountered (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`) across all examples strongly suggest an issue not with the core transformation logic itself, but with how boolean checks are applied to the data structures, likely within the input validation part of the function. Specifically, the check `if not input_grid[0]` will raise this error if `input_grid[0]` is a NumPy array (which might happen if the testing environment pre-processes the input).\n\nThe strategy is to modify the input validation to correctly handle potential NumPy array inputs without performing ambiguous boolean checks on the array itself, while preserving the correct transformation logic for finding and replacing magenta blocks based on their length.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathering via code execution is currently blocked by the error. However, observational metrics confirm consistency across examples:\n*   **Dimensionality:** All inputs/outputs are 1xN grids.\n*   **Size Preservation:** Output grid dimensions always match input grid dimensions.\n*   **Input Colors:** Consistently white (0) and magenta (6).\n*   **Output Colors:** Consistently white (0), red (2), gray (5), and azure (8).\n*   **Transformation Pattern:** The length-to-color mapping (1->2, 2->5, 3->8) for magenta blocks holds true for all provided training pairs. White pixels always map to white pixels.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Validate the input: Check if the outer list or the inner row list is empty. If so, return an appropriately formatted empty grid (e.g., `[[]]`).\n3.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the initial output row.\n4.  Initialize a pointer or index `i` to the start of the row (index 0).\n5.  Iterate through the input row using the index `i`:\n    a.  If the pixel at index `i` is white (0), move to the next pixel (increment `i`).\n    b.  If the pixel at index `i` is magenta (6):\n        i.  Record the starting position (`block_start = i`).\n        ii. Initialize a counter for the block length (`block_length = 0`).\n        iii. Scan forward from `i` as long as the pixels are magenta (6) and within the row bounds. Increment `block_length` and the scanning index for each magenta pixel found.\n        iv. Determine the replacement color based on `block_length`:\n            *   If `block_length` is 1, set `replacement_color` to red (2).\n            *   If `block_length` is 2, set `replacement_color` to gray (5).\n            *   If `block_length` is 3, set `replacement_color` to azure (8).\n            *   If `block_length` is any other value, do not define a replacement (the original pixels will remain).\n        v.  If a `replacement_color` was determined (i.e., length was 1, 2, or 3), update the output row by filling the pixels from `block_start` for `block_length` positions with the `replacement_color`.\n        vi. Set the main index `i` to the position immediately after the processed block (`i = block_start + block_length`).\n    c.  If the pixel is neither white nor magenta (unexpected input), either ignore it or handle as an error, then increment `i`. (Based on examples, only 0 and 6 are expected).\n6.
