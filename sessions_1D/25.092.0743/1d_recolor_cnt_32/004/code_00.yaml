task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # Represented as 1xN list of lists
  size_preservation: True # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input
input_elements:
  - object: pixel
    color: white (0)
    behavior: static, remains unchanged
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - length: integer (1, 2, 3 observed in examples)
    behavior: transformed based on length
output_elements:
  - object: pixel
    color: white (0)
    origin: copied from input white pixel
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - length: 1
    origin: transformed from magenta block of length 1
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - length: 2
    origin: transformed from magenta block of length 2
  - object: contiguous_block
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - length: 3
    origin: transformed from magenta block of length 3
transformation_rule:
  - scope: grid_row # Operates on the single row of the grid
  - action: initialize output row as a copy of the input row
  - action: iterate through the input row to identify contiguous blocks of magenta (6) pixels
  - for_each: identified magenta block
    - determine: block_length
    - determine: replacement_color based on block_length
        - condition: block_length == 1, result: red (2)
        - condition: block_length == 2, result: gray (5)
        - condition: block_length == 3, result: azure (8)
        - condition: otherwise, result: no change (or original magenta color) # Assumed based on examples
    - action: replace the pixels in the output row corresponding to the block's position and length with the replacement_color
  - condition: input pixel is white (0)
  - action: ensure the corresponding output pixel remains white (0) # Achieved by initial copy
relationships:
  - input_magenta_block_length determines output_block_color
  - pixel positions are preserved for the background (white) and the overall block structure
validation_note: Input validation needs to handle potential NumPy array inputs robustly, avoiding direct boolean evaluation of arrays. Checking length/size is preferred (e.g., `len(row)` or `row.size`).
