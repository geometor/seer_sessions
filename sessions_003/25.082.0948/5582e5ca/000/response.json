The core challenge is to figure out the selection criteria. It's not simply the largest, smallest, or most frequent value. Let's inspect the example:\n    *   train\\_1: Input has 4, 8, 6, 3, 0. Output is all 4.\n    *   train\\_2: Input has 6, 8, 9, 1, 4. Output is all 9.\n    *   train\\_3: Input has 4, 6, 9, 1, 8. Output is all 6.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
