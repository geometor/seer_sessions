## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```


**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```


**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```


**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and creating a natural language program to describe the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** Each input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   **Output:** Each output is also a 3x3 grid, but all cells have the same value, and this single value is picked from an input grid's value.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve selecting a single color (digit) from the input grid and using it to fill the entire output grid. The core challenge is to figure out the selection criteria. It's not simply the largest, smallest, or most frequent value. Let's inspect the example:
    *   train\_1: Input has 4, 8, 6, 3, 0. Output is all 4.
    *   train\_2: Input has 6, 8, 9, 1, 4. Output is all 9.
    *   train\_3: Input has 4, 6, 9, 1, 8. Output is all 6.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of digits into another 3x3 grid where all cells have the same value.
  The value is from an input grid's value.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 3x3 grid
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 3x3 grid
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - all_same: true  # All cells have the same value

actions:
  - name: select_value
    description: Selects a single digit from the input grid.
    parameters:
        input: input_grid
        output: integer (0-9)

  - name: fill_grid
    description: Fills the entire output grid with the selected value.
    parameters:
        input: integer
        output: 3x3 output_grid

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by selecting one value, and assigning the selected value to all pixels in the output_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Identify** the value in the center of the input.
3.  **Create** a new 3x3 grid.
4. **Fill** every cell of new output grid from the center value of the input grid.
