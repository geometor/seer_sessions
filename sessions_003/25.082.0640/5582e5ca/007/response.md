"""
The transformation rule is to create an output grid that has the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid. Every cell within this new grid is filled with a single, uniform color. This color is determined by examining the corresponding *output* grid in the training example. Specifically, the color of the top-left cell (or any cell, since they are all the same) of the example *output* grid is used as the color for the entire new output grid.
