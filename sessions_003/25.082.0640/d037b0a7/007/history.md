```python
"""
1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have non-zero values. These are the "seed" pixels.

2.  **Propagation with Precedence:**
    *   Each seed pixel attempts to propagate its value in two directions: *downwards* in its column and *rightwards* in its row.
    *   **Downward propagation takes precedence.**
    *   **Downward Propagation:** A seed pixel's value propagates downwards to all cells in the same column until either:
        *   It reaches the bottom of the grid.
        *   It encounters a cell that *already has a value* resulting from any other downward propagation.
    *   **Rightward Propagation:** A seed pixel's value propagates rightwards to all cells in the same row until either:
        * It reaches the right edge of the grid
        * It is blocked because the cell below that has already been filled by a downward propagation

3.  **Output:** The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid. The propagation rules modify the output grid, filling cells below and to the right of each seed pixel, respecting the precedence and stopping conditions. The original seed pixel values are preserved.

Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first example, which it handles correctly. However, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in the rightward propagation logic. The rightward propagation should stop *before* a cell that has already been filled by downward propagation. The current code propagates rightward even if a downward prop has filled in the value, it just checks if original output value is zero

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Rightward Propagation:** Modify the natural language program and the code to explicitly state and implement the blocking condition for rightward propagation: a cell filled by downward propagation (from any seed) blocks rightward propagation.

2.  **Detailed Analysis of Examples:** Examine each example closely to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails and why the updated rule will fix it.

**Gather Metrics (using visual inspection of outputs - I will use tool execution in later stages when necessary)**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Pixels Changed: All.
    *   Correct: Yes.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Pixels Changed:
        *   Expected: (1,1) changes to 2.
        *   Actual: (0,2) change to 2
    *   Correct: No. One pixel off.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Pixels Changed:
        *   Expected:(1,0) changes to 4 and (2,0) changes to 4 and (1,1)
            changes to 2
        *   Actual: many, many incorrect changes.
    *   Correct: No. Three Pixels are off

**YAML Fact Representation**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - cells: contain color values (0-9)

  - name: seed_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-zero value
      - location: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: propagate_down
    description: Extends a seed pixel's color downwards in its column.
    preconditions:
      - Source cell is a seed pixel.
    stopping_conditions:
      - Reaches the bottom of the grid.
      - Encounters a cell already filled by downward propagation.

  - name: propagate_right
    description: Extends a seed pixel's color rightwards in its row.
    preconditions:
      - Source cell is a seed pixel.
    stopping_conditions:
      - Reaches the right edge of the grid.
      - Encounters a cell that is *below* a seed pixel or is already filled in
        by downward propigation

```


**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all pixels within the input grid that possess non-zero values. These pixels are designated as "seed" pixels.

2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. Preserve all original seed pixel values.

3.  **Downward Propagation (Precedence):**
    *   Each seed pixel initiates a downward propagation of its color value within its respective column.
    *   This propagation continues until one of the following conditions is met:
        *   The bottom row of the grid is reached.
        *   An obstruction is hit - a non-zero cell is encountered, including
            other seed pixels and cells filled by another downward propigation.

4.  **Rightward Propagation:**
    *   Each seed pixel initiates a rightward propagation of its color value within its respective row.
    *   This propagation continues until one of the following conditions is met:
        *   The rightmost column of the grid is reached.
        *   An obstruction is hit - if the cell directly below is not zero or if
            the cell has already been filled by a previous downward propigation

5.  **Output:** The output grid, now modified by the propagation rules, represents the final transformed grid.
