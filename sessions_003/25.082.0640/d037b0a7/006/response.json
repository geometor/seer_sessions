However, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in the rightward propagation logic. The rightward propagation should stop *before* a cell that has already been filled by downward propagation. The current code propagates rightward even if a downward prop has filled in the value, it just checks if original output value is zero\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Rightward Propagation:** Modify the natural language program and the code to explicitly state and implement the blocking condition for rightward propagation: a cell filled by downward propagation (from any seed) blocks rightward propagation.\n\n2.  **Detailed Analysis of Examples:** Examine each example closely to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails and why the updated rule will fix it.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using visual inspection of outputs - I will use tool execution in later stages when necessary)**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Pixels Changed: All.\n    *   Correct: Yes.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Pixels Changed:\n        *   Expected: (1,1) changes to 2.\n        *   Actual: (0,2) change to 2\n    *   Correct: No. One pixel off.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Pixels Changed:\n        *   Expected:(1,0) changes to 4 and (2,0) changes to 4 and (1,1)\n            changes to 2\n        *   Actual: many, many incorrect changes.\n    *   Correct: No. Three Pixels are off\n\n**YAML Fact Representation**\n\n"

These pixels are designated as \"seed\" pixels.\n\n2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. Preserve all original seed pixel values.\n\n3.  **Downward Propagation (Precedence):**\n    *   Each seed pixel initiates a downward propagation of its color value within its respective column.\n    *   This propagation continues until one of the following conditions is met:\n        *   The bottom row of the grid is reached.\n        *   An obstruction is hit - a non-zero cell is encountered, including\n            other seed pixels and cells filled by another downward propigation.\n\n4.  **Rightward Propagation:**\n    *   Each seed pixel initiates a rightward propagation of its color value within its respective row.\n    *   This propagation continues until one of the following conditions is met:\n        *   The rightmost column of the grid is reached.\n        *   An obstruction is hit - if the cell directly below is not zero or if\n            the cell has already been filled by a previous downward propigation\n\n5.  **Output:** The output grid, now modified by the propagation rules, represents the final transformed grid.\n"
