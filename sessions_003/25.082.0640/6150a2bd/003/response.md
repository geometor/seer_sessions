The transformation rule is a reflection (mirroring) of the input grid across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). This is equivalent to transposing the grid, swapping rows and columns. The pixel at position (x, y) in the input grid moves to position (y, x) in the output grid. Colors remain unchanged.
