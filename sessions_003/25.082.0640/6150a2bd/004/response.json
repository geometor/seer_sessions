While the output grid's dimensions are correctly swapped (rows become columns and vice-versa), the pixel arrangement isn't a simple transposition. The errors in both examples indicate a more complex transformation. The consistent `pixels_off` count of 6 in both examples, despite different grid sizes, suggests a patterned error related to the specific transformation logic, and not random misplacement. My strategy is to:\n\n1.  Carefully analyze the pixel movements in both examples.\n2.  Identify a consistent pattern beyond simple transposition.\n3.  Re-formulate the natural language program and code to reflect this pattern.\n4.  Use tool\\_code to programmatically compare input, expected and actual output.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nI'll use `tool_code` to analyze the differences between the expected and transformed outputs, focusing on the specific indices that differ.\n\n"
