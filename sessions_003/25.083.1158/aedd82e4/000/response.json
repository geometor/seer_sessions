The transformation seems to specifically involve the color `2` (red) and introduces or modifies the color `1` (blue). The key seems to be the location of red pixels relative to other red pixels and the grid edges. It feels like a \"find and replace\" or a conditional replacement based on the neighborhood of each red pixel.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
