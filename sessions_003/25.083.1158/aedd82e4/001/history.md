Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the underlying transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.  The transformation seems to specifically involve the color `2` (red) and introduces or modifies the color `1` (blue). The key seems to be the location of red pixels relative to other red pixels and the grid edges. It feels like a "find and replace" or a conditional replacement based on the neighborhood of each red pixel.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers (colors).
  - pixel: An individual cell within the grid, represented by an integer.
  - red_pixel: A pixel with the value 2.
  - blue_pixel: A pixel with the value 1.

properties:
  - color: The integer value of a pixel.
  - position: The row and column index of a pixel within the grid.
  - neighborhood: The set of pixels adjacent to a given pixel (including diagonals).

actions:
  - replace: Change the color of a pixel.

relationships:
  - adjacency:  A pixel can be adjacent to another pixel (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
  - bottom_right_corner: location at bottom right of 2 x 2 red blocks
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all red pixels (value 2).
3.  **Focus** on the 2 x 2 block created.
4. **Check** if a red pixel is at the bottom right corner of another red pixels.
5.  If the condition is met, **replace** the pixel with the value 1 (blue).
6.  All other pixels remain **unchanged**.
7. Return the modified grid as the output.

Essentially changing bottom right red pixel of 2 x 2 red blocks to blue.
