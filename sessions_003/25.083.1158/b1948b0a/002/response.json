However, the code incorrectly *only* considers immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right). The errors in the examples reveal that the transformation rule needs to consider *all* connected magenta pixels as a single object, not just immediate adjacencies.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program to capture the concept of \"connected components\" of magenta pixels. Instead of changing individual magenta pixels based on immediate neighbors, we need to identify *groups* of connected magenta pixels and, treat them as a single group. If a pixel is within a group, turn it into red (value 2), otherwise leave as is.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including specific observations that highlight the shortcomings of the current approach:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input: 3x4 grid with magenta and orange pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Shows a connected group of magenta pixels are turned to red.\n    *   Transformed Output: Doesnt transform all magenta pixels in connected groups.\n    *   Key Observation: The top-right magenta pixel (0,3) is incorrectly left unchanged, and also the bottom-center (2, 2) magenta pixel is incorrectly left unchanged.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input: 6x4 grid with magenta and orange pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Shows several connected groups of magenta pixels are turned to red.\n    *   Transformed Output: Doesnt transform all magenta pixels in connected groups.\n    *   Key Observation: similar errors as in Example 1\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input: 3x6 grid with magenta and orange pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Shows several connected groups of magenta pixels are turned to red.\n    *   Transformed Output: Doesnt transform all magenta pixels in connected groups.\n    *   Key Observation: similar errors as in Example 1\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

The crucial change is considering connected components rather than just immediate neighbors. The next phase will be to revise the python code.\n"
