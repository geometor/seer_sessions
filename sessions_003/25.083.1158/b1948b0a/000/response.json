The transformation seems to selectively change *only* magenta (6) pixels.\n*   The position of changed pixels isn't random; it seems related to the spatial relationships (adjacency) of pixels.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically if there is *any* horizontally or vertically adjacent pixel that has the *same* color value.\n5.  **Preserve Other Colors:** If a pixel is not magenta, or if it is magenta but not adjacent to any other magenta pixels, its color remains unchanged.\n6.  **Output:** Create an output grid with the modified pixel colors, maintaining the original grid dimensions.\n\nIn essence, the rule isolates magenta pixels by changing other magenta cells to red if the cell have neighbours of same color.\n"
