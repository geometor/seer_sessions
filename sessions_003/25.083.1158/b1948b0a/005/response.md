1.  **Identify Magenta Regions:** In the input grid, find all groups of connected magenta (color value 6) pixels. Pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
2.  **Transform to Red:** For each identified magenta region, change the color value of *all* its pixels to red (color value 2).
3.  **Preserve Other Colors:** Ensure that all pixels in the input grid that are *not* part of a magenta region retain their original color values in the output grid.
