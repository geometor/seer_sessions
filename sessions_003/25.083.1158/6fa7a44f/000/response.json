The transformation seems to involve a mirroring or reflection operation, specifically a vertical reflection. The output grid is twice the height of the input grid. The bottom half of the output grid appears to be a vertically flipped copy of the top half, which is identical to the input grid.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
