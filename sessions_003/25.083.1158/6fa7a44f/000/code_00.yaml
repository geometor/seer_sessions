facts:
  - observation: Input and output are 2D grids.
  - observation: Grid values are single-digit integers (0-9).
  - observation: Output grid height is double the input grid height.
  - observation: Output grid width is the same as the input grid width.
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - height: h
      - width: w
      - values: 2D array of integers
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - height: 2h
      - width: w
      - values: 2D array of integers
  - relationship: Top half of OutputGrid is identical to InputGrid.
  - relationship: Bottom half of OutputGrid is a vertical reflection of the InputGrid.
  - action: Vertical reflection of InputGrid to create the second half of OutputGrid
  - action: combine original with the reflection.
