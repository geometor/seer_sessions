Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The input grid transforms into an output grid that appears to be a modified, expanded version of the input. The core operation seems to be a form of duplication or mirroring of the input grid's pixels, both horizontally and vertically. The output grid is exactly twice the size (both width and height) as the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      properties:
        width: variable
        height: variable
  - pixel:
    type: individual element within the grid
    properties:
        value: integer (color)
        x: horizontal coordinate
        y: vertical coordinate

actions:
  - duplicate_row:
      description: Each row in the input is duplicated to create two identical, adjacent rows in the output.
  - duplicate_column:
      description: Each column in the input is duplicated to create two identical, adjacent columns.

relationships:
  - input_output_size:
      description: The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions (width_out = 2 * width_in, height_out = 2 * height_in).
  - pixel_mapping:
      description: Each pixel at (x, y) in the input maps to four pixels in the output at locations (2x, 2y), (2x+1, 2y), (2x, 2y+1), and (2x+1, 2y+1).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid using nested loops (row by row, column by column).
2.  For each pixel at coordinates (x, y) in the input grid, copy its value to the output grid.
3.  **Duplicate**: Place the same pixel value at the following four positions in the output grid:
    *   (2 \* x, 2 \* y)
    *   (2 \* x + 1, 2 \* y)
    *   (2 \* x, 2 \* y + 1)
    *   (2 \* x + 1, 2 \* y + 1)
4. This process effectively duplicates each row and each column of the input, resulting in an output grid that is twice the size of the input in both dimensions, and where each original pixel becomes a 2x2 block of identical pixels.

In simpler terms, the input grid is expanded by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. Each pixel in the input is replicated to form a 2x2 square of the same color in the output.
