objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      properties:
        width: variable
        height: variable
  - pixel:
    type: individual element within the grid
    properties:
        value: integer (color)
        x: horizontal coordinate
        y: vertical coordinate

actions:
  - duplicate_row:
      description: Each row in the input is duplicated to create two identical, adjacent rows in the output.
  - duplicate_column:
      description: Each column in the input is duplicated to create two identical, adjacent columns.

relationships:
  - input_output_size:
      description: The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions (width_out = 2 * width_in, height_out = 2 * height_in).
  - pixel_mapping:
      description: Each pixel at (x, y) in the input maps to four pixels in the output at locations (2x, 2y), (2x+1, 2y), (2x, 2y+1), and (2x+1, 2y+1).
