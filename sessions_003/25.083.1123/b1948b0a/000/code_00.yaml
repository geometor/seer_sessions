objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      properties:
        height: variable
        width: variable
  - pixel:
      type: individual cell in the grid
      properties:
        color: integer (0-9)
        position: (row, column)
        neighbors: adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right)

actions:
  - color_replacement:
      description: Change the color of a pixel based on a condition.
      condition: Presence of a specific color in the immediate horizontal or vertical neighbors.

relationships:
  - spatial_adjacency: Pixels are directly next to each other (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).
