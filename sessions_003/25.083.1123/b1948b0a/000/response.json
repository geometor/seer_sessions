The core operation seems to be a color replacement or conditional modification based on the neighboring pixels. The transformation doesn't involve any apparent geometric manipulations like rotations, reflections, or scaling. The size of the grid remains constant between input and output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
