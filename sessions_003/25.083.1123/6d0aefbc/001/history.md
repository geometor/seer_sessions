Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both rectangular grids of digits, representing colors.
*   **Expansion:** The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input grid. The dimensions (width and height) have increased.
*    **Duplication** The expansion copies the pattern

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns)
      - elements: integers (representing colors)
actions:
  - type: expansion
    properties:
      - factor: 2 # Both dimensions seem to be doubled.
    details: >
        the input grid expands to the double to its dimensions.
relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: The output grid is a scaled-up version of the input grid, with each original element duplicated horizontally and vertically.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a grid of integers.
2.  **Expansion:** The output is a copy of the input grid.
3.  **Output:** The expansion copies each value to be duplicated in a 2 x 2 block, doubling height and length.

In essence, the transformation rule is to take each element in the input grid and duplicate the values.
