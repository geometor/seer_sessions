The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Transpose:** The input grid is transposed. The i-th row of the input grid becomes the i-th column of an intermediate grid.
2.  **Reflect:** The intermediate grid is reflected across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). The element at `(i, j)` in the intermediate grid moves to `(j, i)` in the final output grid. The combinations of steps 1 & 2 is equivalent to transposing across the *opposite* diagonal.
