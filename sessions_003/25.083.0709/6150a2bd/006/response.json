            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a single example and are incorrect. The code performs a transpose and then a reflection across the horizontal axis (`np.flipud`), instead of reflecting across the opposite diagonal. The results show a consistent mismatch in pixel positions, indicating a systematic error in the transformation logic. The strategy is to correct the reflection operation to be along the correct diagonal.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example with some added analysis:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *   Observation: The output is *almost* a correct reflection across the *opposite* diagonal (bottom-left to top-right), but the code is performing an inversion instead, after a transpose.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *   Observation: Similar to Example 1, the intended transformation seems to be reflection across the *opposite* diagonal.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The element at `(i, j)` in the input grid moves to `(n-1-j, m-1-i)` in the output grid, where 'n' is the number of rows and 'm' is the number of columns in the input grid. This is equivalent to transposing the matrix and then reversing both rows and columms or rotating the grid by 180 degrees followed by a regular transpose.\n\n"
