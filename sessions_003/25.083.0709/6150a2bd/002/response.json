            "text": "Here's a report analyzing the provided results and outlining the next steps:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program, \"rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise,\" is incorrect. While the dimensions of the output grid are consistent with a 90-degree rotation, the pixel arrangement within the rotated grid doesn't match the expected output in either example. The `np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)` function performs a 90-degree *clockwise* rotation (k=-1 means one 90 deg clockwise rotation, equivalent to 3 counterclockwise turns), not counter-clockwise. Furthermore, simple rotation is not sufficient to describe the full transformation. There's a clear pattern we need to identify beyond the shape change.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Rotation Direction:** Modify the code to perform a true 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. We'll fix the `k` value in `np.rot90`.\n2.  **Detailed Pixel Comparison:** We need to analyze how individual pixels' positions change from input to output. A simple rotation accounts for the general shape change but not the internal pixel arrangement. We need to determine what rule defines the new location of each cell after the counter clockwise rotation.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately and completely describe the transformation, including the pixel-level changes.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection, no code execution needed for this particular task, as it is a simple visual correction):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Grid: 3x3\n    *   Output Grid: 3x3\n    *   Rotation Discrepancy: The provided code rotates clockwise. Expected output is counter-clockwise.\n    *   Pixel Mapping: Need to meticulously track how each cell from input maps to output.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Grid: 2x3\n    *   Output Grid: 3x2\n    *   Rotation Discrepancy: Same as Example 1.\n    *   Pixel Mapping: Same as Example 1.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
