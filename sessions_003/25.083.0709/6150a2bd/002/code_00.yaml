facts:
  - task: "Rotate grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise"
  - example_1:
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [3, 3]
    rotation: "90 degrees counter-clockwise"
    pixel_mapping: "Needs further analysis, simple rotation is insufficient"
  - example_2:
    input_shape: [2, 3]
    output_shape: [3, 2]
    rotation: "90 degrees counter-clockwise"
    pixel_mapping:  "Needs further analysis, simple rotation is insufficient"
  - general_rule: "Grid is rotated.  Row i in the input becomes column (N-1-i) in the output where N is the number of rows of input."
