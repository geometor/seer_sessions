The same digits appear in both, but their positions change.\n*   There's a mirroring/flipping/rotation effect. It's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip, nor a straightforward 90-degree rotation. It seems input is rotated clockwise by 90 degree. Then it's also flipped over the x axis, which makes it 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n*   The transformation appears to be a consistent re-arrangement of the input grid's elements.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
