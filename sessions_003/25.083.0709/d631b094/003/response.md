"""
Examine the 3x3 input grid. Identify all pixels that are not black (color 0), *excluding* the center pixel at coordinates (1, 1). Extract the color values of these non-black pixels. Create the output grid as a horizontal line (a 1 x N grid) containing these color values, where N is the number of identified non-black pixels. The order of the non-black colors in the output should match the order they are discovered while traversing the input grid row by row.
