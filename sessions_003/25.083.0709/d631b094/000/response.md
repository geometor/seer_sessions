Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program description of the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are 3x3 grids.
*   The outputs are smaller grids with variable dimensions (1x1, 1x2, 1x4 in the examples).
*   The outputs only contain colors that were present in the corresponding input grid, and never in the center (position (1,1)) or upper-left, upper-right, lower-right corners.
*   The values in the input grids are always in the top-left 2x2 or left-most 3. The rest is filled with black.
*   The output grid's dimensions appear related to the number of non-black pixels present on the input.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

actions:
  - name: extract_non_black
    input: input_grid
    output: list of non-black colors
    description: Extracts all non-black (non-zero) color values from specific locations in the input_grid, specifically excluding the center value.
  - name: construct_output
    input: list of non-black colors
    output: output_grid
    description: Creates the output_grid using the extracted non-black colors, repeating each color to construct a 1 x n array.

relationships:
    - type: element_of
      subject: output_grid
      object: input_grid
      description: The elements of the output_grid are a subset of the elements of the input_grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the input grid:** Inspect the 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Identify non-black pixels:** Find all pixels that are *not* black (color 0) and exclude the center value.
3.  **Extract Colors:** Extract the color values of these non-black pixels.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create the output grid by repeating those extracted colors to form horizontal line. If there are *n* non-black pixels, the resulting grid will be 1 X *n*.
