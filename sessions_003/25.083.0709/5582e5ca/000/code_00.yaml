observations:
  - task_type: color_selection_and_replication
  - objects:
      - input_grid:
          type: 2D array
          description: Contains a set of colors represented by digits.
          properties:
            - dimensions: rows x columns (variable)
            - colors: variable, represented by digits 0-9
      - output_grid:
          type: 2D array
          description: Contains only one color, replicated across the entire grid.
          properties:
            - dimensions: Same as input_grid
            - color: A single digit representing a color, selected based on an unknown rule from the input grid.
  - relationships:
      - output_grid_dimensions: "same as input_grid dimensions"
      - output_grid_color: "selected from input_grid colors based on an unknown, context dependent rule, but consistent column-wise and row-wise"
  - actions:
      - selection:
          description: A single color is selected from the input grid.
          rule: unknown, but consistent across all provided examples - might be related to the digits in the last column of the input.
      - replication:
          description: The selected color fills the entire output grid.
