## train_1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
0 2 0
7 0 8
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 2 0
7 2 8
7 2 8
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
4 0 0

4 2 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both rectangular grids of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   **Colors:** Different numbers correspond to different colors.  I need to keep the `COLOR_MAP` in mind.
*   **Shapes:** While individual colored pixels exist, the focus seems to be on horizontal and/or vertical lines of single colors.
*    **Possible Action**: There's a replication or filling action happening, extending existing colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid.
  - observation: "Colors in the input can be replaced or extended in the output"
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (in all examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - object: color_line
    properties:
        - orientation: horizontal or vertical
        - color: defined by the integer value
        - length: number of continuous same color pixels
    actions:
      - name: fill_down
        description: extends the line's color vertically downwards, possibly conditional on the presence of 0.
      - name: fill_right
        description: extend the line's color horizontally towards the right.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell in the input grid, row by row, top to bottom.
2.  **Identify** Non-zero pixel, and trace their corresponding horizontal line to find the end.
3.    **Identify** the right-most pixel of that line.
4.  **Propogate**: For the right-most pixel, fill down its own color value, with the condition of replacing 0 or the value of pixel below it.
5.  **Repeat** to find the next end of horizontal non-zero pixel.

Essentially, the transformation finds the right-most edge of non-zero horizontal regions and extends that edge downwards, replacing any existing '0' or color below that edge.
