I need to keep the `COLOR_MAP` in mind.\n*   **Shapes:** While individual colored pixels exist, the focus seems to be on horizontal and/or vertical lines of single colors.\n*    **Possible Action**: There's a replication or filling action happening, extending existing colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
