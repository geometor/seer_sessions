Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to selectively change some '0' (white) pixels to '2' (red) pixels. The location of the changed pixels appears related to the positions of the non-zero pixels, specifically '5' (gray) pixels. The unchanged pixels seem to form a frame or boundary. The height and with of the example input and output grids match.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Only '0' (white) pixels in the input grid are changed.
  - observation: The changed '0' pixels become '2' (red) pixels.
  - observation: The non-zero pixels ('5' - gray) remain unchanged.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - elements: integers [0-9]
    relations:
      - element_color: "mapped to color names via COLOR_MAP"
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer [0-9]
      - color: derived from value
      - position: (row, column)
  - action: change_pixel_value
    properties:
      - subject: pixel at specific position
      - from_value: 0
      - to_value: 2
    conditions:
      - "subject pixel is directly adjacent to two '5' pixels, on opposite sides."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** pixels with a value of '0' (white).
3.  For each identified '0' pixel, **check for adjacent** '5' (gray) pixels. Specifically, check these two conditions:
    *   Count the number of adjancent '5' pixels, adjancecy means directly above, below, left, and right, of the current pixel (not diagonal)
    *   Are there exactly two adjacent pixels and are the adjacent '5' pixels on opposite sides of the subject pixel?
        * "Opposite sides" means:
          *   horizontal: both to the left and right.
          *   vertical: both above and below.
4. **If and only if** both of the above conditions are true, change the value of the '0' pixel to '2' (red) in the output grid.
5.  **Otherwise**, copy the pixel value from the input grid to the output grid unchanged.

This program focuses on the specific adjacency rule that governs the transformation. It defines the notion of two adjacent pixels of value '5' being on "opposite sides".
