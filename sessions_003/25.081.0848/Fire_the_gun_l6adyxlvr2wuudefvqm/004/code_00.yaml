            Three white pixels at the top-left corner change to red.  They form a contiguous block of white pixels.  The grey pixels are scattered around.

      - example_2:
          changed_white_pixels: [[1, 3], [1, 4]]
          grey_pixel_locations: [[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2], [4, 4]]
          input_grid_shape: [5, 5]
          description: >
            Two white pixels at the top-right corner change to red. These white pixels are adjacent to grey pixels, and one is diagonally adjacent.

      - example_3:
          changed_white_pixels: [[0, 3], [0, 4], [3, 0], [3, 1]]
          grey_pixel_locations: [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3], [4, 3]]

          description: >
            Two white pixels at top-right change to red and two white pixels at bottom left change to red.  The pixels that change are adjacent to grey pixels.

    global_observations:
      - White pixels (0) change to red (2) only when they are adjacent to grey pixels (5), either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
      - The shape of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
      - The grey pixels (5) do not move or change color.
      - Only white pixels that are next to grey are considered.
