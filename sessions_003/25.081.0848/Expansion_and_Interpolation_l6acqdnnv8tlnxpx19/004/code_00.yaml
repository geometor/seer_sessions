    properties:
      - "Defined by contiguous pixels of the same non-zero color."
      - "Expand to the grid edges."

    details:
      - "Pixels of the same color as the original region are added to connect the region to the grid edges, forming the shortest path to all edges."
  - constraint: "Only the last row and column are not necessarily filled - the fill originates from the existing figure."
