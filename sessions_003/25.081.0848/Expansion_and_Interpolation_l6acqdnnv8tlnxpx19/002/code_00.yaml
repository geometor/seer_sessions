facts:
  - object: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - values: integers from 0 to 9, representing colors

  - object: non_zero_pixels
    description: Pixels in the input grid with a value other than 0.
    properties:
      - color: The single non-zero color present in the grid.
      - locations: Row and column indices of these pixels.

  - object: bounding_box
    description: A rectangle defining the outermost non-zero pixels.
    properties:
      - min_row: The smallest row index containing a non-zero pixel.
      - max_row: The largest row index containing a non-zero pixel.
      - min_col: The smallest column index containing a non-zero pixel.
      - max_col: The largest column index containing a non-zero pixel.

  - object: output_grid
    description: A 2D array of the same dimensions as the input grid, after transformation.
    properties:
        - dimensions: Same as input_grid.
        - values: Initially all 0, then filled based on the bounding box and non-zero pixels.

  - action: find_bounding_box
    description: Determine the min/max row/col indices of non-zero pixels in the input grid.

  - action: fill_edges
    description: Set the values of the output_grid along the edges of the bounding box to the non-zero color.

  - action: copy_nonzero
    description: Copy existing pixels to the output.
