Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code execution and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the idea of reflecting or extending yellow objects with red pixels, primarily considering proximity to grid boundaries. The results show consistent mismatches in pixel placement, although the size and color palette are correct. This suggests the core concept of using yellow objects as a basis for transformation is correct, but the logic for placing red pixels needs significant refinement. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each example to pinpoint the exact discrepancies.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent patterns in how the red pixels are placed *relative to* the yellow objects, rather than just focusing on boundary mirroring.
3.  **Refine Logic:** Update the natural language program to accurately capture the observed relationship between yellow and red pixel placement, and fix obvious problems in the current reflection concept.
4. Create a structured YAML to help capture what we learn.

**Gather Metrics and Detailed Analysis**

I'll use a code block to perform an initial analysis, helping create an accurate report.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Yellow Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of yellow (4) pixels.
2.  **Determine Red Pixel Placement:** For each yellow object, place red (2) pixels by filling to the edge of the grid, creating a "filled corner".
    - The red pixels complete a line of pixels on the opposite side of the grid.
    - If the yellow object is not on a boundary, then red pixels are placed to fill towards the boundary, effectively creating a "reflection".

The core concept is filling to the opposite edges, vertically and horizontally, creating a reflection of the yellow object's area, using the grid edge as a boundary. The red fill does NOT extend outside the object bounds, the shape of the red fill is determined by the grid, not the yellow object.
