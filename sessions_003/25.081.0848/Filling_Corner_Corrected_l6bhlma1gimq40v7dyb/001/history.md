Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary element appears to be the interaction and transformation of objects defined by contiguous blocks of the color 'yellow' (4). The output grids seem to introduce the color 'red' (2) in relation to the 'yellow' objects. The spatial relationship between the yellow and red pixels is key. Specifically, red pixels seem to "extend" or be placed "adjacent" to yellow pixels, in some cases on the opposite side or in a mirrored fashion.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: yellow_object
    description: A contiguous block of one or more pixels with the value 4 (yellow).
    properties:
      - shape: variable (can be a single pixel or a larger connected shape)
      - size: variable (depends on the number of connected yellow pixels)
      - location: variable (coordinates within the grid)

  - name: red_object
    description: pixels introduced with value 2 (red)
    properties:
      - shape: appears dependent on position of the yellow object
      - location: related to a yellow objects

actions:
  - name: extend_yellow
    description: create red (2) pixels in relation to the yellow objects

relationships:
  - yellow_to_red:  The location and shape of red pixels is determined with respect the yellow objects.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Yellow Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of 'yellow' (4) pixels in the input grid. Each separate block is considered a distinct object.
2.  **Mirror/Extend:** For each 'yellow object':
    *   If yellow is on the edge of a boundary (first row, last row, first column, last column) add red pixels at the boundary edge on the opposite side of the grid in the same shape as the yellow object
    *   If the yellow object is not on a boundary, add a red object to the side that maximizes distance from the boundary
3.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by placing the original yellow objects and the new red pixels in their determined positions. All other cells remain unchanged (keep their original values from the input grid, usually 'white' (0)).

In summary, the transformation rule involves identifying yellow objects and strategically adding red pixels that reflect or expand related to the yellow objects. The "reflection" or "extension" happens in relation to boundaries of the grid and other yellow object positions.
