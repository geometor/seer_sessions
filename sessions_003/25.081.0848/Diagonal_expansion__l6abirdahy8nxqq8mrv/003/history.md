Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. The code correctly identifies non-white pixels and attempts to draw a cross, but it incorrectly fills *entire* rows and columns based on *any* non-white pixel. The expected outputs show that the cross's arms should extend only to the edges of non-white regions. Instead of expanding to the bounds of the grid, expansion must stop at the first white(0) pixel, or grid edge.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly define "non-white regions" as contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
2.  **Modify Expansion Logic:** Implement a "bounded expansion" mechanism. The cross's arms should grow outwards from the center pixel until a white pixel (0) or the grid boundary is encountered.
3.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure the output grid accurately mirrors background (white) pixels and fills only when a transformation is needed

**Gather Metrics:**

I don't need tool execution to analyze this. The `pixels_off`, `size_correct`, `color_palette_correct` are sufficient. We can determine the input grid size, and output grid size, and find how the current algorithm operates and how the transformation should actually operate.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 5x5
    *   Output Size: 5x5
    *   Pixels Off: 20
    *   Observation: Crosses extend to the edges of the grid, which is incorrect.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 5x5
    *   Output Size: 5x5
    *   Pixels Off: 18
    *   Observation: Similar to Example 1, the crosses are over-extended.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 5x5
    *   Output Size: 5x5
    *   Pixels Off: 20
    *   Observation: Same issue - incorrect cross extension.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: non_white_pixel
    properties:
      - color: value other than 0
      - location: row and column index
    behavior:
      - initiates_cross:  A cross centered on the given pixel is created.
  - object: cross
    properties:
        - center: row, col of the non_white_pixel
        - color: same as initiating non_white_pixel
    behavior:
        - bounded_expansion: extends horizontally and vertically from center, stopping at white pixels or grid edges.
  - object: white_pixel
    properties:
        - color: 0
        - role: boundary for cross expansion
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid identical in size to the input grid, and filled with white (0) pixels.

2.  **Non-White Pixel Identification:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell is not white (value is not 0), identify its row, column, and color.

3.  **Cross Generation (Bounded Expansion):** For each non-white pixel:
    *   Set the color of current cell in the output to the color of the non-white pixel.
    *   **Horizontal Expansion:**
        *   Expand rightward from the center, setting pixel colors to the cross color, until a white pixel or the right grid edge is hit.
        *   Expand leftward from the center, setting pixel colors to the cross color, until a white pixel or the left grid edge is hit.
    *   **Vertical Expansion:**
        *   Expand downward from the center, setting pixel colors to the cross color, until a white pixel or the bottom grid edge is hit.
        *   Expand upward from the center, setting pixel colors to the cross color, until a white pixel or the top grid edge is hit.

4.  **Output:** The output grid now contains crosses of appropriate colors, centered on the locations of the original non-white pixels, with arms extending only to the boundaries (white pixels or grid edges).
