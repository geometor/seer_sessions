The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both 3x3 in the first example, and 3x2 in the second). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic on the numbers. It is likely a spatial transformation, re-arranging the input cells to produce the output. The relative positions of the numbers(pixels) are changing. A key observation is that it is similar to a counter-clockwise 90 degree rotation and mirror. The transformation inverts rows and columns and their order.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For a grid of height (number of rows) `H`, The element that was originally at `input[row][col]` is now at `output[H - 1- col][row]`\n\nAnother way to describe it is:\n1. Rotate the grid 90 degree counter clockwise.\n2. Mirror/Flip the grid vertically.\n"
