The primary color involved is yellow (4), with the background being white (0). The transformation seems to involve a downward propagation or \"waterfall\" effect of the yellow color.  The transformation stops when it reaches either the bottom of the grid or when it reaches the row after the last instance of yellow in that column.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If a given row contains at least one yellow pixel, extend all yellows downward to the *next* row.\n5.  **No other Propagation** If a row contains no yellow, do not add yellow to that or any subsequent row.\n6. **Maintain Dimensions:** Keep all white pixels (0) in same coordinates as the input.\n\nEssentially, the yellow \"falls\" down each column until it hits the bottom or one row past where there was previously yellow.\n"
