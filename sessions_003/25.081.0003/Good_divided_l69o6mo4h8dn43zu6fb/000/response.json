The output grid seems to retain some elements of the input grid but with significant changes. The most obvious changes are:\n\n1.  A specific color is removed entirely. In both examples, color `4` (yellow) in the input is completely absent in the output.\n2.  Another prominent color is set as background. Color `2` (red) in both examples of input, is not found in the output.\n3.  The remaining colors appear to be \"shifted\" or repositioned, and some are removed.\n4.   The output contains more `0` (white) which seems to fill in the space left by removed colors.\n5. The dimensions of input and output are the same.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The empty spaces in the grid should be filled with white.\n\nEssentially, the transformation appears to be a selective color removal and potentially rearrangement, followed by filling the resulting empty spaces with white. Colors 2 and 4 is completely removed.\n"
