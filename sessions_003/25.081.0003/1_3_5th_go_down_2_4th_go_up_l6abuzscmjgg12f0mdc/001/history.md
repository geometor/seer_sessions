Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.
*   **Symmetry:** There's a strong suggestion of a symmetrical transformation, potentially a reflection or rotation of some sort. Visualizing the changes, I have a strong expectation about diagonal mirroring.
*    **Non-Zero Values:** The non-zero values seem to be the key elements undergoing transformation, while the zeros act as a background or empty space.
*   **Object Interactions:** Some colored objects will interact with the diagonal line and others will simply be moved.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids.
    dimensions: 5x5 (all examples)
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Defined by the integer value (0-9).
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - type: transformation
    description: A diagonal reflection/mirroring effect
    details: the colored values are moved diagonally down and to the left.
  - type: observation
    description: Only Non-zero values are actively involved.
    details: Zero values remain unchanged, signifying empty space.
  - type: interaction
    description: object pixels either interact with or move around the diagonal

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the diagonal:** Imagine a diagonal line running from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (4,4) of the input grid.

2.  **Move colored pixels:** Transform each non-zero pixel from the input in this way:
    *    swap the x and y coordinate of the pixel, example: `pixel(row=1,col=3)` becomes `pixel(row=3, col=1)`
    *    the new pixel location gets the color value from the input
    *    empty input pixels (value 0) do not get moved.
    *    if the new position is occupied by another moved pixel, use a stacked, column-wise approach - start adding ones at the left, bottom until empty cell

3.  **Output:** Create the output grid with these moved and potentially "stacked" colored pixels. Pixels that were originally '0' (white/empty) remain '0' in the output.

Essentially the values are being reflected across the main diagonal, creating a mirror image below the diagonal, and stacking the values if there are any overlaps from the input in the transformed position.
