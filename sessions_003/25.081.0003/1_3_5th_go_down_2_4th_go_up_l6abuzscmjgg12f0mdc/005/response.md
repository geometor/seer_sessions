"""
Transforms an input grid by reflecting its non-zero elements across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
If multiple elements map to the same position after reflection, they are stacked vertically, starting from the bottom of the grid.
After reflection and stacking, any non-zero value on the main diagonal will cause its column (below the diagonal) to be filled with that value.
