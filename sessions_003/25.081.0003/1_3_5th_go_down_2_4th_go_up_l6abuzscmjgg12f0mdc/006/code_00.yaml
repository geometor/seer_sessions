      description: "Swap row and column indices of non-zero pixels."
      condition: "Always applied to non-zero pixels."
    - name: "Stack"
      description: "If reflection results in multiple pixels occupying the same location, stack according to rules described in the program"
      condition: "Multiple pixels map to the same reflected coordinates."
  - transformation_rule: "Reflect non-zero pixels across the main diagonal, then stack any colliding pixels vertically from top down, starting at row of swapped column index."
  - original_code_assessment:
      - correct_reflection: "The initial code correctly reflects pixels."
      - incorrect_stacking: "The initial code stacks, however the order is reversed. It also does not consider the correct starting position"
