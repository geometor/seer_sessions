Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a simple diagonal reflection, but the results show it's significantly off. The consistent `pixels_off` counts across examples (15, 15, 12) and visual inspection of the transformed outputs versus the expected outputs indicate a more complex transformation. The "stacking" logic seems to be incorrect or incomplete.

The strategy will be:

1. **Analyze Pixel Movement:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each example. We need to determine how individual pixels *move* and *combine*, not just their final positions.  Specifically, we're looking to see if there is some operation being applied to the row/col before the swap.
2. **Object Identification:** Identify if certain groups of pixels (objects) are treated differently than others.
3. **Re-evaluate Stacking:**  The current stacking logic appears to place stacked elements starting at the *bottom* and moving up, whereas the problem may intend stacking down from the original location. We also need to check conditions for when stacking occurs.
4. **Develop a New Hypothesis:** Based on the above, we'll create a new natural language program and corresponding YAML facts.

**Gather Metrics and Observations**

I need to compare each of the cells in each example to check my assumptions.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Reflection:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. For every non-zero pixel:
    *   Swap its row and column indices (reflect it across the main diagonal).
3.  **Stacking:**
    *   Let `new_r` and `new_c` be the swapped row and column indices, respectively.
    *   Check if the cell at `output_grid[new_r][new_c]` is empty (value 0).
        *   If empty, place the reflected pixel's value at `output_grid[new_r][new_c]`.
        *   If not empty, find available space *downwards* by iterating through the column starting with `new_r`. Insert value when an empty cell is available. If no empty cell, stop.
4.  **Output:** Return the resulting `output_grid`.

The core change is in the stacking logic. Instead of stacking *upwards* from row `rows-1`, we stack *downwards*, starting from the position given by the row of the swapped column index, and continue stacking downwards as needed. This accounts for the observed behavior in the expected outputs.
