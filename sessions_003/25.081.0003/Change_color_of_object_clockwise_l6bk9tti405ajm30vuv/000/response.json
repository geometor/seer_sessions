It's crucial to distinguish between the numbers as mere identifiers and their representation as colors.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color likely represent individual objects.\n*   **Transformations:**  The transformation seems to involve a mirroring or reflection, combined with a color swap.  The positions of some colors are swapped.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Color Pairs:** For each input-output pair, determine the two colors that are swapping positions.  Notice that the colors in corresponding positions between the input and output are exchanging between the pair.\n2.  **Diagonal swap:** The input grid appears to be mirrored along the main diagonal, and, in the process, the two identified color blocks are exchanging their colors. Not a true reflection, because only select colors are moving positions.\n\n**Elaboration and Key Insights:**\n\nThe core concept is a *color-swapped diagonal mirroring*.  It's not a simple rotation or reflection of the *entire* grid. Instead, two specific colors exchange positions, and their new positions seem determined by a diagonal reflection. The remaining colors stay the same. The program has to identify *which* two colors participate in this swap for each example.\n\n**Example Breakdown (train\\_1):**\n\n*   Input colors 3 and 2, swap with each other.\n*   Input colors 4 and 8 also perform a swap\n*   The movement of the swapped colors appears to perform a diagonal mirroring.\n\n**Example Breakdown (train\\_2):**\n\n*   Input colors 5 and 6, swap with each other.\n*   Input colors 3 and 2 also swap with each other\n\n**Example Breakdown (train_3):**\n* Input colors 9 and 7, swap with each other\n* Input colors 4 and 4 also swap - a more traditional reflection.\n\nThis detailed perception and natural language program will be crucial in the coding phase, it acts as specifications.\n"
