            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and subsequent code:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a color-swapped diagonal mirroring was partially correct but incomplete. The code successfully identifies color swaps but incorrectly applies them universally.  The errors show that the swaps are *localized* and *conditional*, not global.  The swaps also do not consistently apply to all pixels of a color; train_3 shows an unchanged color 7.  The code also does not use any detection, and applies the hard-coded colors.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine where the transformed output differs from the expected output in *each* example.  This pinpoints the limitations of the current logic. Focus especially on positions where colors that *should* have changed didn't.\n2.  **Identify Conditions:** Determine the *conditions* under which the color swaps occur.  Is it based on object shape, connectivity, adjacency, or something else?  The current code assumes all instances of a color should be swapped, which is clearly wrong.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:**  Update the description to incorporate these conditions.  Be specific about *which* pixels of the swapped colors are affected and *why*.\n4. **Object Identification:** Use a method of grouping like connectivity to determine objects and what colors should be used to swap. This method will need to be aware of the swap condition and which pixels to change.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using Python tool for verification where needed)**\n\nI'll use manual analysis, supplemented by conceptual code execution where necessary to highlight specific points. I will describe each example and focus on how the rule is different to the previous implementation.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5\n    *   Colors Involved in Swap: 2 (red), 3 (green), 4(yellow), 8(light blue).\n    *   Observation: Red (2) and green (3) swap, and yellow(4) and blue(8) swap. It appears as if they mirror along the diagonal.\n    *   Pixels Off: 14.  This high number indicates the global swap assumption is very wrong.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5\n    *   Colors Involved in Swap: 2(red), 3(green), 5(grey), 6(pink)\n    *   Observation: Colors appear to have moved. Red(2) and grey(5) appear to swap and green(3) and pink(6). It does not appear to be a mirror.\n    *   Pixels Off: 14.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5\n    *   Colors Involved in Swap: 4(yellow), 7(orange), 9(dark red)\n    *   Observation: Yellow(4) and dark red(9) swap, and orange(7) does not change.\n    *   Pixels Off: 10.\n\n**YAML Fact Base**\n\n"
