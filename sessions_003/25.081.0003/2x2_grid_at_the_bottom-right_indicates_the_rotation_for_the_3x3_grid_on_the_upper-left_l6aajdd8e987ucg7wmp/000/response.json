Here's my breakdown of the example input-output pairs:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 5x5 grids.\n*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, represented by digits 0-9, where 0 is white and seems most common (background)\n*    **Objects**: Contiguous blocks of single colors exist. In this task there are two distinct object types based on colors (object-3 and object-1)\n*   **Object-3:** Color 3 (green) appears as a cohesive object, shapes vary (single,\n    double, triple pixels) but always arranged horizontally or vertically\n    adjacent. It's location is not consistent across all examples.\n*   **Object-1:** Color 1 (blue) appears in all the input examples, always in a 2x1\n    block oriented vertically. There is also an adjacent object 4 (yellow) -\n    which always appears on the right hand-side of the 1.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
