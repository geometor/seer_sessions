The core issue is that the code's logic for replacing white pixels with azure is too simplistic and incorrectly handles the relationship between the \"control row\" (the row with reds and a single azure) and the all-white columns, especially when there are multiple azure colored cells.\n\nThe strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Analyzing the Examples Closely**: Examine the provided input, expected output, and transformed output grids to pinpoint exactly where the code's logic fails. I'll pay close attention to the positioning of red, azure, and white pixels.\n2.  **Refining the Control Row Logic**: The concept of a \"control row\" seems valid, but the way it interacts with other elements needs to be adjusted.\n3.  **Improving Column and Color Replacement**: Rethink the criteria for replacing white pixels. It seems dependent on the position of not only red but *also* azure in the control row.\n4.  **Developing a Correct Natural Language Program**: Create a revised program description that correctly accounts for all examples\n\n**Gathering Metrics**\n\nI'll use the provided information to manually extract the metrics needed, since I don't have code execution in this dreamer stage.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input Dimensions**: 5x5\n*   **Control Row Index**: 4 (row index from 0)\n*   **All-White Columns**: \\[1, 3]\n*   **Errors**:\n    *   The transformed output is identical to the input.\n    *   Pixels in columns 1 and 3 above row 4 should have been changed.\n    *   Columns 2 and 4 are all white above row 4 and they are incorrectly all white.\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input Dimensions**: 5x5\n*   **Control Row Index**: 4\n*   **All-White Columns**: \\[1, 2]\n*   **Errors**:\n    *   The transformed output is identical to the input.\n    *   The white pixels are not transformed above row 4.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

It takes into consideration the vertical relationship between the azure in the control row and the cells above it.\n"
