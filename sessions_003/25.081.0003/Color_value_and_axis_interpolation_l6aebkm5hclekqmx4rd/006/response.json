            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and results to refine the natural language program and address the errors.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of stacking rows on top of each other, preserving non-zero values in the last row. However, the test results clearly show this is incorrect. The code only preserves the last row and doesn't modify the other rows according to the patterns observed in the expected outputs. The expected outputs demonstrate a pattern where non-zero values from the last row propagate upwards, filling in zeros in the columns above. Also we are not stacking from top to bottom. Instead, each cell in the last row is propagating upwards to fill the zeros above it.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. We need to see where the values are propagated, what are their conditions and the target position in the output.\n2.  **Identify the Core Rule:** Determine the precise rule governing how non-zero elements from the last row influence the rest of the grid.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the program to accurately reflect the identified rule, paying close attention to the direction and conditions of propagation.\n4. Develop code from the updated description\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's start with a manual observation of the examples:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input: 5x5 grid, last row is `1 2 3 5 6`.\n*   Expected Output: Last row is unchanged. Each non-zero element in the last row propagates upwards, filling zeros in its column.\n*   Transformed Output: Only the last row of the input is preserved.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input: 5x5 grid, last row is `6 1 3 2 5`.\n*   Expected Output: Last row is unchanged. Each non-zero element propagates upwards.\n*   Transformed Output: Only the last row of the input is preserved.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   Input: 5x5 grid, last row is `5 3 6 2 1`.\n*   Expected Output: Last row is unchanged. Each non-zero element propagates upwards.\n*   Transformed Output: Only the last row of the input is preserved.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
