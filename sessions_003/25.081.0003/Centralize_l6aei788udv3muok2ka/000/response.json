The most prominent element is the presence of a single \"object\" (contiguous block of non-zero pixels) in each input grid. This object is always a solid rectangle of a single color (red, gray, or magenta). The transformation seems to involve a rotation of this object by 90 degrees clockwise, and an adjustment of the final position, such as center alignment with original object. The background (zero-valued pixels, i.e. white) remains largely unchanged, acting as padding.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

This constitutes the single rectangular object.\n\n2.  **Determine Dimensions:** Find the width and height of this rectangular object.\n\n3.  **Rotate 90 Degrees Clockwise:** Imagine, or conceptually perform, a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the object. This swaps the width and height and inverts the relative pixel positions within the object.\n\n4  **Center**: Move the rotated object such that it aligns with the horizontal and vertical center lines from it's orignal position.\n\n5.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the original input grid, filled with zeros (white background).\n\n6.  **Place Rotated Object:** Place the rotated object onto the output grid in the centered position. Ensure that the rotated object's pixels overwrite the corresponding background pixels in the output grid.\n"
