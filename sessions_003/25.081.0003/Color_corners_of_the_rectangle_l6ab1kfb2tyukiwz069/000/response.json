There are also background pixels of white (0). We also perceive an introduction of orange (7) pixels.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The green block maintains its shape and size. The orange pixels appear to be inserted to the left and right of the existing green block's columns.\n*   **Transformations:** The core transformation seems to be an insertion or wrapping of the green object with orange pixels, happening only on the rows that contain the original green object. It's a column-wise conditional insertion.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
