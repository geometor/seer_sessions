facts:
  - description: "The transformation involves rearranging pixels within rows, not just entire rows."
    evidence: "Differences (x) are observed within rows in the diff grids of all examples."
    example: 1

  - description: "Zeros are treated differently than other colors."
    evidence: "Zeros often move to fill spaces, suggesting a padding or filling role."
    example: 2

  - description: "Non-zero pixels in a row are often, but not always, grouped together."
    evidence: "The transformed outputs often show non-zero pixels clustered, although their exact order and position change."
    example: 3

  - description: "Empty rows in the input do not dictate empty rows in the output always.  They influence the padding at the bottom"
    evidence: "Example 3 has an empty row at the top of the output, not the input."
    example: 3

  - description: "Non-zero pixels may be reordered within a row."
    evidence: "In example 1, the '5' moves from the fourth to the third position."
    example: 1
