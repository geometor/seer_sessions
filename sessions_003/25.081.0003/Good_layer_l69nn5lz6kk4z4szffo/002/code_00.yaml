      objects:
        - color: 4
          shape: rectangle
          boundary_action: expand_down
        - color: 1

        - color: 0 #background
          shape: irregular
          boundary_action: none
      transformation: "The boundary between the color 4 rectangle and the color 1 rectangle shifts. The color 4 rectangle expands downwards, and the color 1 rectangle contracts upwards."
  - example_2:
     objects:
        - color: 3
          shape: rectangle
          boundary_action: expand_right
        - color: 6
          shape: rectangle

        - color: 0  # background color
          shape: irregular
          boundary_action: none
     transformation: "The boundary between the color 3 rectangle and the color 6 rectangle shifts such that the color 3 rectangle extends to the right and color 6 rectangle contracts to the left"
