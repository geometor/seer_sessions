The primary elements are:\n\n*   **Background:** The white (0) pixels seem to form a background.\n*   **Horizontal Shapes:** There are horizontal lines or rectangles of a single, non-white color within each input grid.\n*    **Outer Edge Pixels**: There are pixels that define the outer edge of the object.\n*   **Color Changes**: Specific, single pixels seem to shift position and/or change their color.  The transformation seems to focus on moving and sometimes combining color from the edge pixels on the outer perimeter of the object.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
