Specifically, it appears to involve some kind of \"filling\" or \"propagation\" of colors, based on the position of highest color.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The relative positions of colors/objects are critical. The examples show a consistent pattern related to the arrangement of the colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Consider each distinct color as a separate object.\n2.  **Iterate:** For each row from top to bottom:\n    *   Find the left most occurrance of the highest color in that row. Fill all positions to its left up to the start of the grid with this color.\n    *   Find the next highest color in the row, do the same fill to left operation.\n    *   Repeat untill the lowest non-zero color, or untill all postitions to the left of any non-zero color are filled.\n3. Output the transformed grid.\n\nEssentially - it can be thought of a left \"fill\" operation on each row with each non zero colour starting with the largest colour.\n"
