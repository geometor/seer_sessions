  - observation: "Each example consists of a 5x5 input grid and a 5x5 expected output grid."
  - object_identification: "Objects are contiguous blocks of the same color."
  - row_operation: "Within each row, colors influence cells to the left of their original position"
  - column_operation: "within each column, colours influence cells below their original position, after row operations"
