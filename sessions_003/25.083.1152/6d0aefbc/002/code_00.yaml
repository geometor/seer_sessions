objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x6
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)

actions:
  - name: transform
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      The transformation duplicates and re-arranges the input_grid columns to produce the output_grid. The number of rows
      remains constant, and the number of columns doubles. Columns are duplicated with a diagonal reflection effect.
      The colors of input grid are preserved and the color counts are consistent with duplication.
