objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3)
        - elements: integers (representing colors)
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: doubled input grid dimensions (e.g., 6x6)
        - elements: integers (representing colors, same as input)
actions:
  - duplication:
      description: Each pixel in the input grid is duplicated.
      properties:
        - direction: both horizontal and vertical
relationships:
  - input_to_output:
      type: transformation
      description: output_grid is created by duplicating each pixel of the input_grid.
      properties:
         - size_change: output_grid dimensions are twice that of input_grid.
         - color_preservation:  pixel color is preserved from input to output.
