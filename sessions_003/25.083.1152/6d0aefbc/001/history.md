Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The output grid appears to be a doubled/mirrored version of the input grid. The core operation seems to be a duplication of each pixel in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The colors of the original pixels are preserved in their expanded counterparts.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3)
        - elements: integers (representing colors)
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: doubled input grid dimensions (e.g., 6x6)
        - elements: integers (representing colors, same as input)
actions:
  - duplication:
      description: Each pixel in the input grid is duplicated.
      properties:
        - direction: both horizontal and vertical
relationships:
  - input_to_output:
      type: transformation
      description: output_grid is created by duplicating each pixel of the input_grid.
      properties:
         - size_change: output_grid dimensions are twice that of input_grid.
         - color_preservation:  pixel color is preserved from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive an input grid of dimensions *m* x *n*.
2.  **Duplication:** For each pixel (cell) in the input grid:
    *   Create a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid.
    *   Each pixel in the output block should be same color as the original input cell.
3. **Output Dimensions**: the program creates a new grid where the number of rows and the number of columns is double the input, in each dimension.
4.  **Output:** Return the new grid.

In essence, the transformation rule is to double each pixel in both dimensions, effectively creating a 2x2 "magnified" version of each original pixel, and thus creating an output that has a mirrored, doubled version.
