Here's my breakdown of the task, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input is a rectangular grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   **Output:** The output appears to be a significantly smaller rectangular grid, also containing single-digit integers. It seems like the output is a condensed or summarized version of the input, focusing on specific elements.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.\n*   **Relationships:** The position of elements relative to each other seems to be significant. We must carefully examine how different colored blocks are arrange in each grid.\n* **Possible Operations:** The transformation *doesn't* appear to be a simple sub-section selection. There's likely some logic related to identifying a recurring pattern or a specific object within the input.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
