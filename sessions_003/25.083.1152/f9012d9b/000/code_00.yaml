task_description: |
  The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into a smaller output grid.
  The transformation rule seems to involve selecting specific parts of the input grid.

observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: 5x5
      output_shape: 2x2
      input_colors: [0, 1, 2]
      output_colors: [1, 2]
      notes: |
          The center of the input is 1, the upper and bottom 3x1 sections are [2 1 2].

  - example_2:
      input_shape: 4x4
      output_shape: 1x1
      input_colors: [0, 6, 8]
      output_colors: [8]
      notes: |
        The input features a checkerboard pattern of 6 & 8, the output is 8, which is the top left.

  - example_3:
      input_shape: 7x7
      output_shape: 2x2
      input_colors: [0, 2, 5]
      output_colors: [2, 5]
      notes: |
        Input is made up of regions of 2 and 5, with two 0s in the bottom right.
        The output is the top left 2x2 section of a consistent 5x5 section of the input grid.
