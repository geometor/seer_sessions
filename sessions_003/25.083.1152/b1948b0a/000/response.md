Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers, representing colors. The primary change appears to be the substitution of specific colors, namely '6' (magenta) gets replaced by '2'(red). The color '7'(orange) is unaffected. The transformation maintains the grid's shape and size; only specific pixel values change. There doesn't seem to be object movement, interaction, or complex geometric manipulations. The key action is color replacement.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_substitution
grid_dimensions:
  train_1:
    input: [3, 4]
    output: [3, 4]
  train_2:
    input: [6, 4]
    output: [6, 4]
  train_3:
    input: [3, 6]
    output: [3, 6]
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        possible_values: [6, 7, 2]  # observed values
      position: [row, column]
actions:
  - type: replace_color
    agent: system
    target: pixel
    precondition: pixel.color == 6
    postcondition: pixel.color == 2
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.  Neighboring pixels can have the same or different colors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color value of the current pixel.
3.  **If** the color value is '6' (magenta), **replace** it with '2' (red).
4.  **Otherwise** if it is any other color, leave it as the original color.
5.  **Output** the modified grid, preserving the original dimensions.
