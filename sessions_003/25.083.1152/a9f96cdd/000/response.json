The most prominent feature is the presence of the number '2' (red) in the input grids and its apparent replacement or influence on other numbers in the output grids. The positions of '2' in the input seems to correlate with varied numerical patterns in the output, suggesting a rule-based transformation dependent on '2's location. There's no simple mirroring, shifting, or direct substitution. The transformation appears to involve spreading or generating new values in a localized manner, and the all-zero surroundings suggest an \"empty space\" concept, where the transformation happens around '2'.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"
