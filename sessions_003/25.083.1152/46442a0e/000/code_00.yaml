objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: single digits (0-9)
      - dimensions: variable height and width

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: single digits (0-9)
      - dimensions: larger than input_grid, even number of rows and columns

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded to create the output grid.
  - name: reflect_horizontal
    description: a copy input is created and the original is horizontally reflected, then the copy is horizontally concatenated
  - name: reflect_vertical
     description: step output from the horizontal reflection is vertically reflected, then original is vertically concatenated

relationships:
  - input_to_output: The input grid is transformed into the output grid through a process of reflection. The output contains both the original and a reflection of the input pattern. The expansion is 2x in each dimension.
