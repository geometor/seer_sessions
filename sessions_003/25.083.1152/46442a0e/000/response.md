Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits (representing colors).
*   The input grids seem to be smaller than the output grids.
*   The input grid appears to be used as a "seed" or "pattern" that is expanded in some way to form the output grid.
*   The output grid appears to have a symmetrical or repeating structure, resembling a reflected or tiled version of the input, but not a direct expansion.
*   The size increase is not a simple scaling, as the output has additional rows and columns, suggesting mirroring or other reflection.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: single digits (0-9)
      - dimensions: variable height and width

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: single digits (0-9)
      - dimensions: larger than input_grid, even number of rows and columns

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded to create the output grid.
  - name: reflect_horizontal
    description: a copy input is created and the original is horizontally reflected, then the copy is horizontally concatenated
  - name: reflect_vertical
     description: step output from the horizontal reflection is vertically reflected, then original is vertically concatenated

relationships:
  - input_to_output: The input grid is transformed into the output grid through a process of reflection. The output contains both the original and a reflection of the input pattern. The expansion is 2x in each dimension.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Horizontal Reflection:** Take the input grid and create a horizontally mirrored copy of it. Concatenate the original input grid with its horizontally mirrored copy, side-by-side.
2.  **Vertical Reflection:** Take the resulting grid from step 1 and create a vertically mirrored copy of it. Concatenate the grid from step 1 with its vertically mirrored copy, one above the other.

Essentially, the input grid is reflected both horizontally and vertically to create a 2x2 tiled pattern in the output grid, using the original input as the top-left tile.
