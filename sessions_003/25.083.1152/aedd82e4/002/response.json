            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the subsequent code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the core idea of changing '2' (red) to '1' (blue), it implemented an incorrect rule. The original program focused on the *last* occurrence of '2' in each row and column *independently*. The results clearly show this isn't the correct logic. The transformation isn't simply about the last '2' in a row/column, it is about *order* and how those two rules combine.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze the mismatches:** Carefully examine *where* the predicted output differs from the expected output in each example. This will provide clues about the *true* underlying rule. We will use code to programmatically compare the results to the ground truth for all the given examples\n2.  **Refine the rule:** Based on the mismatch analysis, develop a more precise natural language description of the transformation.\n3.  **Re-implement:** Generate new code based on the updated natural language program.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Mismatches:**\n\nI'll use a `tool_code` block to generate a more detailed comparison report, focusing on the differences.\n\n"
