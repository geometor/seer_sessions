"""
Iterate through each column of the input grid, starting from the bottom row and moving upwards.
For each column, find the last (bottom-most) occurrence of the value '2' (red).
If a '2' is found in that column, change its value to '1' (blue) in the output grid.
Iterate through each row of the input grid, start from the right-most column and moving left
For each row, find the last(right-most) occurence of the value '2'(red).
If a '2' is found in that row, change its value to '1'(blue) in the output grid
Copy all other pixel values from the input grid to the output grid unchanged.
ensure that if a '2' has already been changed to a '1' by the column rule, it is not changed again
by the row rule.
