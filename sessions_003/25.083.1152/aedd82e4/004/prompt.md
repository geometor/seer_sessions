1.  **Copy the Input:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Column Rule (Bottom-Up):** Iterate through each column of the grid, starting from the *bottom* row and moving *upwards*.
    *   For each column, find the *last* (i.e., bottom-most) occurrence of a red pixel ('2').
    *   If a red pixel is found in that column, change its value to blue ('1') *in the output grid*.
3.  **Row Rule (Right-to-Left):** Iterate through each row of the *output* grid (which may have been modified by the column rule), starting from the *right-most* column and moving *left*.
    *   For each row, find the *last* (i.e., right-most) occurrence of a red pixel ('2'). Importantly, consider pixels that are *currently* red, including those that were originally red or turned red by previous operations within that row.
    *   If a red pixel is found in that row, change its value to blue ('1') in the output grid.
4. **Important Note:** The column rule is applied *before* the row rule. Changes made by the column rule affect the input to the row rule. The "last red" is determined at each rule individually.
