  - action: transform_red_to_blue
    condition: "A red pixel is transformed to blue if it meets specific criteria related to its position within its row and column."
    details: |
        The transformation occurs only for red pixels that are either:
        1. The bottom-most red pixel in their column.
        2. The right-most red pixel in their row.  The original input grid must be used to evaluate the conditions.
    input: input_grid (2D array of integers)
    output: output_grid (2D array of integers)

  - observation_all_examples: |
      In all training examples, only the bottom-most red pixel in a column or right-most red pixel in a row (based on the original grid) is changed to blue.  Other red pixels are not changed.
      The existing code incorrectly considers intermediate states, causing additional pixels to be converted to blue.
