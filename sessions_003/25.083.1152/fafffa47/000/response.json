The top region contains mostly '9' (maroon) and '0' (white), while the bottom region contains mostly '1' (blue) and '0' (white).\n*   The output grids contain only '0' (white) and '2' (red).\n*   The '2' (red) pixels in the output seem to correspond to the locations of '9' (maroon) pixels in the upper section of the input, but not all '9's become '2's. There's a spatial relationship or pattern.\n*   The size and potentially shape of top section of input are related with size and shape of output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The lower section is defined as the region containing any '1' (blue) pixels. The upper section is everything above the lower section.\n\n2.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid has a height that is the same with the height of upper section of the input grid and a width equal to the input grid's width (which is consistently 3 in the examples).\n\n3. **Upper Section Mapping:** For the Upper Section\n    *   If a cell color is '9' in the input grid, change its value to '2'(Red) in the output grid.\n    *   If a cell color is '0' in the input grid, change its value to '0'(White) in the output grid.\n\n4.  **Lower Section Mapping:** The output grid does not reflect colors of Lower Section from input grid, all values of Lower Section in input will be transformed into 0 (White) in output.\n\n5. **Construct Output:** build the output section row by row based on upper section mapping.\n"
