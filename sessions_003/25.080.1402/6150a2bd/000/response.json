The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (e.g., 3x3 in the first example, and 3x2 to 3x3 in the second.) The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic or color changes based on neighboring pixels. Instead, the entire grid seems to be re-arranged. The order seems very specific. It appears input is rotated and flipped, and pixel values are remapped.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
