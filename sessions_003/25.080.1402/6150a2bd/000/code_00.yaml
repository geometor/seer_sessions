objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      properties:
        height:  # Varies, determined from input
        width:  # Varies, determined from input

transformations:
  - rotation: input is rotated, possibly counter clock wise 90 degrees, 180, or 270
  - flip: input is possibly flipped verticaly or horizontally, possibly before and/or after the rotation
  - remap: a many to one relationship from input pixels to output pixels, potentially following a pattern

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid:  The transformation rule defines this mapping.
  - color_mapping:  Each integer corresponds to a specific color.
  - spatial_rearrangement:  Pixel positions change in a structured way (rotation/reflection).
