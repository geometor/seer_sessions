## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two horizontal lines of single-digit numbers in the input, which are then transformed into two horizontal lines in the output. The numbers in the output alternate between the numbers present in the corresponding positions in the input lines. There is no change of background, and it does not appear that shapes, and sizes of objects matter here.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input consists of two rows of equal length, filled with the same single digit on each row.
  - object_1: |
      The first row of the input.
  - property_1: |
      Contains a repeated single digit number (e.g., 3).
  - object_2: |
      The second row of the input.
  - property_2: |
      Contains a repeated single digit number, different from the first row (e.g., 9).
  - transformation: |
      The output consists of two rows.
  - output_row_1: |
      Alternates between the digit from input row 1 and input row 2, starting with the digit from row 1.
  - output_row_2: |
      Alternates between the digit from input row 2 and input row 1, starting with the digit from row 2.
  - rule: The two values are interleaved in the output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input Identification:** Identify two horizontal lines (rows) of numbers in the input. Note the single digit value of the first row and second row, and that all elements on a row are the same single digit number.

2.  **Output Construction - Row 1:** Create the first output row by alternating between the number from the first input row and the number from the second input row. Start with the number from the first input row.

3.  **Output Construction - Row 2:** Create the second output row by alternating between the number from the second input row and the number from the first input row. Start with the number from the second input row.

4. The length of the output rows is the same as the input rows.
