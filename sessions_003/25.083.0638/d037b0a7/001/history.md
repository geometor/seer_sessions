Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The input grids seem to transform into output grids of the same dimensions. The transformation appears to involve some form of pattern recognition and replication based on non-zero color values. It looks like non-zero colors on the right-most and bottom-most edges are playing an important role.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_description:
  objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: 3x3 (all examples)
        - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  observations:
    - pattern: "Non-zero values on the right edge propagate downwards."
    - pattern: "Non-zero values on the bottom edge propagate rightwards."
    - pattern: "Propagation stops when it meets a non-zero cell"
    - relationship: "The non-zero color at the bottom right corner of the input appears to become a critical value"
  actions:
    - propagate: "Replicate a color value across adjacent cells."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Color:** Find the color value in the bottom-right cell of the input grid.
2.  **Vertical Propagation**: For each column starting from the right, propagate the right-most non-zero color down the rows, overwriting zeros.
3. **Bottom Row Propagation**: On the bottom row, propagate each non-zero color value to the right, overwriting zeros.
4.  If the bottom right element is not 0, then fill the bottom-right 2x2 subgrid with the value of the bottom-right corner element.

Essentially, the transformation "fills in" parts of the grid. The non-zero values on the edges get extended.
