The transformation rule involves propagating non-zero values from the right and bottom edges of the input grid. Vertical propagation takes precedence over horizontal propagation.  Non-zero values propagate downwards within a column until a non-zero cell is encountered. Non-zero values on the bottom row propagate to the right until a non-zero cell is encountered or if the cell has already been set by vertical propagation.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, capturing the basic idea of propagation. However, Example 3 reveals a flaw: the bottom-row propagation should *only* fill zeros that haven't already been filled by vertical propagation. My original logic propagated the rightmost non-zero cell on the bottom row all of the way across, unless another value existed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Example 3 Closely:** Understand precisely *why* the current logic fails in Example 3. The vertical propagation should take higher precedence and should stop if encountering another object.
2.  **Metrics:** I'll use numpy code execution to re-confirm that vertical propagation and the number of errors in the training examples. This ensures my report is based on solid data, not just visual inspection.
3.  **Refine Facts (YAML):** I will adjust the YAML description to accurately reflect the precedence of vertical propagation.
4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** I will rewrite the program to clearly state the precedence rule and the stopping condition for horizontal bottom row propagation.

**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Example 1:** Perfect match. The code correctly propagates the `6` (blue) down and the `4` (yellow) down and to the right.
*   **Example 2:** Perfect match. The `2` (red) propagates down, and the `8` (azure) and `7` (orange) propagate as expected.
*   **Example 3:** Incorrect. `pixels_off: 1`. The difference is at `[2,2]`. The expected output is `0` (white) at this, and `2` has propagated from the cell to the left. Vertical propagation has filled this, and the horizontal should not.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
objects:
  - description: Grid cells with non-zero values.
    properties:
      - value: Represents a color.
      - propagation_source: Can be a source for vertical or horizontal propagation.

actions:
  - name: Vertical Propagation
    description: Non-zero values propagate downwards within their column.
    precedence: Higher than horizontal propagation.
    stopping_condition: Propagation stops when a non-zero cell is encountered.
  - name: Horizontal Propagation (Bottom Row)
    description: Non-zero values on the bottom row propagate to the right.
    precedence: Lower than vertical propagation.
    stopping_condition: Propagation stops when a non-zero cell is encountered OR the cell has already been filled by vertical propagation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy:** Begin by creating a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Vertical Propagation:** Iterate through the grid columns from right to left, and within each column, iterate from top to bottom. If a cell has a non-zero value, propagate that value downwards within the same column. Stop the downward propagation if another non-zero value is encountered.
3. **Bottom Row Horizontal Propagation:** Iterate through the bottom row of the grid from left to right. If a cell contains non-zero value, check the cell to the right. Only propagate the value if the cell to the right has a value of `0`.
4.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.
