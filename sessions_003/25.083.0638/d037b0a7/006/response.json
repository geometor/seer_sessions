            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good start, capturing the basic idea of propagation. However, Example 3 reveals a flaw: the bottom-row propagation should *only* fill zeros that haven't already been filled by vertical propagation. My original logic propagated the rightmost non-zero cell on the bottom row all of the way across, unless another value existed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Example 3 Closely:** Understand precisely *why* the current logic fails in Example 3. The vertical propagation should take higher precedence and should stop if encountering another object.\n2.  **Metrics:** I'll use numpy code execution to re-confirm that vertical propagation and the number of errors in the training examples. This ensures my report is based on solid data, not just visual inspection.\n3.  **Refine Facts (YAML):** I will adjust the YAML description to accurately reflect the precedence of vertical propagation.\n4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** I will rewrite the program to clearly state the precedence rule and the stopping condition for horizontal bottom row propagation.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**\n\n"
