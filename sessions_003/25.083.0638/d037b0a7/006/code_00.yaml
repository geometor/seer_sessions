      - propagation_source: Can be a source for vertical or horizontal propagation.

actions:
  - name: Vertical Propagation
    description: Non-zero values propagate downwards within their column.

    stopping_condition: Propagation stops when a non-zero cell is encountered.
  - name: Horizontal Propagation (Bottom Row)
    description: Non-zero values on the bottom row propagate to the right.
    precedence: Lower than vertical propagation.
    stopping_condition: Propagation stops when a non-zero cell is encountered OR the cell has already been filled by vertical propagation.
