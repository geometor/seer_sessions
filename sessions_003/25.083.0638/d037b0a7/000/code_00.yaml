task_description:
  objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: 3x3 (all examples)
        - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  observations:
    - pattern: "Non-zero values on the right edge propagate downwards."
    - pattern: "Non-zero values on the bottom edge propagate rightwards."
    - pattern: "Propagation stops when it meets a non-zero cell"
    - relationship: "The non-zero color at the bottom right corner of the input appears to become a critical value"
  actions:
    - propagate: "Replicate a color value across adjacent cells."
