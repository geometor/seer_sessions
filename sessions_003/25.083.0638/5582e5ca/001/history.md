## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```


**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```


**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```


**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x3 grid. The output grid consists of a single color repeated across all cells. The key seems to be identifying which of the input colors becomes the uniform output color. There isn't an obvious visual pattern like mirroring, rotation, or object manipulation. It looks to be the right most digit in the top row of the input.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids of integers.
    dimensions: 3x3
    data_type: integer
  - type: transformation
    description: Output grid is a uniform color.
    mechanism: selection
    details: The color of the output grid is one of the colors present in the input grid. Specifically, the color is taken from the element at row 0, column 2 of the input.
  - type: objects
    description: Each grid cell is considered an object.
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer (0-9).
  - type: position
    description: the value in the top right corner of the input determines the color of the output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the target color:** Observe the input grid and find the color value located at the top right cell. The integers are zero indexed, so the index is row 0, column 2.
2.  **Create the output grid:** Create a new 3x3 grid.
3.  **Fill the output grid:** Fill every cell of the output grid with the target color identified in step 1.
