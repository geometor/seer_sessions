The output grid consists of a single color repeated across all cells. The key seems to be identifying which of the input colors becomes the uniform output color. There isn't an obvious visual pattern like mirroring, rotation, or object manipulation. It looks to be the right most digit in the top row of the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
