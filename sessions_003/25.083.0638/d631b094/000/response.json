Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 3x3 grid (input) into a smaller, variable-sized grid (output). The input grids seem to contain a single non-zero \"object\" (a contiguous block of pixels of a single color) surrounded by zeros (white pixels). The output grid seems to be composed of only the non-zero color from the input grid, and the size of the output seems to relate to the number of times the non-zero color appears in each *row* of input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
