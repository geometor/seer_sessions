Okay, I'm ready to analyze this task. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid (input) into a smaller, variable-sized grid (output). The input grids seem to contain a single non-zero "object" (a contiguous block of pixels of a single color) surrounded by zeros (white pixels). The output grid seems to be composed of only the non-zero color from the input grid, and the size of the output seems to relate to the number of times the non-zero color appears in each *row* of input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
observations:
  - task_type: object_extraction
  - input_grid_size: 3x3
  - output_grid_size: variable
  - input_objects:
    - train_1:
      - color: blue (1)

    - train_2:
      - color: red (2)
        shape: irregular
        count: 3
        positions:  [[0,1], [1,0], [2,1]]
    - train_3:
      - color: orange (7)
        shape: irregular
        count: 1
        positions:  [[0,1]]
    - train_4:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: irregular
        count: 4
        positions: [[0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [2,0]]
  - output_objects:
    - train_1:
        color: blue(1)
        shape: rectangle
        size: 1x2
    - train_2:
        color: red(2)
        shape: rectangle
        size: 1x3
    - train_3:
        color: orange(7)
        shape: rectangle
        size: 1x1
    - train_4:
        color: azure(8)
        shape: rectangle
        size: 1x4

  - relationships:
    - output_color: "same as the non-zero color in the input"
    - output_width: "number of instances of the non-zero color in the input"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-zero color:** Scan the input grid to find the single color value that is not zero.
2.  **Count non-zero color in each row:** For each row, determine how many instances of identified color exists.
3.  **Construct the output:** Create a new 1-dimensional array. Its color should be the same as the non-zero color that identified in the input, and the size equal to the number of instances of that color.
