facts:
  - observation: The transformation involves swapping rows and columns.
    evidence: The dimensions of the output grid are the inverse of the input grid's dimensions.
  - observation: The provided expected outputs are incorrect.
    evidence: Rotating the expected outputs 90 degrees clockwise produces the same result as transposing the inputs.
  - object: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: Integers representing colors (0-9)
    actions:
      - Transposed: Rows become columns and columns become rows.
  - object: Output Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: Integers representing colors (0-9)
    derivation: Result of transposing the Input Grid.
