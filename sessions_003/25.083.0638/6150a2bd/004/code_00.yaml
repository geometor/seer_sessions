facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid's dimensions are transposed in the output grid.
      Rows become columns, and columns become rows.
  - object_property: |
     The input grid contains colors represented by integers from 0-9
  - object_transformation_example_1: |
      Input grid: [[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
      Expected output: [[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]]
  - object_transformation_example_2: |
      Input grid: [[5, 5, 2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
      Expected output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 5, 5]]
  - action: |
      The initial transformation incorrectly reverses the columns after transposing.
  - error_analysis: |
      In both examples, 6 pixels are mismatched.
      The sizes are correctly transposed, and the color palettes are maintained.
      The number of pixels for each color are correct.
  - corrected_action:
    description: The input is correctly transposed, the error lies in the reversal of columns.
