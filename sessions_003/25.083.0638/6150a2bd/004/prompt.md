The transformation rule involves remapping pixels from the input grid to the output grid.
Specifically, the rows of the input grid become the columns of the output grid, but in reversed order.
The first row of the input becomes the last column of the output, the second row of the input becomes
the second-to-last column of the output, and so on.
Alternatively, the input grid is transposed and then the columns are reversed (or the rows are flipped after transposing).
