"""
The transformation rule involves remapping pixels from the input grid to the output grid.
Specifically, the rows of the input grid become the columns of the output grid, but in reversed order.
The first row of the input becomes the last column of the output, the second row of the input becomes
the second-to-last column of the output, and so on.
Alternatively, the input grid is transposed and then the columns are reversed (or the rows are flipped after transposing).

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for updating the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (transpose and reverse columns) is partially correct, as it captures the general idea of remapping rows to columns. However, the specific implementation of reversing the *columns* after transposition is incorrect. The errors in both examples show a consistent pattern of misplacement, suggesting an issue with the column/row reversal logic. The strategy should focus on correcting the reversal operation, possibly by reversing rows instead of columns, or adjusting the order of operations.

**Gather Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's verify the provided examples and analyze pixel mismatches using code execution.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_array = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_array = np.array(transformed_output)

    pixels_off = np.sum(expected_array != transformed_array)
    size_correct = input_array.shape == expected_array.shape[::-1] #check transpose
    color_palette_correct = np.all(np.isin(transformed_array, input_array))

    unique_expected, counts_expected = np.unique(expected_array, return_counts=True)
    unique_transformed, counts_transformed = np.unique(transformed_array, return_counts=True)

    correct_pixel_counts = True
    if set(unique_expected) == set(unique_transformed):
        for value in unique_expected:
            if counts_expected[np.where(unique_expected==value)] != counts_transformed[np.where(unique_transformed == value)]:
                correct_pixel_counts = False
                break
    else:
         correct_pixel_counts = False


    return {
        "pixels_off": int(pixels_off),

        "color_palette_correct": bool(color_palette_correct),
        "correct_pixel_counts": bool(correct_pixel_counts)
    }

# Example 1
input_grid1 = [[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
expected_output1 = [[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]]
transformed_output1 = [[5, 3, 3], [0, 7, 3], [0, 0, 8]]

# Example 2
input_grid2 = [[5, 5, 2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
expected_output2 = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 5, 5]]
transformed_output2 = [[0, 1, 5], [0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 2]]

results1 = analyze_example(input_grid1, expected_output1, transformed_output1)
results2 = analyze_example(input_grid2, expected_output2, transformed_output2)

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid's dimensions are transposed in the output grid.
      Rows become columns, and columns become rows.
  - object_property: |
     The input grid contains colors represented by integers from 0-9
  - object_transformation_example_1: |
      Input grid: [[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
      Expected output: [[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]]
  - object_transformation_example_2: |

      Expected output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 5, 5]]
  - action: |
      The initial transformation incorrectly reverses the columns after transposing.
  - error_analysis: |
      In both examples, 6 pixels are mismatched.
      The sizes are correctly transposed, and the color palettes are maintained.
      The number of pixels for each color are correct.
  - corrected_action:
    description: The input is correctly transposed, the error lies in the reversal of columns.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Transpose the input grid:** The rows of the input grid become the columns of the output grid, and vice-versa. This is a standard matrix transposition operation.
2.  **No Reversal:** Do *not* reverse the order of rows or columns after the transposition. The initially proposed column reversal is incorrect. The correct transformation is a simple transposition.
