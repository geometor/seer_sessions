Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color substitutions, but rather a rearrangement of the existing colors within the grid. It appears the grid is rotated, and that there are some objects in the grid defined by sequences of digits.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
