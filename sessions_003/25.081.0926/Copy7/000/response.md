Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Task Elements**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of integers, representing colors.
*   **Color Changes:** It appears that there are specific and possibly conditional color changes applied to the pixels.
*   **Spatial Relationships:** The position of the changed colors seems important. The changes often appear near the center of existing color blocks.
* **Objectness** - there are clearly identifiable objects as color blocks in both the input and output, and in both cases the objects persist
* **Goal-directedness** - there may be an intention to modify certain color blocks based on adjacent colors

**YAML Fact Block**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output are rectangular grids of integers (colors).
  - observation: The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical.
  - object_type: color_block
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - shape: contiguous block of same-color pixels
      - position: row and column indices
    actions:
      - change_color: Some pixels within color blocks change color.
    relationships:
      - adjacent_to: Color changes occur adjacent to specific colors.
  - observation: "train_1 shows orange pixels adjacent to where the green color is added"
  - observation: "train_2 shows blue pixels adjacent to where the blue color is added"
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate:** Go through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Target:** Find pixels with value not equal to black (0).
3.  **Check Neighbors:** For the next pixel, to the right:
    * If the pixel to the right is black (0),
      * And if to the right of that black pixel there is an orange pixel (7) and the target pixel is green (3), change the black pixel (0) adjacent to green to green (3).
      * And if to the right of that black pixel there is a blue pixel (1) and the target pixel is blue (2), change the black pixel (0) adjacent to blue to blue (1).

In other words, certain color blocks are inserting themselves into available adjacent black spaces, but only when certain other conditions are met.
