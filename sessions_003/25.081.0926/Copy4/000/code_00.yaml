facts:
  - observation: Input and output are grids of different sizes.
  - observation: Grid cells contain integer values that represent distinct colors.
  - object_type: Single-color objects are contiguous blocks of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9).
      - shape: Can be any shape formed by adjacent cells.
      - size: Number of cells in the block.
    actions:
      - replicated: objects from the input appear to be copied into the output, potentially multiple times.
  - object_type: Multi-color objects are contiguous blocks of different colors.
    properties:
      - colors: Contains a mix of integer values
      - size: The number of cells
    actions:
      - modified: copied from the input to output with changes in shape or structure
  - relationship: The output grid appears to be a modified or expanded version of the input grid.
  - action: Some single color objects have extra copies in specific positions
  - action: Some single cell objects are replicated in the output to be multi-cell objects
