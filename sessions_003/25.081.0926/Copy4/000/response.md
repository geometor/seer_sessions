Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of varying dimensions.
*   **Colors:** Cells within the grids have integer values representing different colors.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects. There are single-color and multi-color objects
*   **Background:** The color `0` (white) seems to act as a background, as it's the most prevalent and doesn't seem to be directly involved in the core transformation.
*   **Change Detection:** The core task seems to be to apply object-based modifications/copying/moving

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output are grids of different sizes.
  - observation: Grid cells contain integer values that represent distinct colors.
  - object_type: Single-color objects are contiguous blocks of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9).
      - shape: Can be any shape formed by adjacent cells.
      - size: Number of cells in the block.
    actions:
      - replicated: objects from the input appear to be copied into the output, potentially multiple times.
  - object_type: Multi-color objects are contiguous blocks of different colors.
    properties:
      - colors: Contains a mix of integer values
      - size: The number of cells
    actions:
      - modified: copied from the input to output with changes in shape or structure
  - relationship: The output grid appears to be a modified or expanded version of the input grid.
  - action: Some single color objects have extra copies in specific positions
  - action: Some single cell objects are replicated in the output to be multi-cell objects
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each single-color object within the input grid.
2.  Identify any single-color objects.
3.  **Replicate** those objects in the output grid at the same location.
4.  For each of these single-color objects, **check** for instances of single-color objects directly below or to the side that have the same size as the original object.
5. For any extra instances of that object that are found at the bottom or on any sides, create copies in the output.
6. Check for a single cell objects.
7. If this is the only object that have these cell, extend the object in the output.
