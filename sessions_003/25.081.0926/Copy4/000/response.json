Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of varying dimensions.\n*   **Colors:** Cells within the grids have integer values representing different colors.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects. There are single-color and multi-color objects\n*   **Background:** The color `0` (white) seems to act as a background, as it's the most prevalent and doesn't seem to be directly involved in the core transformation.\n*   **Change Detection:** The core task seems to be to apply object-based modifications/copying/moving\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
