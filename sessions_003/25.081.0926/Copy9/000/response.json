The transformation seems to involve shifting or mirroring existing objects/shapes within the grid, and sometimes combining this with an insertion or a replication of sub-shapes, possibly triggered by the position or color of existing components. There's a clear emphasis on preserving certain object attributes, like color and general shape, after moving them. The positioning of these shifted components often relates to the original objects.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
