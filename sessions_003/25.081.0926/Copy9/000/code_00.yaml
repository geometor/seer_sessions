facts:
  - observation: "Grids are 2D arrays of integers (0-9)."
  - observation: "Each integer represents a color."
  - observation: "Objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color."
  - observation: "Transformations involve moving existing objects within the grid."
  - observation: "The transformations preserve object color and shape (to an extent)."
  - observation: "Object displacement is relative to some reference."
  - observation_t1: "A blue 3x3 square moves and gets mirrored on the X axis"
  - observation_t2: "A red object on the left edge is detected and replicated to include the green 'L' shape."
  - observation_t2: "The green object's orientation matters."
  - observation_t3: "A magenta object at the bottom mirrors to the top."
  - observation_t3: "An azure object is replicated to a position relative to the magenta object"
