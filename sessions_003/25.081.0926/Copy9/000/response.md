Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve shifting or mirroring existing objects/shapes within the grid, and sometimes combining this with an insertion or a replication of sub-shapes, possibly triggered by the position or color of existing components. There's a clear emphasis on preserving certain object attributes, like color and general shape, after moving them. The positioning of these shifted components often relates to the original objects.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Grids are 2D arrays of integers (0-9)."
  - observation: "Each integer represents a color."
  - observation: "Objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color."
  - observation: "Transformations involve moving existing objects within the grid."
  - observation: "The transformations preserve object color and shape (to an extent)."
  - observation: "Object displacement is relative to some reference."
  - observation_t1: "A blue 3x3 square moves and gets mirrored on the X axis"
  - observation_t2: "A red object on the left edge is detected and replicated to include the green 'L' shape."
  - observation_t2: "The green object's orientation matters."
  - observation_t3: "A magenta object at the bottom mirrors to the top."
  - observation_t3: "An azure object is replicated to a position relative to the magenta object"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. Each block is an object, characterized by its color, shape, and position.

2.  **Find object to mirror:** Search an object at the left edge of the image (column index 0) or on the bottom edge.

3.  **Mirror the object:** reflect the identified object's position vertically.

4. **Find second object**: search for second object
5. **Replicate the second object**: Find second object at the border adjacent to the first one and replicate it mirroring the first one
