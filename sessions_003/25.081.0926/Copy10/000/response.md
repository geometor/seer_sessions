Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pairs, focusing on perception, object properties, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids with single-digit integer values representing different colors. The primary objects appear to be contiguous blocks of the same color. There's a clear transformation happening, where some input elements are either changing position, or are duplicated. There is repetition after the transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_block
    color: 3 (green)
    shape: variable  # Initial shape is a line, final is like a thick line with repetition
    properties:
      - movable: true
      - repeatable: true

  - name: red_block
    color: 2 (red)
    shape: variable # Initial shape is a rectangle, final is thick line with repetition
    properties:
      - movable: true
      - repeatable: true

  - name: yellow_block
    color: 4 (yellow)
    shape: variable # Initial shape a cross, final appears as a duplicated and expanded cross.
    properties:
      - movable: true
      - repeatable: true

  - name: blue_block
    color: 1 (blue)
    shape: variable  # Initial shape is 'L' shaped, and a straight line.  Final shape is repetition of initial shape.
    properties:
        - movable: true
        - repeatable: true

  - name: background
    color: 0 (white)
    shape: grid
    properties:
      - static: true

actions:
  - name: repeat
    description: Duplicates an object horizontally, creates mirrored copy
    affects: [green_block, red_block, blue_block, yellow_block]

relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      description: Objects are adjacent. Repetition and duplication seem to happen along adjacency.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-white (non-zero) pixels.  These are our primary objects.
2.  **Vertical Mirror:** Imagine, or establish a horizontal line going through the center of the input grid.
3. **Object Duplication (below the center line):**
     *   Iterate through objects found *above* the center line:
         * Check where the object exists on and above the center line.
         * Create an exact copy of the object *below* the center line.
4. **Output Result:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid. Add the duplicated objects to the grid.

In summary, the core transformation is a vertical mirroring/duplication of colored objects, where the duplication occurrs from the upper half of the grid to the lower half, with the middle line serving as a mirror for location.
