"""
1. Identify Objects: Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (objects) in the input grid. Each block of the same color is a separate object, even if they are not contiguous.
2. Calculate Centroids: For each identified object, calculate its vertical centroid (average row value).
3. Vertical Mirroring (Per Object): For each object, mirror it vertically with respect to its centroid. This means, for each pixel in the original object at row `r` and column `c`, a corresponding pixel of the same color is placed at row `r'` and column `c`, where `r'` is calculated as `2 * centroid_row - r`, and `centroid_row` is the integer part of the object centroid row. Overwrite pixels in existing locations.
4. Output: Return the grid with all objects vertically mirrored around their centroid.
