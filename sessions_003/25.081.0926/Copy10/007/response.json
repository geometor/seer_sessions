Each block of the same color is a separate object, even if they are not contiguous.\n2. Calculate Centroids: For each identified object, calculate its vertical centroid (average row value).\n3. Vertical Mirroring (Per Object): For each object, mirror it vertically with respect to its centroid. This means, for each pixel in the original object at row `r` and column `c`, a corresponding pixel of the same color is placed at row `r'` and column `c`, where `r'` is calculated as `2 * centroid_row - r`, and `centroid_row` is the integer part of the object centroid row. Overwrite pixels in existing locations.\n4. Output: Return the grid with all objects vertically mirrored around their centroid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels as objects.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, color, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], current_object)\n                objects.append((grid[r, c], current_object))  # Store color and object pixels\n    return objects\n\ndef calculate_centroid(object_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the centroid of an object.\"\"\"\n    sum_r = sum(r for r, _ in object_pixels)\n    sum_c = sum(c for _, c in object_pixels)\n    centroid_row = sum_r / len(object_pixels)\n    return centroid_row\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Find objects\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Mirror each object vertically around its centroid\n    for color, obj_pixels in objects:\n        centroid_row = calculate_centroid(obj_pixels)\n        for r, c in obj_pixels:\n            # Calculate mirrored row position\n            mirror_r = int(2 * centroid_row - r)\n\n            # Check bounds and set pixel\n            if 0 <= mirror_r < rows:\n                output_grid[mirror_r, c] = color\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
