Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of either inserting a row of zeros or a column of zeros, depending on whether a zero-row already existed. The results clearly show this is incorrect.
- Example 1 failed because it inserted a column of zeros between two copies of the input *horizontally*, when the correct result should have added a row of zeros between two copies of the input *vertically*. The logic reversed.
- Example 2 failed because it chose row insertion when a zero row exists, but applied it incorrectly. The correct solution should have inserted *column* between two copies of the image horizontally.

The strategy is:

1.  Re-examine the examples to correct the core logic.
2.  Gather more detailed metrics beyond basic matching to pinpoint the errors.
3.  Update the YAML and natural language program to reflect the correct logic, which seems to be related to horizontal stacking with conditional zero-column insertion.

**Gathering Metrics and Further Analysis:**

For this, I don't need to do additional code execution as I can get this directly from the human readable input/output/results.
- input_1: (3, 11), output_1: (7,11)
- input_2: (9, 4), output_2: (9,9)

Here are some key metrics and analysis of the first two examples:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Size:** 3x11
*   **Output Size:** 7x11
*   **Match:** False
*   **Observation:** The output is the *vertical* stacking of the input with an added row of zeros. There are no zero rows in the input. The code incorrectly stacked horizontally and inserted a zero *column*.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Size:** 9x4
*   **Output Size:** 9x9
*   **Match:** False
*  **Observation:** The output should be the *horizontal* stacking of the input and an insertion of a column of zeros. There are rows of zeros, multiple in fact.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    shape: [3, 11]
    objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          has_zero_row: false
          has_zero_col: true
  output:
    shape: [7, 11]
    objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
         derived_from: "vertical stacking of input with inserted zero row"

example_2:
  input:
    shape: [9, 4]
    objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          has_zero_row: true
          has_zero_col: false
  output:
    shape: [9, 9]
    objects:
      - type: grid
         properties:
            derived_from: "horizontal stacking of input with inserted zero column"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine Input:** Determine the dimensions of the input grid and check for the presence of all-zero rows.
2.  **Conditional Stacking and Zero Insertion:**
    *   **If the input grid contains any all-zero rows:** Duplicate the input grid *horizontally*. Insert a column of zeros between the two copies of the input.
    *   **If the input grid does NOT contain any all-zero rows:** Duplicate the input grid *vertically*. Stack two copies of the input. Add one row of zeros between the two copies of the input.
