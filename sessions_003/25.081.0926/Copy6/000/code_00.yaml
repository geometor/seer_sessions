facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids consist of single-digit integers, where the input gets repeated twice.
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: variable
      - columns: variable
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: greater than input_grid
      - columns: greater than input_grid, or the same as input_grid
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - transformation:
      type: duplication and insertion
      details: |
        The input grid is duplicated.
        In train_1, the output is constructed by stacking 2 input grids and a row is added.
        In train_2, the output has a new column of zeros inserted between two duplicates of input grid that have been placed side-by-side.
  - object: zero_row
    type: 1D array
    properties:
      - length: equal to the number of columns of the input grid
      - values: all zeros
