Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for resolving the errors in the transformation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were too simplistic. The core idea of identifying "objects" (contiguous non-zero pixels) is correct, but the column duplication and shifting logic is flawed and doesn't generalize to all cases. The code duplicates the last two columns of *each object* and shifts them one column to the right *within the bounds of that object*.  This works only in very specific circumstances (like the objects in the examples not overlapping in their x-coordinates). The expected outputs in Examples 1 and 2 clearly show this logic is incorrect. It appears that shifting/copying to the right is not constrained by object boundaries. It copies over anything, including zeros. The transformation must preserve the original grid's structure where possible.

**Strategy:**

1. **Verify Object Identification:** Ensure the `get_objects` function correctly identifies all contiguous non-zero regions as separate objects. This seems to work as designed so far.
2. **Re-examine Transformation Logic:** The column duplication logic is incorrect. Analyze the examples to discern the *precise* rule for how columns are duplicated and shifted. It's likely a grid-wide operation, not an object-specific one.
3. **Consider Edge Cases:** Pay attention to what happens at the edges of the grid and when objects are adjacent.
4. **Iterative Refinement:**  Use the feedback from each example to progressively refine the natural language program and the code.

**Metrics and Observations (Example 1):**

- **Input:** A grid with two distinct objects (red and blue).
- **Expected Output:** The last two columns of the *entire grid where there are objects* are duplicated and shifted to the right. The red block becomes bigger to the right.
- **Transformed Output:** Only the last two columns *within each object* are duplicated and shifted, leading to an incorrect result.
- **Mismatch:** The transformed output fails to correctly duplicate and shift the columns to the right, especially at the object boundaries.

**Metrics and Observations (Example 2):**

- **Input:** A grid with multiple objects of yellow and a smaller green object.
- **Expected Output:** The last two columns of the grid are duplicated for regions that have colors. The green block is also duplicated, but now shifted to the right by one.
- **Transformed Output:** Again, the duplication and shifting are confined within each object, resulting in significant errors.
- **Mismatch:** The transformed output does a very poor job of copying to the right.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
example_1:
  objects:
    - color: 2  # Red
      shape: Roughly rectangular
      action: Rightmost two columns containing the object are duplicated and shifted one position to the right.
    - color: 1  # Blue
      shape: Roughly rectangular
      action: Rightmost two columns containing the object are duplicated and shifted one position to the right.
  grid_action: last two columns copied and inserted

example_2:
  objects:
    - color: 4  # Yellow
      shape: Irregular, forms two separate regions.
      action: Rightmost two columns of the region where there are colors are duplicated and shift one position to right.
    - color: 3  # Green
      shape: single cell, forms a line after shift.
      action:  Rightmost two columns of the region where there are colors are duplicated and shift one position to right.
  grid_action: last two columns copied and inserted
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous regions of non-zero pixels (objects) in the input grid.
2.  Identify the last two columns of the *entire input grid* that have any non-zero pixels.
3.  Duplicate these last two columns.
4.  Insert these duplicated columns immediately to the *right* of their original positions in the grid, shifting any existing pixels in those columns and beyond to the right.
5.  If the inserted columns exceed the initial grid boundaries, extend the grid boundary.

Essentially, take the last two columns that have colours, duplicate them, shift everything including and to the right of those columns one position to the right, and fill the gap with the copy.
