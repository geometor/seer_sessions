Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a limited understanding of the transformation, derived from only the first training example. The subsequent tests on the second example revealed significant discrepancies. The core issue is that the initial program incorrectly assumed that *only* the last two columns of *each object* should be duplicated and shifted. The second example demonstrates a more complex rule: It appears that the program attempts to copy pixels to the right of the last two columns, and when there are isolated pixels or columns, it's unclear how to duplicate and shift them. The objects are defined as contiguous block of non-zero pixels, but that may also require more scrutiny.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Object Definition:** Carefully analyze how objects are identified in both examples, particularly focusing on isolated pixels and single-column objects.
2.  **Clarify Duplication Rule:** Determine the precise logic behind duplicating and shifting. Consider cases where objects have fewer than two columns or when adjacent columns have different heights. Does it only look at the last two columns of the *entire grid*, rather than within each object?
3.  **Analyze Example 2 in Detail:** Break down Example 2 step-by-step to understand how the transformation applies to different parts of the input grid.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Update the natural language program and code based on the improved understanding. Test against both examples and iterate.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of non-zero (colored) pixels. These are considered objects. Contiguous means connected horizontally or vertically.
2.  **Examine the Input:** Examine color 3 in the input.
3. **Transformation Rule**
    - In the second example, we notice that for every column containing an isolated pixel of color 3 (where "isolated" means the pixel above and below is color 0) the single pixel is duplicated at the right of the right-most contiguous block of color 4.

The current hypothesis is that single isolated pixels of any color are treated differently than solid color blocks. Isolated pixels are duplicated to the right of a region.
