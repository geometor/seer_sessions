Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves 1-dimensional grids (essentially arrays or lists) where each cell contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color. The transformation seems to focus on replacing certain colored pixels with black (0) pixels, effectively "erasing" parts of the original input. The core challenge is to discern the rule that dictates which pixels are erased and which are preserved. The position of the non-zero color seems important.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 1-dimensional and of the same length.
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain a sequence of one color value, bordered on either side by zeros.
  - observation: |
      The output grids preserve the central sequence of non-zero color values.
  - observation: |
      The output has leading and trailing zero values.
  - observation: |
      The transformation appears to remove single isolated colored values, and replace by zeroes, on the edges.
  - property: |
      Color of the central sequence is variable (blue=1 in examples 1 and 2, green=3 in example 3).
  - property: |
      Length of the central color segment is variable.
  - property: |
     Number of leading and trailing zeros can vary.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core:** Find the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels in the input grid. This is the "core" segment.
2.  **Preserve the Core:** Copy the "core" segment of non-zero pixels to the output grid, maintaining their original positions relative to each other.
3.  **Fill with Zeroes:** Fill all other positions in the output grid (those before and after the core segment) with zeros (black pixels).

In simpler terms, the rule is to keep the largest "block" of the same non-zero color and replace everything else with zeros. It's like finding the largest "island" of a single color and setting the "sea" (all surrounding pixels) to black (0).
