Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves 1x32 grids (single-row matrices). The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are 0 (white), 4 (yellow), and 2 (red).  The transformation seems to involve removing isolated color pixels that are surrounded by white pixels.  A key characteristic appears to be the preservation of contiguous blocks of the same non-white color.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids are 1x32."
  - observation: "Pixels are represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to colors."
  - observation: "Predominant colors are 0 (white), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow)."
  - object_type: "Pixel"
    properties:
      - color: "Integer value (0-9)"
    states:
      - isolated: "Surrounded by pixels of a different color."
      - contiguous: "Adjacent to at least one pixel of the same color."
  - action: "Removal"
    condition: "Isolated non-white pixels."
    result: "Pixel color changes to 0 (white)."
  - action: "Preservation"
    condition: "Non-white pixels forming a contiguous block."
    result: "Pixels retain their original color."
  - relationship: "adjacency"
    description: "determines if a non-white pixel is isolated or connected"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  For each pixel, check if it is a non-white color (not 0).
3.  If the pixel is non-white, check its adjacent pixels (left and right neighbors).
4.  If both adjacent pixels are white (0) or do not exist (edge cases), the current pixel is considered "isolated".
5.  Change the color of isolated non-white pixels to white (0).
6. If a non-white pixel has one or two adjacent pixels that are the same non-white color it is part of a contiguous block, preserve the pixel's original color.
7.  Output the resulting grid.
