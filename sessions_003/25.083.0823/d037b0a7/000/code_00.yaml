facts:
  - observation: Grids are 3x3 in all examples.
  - observation: Grid cells contain single-digit integers representing colors.
  - observation: The transformation maintains the grid dimensions.
  - observation: The color distribution changes between input and output.
  - observation: "0" (white) is unchanged in the output.
  - object: Each non-zero colored cell of Input grid is a *source*
  - property: The top right corner cell in the example, `input[0][-1]`
  - action: A *source* cell duplicates its color down.
  - action: The *source* value replaces the other cell values.
  - action: There is vertical propagation of color downwards from the top right cell.
  - relation: Non-zero values on last column propagate to empty regions.
  - relation: If there is any non-zero colors in that vertical propagation they become *sources*.
