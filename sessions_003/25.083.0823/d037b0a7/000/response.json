Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   There's a clear pattern of changes happening, suggesting a rule-based transformation.\n*   The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x3 in all examples).\n* The examples show different colors in various configurations.\n*   Specific colors seem to propagate or influence other cells.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
