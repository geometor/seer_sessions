## train_1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
0 2 0
7 0 8
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 2 0
7 2 8
7 2 8
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
4 0 0

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   There's a clear pattern of changes happening, suggesting a rule-based transformation.
*   The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x3 in all examples).
* The examples show different colors in various configurations.
*   Specific colors seem to propagate or influence other cells.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Grids are 3x3 in all examples.
  - observation: Grid cells contain single-digit integers representing colors.
  - observation: The transformation maintains the grid dimensions.
  - observation: The color distribution changes between input and output.
  - observation: "0" (white) is unchanged in the output.
  - object: Each non-zero colored cell of Input grid is a *source*
  - property: The top right corner cell in the example, `input[0][-1]`
  - action: A *source* cell duplicates its color down.
  - action: The *source* value replaces the other cell values.
  - action: There is vertical propagation of color downwards from the top right cell.
  - relation: Non-zero values on last column propagate to empty regions.
  - relation: If there is any non-zero colors in that vertical propagation they become *sources*.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Source:** Find the color of the cell in the top right corner of the input grid (`input[0][-1]`).
2.  **Vertical Propagation:** Iterate through each row of the grid, starting from the top (row 0).
3.  **Replacement:** The *source* replaces cell values.
4.  **Zero Handling:** Any original 0 values in the input grid will not be changed.
5.  **Other Source handling:** If any other *source* colors are encountered along a column, duplicate them down.

Essentially, the color of the top-right cell propagates downwards, filling the entire column below it. Other non-zero colors encountered during propagation are also extended downwards. White (0) cells remain unchanged.
