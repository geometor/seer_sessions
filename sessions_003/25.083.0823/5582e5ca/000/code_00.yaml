  The task is to transform a 3x3 input grid of digits (colors) into a 3x3 output grid where all cells have the same color.
observations:
  - input_grid:
      type: 3x3 grid
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - output_grid:
      type: 3x3 grid
      elements: single-digit integer (0-9), all identical
  - transformation:
      type: select_and_replicate
      description: A single color value from input is selected and replicated across the output grid.
      selection_criteria: ? # This needs to be determined - it is not an obvious rule
facts:
  - example_1:
    - input: [[4, 4, 8], [6, 4, 3], [6, 3, 0]]
    - output: [[4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4]]
    - selected_color: 4
  - example_2:
    - input: [[6, 8, 9], [1, 8, 1], [9, 4, 9]]
    - output: [[9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]
    - selected_color: 9
  - example_3:
    - input: [[4, 6, 9], [6, 4, 1], [8, 8, 6]]
    - output: [[6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6]]
    - selected_color: 6
