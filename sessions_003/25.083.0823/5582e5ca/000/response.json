The output grid consists of a single color repeated across all cells. The key seems to be identifying a specific color within the input grid that becomes the uniform color of the output grid. It's not immediately obvious which input value gives the answer - not min, max, or average. It looks like its one of the values in the input, and the task to select which one.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
