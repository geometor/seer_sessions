The input grids are 3x3, and the output grids vary in size but only contain one non-zero color, and that color is present on the input. The transformation seems to involve identifying the non-zero color in the input and creating a new grid filled with only that color. The output grid dimensions may or may not relate to the arrangement of the non-zero in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
