The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both are 3x3 in the first example and 3x2/2x3 in the second). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic operations on the cell values. Instead, it looks like a rearrangement or mirroring of the grid's rows and columns, potentially with a rotation. The order of rows and columns seems to change, and the positions of individual elements are altered in a systematic way.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This means the element at `input[row][col]` will move to `output[col][row]`.\n\n2. **Rotate the transposed grid:** Rotate by 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n\nLet's break it down for better clarity and to avoid using language specific terms.\n\n1. **Flip the input grid:** Swap rows and columns. Row 0 becomes Column 0, Row 1 becomes Column 1, and so on.\n\n2. **Reverse the new rows:** The order of values on the new rows should be the reverse of the order of the values on the original columns.\n"
