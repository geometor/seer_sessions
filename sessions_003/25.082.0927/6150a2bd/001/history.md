## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, aiming to discern the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of digits (representing colors).
*   **Values:** Digits 0-9 are present, each corresponding to a specific color.
*   **Shapes:** Implicit shapes formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. There are no explicit shape definitions.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve rearranging and/or mirroring the input grid to produce the output grid. The dimensions of input/output are maintained.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output are 2D grids.
  - observation: Grid dimensions are preserved during transformation.
  - observation: Digits represent colors.
  - observation: Contiguous pixels of the same color form implicit objects.
  - action: The input grid's values and their relative positions are mirrored and inverted.
  - relationship: Input[i, j] maps to Output[height - 1 - i, width - 1 - j] where height and width are the dimensions of the grid, and i, j are the row and column indices, respectively.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Mirror and Invert:** The transformation mirrors the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This can also be considered as inverting or reversing the row and column orders from the input to generate the output.
2.  Preserve Colors: preserve the original color values in their new locations in the output.

In essence, the transformation takes each element at position (i, j) in the input grid and places it at position (height - 1 - i, width - 1 - j) in the output grid, where 'height' is the number of rows and 'width' is the number of columns in the grid. This effectively rotates the grid 180 degrees, or inverts rows and columns.
