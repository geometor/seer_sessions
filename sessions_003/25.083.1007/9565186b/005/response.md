1. Identify Boundaries: Pixels of color 4 (yellow) act as boundaries or a frame. They remain unchanged.
2. Enclosed Transformation: Any pixel of color 1, 2, 3, or 8 that is *completely enclosed* by color 4 (yellow) is transformed to color 5 (gray). "Completely enclosed" means that if you were to "flood fill" outwards from the non-yellow pixel, you would *only* encounter other non-yellow pixels or the edge of the image until hitting a yellow pixel in *every* direction.
