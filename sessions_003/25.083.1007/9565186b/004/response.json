The core idea of identifying the \"largest object\" made of colors 1, 2, 3, and 8 and turning it gray (5) is partially correct, but the precise conditions under which this transformation occurs need refinement. The current code fails when smaller object should have also transformed, for example in the third pair.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Examine all examples**: We will carefully analyze each input-output pair in the training set, not just the first.\n2.  **Refine Object Definition**: We will investigate how the objects are related.\n3.  **Conditional Transformation**: Investigate if the yellow pixels are boundaries.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification):**\n\n"
