These pixels form potential boundaries.\n2.  **Closed Loop Check:** Determine if the yellow pixels form one or more *closed, contiguous loops*. A closed loop means that if you trace along adjacent yellow pixels, you return to your starting point without lifting your \"finger\" and without crossing any non-yellow pixels. The yellow loop must be complete and unbroken.\n3.  **Interior Transformation:** Identify regions of connected pixels of color 1, 2, 3, or 8 that are *completely contained* within a closed loop of yellow pixels. \"Completely contained\" means that the region is entirely inside the yellow loop, and there's no path from any pixel in the region to the edge of the grid without crossing a yellow pixel.\n4.  **Change Color:** Change the color of all pixels within these completely contained regions to color 5 (gray).\n5. **Preserve Boundaries**: The yellow pixels (color 4) themselves do *not* change.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\ndef find_yellow_loops(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds closed loops of yellow (color 4) pixels in the grid.\n    Returns a mask where loop pixels are True, and others are False.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    yellow_pixels = (grid == 4)\n    labeled_array, num_features = label(yellow_pixels)\n\n    loop_mask = np.zeros_like(yellow_pixels, dtype=bool)\n\n    for feature_label in range(1, num_features + 1):  # Iterate through each labeled region\n        feature_pixels = (labeled_array == feature_label)\n        # Create a padded array to check for boundary conditions\n        padded_feature = np.pad(feature_pixels, pad_width=1, mode='constant', constant_values=0)\n\n        # Find coordinates of the feature pixels in the padded array\n        coords = np.argwhere(padded_feature)\n        min_row, min_col = np.min(coords, axis=0)\n        max_row, max_col = np.max(coords, axis=0)\n\n        # Check if the feature touches the edge of the padded array\n        if not (min_row == 0 or min_col == 0 or max_row == padded_feature.shape[0] - 1 or max_col == padded_feature.shape[1] - 1):\n            loop_mask[feature_pixels] = True # Closed loop\n    return loop_mask\n\ndef is_completely_contained(grid, region_mask, yellow_loop_mask):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a region is completely contained within a yellow loop.\"\"\"\n    # Expand the region mask slightly to check for adjacency to yellow pixels.\n    expanded_region = np.copy(region_mask)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r, c in np.argwhere(region_mask):\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                expanded_region[nr, nc] = True\n\n    # Check if the expanded region intersects with the yellow loop.\n    # If it *doesn't* intersect, it means it is completely inside the loop.\n    return not np.any(expanded_region & ~yellow_loop_mask & (grid != 4) )\n\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Find yellow loops\n    yellow_loop_mask = find_yellow_loops(input_grid)\n\n    # Identify regions to transform\n    for color in [1, 2, 3, 8]:\n        color_regions = (input_grid == color)\n        labeled_regions, num_regions = label(color_regions)\n\n        for region_label in range(1, num_regions + 1):\n            region_mask = (labeled_regions == region_label)\n\n            # Check if the region is completely contained within a yellow loop\n            if is_completely_contained(input_grid, region_mask, yellow_loop_mask):\n                #change color\n                output_grid[region_mask] = 5\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
