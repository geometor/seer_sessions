It assumes the provided `output_grid` in the `transform` function's arguments is the intended output for the corresponding input. However, the testing framework seems to pass *a different* output grid each time. This means that during testing, `transform` does not have access to the correct dimensions. The `transform` function *must* be self-contained; It should only transform a *single* input grid, and it should deduce the target dimensions based solely on the input examples available.\n\nThe strategy, therefore, is to modify the natural language program and the code to identify the target dimensions based on analyzing all the input/output examples _before_ processing, and those dimensions will be hard coded into the `transform` function.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nI need to determine the output dimensions for each training example. Since I can't directly execute code here, I'll manually inspect each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input is 4x8, Output is 4x4.\n*   **Example 2:** Input is 3x6, Output is 3x3.\n*   **Example 3:** Input is 6x2, Output is 3x2.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
