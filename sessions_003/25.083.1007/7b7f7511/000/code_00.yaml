  The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid by vertical truncation.
observations:
  - type: object
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - variable height
      - variable width
  - type: object
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - height is a subset of the input grid height
      - width is the same as input grid width
  - type: action
    description: Truncation
    properties:
      - vertical
      - retains the top portion of the input grid
      - output grid height seems related to the smallest height seen in the train examples.
relationships:
  - output grid is a vertically truncated version of the input grid.
  - The width remains constant.
