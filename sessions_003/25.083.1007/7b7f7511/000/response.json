Here's my breakdown of the provided input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The input grids seem to be transformed into output grids that are vertically truncated versions of the input. The number of rows appears to be the defining factor in the transformation. It seems that the output grids retain the upper part of the input grids. There isn't any change concerning color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
