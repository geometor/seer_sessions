## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two horizontal lines of single-digit numbers in the input, which are then transformed into two lines of alternating digits in the output. The digits in the input lines seem to be directly used in the output, but their arrangement changes. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (2 rows and 6 columns). The core operation appears to be an interleaving of the digits from the two input rows.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: row
    properties:
      - id: row1
        values: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]  # Example 1
        color: green #based on the color map
      - id: row2
        values: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]  # Example 1
        color: maroon #based on the color map
      - id: row1
        values: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] #Example 2
        color: yellow
      - id: row2
        values: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] #Example 2
        color: azure
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - id: input_grid
        dimensions: [2, 6]
      - id: output_grid
        dimensions: [2, 6]

actions:
  - type: interleave
    input: [row1, row2]
    output: [output_row1, output_row2]

relationships:
  - type: element-wise correspondence
    description: Each element in the output rows corresponds to an element in the input rows, but the positions are rearranged.
  - type: alternating pattern
    description: Output rows are formed by alternating elements from the two input rows.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input Rows:** The input consists of two rows of equal length, each containing a series of identical digits.

2.  **Interleave Digits:** Create two new rows for the output.
    *   The first output row is created by alternating digits from the first input row and the second input row, starting with the first input row.
    *   The second output row is created by alternating digits from the second input row and the first input row, starting with the second input row.

3. **Form Output grid:** arrange the new rows to form a new grid the same dimensions as the input grid.
