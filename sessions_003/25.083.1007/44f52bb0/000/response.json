The grids contain only two colors: black (0) and red (2). The output seems to relate to the *number* of red (2) pixels present, their configuration, and potentially their surrounding context (black pixels). The outputs provided, '1' and '7', appear a bit arbitrary without additional structure in the input grids. There seems to be some complex rule beyond simple counting since there is one example with one red pixel and output `7` and another with six and also output `7`. I will see if i can get the number of red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
