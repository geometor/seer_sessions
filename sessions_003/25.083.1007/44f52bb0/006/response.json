The tests reveal inconsistencies. Examples 2, 3 and 4 are misclassified. It's clear the shape definitions are either too restrictive or incorrectly implemented. The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Re-examining Shape Definitions:** We need to carefully redefine what constitutes each shape (cross, square ring, L-shape, line segment). The current definitions have clear errors.\n2.  **Addressing Edge Cases:** Consider cases at the edges of the 3x3 grid.\n3.  **Counting Red Pixels**: The number of red pixels seems to be very important. Use that in the classification process.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nTo better understand the errors, let's analyze the red pixel counts and positions in each example using code execution.\n\n"
