The core issue is that the shape definitions are too restrictive and don't cover all variations within the intended categories. The code also includes a default output of 0 which is incorrect. The expected outputs are always either 1 or 7. The strategy will involve broadening the shape definitions and correcting the default value issue. Specifically: a simpler more robust definition of `is_square_ring` and `is_l_shape` are needed, and potentially removing the default value to ensure the program returns only 1 or 7.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution for verification):**\n\n"

If this holds, then the result is 7.\n    *   If the count is 5, and the red pixels form a \"cross\" shape (a central red pixel surrounded by four other red pixels), the output is 1.\n    *   If the count is 6, and they form an incomplete 3x3 square (missing the center and two opposite corners pixels on the diagonal), the output is 1.\n\nEssentially, the rule distinguishes between several shapes based on the number of red pixels. 2 pixels forming a line results in `1`. 3 pixels in \"L\" shape or 4 pixels making a larger L shape outputs `7`. 5 Pixels arranged in cross shape results in `1`. 6 Pixels forming an incomplete square also result in `1`.\n"
