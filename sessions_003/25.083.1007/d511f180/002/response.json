            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and it doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core idea of replacing gray (5) pixels with azure (8) pixels based on neighbors is correct, but the logic needs adjustments. The two-pass approach (checking for fully surrounded pixels first, then any neighbor) is not the correct interpretation of the transformation rule. The order of operations and neighbor checking is incorrect.\n\nThe key to improving performance is to correctly identify when a gray pixel should be replaced with an azure pixel. By comparing inputs, expected outputs and the incorrect transformation, there is not a consistent rule that can be deduced about checking fully surrounded and then adjacent pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, including specific metrics:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Notes: The transform missed several gray pixels that should have been azure, and wrongly replaced 5s that shouldn't be.\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Pixels Off: 1\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Notes: One gray was replaced with azure that had an azure neighbor, and one gray pixel adjacent to another gray pixel wasn't transformed into an 8.\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Pixels Off: 3\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Notes: Similar to example 1, missed changes and incorrectly changed some. The key difference between the expected and transformed results is that when the program sees a 5 surrounded by any 8s, it should replace all adjacent 5s with 8s.\n\nBased on the examples, all of the errors are related to improperly transforming gray pixels (5) into azure (8). The code incorrectly checks for fully surrounded first, and it misses replacing a gray pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"
