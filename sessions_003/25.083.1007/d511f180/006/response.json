            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation description:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of \"spreading\" azure (8) from existing azure pixels to adjacent gray (5) pixels. This works to some extent, but the provided examples and results reveal inconsistencies. The transformation doesn't simply replace *all* gray pixels adjacent to azure with azure. It seems there's a directional or conditional aspect that the current logic is missing. The expected results are slightly different, with grey pixels changing to the color of a nearby neighbor, in the opposite direction from the azure pixel.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Differences:** Carefully examine *where* the predicted output differs from the expected output in each example. This will highlight the specific gray pixels that are being incorrectly transformed (or not transformed).\n2.  **Re-evaluate Neighbors:** Instead of just checking if *any* neighbor is azure, I need to consider the relative positions of the gray pixel and its azure neighbor. The examples might involve a directional spread, a \"fill\" based on a neighboring azure, or other shapes on the grid.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the observed differences, I'll reformulate the natural language description to be more precise about *which* gray pixels get replaced and *why*.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**\n\nI'll start by writing a python script to collect the locations of the errors\n\n"
