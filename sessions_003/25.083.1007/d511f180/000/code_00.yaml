facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - values: integers 0-9 representing colors
  - object: cell
    description: individual element within the grid
    properties:
      - value: integer (color)
      - position: row, column index
  - transformation: value_replacement
    description: specific values are replaced with other values.
    properties:
        - original_value: value before transformation
        - replacement_value: value after transformation
    conditions: "appears that 5s surrounded on orthogonal sides get replaced, order of replacement is top-to-bottom, left-to-right"
  - observation_1: "in example 1, all 5s in the center of orthogonal 8s get replaced by 8s"
  - observation_2: "in example 2, the top middle 5 is surrounded on 2 sides by 8, one being diagonal, and it is changed to an 8. The 5 in the middle on the right is only adjacent to one 8 and it gets changed"
  - observation_3: "in example 3, the 5s in top middle and middle left both changed to 8s, even though they are not surrounded"
