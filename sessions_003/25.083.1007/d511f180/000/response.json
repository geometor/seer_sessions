The transformation seems to involve a specific type of replacement or swapping of values within the grid, maintaining the overall grid structure (dimensions remain the same). The change is localized and doesn't involve complex global operations. There's a strong indication that a particular color/number is being replaced by another, based on some rule related to its surroundings.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
