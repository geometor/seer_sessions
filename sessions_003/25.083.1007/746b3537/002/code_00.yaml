observations:
  - task: "Extract and represent unique colors"
    details: |
      The transformation identifies all unique colors present in the input grid.
      Each of these unique colors is then represented in the output grid. The output grid presents one pixel for each of the identified colors, in order.
    objects:
      - input_grid: A 2D array of color values.
      - output_grid: A 1D array containing one pixel of each of the unique colors from the input_grid.
      - row: A horizontal line of pixels within the input grid.  Relevant only if all pixels are the same color.
      - pixel: A single cell in the grid, represented by a color value.
      - unique_colors: set of colors that appear in the input_grid.
    properties:
      - color: An integer value (0-9) representing a specific color.
      - solid_color_row: a property of a row where all pixels within the row share the same color.
      - unique: all present with no duplicates.

    actions:
      - identify: Find all unique colors in the input grid.
      - extract: Take one pixel of each of the unique colors.
      - construct: build output by stacking single pixels in order.
