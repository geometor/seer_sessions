Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are rectangular grids of varying dimensions, filled with single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   The outputs are also grids, but they appear to be derived from the input grids in a specific way. It seems like the output takes one instance of each row from input and remove the duplicates.
*   The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid, specifically collapsing rows.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: object
    description: Input grid
    properties:
      - attribute: dimensions
        value: variable (e.g., 3x3, 3x5, 4x2, 6x4)
      - attribute: content
        value: 2D array of integers (0-9)

  - type: object
    description: Output grid
    properties:
      - attribute: dimensions
        value: variable (derived from input)
      - attribute: content
        value: 2D array of integers (0-9)

  - type: action
    description: Row extraction
    details: Extract unique row from the input grid.

  - type: relationship
    description: Input-Output Mapping
    details: The output grid is constructed by extracting one instance of each rows of input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through the rows of the input grid.
2.  **Check** each row if its existed before.
3.  **Construct** the output grid with all the rows that appear the first time in the input grid, keep its original order.
