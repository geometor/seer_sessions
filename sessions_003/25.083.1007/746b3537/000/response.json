Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are rectangular grids of varying dimensions, filled with single-digit integers (representing colors).\n*   The outputs are also grids, but they appear to be derived from the input grids in a specific way. It seems like the output takes one instance of each row from input and remove the duplicates.\n*   The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid, specifically collapsing rows.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
