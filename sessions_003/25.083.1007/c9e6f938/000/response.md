Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, where each digit represents a color.
*   The digit `0` (white) appears to be a background or empty space.
*   The digit `7` (orange) appears to be the active element or object being manipulated.
*   The output grid is always twice as wide as the input grid.
*   The transformation seems to involve a horizontal mirroring or reflection of the input, with some modification. Specifically, the `7`s in the input seem to create "blocks" of `7`s in the output extending to the vertical boundaries of the new grid dimensions.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - color_map: {0: white, 7: orange}
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - role: source data
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - role: transformed data
      - dimensions:
          width: 2 * input_grid.width
          height: input_grid.height
  - object: digit_7
    properties:
      - color: orange
      - role: primary object
      - behavior: expands horizontally during transformation
  - action: transformation
    description: horizontal mirroring/reflection with modification
    details:
      - input grid is doubled in width
      - For every column containing the object (digit 7),
        the corresponding and mirrored columns are filled to the top and bottom edges with 7's in the output,
        unless the mirrored location is already occupied by a 7-filled area of the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double the Width:** Create a new output grid that is twice the width of the input grid and the same height.
2.  **Iterate through Input Columns:** For each column in the *input* grid:
3.  **Check for '7':**  If the current input column contains a '7',
4.  **Fill Mirrored Columns:**
      a. Find the corresponding column in the *output* grid (same index as the input column)
      b.  Fill every cell in the corresponding column of the output grid with '7'.
      c. Find the mirrored column index in the output grid (output\_grid.width - input\_column\_index - 1)
      d.  Fill every cell in this mirrored column of the output grid with '7'.

This program essentially describes a process where the presence of a '7' in an input column triggers the filling of both that corresponding column and its mirrored counterpart in the output grid with '7's.
