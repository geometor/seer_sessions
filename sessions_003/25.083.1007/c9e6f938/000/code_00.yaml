    description: horizontal mirroring/reflection with modification
    details:
      - input grid is doubled in width
      - For every column containing the object (digit 7),
        the corresponding and mirrored columns are filled to the top and bottom edges with 7's in the output,
        unless the mirrored location is already occupied by a 7-filled area of the input.
