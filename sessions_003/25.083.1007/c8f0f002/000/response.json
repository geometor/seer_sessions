It is not based in objectness.\n*   The color gray (5) appears in locations originally occupied by 7 and 1 and 8.\n*   The positions being changed appear to form a \"frame\" of replacement along the edges of blocks of 7s and 1s.\n*   The transformation has no reliance on numbers, counting, geometry, or topology other than adjacency.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
