facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Cells contain single-digit integers representing colors.
  - observation: The color gray (5) replaces other colors in the output.
  - observation: The replacement isn't a simple color-for-color substitution.
  - observation: The replacement pattern appears around the edges of contiguous same-colored regions.
  - relationship: The replacement occurs at the boundary of object pixels with values 7 and 1.
  - constraint: "inner" pixels of objects are not affected - those not adjacent to other colors
