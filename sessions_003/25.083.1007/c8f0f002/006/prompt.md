1.  **First Pass (1s and 7s):**
    *   Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
    *   If a cell is blue (1) or orange (7):
        *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
        *   If a neighboring cell has the *other* of these two colors (i.e., a 1 is next to a 7, or a 7 is next to a 1), change the current cell's color to gray (5).
        *   Keep track of these changed cells.
2.  **Second Pass (8s):**
    *   Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
    *   If a cell is azure (8):
        *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals)
        *   If *any* neighbor was a 1 or 7 that changed to a 5 in the first pass, change the current cell (the 8) to gray (5).
3.  **All Other Cells:**
    *   Any cell not meeting the above conditions retains its original color.
