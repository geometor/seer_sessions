            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the importance of colors 1, 7, and 8, and the concept of neighboring cells, it failed to accurately capture the conditions for changing the colors. Specifically, it's overly aggressive in changing 1s and 7s to 5s. It appears to change any 1 or 7 next to *any* different, non-8 color, regardless of the output's more specific requirements. The 8s transformation rule seems correct in principle, but because the first pass is incorrect, it also produces errors.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Errors:** Carefully examine *why* the current code fails on each example. Determine the *precise* conditions under which 1s, 7s, and 8s change to 5s in the *correct* output. The current code changes colors when a condition is met, we need to determine if the changed color depends on the color of the neighboring pixels.\n2.  **Refine the Neighbor Rule:** The current neighbor check is too broad. We need to determine what relationship exists between cells that change and their neighbors.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to precisely reflect the refined rules.\n4.  **Update Code:** Modify the code to implement the updated natural language program.\n5.  **Re-test:** Run the revised code against all training examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection, as code execution is not necessary for this observational step):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x6 grid with 1s, 7s, and 8s.\n    *   Expected Output: Shows specific 1s and 7s changing to 5, seemingly where they border each other. Some 8s are unchanged.\n    *   Observed Error: The code changes almost all 1s and 7s to 5.\n    *   Pixels Off: 10\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x4 grid.\n    *   Expected Output: Similar pattern as Example 1.\n    *   Observed Error: Same as Example 1 - too many 1s and 7s are converted to 5.\n        *   Pixels off: 6\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x5 grid.\n    *   Expected Output: Again, selective changes, not wholesale.\n    *   Observed Error: Same as Examples 1 & 2.\n     *   Pixels Off: 11\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

They only change to 5 if they are adjacent to *each other*, not just any different, non-8 color. The condition for 8 is also more explicit, it is only changed if a neighbor changed in the first pass.\n"
