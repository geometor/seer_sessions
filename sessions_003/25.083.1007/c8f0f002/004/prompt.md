1. Iterate through each cell (pixel) in the input grid.

2. First Pass - Change 1s and 7s:
    *   For each cell, check if its color is blue (1) or orange (7).
    *   If it is, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    *   If *any* of these neighbors have a *different* color value AND the neighboring color is not azure (8), change the current cell's color to gray (5).
    *   Keep track of the cells changed to 5.

3. Second Pass - Change 8s:
    *   Iterate through each cell again
    *   If the current cell is an 8.
    *   If a neighboring cell (up, down, left, right, diagonal) is a blue (1) or orange (7) cell that has been changed to a 5 in the first pass, change the current cell's color to gray (5)

4. Otherwise, keep the original color of the cell.
