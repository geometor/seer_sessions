Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program description:

**Perception:**

The core transformation seems to involve replacing a specific, consistent pattern in the input grid with a single color in the output grid. The pattern appears to be related to the presence of the color gray (value 5). The surrounding colors in the input don't seem to matter, the only thing that changes is the column with gray. It seems that the column that has the gray square turns to red, and any other place keeps with '0'.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x7 (all examples)
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - colors: contains white (0), blue (1), and gray (5)

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (all examples)
      - values: integers (0,2)
      - colors: contains only white(0) and red (2)

  - object: gray_column
    type: column
    properties:
       - color : gray(5)
       - position: index 3 (all examples)
  - action: replace_column
    description: The column containing the gray color is transformed to red.

  - relationship:
    subject: input_grid
    predicate: contains
    object: gray_column

  - relationship:
      subject: gray_column
      predicate: transformed_to
      object: red_column

  - constant: color_gray
      value: 5

  - constant: color_white
      value: 0

  - constant: color_blue
       value: 1
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Gray Column:** Locate the column in the input grid that contains the color gray (value 5).
2.  **Create output grid:** Create output grid size of input grid height and a constant of 3 columns wide.
3.  **Transform to Red:** Replace that entire output column to the color red (value 2).
4.  **Fill Remaining with white:** Fill the remaining columns of output with the color white (value 0).

In essence, the transformation isolates the column with gray, replaces it with red, and presents it within an all-white background, trimming the width down to 3 columns.
