facts:
  - object: gray_column
    description: A vertical line of pixels with the color gray (value 5).  Its presence is a key landmark.
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      cardinality: one # there should only ever be one

  - object: blue_pixels
    description: Pixels with color blue (value 1).  Their position relative to the gray_column determines the output.
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      relation: adjacent to gray_column

  - object: red_pixels
    description:  Pixels in the output with the color red (value 2).
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      relation:  replaces blue pixels in the output, but maintains row index

  - action: find_gray_column
    description: Locates the single gray column in the input grid.

  - action: check_blue_neighbors
    description: Determines which rows have blue pixels to the left and/or right of the gray column.

  - action: determine_output_width
    description:  Set the column to be 0, 1, or 2 based on left or right blue neighbors
    logic: >
        If there are blue pixels to the left of the gray column in any row, there will be one output column.
        If there are blue pixels to the right of the gray column in any row, there will be another output column.

  - action: create_output
    description: Generates output grid.
    logic: >
        The output grid's width depends on blue_neighbors.
        Red pixels are placed in the output grid at rows where blue pixels were adjacent to the gray column, with a maximum of two columns.
        All other cells are white.
