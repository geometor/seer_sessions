This subgrid isn't based on a simple fixed position (like the top-left corner). Instead, it appears to be defined by the arrangement of non-zero pixels in the input. Specifically, the selected 2x2 region's top-left corner is related to a particular pattern in the top-left of the original matrix. It could be a consistent pixel present that tells me which portion to crop.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
