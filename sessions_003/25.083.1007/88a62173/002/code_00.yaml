facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Represents the initial state
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - size: 2x2
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Represents the transformed state
  - observation: "The output grid is always 2x2."
  - observation: "The top-left non-zero value of input is used as reference point"
  - observation: "output pixel values are the same as some input pixel value"
  - action: find_top_left_non_zero
    description: "Locates the top-leftmost non-zero element in the input grid."
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: "Extracts a 2x2 subgrid, with the top left being based on the reference location"
  - error_observation: "extracted output does not exactly match expected in value"
