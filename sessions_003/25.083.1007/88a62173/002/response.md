Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of finding the top-leftmost non-zero element and extracting a 2x2 subgrid was partially successful. It correctly identified the size of the output and the starting point. However, the content of the 2x2 subgrid doesn't always match the expected output. The issue seems to be that the extracted subgrid does not always have the correct elements relative to the top-left non-zero element of the input grid. It is close, but there's an error related to mirroring or adjacency that is not correct. We need a better way to relate the output pixels to the input pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the relationship:** Instead of simply taking the immediate 2x2 subgrid, we need to analyze the *relative positions* of the pixels in the output compared to the input, with the top-leftmost non-zero pixel as the reference.
2.  **Consider mirroring/flipping:** The discrepancies in the examples suggest a possible reflection or rotation might be involved.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**

Since I need to examine all the examples, the most relevant metric is calculating differences. I don't think I need more metrics.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_id: 88a62173
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Represents the initial state
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - size: 2x2
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Represents the transformed state
  - observation: "The output grid is always 2x2."
  - observation: "The top-left non-zero value of input is used as reference point"
  - observation: "output pixel values are the same as some input pixel value"
  - action: find_top_left_non_zero
    description: "Locates the top-leftmost non-zero element in the input grid."
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: "Extracts a 2x2 subgrid, with the top left being based on the reference location"
  - error_observation: "extracted output does not exactly match expected in value"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Reference:** Locate the top-leftmost non-zero element in the input grid. This serves as the anchor point (row\_anchor, col\_anchor).
2. **Construct output grid**: Construct 2x2 output.
3.  **Populate Output:** Populate the output grid using values from the input array based on the position of the top-leftmost non-zero, as such
    *   output\[0,0] = input\_grid\[row\_anchor, col\_anchor]
    *   output\[0,1] = input\_grid\[row\_anchor, col\_anchor+1]
    *    output\[1,0] = input\_grid\[row\_anchor+1, col\_anchor]
    *    output\[1,1] = input\_grid\[row\_anchor,col\_anchor-1] if col\_anchor > 0. if not available, then value should be input\_grid\[row\_anchor+1, col\_anchor+2]

That last instruction is a bit complicated, but example 3 seems to require that the location to the left of the anchor, if it exists, otherwise 2 to the right of the anchor.
