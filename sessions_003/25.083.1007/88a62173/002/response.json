It correctly identified the size of the output and the starting point. However, the content of the 2x2 subgrid doesn't always match the expected output. The issue seems to be that the extracted subgrid does not always have the correct elements relative to the top-left non-zero element of the input grid. It is close, but there's an error related to mirroring or adjacency that is not correct. We need a better way to relate the output pixels to the input pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the relationship:** Instead of simply taking the immediate 2x2 subgrid, we need to analyze the *relative positions* of the pixels in the output compared to the input, with the top-leftmost non-zero pixel as the reference.\n2.  **Consider mirroring/flipping:** The discrepancies in the examples suggest a possible reflection or rotation might be involved.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nSince I need to examine all the examples, the most relevant metric is calculating differences. I don't think I need more metrics.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
