Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial strategy was to locate the top-leftmost non-zero element and use it as an anchor to build a 2x2 output grid. While this approach has merit, it's clear from the test results that the selection of elements for the output grid needs adjustments. The current logic doesn't consistently capture the correct surrounding pixels from the input. Specifically, the logic for populating `output_grid[1, 1]` is flawed and needs to be corrected.

The errors show a pattern:
1. Example 1 failed likely due to an out-of-bounds access, or a mistake in the index calculation.
2. example 2 failed because it picked 0 at output[1,0] instead of 1.
3. Example 3 failed because it picked 8 at output[0,1] instread of 0.

It is becoming obvious that the approach of getting the top-left-most non zero pixel, followed by picking a 2x2 subgrid is not the correct logic. It seems like the correct logic is finding the top-leftmost non-zero pixel, drawing a bounding box around the largest contiguous non-zero block of pixels and the constructing a 2x2 subgrid by sampling pixels from this bounding box.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's use `numpy` to get shapes of inputs and outputs.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Largest Contiguous Block:**
    In the input grid, find the largest contiguous block of non-zero pixels. Contiguous means that the pixels are connected horizontally, vertically.

2. **Determine Bounding Box:**
    Draw an imaginary bounding box that encloses the entire contiguos block. The bounding box should have sides parallel with the input grid and be as small as it can and still include all pixels of the contiguos block.
   
3. **Sample pixels** 
    Sample pixels from the bounding box corners.
    *   output[0,0] = top-left corner
    *   output[0,1] = top-right corner
    *    output[1,0] = bottom-left corner
    *    output[1,1] = bottom-right corner

4. **Construct output grid**:
    Construct 2x2 output array

5.  **Populate Output:** Populate the output grid using values from the input array.
