facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain rows of single-color pixels, and others that might have multiple colors.
  - object_identification: |
      Each row can be considered an object.
  - property: |
      Rows have the property of color homogeneity (all pixels in a row are the same color) or heterogeneity (pixels have different colors)
  - action: |
      The transformation identifies rows with color homogeneity in the input.
  - transformation: |
      Homogeneous rows in input are converted to gray (5) in the output.
      Heterogeneous rows, or homogeneous rows colored differently than other rows in the grid, in input are converted to white (0) in output.
  - relation: |
      There's a one-to-one correspondence between rows in the input and output grids. The transformation operates on a per-row basis.
