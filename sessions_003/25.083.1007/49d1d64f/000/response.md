Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors). The input grids vary in size.
*   **Output:** The output is also a 2D grid of single-digit integers. The output grids appear to be an expanded version of the input grids. There's a pattern of duplication and framing with zeros.
*    The core transformation seems to involve expanding each row and each column of the original input, and then adds a border of '0's around it.

**YAML Fact Block:**

      - add_border:
           description: A border of zeros is added around entire grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Duplicate Rows:** For each row in the input grid, create an identical copy of that row immediately below it.
2.  **Duplicate Columns:** For each column in the grid (which now has duplicated rows), create an identical copy of that column immediately to its right.
3. **Add 0 border:** Create a border of '0' valued cells around the resulting grid. This border is one cell thick on all sides (top, bottom, left, and right).

Essentially, the program takes each input pixel and turns it into a 2x2 block of the same color, and then encases everything with a border/frame of '0' (white) color.
