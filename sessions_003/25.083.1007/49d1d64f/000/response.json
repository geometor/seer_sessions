The input grids vary in size.\n*   **Output:** The output is also a 2D grid of single-digit integers. The output grids appear to be an expanded version of the input grids. There's a pattern of duplication and framing with zeros.\n*    The core transformation seems to involve expanding each row and each column of the original input, and then adds a border of '0's around it.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
