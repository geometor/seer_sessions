            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program was on the right track, focusing on expanding each pixel into a 2x2 block and adding a border. However, it's clear from the test results that the border implementation is incorrect. Instead of adding a single-pixel border *around* the expanded grid, it's adding a border that's effectively doubling the size of the expanded grid again, and leaving most new spaces at '0'. The core expansion logic (pixel to 2x2 block) seems correct, but the border logic needs significant adjustment. The program needs a top, bottom, left, and right border.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Expansion:** Double-check that the 2x2 expansion is universally correct across all examples. Although it appears correct visually, we want to programmatically confirm it before focusing solely on the border issue.\n2.  **Correct Border:** The main focus should be on fixing the border. The border implementation does not follow what we want to accomplish.\n3.  **Precise Language:** Refine the natural language program to be extremely specific about *how* the border is applied *after* the expansion.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**\n\nFirst, I will check the height and width of input, expected, and actual grids.\n\n"
