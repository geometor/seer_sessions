facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids are always 3x3.
  - observation: Input grids consist of digits between 2 and 4 inclusive.
  - observation: Output grids mostly consist of 0s, and 5s.
  - object: InputGrid, a 3x3 matrix of integers.
  - object: OutputGrid, a 3x3 matrix of integers.
  - property: InputGrid.values, the set of unique values in InputGrid.
  - property: OutputGrid.diagonal, elements where row index equals column index.
  - property: OutputGrid.anti_diagonal, elements where row index plus column index equals 2.
  - action: Transform, converting InputGrid to OutputGrid.
  - relationship: "If InputGrid.values contains both 2 and 3 or 2 and 4, then OutputGrid has 5s on diagonal or anti-diagonal and 0 otherwise."
  - relationship: "If InputGrid.values contains only a single value like 3 or 4, and this single value is present across whole input grid, then the whole output grid becomes the same and filled with color 5, except for the cases when input contains other value then 3 and 4"
  - relationship: "If InputGrid has values of 3 and 4 (without 2), there seems to be an overwrite of the single color rule with another diagonal-like one"
