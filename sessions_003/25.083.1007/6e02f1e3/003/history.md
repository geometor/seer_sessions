```python
"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on the following rules:

1.  **Check Input Values:** Examine the unique values present in the input grid.

2.  **Single Value Rule:**
    *   If the input grid contains *only* the value 3, or *only* the value 4, fill the output grid entirely with 5s.

3.  **Mixed Values Rule:**
    *    If input grid has only values of 3 and 4, the output grid will have a diagonal of 5 from top-left to bottom-right, 0 otherwise.
    *   If the input grid contains 2 and 3: Create an output grid where the *anti-diagonal* (top-right to bottom-left) is filled with 5s, and all other cells are 0.
    *   If the input grid contains 2 and 4: Create an output grid where the *diagonal* (top-left to bottom-right) is filled with 5s, and all other cells are 0.

4.  **Overwrite rule:**
    *   If the single color rule is met, and the color is not 3 or 4, apply mixed value rule.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code captures some aspects of the transformation but fails to correctly handle several cases. The core issue seems to be an incorrect prioritization and combination of the single-value and mixed-value rules, and an incomplete application of the mixed-values rules. The expected outputs sometimes have `0` where the rules as currently coded produce `5`, and vice-versa. Also the all-5 rule seems to be applied too broadly.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine each example where the transformed output differs from the expected output. Identify the specific conditions (input values) and the expected output patterns.
2.  **Prioritize Rules:** Determine the correct order of applying the rules. It appears the mixed-value rules should be re-evaluated, and applied before the single value rules, and the conditions for some of the rules are not right.
3.  **Refine Conditions:** Adjust the conditions for each rule to accurately reflect the observed behavior in *all* examples.
4.  **Rewrite Program:** Based on the refined understanding, rewrite the natural language program.
5.  Use the validation outputs and images to verify the observations, focusing on pixels that don't match.

**Gather Metrics & Observations (using code execution where needed):**
I'll summarize the key observations from the provided results directly, focusing on discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:** Input has 2 and 3. Expected output is a diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) of 5s. Transformed output is an anti-diagonal.
*   **Example 2:** Input has 2, 3, and 4. Expected output is all zeros. Transformed output is also all zeros. This looks correct, but the reason why needs to be identified in the rules.
*   **Example 3:** Input has only 4. Expected output has 5s in the top row, 0s elsewhere. Transformed output is all 5s.
*   **Example 4:** Input has only 3. Expected output has 5s in the top row, 0s elsewhere. Transformed output is all 5s.
*   **Example 5:** Input has 3 and 4. Expected Output is diagonal with 5. Actual is diagonal with 5. This example works.

**YAML Facts:**

    expected_output_pattern: diagonal_5
    actual_output_pattern: diagonal_5
    rule_applied: "mixed_3_4_correct"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Check for Mixed Values (Priority):**
    *   If the input grid contains only 2 and 3, the output grid will have an *anti-diagonal* (top-right to bottom-left) of 5s, and 0s otherwise.
    *   If the input grid contains only 3 and 4, the output grid will have a *diagonal* (top-left to bottom-right) of 5s, and 0s otherwise.
    *   If the input grid contains only 2 and 4, the output grid will have a *diagonal* (top-left to bottom-right) of 5s and 0s otherwise.
    *  If the input grid contains 2, 3, and 4, the output grid is all 0s.

2.  **Check for Single Value (Secondary):**
    *   If the input grid contains *only* the value 3, fill the *top row* of the output grid with 5s, and the rest with 0s.
    *   If the input grid contains *only* the value 4, fill the *top row* of the output grid with 5s, and the rest with 0s.

3.  **Default:** If none of the above conditions are met, the output grid is all 0s (this might be redundant given the initialization, but it's good to state explicitly).
