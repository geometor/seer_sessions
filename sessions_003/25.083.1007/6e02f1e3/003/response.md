"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on the following rules:

1.  **Check for Mixed Values (Priority):**
    *   If the input grid contains only 2 and 3, the output grid will have an *anti-diagonal* (top-right to bottom-left) of 5s, and 0s otherwise.
    *   If the input grid contains only 3 and 4, the output grid will have a *diagonal* (top-left to bottom-right) of 5s, and 0s otherwise.
    *   If the input grid contains only 2 and 4, the output grid will have a *diagonal* (top-left to bottom-right) of 5s and 0s otherwise.
    *  If the input grid contains 2, 3, and 4, the output grid is all 0s.

2.  **Check for Single Value (Secondary):**
    *   If the input grid contains *only* the value 3, fill the *top row* of the output grid with 5s, and the rest with 0s.
    *   If the input grid contains *only* the value 4, fill the *top row* of the output grid with 5s, and the rest with 0s.

3.  **Default:** If none of the above conditions are met, the output grid is all 0s (this might be redundant given the initialization, but it's good to state explicitly).
