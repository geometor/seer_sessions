            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code captures some aspects of the transformation but fails to correctly handle several cases. The core issue seems to be an incorrect prioritization and combination of the single-value and mixed-value rules, and an incomplete application of the mixed-values rules. The expected outputs sometimes have `0` where the rules as currently coded produce `5`, and vice-versa. Also the all-5 rule seems to be applied too broadly.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine each example where the transformed output differs from the expected output. Identify the specific conditions (input values) and the expected output patterns.\n2.  **Prioritize Rules:** Determine the correct order of applying the rules. It appears the mixed-value rules should be re-evaluated, and applied before the single value rules, and the conditions for some of the rules are not right.\n3.  **Refine Conditions:** Adjust the conditions for each rule to accurately reflect the observed behavior in *all* examples.\n4.  **Rewrite Program:** Based on the refined understanding, rewrite the natural language program.\n5.  Use the validation outputs and images to verify the observations, focusing on pixels that don't match.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Observations (using code execution where needed):**\nI'll summarize the key observations from the provided results directly, focusing on discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input has 2 and 3. Expected output is a diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) of 5s. Transformed output is an anti-diagonal.\n*   **Example 2:** Input has 2, 3, and 4. Expected output is all zeros. Transformed output is also all zeros. This looks correct, but the reason why needs to be identified in the rules.\n*   **Example 3:** Input has only 4. Expected output has 5s in the top row, 0s elsewhere. Transformed output is all 5s.\n*   **Example 4:** Input has only 3. Expected output has 5s in the top row, 0s elsewhere. Transformed output is all 5s.\n*   **Example 5:** Input has 3 and 4. Expected Output is diagonal with 5. Actual is diagonal with 5. This example works.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
