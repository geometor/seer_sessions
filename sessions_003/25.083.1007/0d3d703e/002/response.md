Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code performs a digit substitution, and it works correctly for most of the examples. However, Example 3 reveals an error: the digit 6 in the input is not correctly transformed, as it remains a 6 in the output while the expected output has it a 2. This indicates that either our substitution map is incomplete or the logic is faulty. The provided code comments indicate that it should not change any digit not in the mapping, so that makes it most likely an incomplete mapping.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Examine Example 3 Closely:** We need to identify why '6' wasn't transformed to '2'. This suggests a missing rule in our `substitution_map`.
2.  **Update Substitution Map:** Incorporate the missing rule (6 -> 2) into the `substitution_map`.
3.  **Re-evaluate Natural Language Program:** Update the program description to accurately reflect the complete substitution rule set.
4.  Present the facts extracted from the training examples as YAML.

**Metrics and Reports (using provided results, no code execution needed):**

*   **Example 1:** Perfect match.
*   **Example 2:** Perfect match.
*   **Example 3:** Mismatch. 3 pixels are incorrect. The color palette of the output is listed as incorrect.
*   **Example 4:** Perfect match.

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation performs a digit substitution on the input grid. The following substitutions are applied:

*   3 becomes 4
*   1 becomes 5
*   2 becomes 6
*   8 becomes 9
*   5 becomes 1
*   9 becomes 8
*   4 becomes 3
*   6 becomes 2

All other digits remain unchanged.
