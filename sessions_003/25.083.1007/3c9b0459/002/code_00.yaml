task: 3c9b0459
observations:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: rectangular (rows x columns)
    transformations:
      - initial_attempt: reverse rows, then transpose
        correct: False
      - observed_effect:  The output appears to be a reflection across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), combined with a reversal of rows. It is as if we flip the grid horizontally and THEN flip it across the main diagonal.  Alternatively, it is rotating the grid clockwise by 90 degrees.

      input_shape: 3x3
      output_shape: 3x3
      pixels_off: 8
