Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the grid's rows, suggesting a permutation or rotation of some kind. The values within each row also appear to be reversed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        - height: number of rows
        - width:  number of columns
      actions:
        - row_reversal: reverse the order of elements in each row
        - grid_transpose: interchange rows and columns of entire grid

relationships:
  - input_output:
      relation: transformation
      description: Input grid is transformed to output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reverse each row:** For every row in the input grid, reverse the order of its elements.
2.  **Transpose the grid:** Swap rows and columns, perform a transpose operation.

Effectively, these operations are doing a counter-clockwise 90 degree rotation of the original grid.
