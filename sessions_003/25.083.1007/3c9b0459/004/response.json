            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the 90-degree clockwise rotation and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. While the output grid sizes are correct, indicating the rotation operation itself is likely valid at a fundamental level, the colors within the rotated grids do not match the expected outputs. This suggests a more complex transformation rule that likely *includes* rotation, but also involves additional color/pixel manipulations based on some currently unknown criteria. My strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Verify Rotation:** First I need to ensure it *is* rotation that is happening and identify the axis of rotation, accounting for color.\n2.  **Analyze Color Changes:** Examine the specific color changes in each example to identify patterns. Are the changes consistent across examples, or do they depend on position, surrounding colors, or other factors?\n3.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Based on the detailed analysis, I will develop a more complex description, still likely based around rotation.\n\n**Gather Metrics (Using Code for Precision):**\n\nI'll write python code to gather more structured information on differences between my output and the expected output.\n\n"

The color swapping rule, however, needs to be much better defined. The current implementation is close, but the key to solving this is to deduce *why* the colors are swapped.
