## train_1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```


**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
9 2 4
2 4 4
2 9 2
```


**output:**
```
2 9 2
4 4 2
4 2 9
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
8 8 8
5 5 8
8 5 5
```


**output:**
```
5 5 8
8 5 5
8 8 8
```


## train_4

**input:**
```
3 2 9
9 9 9
2 3 3
```


**output:**
```
3 3 2
9 9 9
9 2 3
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the grid's rows, suggesting a permutation or rotation of some kind. The values within each row also appear to be reversed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        - height: number of rows
        - width:  number of columns
      actions:
        - row_reversal: reverse the order of elements in each row
        - grid_transpose: interchange rows and columns of entire grid

relationships:
  - input_output:
      relation: transformation
      description: Input grid is transformed to output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reverse each row:** For every row in the input grid, reverse the order of its elements.
2.  **Transpose the grid:** Swap rows and columns, perform a transpose operation.

Effectively, these operations are doing a counter-clockwise 90 degree rotation of the original grid.
