Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The current strategy of rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise is correct. However, the color-swapping logic is flawed and doesn't generalize across all examples. The initial assumption about swapping colors based on sorting unique colors (excluding the center) and creating a circular swap pattern is not consistent with all observed transformations. It appears to work partially for some cases, but fails significantly in others. A new strategy is needed to identify color mappings that's not hardcoded and relies on more generalizable principles that can be applied reliably.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Abandon current color swap logic:** The current approach to defining `swaps` is too specific and brittle, it won't adapt well.
2.  **Focus on a direct mapping approach:** Instead of complex swap logic, try to derive a direct color mapping (input color -> output color). It appears that there could be two strategies to explore, the first is a simple direct mapping, and the other is to find a simple mapping rule based on pixel location (perhaps some simple math function).
3. **Re-examine rotated grids:** Focus on the relationship between colors *after* rotation, since the rotation step works.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I will calculate the color mappings for each example *after* the rotation. This should give me a cleaner picture of the color transformations.

**Analysis of Color Mappings:**

The attempt to find a direct, consistent color mapping after rotation failed. The `get_color_mapping` function returns `None` for all examples, indicating that there isn't a simple one-to-one correspondence between the colors in the rotated grid and the output grid. This means the color transformation isn't a simple substitution cipher applied *after* rotation. The mapping depends on something else. The most likely candidate is a location-based transformation, where the new color depends on both position *and* original color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task: 3c9b0459
description: Rotate and recolor a 3x3 grid.
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (colors)
actions:
  - name: rotate
    type: spatial
    description: Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
  - name: recolor
    type: transformation
    description: Change pixel colors based on a rule dependent on the *original* color and position in the rotated grid. This IS NOT a simple color swap.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Recolor:** For each cell in the *rotated* grid, determine its new color based on a rule.  This rule is *not* a simple color-to-color mapping. The output color depends on BOTH the color in the rotated grid and the location. Since we know a direct mapping is not enough we will need to determine the role of location in our code step.
