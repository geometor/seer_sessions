            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current strategy of rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise is correct. However, the color-swapping logic is flawed and doesn't generalize across all examples. The initial assumption about swapping colors based on sorting unique colors (excluding the center) and creating a circular swap pattern is not consistent with all observed transformations. It appears to work partially for some cases, but fails significantly in others. A new strategy is needed to identify color mappings that's not hardcoded and relies on more generalizable principles that can be applied reliably.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Abandon current color swap logic:** The current approach to defining `swaps` is too specific and brittle, it won't adapt well.\n2.  **Focus on a direct mapping approach:** Instead of complex swap logic, try to derive a direct color mapping (input color -> output color). It appears that there could be two strategies to explore, the first is a simple direct mapping, and the other is to find a simple mapping rule based on pixel location (perhaps some simple math function).\n3. **Re-examine rotated grids:** Focus on the relationship between colors *after* rotation, since the rotation step works.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI will calculate the color mappings for each example *after* the rotation. This should give me a cleaner picture of the color transformations.\n\n"
