The transformation seems to re-arrange the elements within the grid. There is no simple mirroring or 90 degree rotation. The position of elements change, and it seems like the re-position is non-linear. It does not appear that elements are simple reversed, flipped, or rotated. It appears to be a reordering of columns, but the specific rule for how they are reordered is difficult to discern visually, and could potentially depend on element color or value or its position.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
