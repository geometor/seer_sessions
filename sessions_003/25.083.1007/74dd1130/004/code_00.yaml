facts:
  - observation: Each example consists of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (colors).
  - object_property: The size of the grid remains constant during the transformation.
  - object_property: The set of colors used in the input grid is the same as in the output grid, but their positions may change.
  - transformation_type: Pixel rearrangement within the grid.
  - observation: The transformation is not a simple row-wise sort.
  - observation: The differences between input and expected output vary across examples, suggesting a more complex rule than simple swaps.
