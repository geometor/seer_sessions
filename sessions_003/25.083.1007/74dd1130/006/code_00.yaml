  - task_id: 74dd1130
  - grid_size: 3x3
  - object_type: pixel
  - object_properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
  - actions:
      - name: rearrange
        description: Pixels move from their input positions to new positions in the output grid, maintaining their color.
      - name: duplicate # Added to reflect observations.
        description: Pixel values may be duplicated in multiple places within the same output column.

  - observations:
    - example_1: "Input pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (2,1) and (2,2) map to multiple output locations"
    - example_2: "Input pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) and (2,2) map to multiple output locations"
    - example_3: "Input pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (2,2) map to multiple output positions"
    - example_4: "Input pixels at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) and (2,2) map to multiple output locations"
    - general: "No color changes occur during the transformation."
    - general: "The transformation rearranges pixels within the grid."
    - general: "Input pixels may be duplicated."
