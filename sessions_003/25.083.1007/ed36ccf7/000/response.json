The input grids seem to have a mix of two colors, arranged in a particular pattern. The output grids also contain the same two colors, but their arrangement is different. The transformation appears to be a kind of rearrangement or rotation of the color blocks within the grid, maintaining the original colors. It's likely a geometric manipulation of the color regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
