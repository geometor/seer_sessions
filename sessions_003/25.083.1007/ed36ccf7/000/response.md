Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids. The input grids seem to have a mix of two colors, arranged in a particular pattern. The output grids also contain the same two colors, but their arrangement is different. The transformation appears to be a kind of rearrangement or rotation of the color blocks within the grid, maintaining the original colors. It's likely a geometric manipulation of the color regions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    size: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - property: color_blocks
    description: contiguous regions of the same color within the grid
  - action: rearrangement
    description: The positions of the color blocks are altered.
  - relationship: color_preservation
    description: The colors present in the input grid are the same as those in the output grid.
  - observation: pattern_change
    description: specific arrangements of color change, possible rotation or reflection
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the two distinct colors present in the input grid.
2.  **Observe** the spatial arrangement of the color blocks. Note the top-left cell color as the "primary" color.
3. **Rotate** - rotate the grid clockwise to produce the output grid.
4.  **Construct** the output grid by applying a 90-degree clockwise rotation to the input grid. This involves remapping the indices: input\[i]\[j] becomes output\[j]\[2-i].
