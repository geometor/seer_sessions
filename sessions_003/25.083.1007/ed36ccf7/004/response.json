            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program described a matrix transposition (reflection across the main diagonal). However, the results show this is incorrect for all four training examples. The code *does* perform a transposition, but the expected outputs are different. This indicates a misunderstanding of the underlying transformation rule. My strategy will be to carefully re-examine the input/output pairs, focusing on the *changes* in pixel positions and colors. I will try different approaches.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Visually inspect each input-output pair, looking for simple geometric transformations (rotations, reflections other than the main diagonal, etc.) or color-based rules. It's highly probable that the rule is a combination of the priors.\n2.  **Object Identification** I will use code to identify areas of same colored contiguous pixels.\n3.  **Hypothesis Generation and Testing:** Based on observations, I will formulate a new hypothesis about the transformation rule and describe it in a revised natural language program.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Observations (using manual analysis for now, since code execution for image analysis isn't directly provided):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Two colors (maroon (9) and white(0)).\n    *   Output: Seems like a reflection across the *anti-diagonal* (top-right to bottom-left), with maroon and white swapped.\n    *  Pixels off by 2\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Two colors (magenta (6) and white (0)).\n    *   Output: Looks like a horizontal flip, AND the last two rows are swapped in positions 1 and 2\n    *  Pixels off by 2\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Two colors (white (0) and maroon (9)).\n    *   Output:  Looks like an anti-diagonal swap.\n    * Pixels off by 4\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Two colors (red (2) and white (0)).\n    *   Output: Looks like a 90deg counter-clockwise rotation.\n    * Pixels off by 4\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
