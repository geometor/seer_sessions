Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis of a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. While the output grid dimensions are correct, the pixel arrangements within the grids are wrong in all test cases. This suggests a more complex transformation is at play, and it's not a simple rotation. The strategy will involve closely re-examining the input-output pairs to identify the *actual* rule governing pixel movement and color preservation. It seems the initial program considered it a rotation, but rotated in the wrong direction, and made errors.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification:** We need to identify if the transformation treats the entire grid as a single object, or if there are sub-objects (e.g., lines, shapes, individual pixels) that are being manipulated independently.
2.  **Relationship Analysis:** We'll focus on how the *positions* of pixels of specific colors change from input to output. Are there consistent patterns in how pixels of a certain color are relocated?
3.  **Rule Refinement:** Based on the identified objects and their movements, we'll formulate a new, more precise natural language program that explains the transformation.
4. Consider x,y coordinates to map input to output, to see if there's some coordinate based rule

**Gather Metrics & Example Analysis:**

I'll analyze each example pair, noting specific pixel movements and discrepancies.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: ed36ccf7
  - objects:
    - description: Individual pixels with distinct color values.
      properties:
        - color: Integer value (0-9) representing the color.
        - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.
  - transformation_type: Coordinate-based mapping.
  - coordinate_mapping:
    - description: The transformation appears to be a reflection across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), which is equivalent to transposing the matrix
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a reflection of the input grid across its main diagonal. In other words, the pixel at input position (row, col) moves to output position (col, row). This is equivalent to a matrix transposition.

It's a matrix transpose.
