facts:
  - description: "Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid."
    type: "general_observation"

  - description: "The input grid can contain multiple colors (represented by integers 0-9), but only one non-zero color is considered the 'target color'."
    type: "input_grid"

  - description: "The target color is the single non-zero color present within the input grid."
    type: "target_color_definition"

  - description: "The output grid is always filled entirely with the target color."
    type: "output_grid"

  - description: "The dimensions of the output grid are related to the occurrences of the target color in the first row (top) and first column (side) of the input grid."
    type: "dimension_relationship"
    details: "The relationship isn't a simple count, but seems to involve a product or combination of the top and side counts."
