facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid contains a single non-zero color, referred to as the "target color".
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always a single row (height 1).
  - observation: |
      The output grid's width is determined by the occurrences of the target color in the first row (top_count) and first column (side_count) of the input grid.
  - relationship: |
      If top_count is 0, the width equals the side_count.
  - relationship: |
      If side_count is 0, the width equals the top_count.
  - relationship: |
     If side_count > 0 and top_count > 0, width equals top_count + side_count + 1
  - relationship: |
      If top_count is 0, width equals the side_count. Example 1: top_count=0, side_count=1, width=2.
  - relationship: |
      If only `top_count` is zero, then `width = side_count` is not correct

  - action: |
      The output grid is filled entirely with the target color.
