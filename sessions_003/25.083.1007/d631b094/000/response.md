Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. The input grids seem to have a single non-zero color, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid contains only the non-zero color from the input, and the size of the output appears to be related to the number of times that non-zero color appears in the input, specifically the number of times along the top and side.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3)
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: variable (smaller than input)
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - type: color
    properties:
      - name: non_zero_color
      - value: integer (not 0)

actions:
  - name: extract_color
    description: Identify the single non-zero color in the input grid.
  - name: count_occurrences
    description: Count the occurrences of the non-zero color on the top and side of input grid.
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid with dimensions based on color counts and fill with extracted color.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains non_zero_color.
  - output_grid contains only non_zero_color.
  - output_grid dimensions are related to the positions of non_zero_color in input_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Target Color:** Find the single non-zero color (pixel value) present in the input grid.
2. **Locate Color positions on top and side:**
    - find instances of the color on the top row.
    - find instances of the color on the leftmost column.
3. **Determine output dimensions**: Determine the number of instances of the color on the top row and left columns
4. **Construct the Output Grid:** Create a new grid. If count from top row is N and count from left is M:
    * If both M and N are zero, do not create any grid
    * if M = 0, the output grid dimensions is  N x N and fill it with the target color.
    * if N = 0, the output grid dimensions is M x M and fill it with the target color.
    * if neither M nor N = 0, the output grid dimension is N x M and fill it with the target color

Essentially, the transformation extracts the non-zero color and uses its counts along the top and left edges of the input grid to define shape of a solid block in the output.
