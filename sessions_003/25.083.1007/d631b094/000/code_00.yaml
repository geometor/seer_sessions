objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3)
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: variable (smaller than input)
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - type: color
    properties:
      - name: non_zero_color
      - value: integer (not 0)

actions:
  - name: extract_color
    description: Identify the single non-zero color in the input grid.
  - name: count_occurrences
    description: Count the occurrences of the non-zero color on the top and side of input grid.
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid with dimensions based on color counts and fill with extracted color.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains non_zero_color.
  - output_grid contains only non_zero_color.
  - output_grid dimensions are related to the positions of non_zero_color in input_grid.
