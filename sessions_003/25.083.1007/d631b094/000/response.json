The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. The input grids seem to have a single non-zero color, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid contains only the non-zero color from the input, and the size of the output appears to be related to the number of times that non-zero color appears in the input, specifically the number of times along the top and side.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If count from top row is N and count from left is M:\n    * If both M and N are zero, do not create any grid\n    * if M = 0, the output grid dimensions is  N x N and fill it with the target color.\n    * if N = 0, the output grid dimensions is M x M and fill it with the target color.\n    * if neither M nor N = 0, the output grid dimension is N x M and fill it with the target color\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the non-zero color and uses its counts along the top and left edges of the input grid to define shape of a solid block in the output.\n"
