            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting Python code were too simplistic. The code rotates the grid 180 degrees and then reverses each row. While this might have coincidentally appeared correct for the *first* example, it's clearly incorrect for the second example, and only partially correct for the first (it gets the shape and colors right, but not all pixel positions). The core issue is that the program describes two separate operations (rotation and row reversal), and does them indepently. The provided examples show that the task requires something else. It's necessary to reverse rows *and* reverse columns, that is, mirror horizontally and vertically. The current strategy does not account for reversing the columns of the grids.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Misunderstanding:** I'll use a simple `tool_code` block to visually inspect the inputs and outputs again, confirming the nature of the errors. I'll confirm the dimensions and basic pixel arrangement to see the differences clearly. This is not strictly about counting errors, it is about *seeing* how the current rule fails.\n2.  **Correct the Rule:** Based on the visual check and the results, I will correct the observation and revise the natural language program to include a description to reverse the columns. The order of rows is reversed, AND the order of columns is reversed. This is equivalent to reversing the entire grid, not rotating it.\n3.  **Prepare for Future Coding:** The YAML and natural language program will reflect this revised understanding, focusing on the idea of reversing both rows *and* columns. This will provide the correct context for the coder in the next stage.\n\n**Metrics and Verification (using tool_code):**\n\n"
