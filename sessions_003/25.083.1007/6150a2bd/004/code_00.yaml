observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: variable number
      - columns: variable number
      - elements: integers representing colors (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: same as input_grid
      - columns: same as input_grid
      - elements: integers representing colors (0-9), a rearrangement of input_grid elements

actions:
  - description: The order of rows in the input grid is reversed.
  - description: The order of columns (elements within each row) in the input grid is reversed.
  - description: The combined effect of reversing rows and columns produces the output grid.
