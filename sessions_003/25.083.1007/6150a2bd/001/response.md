The transformation rule appears to be a rotation of the input matrix by 180 degrees followed by reversing the array values along the diagonal of the matrix.
In more detail:

1.  The input grid is rotated 180 degrees clockwise.
2.  The new matrix values are mirrored, such that the row and column are swapped.
