objects:
  - description: Non-zero colored regions.
    properties:
      - connectedness: 4-connected (up, down, left, right neighbors).
      - color:  A single digit from 1 to 9.
      - separation:  Objects are distinct if they are not 4-connected or have different colors.

actions:
  - count: Determine the number of distinct objects.
    method: Iterate through each pixel, and if it hasn't been visited and is not background (0), start a 4-connected Depth-First Search (DFS) to mark all connected pixels of the same color, incrementing the count for each new object found.
