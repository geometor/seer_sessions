Create an empty \"visited\" set to track pixels that have been processed.\n2.  **Iterate:** Loop through each pixel in the input grid.\n3.  **Check Visited and Zero:** For the current pixel:\n    *   If the pixel has already been visited, skip to the next pixel.\n    *   If the pixel's value is 0 (white/background), skip to the next pixel.\n4.  **Object Found:** If the pixel is not visited and not zero, increment the object count.\n5.  **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Perform a DFS starting from the current pixel:\n    *   Mark the current pixel as visited.\n    *   Recursively visit all 8-connected neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).\n    *   During the DFS, *only* visit neighbors that have the *same* color as the starting pixel and have not been visited.\n6.  **Continue Iteration:** After the DFS completes (meaning one entire connected object has been explored), continue the outer loop iteration from step 2.\n7.  **Output:** After iterating through all pixels, output the final object count. This count represents the number of distinct, non-zero, connected regions in the grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_distinct_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Counts distinct objects in the grid.\"\"\"\n    visited = set()\n    count = 0\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0])\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                dfs(r + dr, c + dc, color)\n\n\n    for r in range(len(grid)):\n        for c in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if (r,c) not in visited and grid[r,c]!=0:\n                count += 1\n                dfs(r,c, grid[r,c])\n    return count\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Convert input_grid to numpy array\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n\n    # Count distinct objects using the helper function\n    object_count = count_distinct_objects(grid)\n\n    return object_count\n```"
