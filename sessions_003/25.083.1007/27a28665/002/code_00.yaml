  - object_definition:
      - "An object is a contiguous region of pixels of the *same* color."
      - "Pixels are considered contiguous if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally."
      - "Disconnected regions of the same color are considered distinct objects."
  - input_grid_size: 3x3
  - output_type: integer
  - output_description: "The total number of distinct objects in the input grid."
  - example_1:
      - input_objects: 1 (one connected gray region)
      - output: 1
      - result: correct
  - example_2:
      - input_objects: 2 (two disconnected azure regions)
      - output: 2
      - result: incorrect (predicted 1)

      - input_objects: 3 (1: two connected blue cells and one separate blue cell. )
      - output: 3
      - result: incorrect (predicted 1)
  - example_5:
      - input_objects: 3 (two connected azure cells, and another separate azure cell)
