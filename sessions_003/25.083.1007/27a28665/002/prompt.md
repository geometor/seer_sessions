1.  **Identify Objects:** The input is a 3x3 grid. Consider contiguous blocks of the *same* color as separate objects. Diagonally connected is considered contiguos, and a single non-zero cell is contiguous to itself.
2.  **Count Objects:** count how many discrete objects are present in the input.
3. **Output count:** output the single integer count of the objects.
