"""
1.  **Identify Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Define Objects:**  An object is defined as a group of one or more connected pixels of the *same* color.
    *   Pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    *   Pixels of different colors are *never* considered part of the same object, even if adjacent.
    *   Two groups of pixels with the same color that are *not* connected are considered separate objects.
3.  **Count Objects:** Count the number of distinct objects in the grid, following the definition above.
4.  **Output Count:** Output the integer count representing the total number of objects found.
