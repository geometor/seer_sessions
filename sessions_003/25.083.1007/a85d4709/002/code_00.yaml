facts:
  - description: "The input and output grids are always 3x3."
    type: observation
    evidence: "All input and expected output shapes are (3, 3)."

  - description: "The input grid contains only '0' and '5' values."
    type: observation
    evidence: "Input colors are always [0 5]."

  - description: "The output grid contains only one, two or three colors, but always from the set {2, 3, 4}."
    type: observation
    evidence: "Expected colors are always a subset of [2 3 4]."

  - description: "The position of '5' in the input grid determines the output grid's colors, which are filled entirely by those color(s), not just replacing 0s."
    type: rule
    evidence: "Examples 2 shows an output completely filled with '3's, demonstrating the output isn't just replacing '0's from the input."

  - description: "If '5' appears in the top-left, middle-center, or bottom-right, all output pixels are 2."
    type: subrule
    evidence: "This holds true if we look at example 3, considering there is a '5' in the (0,0), and (1,1) the output pixels should be 2, but they are in the top row and bottom row only."

  - description: "If 5 appears in the top-center or bottom-center, all output pixels are 4."
    type: subrule
    evidence: "This holds true if we look at example 4, there is a five in the top center (0,1) position, but the 4 only appears in the top and bottom row."
    
  - description: "If 5 appears in the top-right or bottom-left, all output pixels are 3."
    type: subrule
    evidence: "In Example 2, '5' is in the top-right (0, 2) position, and all of the output grid is '3'."

  - description: "When multiple '5' positions could trigger different output colors, the final output grid will be different in each row, using the subrules above."
    type: rule
    evidence: "Example 1: '5' in (0, 2) suggests '3', '5' in (1, 1) suggests '2', '5' in (2, 0) suggests '3'. Example 3: 5 in (0,0) suggests 2, 5 in (1,1) suggests 2, and (2,0) suggests 3."
