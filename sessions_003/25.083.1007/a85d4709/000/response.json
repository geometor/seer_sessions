The key seems to lie in the position of the digit '5' (gray) within the input grid and a corresponding color change in the output. The '0' (white) values in the input are replaced based on the location of the '5'.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Further information required to be conclusive here.\n\n3.  **Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions (3x3) where the identified transformation rule is applied. Replace all '0' values in the input with the determined output value, based on the above rule.  The '5' values themselves seem to be discarded and replaced with the appropriate number.\n\nIn summary the output replaces all cells with a single digit based upon where 5's are located on the input.\n"
