            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code and devise a plan to improve the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very specific interpretation of the first training example, focusing solely on the position of the '5's and their direct mapping to output row colors. This approach clearly doesn't generalize well, as evidenced by the mismatches in examples 1, 2, and 3. The code correctly handles example 4, which happens to fit the initial, overly specific rule.\n\nThe core issue is that the initial program overfitted to the first example.  It assumed a one-to-one correspondence between *specific* '5' positions and output row colors, without considering a more general rule. We need to shift from *position-specific* rules to a *row-specific* rule, considering the presence and column index of '5' within each row independently.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* training examples, focusing on the relationship between the presence of '5' in *each row* of the input and the color of the *corresponding row* in the output.\n2. **Identify Row-Specific Rules:**  Determine a rule for each row (1, 2, and 3) that dictates the output row's color based on the presence and/or column index of '5' in the corresponding input row.\n3. **Refine Natural Language Program:**  Rewrite the natural language program to reflect these row-specific rules.\n4. **Revise Code:** Update the code to implement the refined program.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\nI don't need to use code execution. It can be done by observation:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True (but misapplied)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 3\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: False (uses colors 2 and 3, expected only 3)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: False (uses colors 2 and 3, expected 2 and 4)\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

The color of each output row depends *only* on the contents of the *corresponding* input row. Within each row, the column index of the *first* '5' (if any) determines the output color, following a specific mapping for each row.\n"
