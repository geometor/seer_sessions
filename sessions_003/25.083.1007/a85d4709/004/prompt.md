"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on the position of '5's in the input. The output grid is filled row by row,
with each row's color determined by the presence of a '5' in specific positions within the input grid.

- Row 1: If '5' is at (0,0), the row is filled with '2'. If '5' is at (0,1), the row is filled with '4'. If '5' is at (0,2), the row is filled with '3'.
- Row 2: If '5' is at (1,1), the row is filled with '2'. If '5' is at (1,2), the row is filled with '3'.
- Row 3: If '5' is at (2,0), the row is filled with '3'. If '5' is at (2,1), the row is filled with '4'. If '5' is at (2,2), the row is filled with '2'.
