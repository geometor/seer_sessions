Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on the position of '5's in the input.
'0' values are replaced according to these rules:
- If '5' is in the top-left (0,0), middle-center (1,1) , or bottom-right(2,2) position, all '0's become '2's.
- If '5' is in the top-center (0,1) or bottom-center (2,1), position, all '0' in the input become '4's.
- If '5' is in the top-right (0,2) or bottom-left (2,0) position, all '0's become '3's.
