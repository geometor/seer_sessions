The inputs and outputs contain digits representing colors. The primary colors involved seem to be blue (1) and red (2), along with white/background (0). The transformation appears to involve a vertical shift or rearrangement of rows. The colored rows \"move down\" one row each step.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The row at index `i` of the input grid should map to row index `(i + 1) % 3` of the output grid. Specifically:\n    -   Input row 0 becomes output row 1.\n    -   Input row 1 becomes output row 2.\n    -   Input row 2 becomes output row 0.\n3. **Compose output:** reassemble shifted rows into the final output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation is a downward cyclic shift of rows by one position within the 3x3 grid.\n"
