The transformation seems to involve a specific pattern of filling cells with colors from other cells, suggesting a propagation or expansion of color values. There's a clear vertical and horizontal directionality to how colors change, and non-zero values other than specific seed values appear important.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The right most color has been copied to all of the other non-zero color.\n4. **Copy down**: Copy all rows down to create duplicates of the seed color in the next row(s) until the end of the grid.\n\nIn essence, the rightmost non-zero color in each row is setting colors to the left, then the full row is propagated downwards, filling the output grid below that row with the color, and stopping with the grid boundary.\n"
