facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      There are single non-zero color values in each row and column.
  - observation: |
     In the output, the final column of the grid is a seed for creating
     copies of the color values in previous columns of its row, creating vertical lines downwards.
  - observation: |
      The original non-zero color pixels from the input are preserved in the output.
  - action: |
     Colors from the right most non-zero pixel in a row in the input are propagating to cells to the left.
  - action: |
      Colors propagate downwards.
