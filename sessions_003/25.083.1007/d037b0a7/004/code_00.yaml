facts:
  - type: observation
    description: "Each row has a 'seed' pixel, which is the rightmost non-zero pixel in the input grid."
  - type: observation
    description: "If a row has a seed, all non-zero pixels to the left of the seed are changed to the seed's color (horizontal fill)."
  - type: observation
    description: "After horizontal filling, the entire row containing a seed is propagated downwards."
  - type: observation
    description:  "During downward propagation, non-zero pixels in subsequent rows are replaced by corresponding pixels from the propagating row, preserving the zeros in the lower rows."
  - type: inference
    description: "Rows without a seed in the input do not propagate downwards."
