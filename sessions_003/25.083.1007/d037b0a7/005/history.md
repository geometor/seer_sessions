1.  **Seed Identification:** For each row in the input grid, find the rightmost non-zero pixel. This pixel's color is the "seed" color for that row. If a row has no non-zero pixels, it is skipped for horizontal and vertical filling.

2.  **Horizontal Filling:** For each row, if a seed color exists, iterate from the seed position *leftwards*.  Replace any non-zero pixel colors to the left of the seed with the seed color.

3.  **Vertical Filling:** Starting from the top row, propagate each filled row (rows where a seed color exists) downwards. For each subsequent row, replace any *non-zero* color with the color from the same column in the source row (filled row above). Stop when the bottom of the grid is reached.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too narrowly focused on the first training example. The code failed to generalize to the other examples because it incorrectly implemented the vertical filling. It appears the vertical filling should only copy the _entire_ row downwards if the top row had a seed, and then only replacing the non-zero values in the subsequent rows with the corresponding values from the "seeded" row. The current implementation has some errors related to this logic.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Vertical Filling:** Carefully analyze how the colors propagate downwards in *all* examples. The key is to understand the condition that triggers vertical propagation and which values are copied. It's not just about replacing non-zero values; it's about replicating the entire row (after horizontal filling) downwards, but respecting existing zero values.
2.  **Correct Indexing and Propagation:** Make sure the propagation happens according to example, not based just on the presence of a seed.
3. **Refine Natural Language program:** update and reword the natural language program based on all example and test outputs.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Seed Identification:** For each row in the *input* grid, identify the rightmost non-zero pixel. This is the "seed" pixel for that row, and its color is the "seed color". If a row contains no non-zero pixels, it has no seed and is skipped in subsequent steps.

2.  **Horizontal Filling:** For each row that *has* a seed:
    *   Iterate from the seed pixel's position *leftwards*.
    *   If a pixel to the left of the seed is non-zero, change its color to the seed color.

3.  **Vertical Propagation:** After performing the horizontal fill on all rows, propagate downwards:
    *    Iterate through each row, starting from the top.
    *    For each row i, if the row in the *original input* had a seed (rightmost non-zero), copy its (horizontally filled) values to all subsequent rows. When copying, replace only the non-zero values.
    * if the row in the original input had no seed, skip it.
