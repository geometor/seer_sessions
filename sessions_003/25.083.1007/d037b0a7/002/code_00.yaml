facts:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
  - object: cell
    description: An individual element within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: An integer representing the color of the cell (0-9).
      - row_index: The row index of the cell.
      - col_index: The column index of the cell.
  - action: identify_seed
    description: Find the rightmost non-zero color in a row.
    input: A row (1D array) from the grid.
    output: The color value of the rightmost non-zero cell, or None if the row has no non-zero values.
  - action: horizontal_fill
    description: Set the color of all non-zero pixels to the left of the seed in a row to the seed color.
    input: row, seed_color, seed_col
    output: modified row
  - action: vertical_fill
    description: Propagate the horizontally filled row downwards, replacing non-zero cells in subsequent rows.
    input: current_row_index, grid
    output: modified grid
  - observation: propagation_limit
    description: vertical propagation stops at the bottom boundary of the grid and doesn't replace zeros.
