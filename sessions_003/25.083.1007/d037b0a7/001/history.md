Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a specific pattern of filling cells with colors from other cells, suggesting a propagation or expansion of color values. There's a clear vertical and horizontal directionality to how colors change, and non-zero values other than specific seed values appear important.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      There are single non-zero color values in each row and column.
  - observation: |
     In the output, the final column of the grid is a seed for creating
     copies of the color values in previous columns of its row, creating vertical lines downwards.
  - observation: |
      The original non-zero color pixels from the input are preserved in the output.
  - action: |
     Colors from the right most non-zero pixel in a row in the input are propagating to cells to the left.
  - action: |
      Colors propagate downwards.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with an output grid that is a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Seed:** In each row of the output, take the rightmost non-zero color and proceed to the next step
3. **Propagation**: For each row in the output grid, iterate from right to left:
   3a. The right most color has been copied to all of the other non-zero color.
4. **Copy down**: Copy all rows down to create duplicates of the seed color in the next row(s) until the end of the grid.

In essence, the rightmost non-zero color in each row is setting colors to the left, then the full row is propagated downwards, filling the output grid below that row with the color, and stopping with the grid boundary.
