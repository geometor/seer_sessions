objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - name: cells
        type: integer (0-9)
        description: Represents colors. 0 is background.
      - name: rows
        type: list of cells
      - name: seed_pixel
        type: cell
        description: The rightmost non-zero pixel in a row.
      - name: seed_color
        type: integer
        description: "The color value of the seed pixel"

actions:
  - name: horizontal_fill
    description: "Fill non-zero pixels to the left of the seed pixel with the seed color."
    input: row, seed_pixel
    output: modified row
  - name: vertical_propagation
    description: "Copy horizontally-filled rows downwards, replacing non-zero pixels."
    input: grid, seeded_rows
    output: transformed grid

observations:
    - horizontal_fill_extends_to_all_non_zero: "the horizontal fill must continue until the edge or a zero value"
    - vertical_copy_uses_filled_row: "copy values from the *horizontally filled* output row"
    - vertical_propagation_all_rows: "apply vertical propagation to *all rows* below a seeded row, not just the next one"
