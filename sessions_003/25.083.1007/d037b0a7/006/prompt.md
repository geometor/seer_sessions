1.  **Seed Identification:** For each row in the *input* grid, identify the rightmost non-zero pixel. This is the "seed" pixel for that row, and its color is the "seed color". If a row contains no non-zero pixels, it has no seed and is skipped in subsequent steps.

2.  **Horizontal Filling:** For each row that *has* a seed:
    *   Iterate from the seed pixel's position *leftwards*.
    *   If a pixel to the left of the seed is non-zero, change its color to the seed color.

3.  **Vertical Propagation:** After performing the horizontal fill on all rows, propagate downwards:
    *    Iterate through each row, starting from the top.
    *    For each row i, if the row in the *original input* had a seed (rightmost non-zero), copy its (horizontally filled) values to all subsequent rows. When copying, replace only the non-zero values.
    * if the row in the original input had no seed, skip it.
