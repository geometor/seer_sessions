The transformation seems to involve replicating certain elements and filling areas. The top-right element of input seems to define a fill color for the output grid. The structure in the input grid using 0 (white) as a background is \"L\" shaped, and that shape is maintained and/or extended in some way in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Fill with extension color: All newly filled cells and the original top-right cell use the top-right cell's input color\n5. Fill the L connection: fill the \"gap\" created from the extension by using the L corner color.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies an \"L\" shape, extends it to form a rectangle, filling the newly occupied space with a color determined by the input's top-right cell, and \"connecting\" the gap created by the \"L\" extension with the corner color.\n"
