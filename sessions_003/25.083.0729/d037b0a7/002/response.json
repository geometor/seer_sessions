However, the results show it's failing in several ways:\n\n1.  **Incorrect \"L\" detection:** It seems to be misinterpreting the \"L\" shape or its orientation in some cases. It is not handling diagonal \"L\" correctly.\n2.  **Incorrect Extension:** The extension logic is flawed. It doesn't always fill the rectangle correctly, especially when the \"L\" isn't in a specific orientation (as in Example 3).\n3. **Incorrect Top-Right color.** Example 1 and 2 failing because of top-right.\n4. Example 3 shows us we need to account for an \"L\" forming at the top or left edge.\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Refine \"L\" detection:** Improve the `find_l_shape` function to correctly identify the corner and orientation of the \"L\", including diagonal \"L\".\n2.  **Correct the extension logic:** Rewrite the `transform` function to properly extend the \"L\" into a rectangle based on the identified corner and orientation, filling with the top right color.\n3.  **Handle edge cases:** Ensure the code works correctly when the \"L\" is at the edges of the grid.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's use code execution to get more precise information about the mismatches.\n\n"
