            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very limited understanding, assuming the top-left corner of the *expected* output dictates the fill color for the entire output grid. The results clearly show this is incorrect for all three examples. The `size_correct`, `color_palette_correct`, and `correct_pixel_counts` are all `False`, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** We need to understand *why* the current logic fails. We'll examine the input and expected output of *each* example, not just relying on automated comparisons.\n\n2.  **Identify Correct Rule:** The goal is to find a consistent rule that explains how *all* input grids transform into their corresponding output grids.\n\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on a deeper understanding, we'll rewrite the natural language program to reflect the true transformation.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Observations (using code execution when necessary):**\n\nI don't need to execute the code again because provided outputs already include data of results after the code has already been executed on the examples. I need to use this data to understand properties, relationships, and what is actually happening in the data.\n\nLet's analyze each example manually by observing the inputs and expected output:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    "
