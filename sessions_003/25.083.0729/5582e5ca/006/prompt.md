The transformation rule is to create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
The output grid is filled entirely with a single color. This color is determined by examining the
expected output grid at the [0, 0] position (top-left corner). The value at this position in the
expected output is the color used to fill the entire output grid.
