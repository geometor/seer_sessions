## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```


**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```


**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```


**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, likely representing colored pixels.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same in each example.
*   The output grid in each example consists of a single, repeated digit. This suggests a kind of "dominant color" selection or a reduction to a single color.
*   The repeated digit in the output grid seems to be present in original input grid.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (rows x columns)
      - elements: single digits (0-9), representing colors

actions:
  - type: select_dominant_element
    description: Determines a single digit to be used for the entire output grid.
    parameters:
      - selection_criteria: "unknown, but must exist in the input"

  - type: create_output_grid
    description: Generates a new grid with the same dimensions as the input.
    parameters:
      - fill_value: The selected dominant element from the selection_criteria of action type 'select_dominant_element'

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains a set of digits.
  - output_grid: Contains only one repeating digit, taken from input_grid, same dimension as input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input grid.
2.  **Select** the last digit of first row in the input grid.
3.  **Create** a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  **Fill** the new grid entirely with the selected digit.
