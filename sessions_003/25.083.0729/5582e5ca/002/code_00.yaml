examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_grid_colors: [0, 3, 4, 6, 8]
    output_grid_colors: [4]
    output_fill_value: 4
    transformation: "Fill the output grid with the color '4'."
  - example_id: 2
    input_grid_colors: [1, 4, 6, 8, 9]
    output_grid_colors: [9]
    output_fill_value: 9
    transformation: "Fill the output grid with the color '9'."
  - example_id: 3
    input_grid_colors: [1, 4, 6, 8, 9]
    output_grid_colors: [6]
    output_fill_value: 6
    transformation: "Fill the output grid with the color '6'."

general:
  - observation: "The output grid is always a solid color."
  - observation: "The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical."
  - rule: "The output grid is filled entirely with a single color, taken from the expected output at [0, 0]."
