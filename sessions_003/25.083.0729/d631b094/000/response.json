The output grids seem to be significantly smaller than the input grids and appear to be related to non-zero values in the inputs. There's a sense of aggregation or summarization of the input data. It looks like we are isolating the non-zero color and its occurrences within the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
