Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule and provide the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The output grids seem to be significantly smaller than the input grids and appear to be related to non-zero values in the inputs. There's a sense of aggregation or summarization of the input data. It looks like we are isolating the non-zero color and its occurrences within the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are 3x3. Output grids vary in size (1x2, 1x3, 1x1, 1x4).
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - values: Integers 0-9
          - size: 3x3
      - name: output_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - values: Integers 0-9
          - size: Variable, smaller than input_grid
  - relationships:
      - type: input_to_output
        description: Output grid is derived from the input grid.
  - actions:
      - type: extract_non_zero
        description: Non-zero values from the input grid seem to determine the output grid's content.
      - type: count_occurrences
        description: The number of times each non-zero number presents in the input grid may correspond to the number of its appearances in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the non-zero value in the input grid.
2.  **Count** the number of times this non-zero value appears in the input grid.
3.  **Create** the output grid. It's dimensions is 1 x count.
4. **Populate** output grid with a value, equal to the non-zero value identified before, repeating this number of times.

Essentially the input's non-zero value becomes the output grid's value, repeated for its count in input.
