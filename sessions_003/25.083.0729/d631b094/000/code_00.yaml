facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are 3x3. Output grids vary in size (1x2, 1x3, 1x1, 1x4).
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - values: Integers 0-9
          - size: 3x3
      - name: output_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - values: Integers 0-9
          - size: Variable, smaller than input_grid
  - relationships:
      - type: input_to_output
        description: Output grid is derived from the input grid.
  - actions:
      - type: extract_non_zero
        description: Non-zero values from the input grid seem to determine the output grid's content.
      - type: count_occurrences
        description: The number of times each non-zero number presents in the input grid may correspond to the number of its appearances in the output grid.
