            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed adjustments to the natural language program and code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code performs a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation and then flips the grid vertically. This approach correctly transforms some aspects of the input but fails to accurately reproduce the expected outputs in both examples. The pixel-level mismatches (pixels_off) and the visual differences in the transformed images indicate that the transformation rule isn't just a simple rotation and flip. We need to analyze the spatial relationships and color changes more closely to identify the precise rule.\n\nThe main issue is that the previous code *does not* perform the rotation and inversion of rows correctly.\n\nStrategy is to focus on object transformation and position changes.\nThe outputs suggest a rotation, but not a typical matrix rotation. It's more like \"rotating the *idea*\" or content rather than the literal grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Manual Analysis & Conceptual Understanding)**\n\nI can't use code execution since I do not have interactive access to prior tools or outputs. I need to reason the transformation visually.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    "
