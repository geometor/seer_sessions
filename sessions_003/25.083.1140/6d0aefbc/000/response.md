Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task and provide my observations. Here's my breakdown of the example input-output pairs:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The output grid appears to be a "doubled" or "mirrored" version of the input grid, with each column in the input grid being repeated once, resulting in an output grid with twice the number of columns. The values in each original column from the input are duplicated in the corresponding new columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3)
        elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x6)
        elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    relationships:
      - output_grid is derived from input_grid
      - output_grid has twice the number of columns as input_grid

actions:
  - type: duplication
    description: Each column in the input_grid is duplicated.
    parameters:
      - source: input_grid column
      - destination: output_grid columns (original and adjacent)
    result: The original column is copied and placed next to the copy.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the input grid:** Determine the dimensions (rows and columns) of the input grid.
2.  **Create the output grid:** Create a new grid with the same number of rows as the input grid but twice the number of columns.
3.  **Iterate over input columns:** For each column in the input grid:
    *   Copy the entire column.
    *   Paste the copied column into the output grid at the corresponding position (e.g. column 0 from source to column 0 in destination, then column 1 in destination).
    *   Paste the same, copied column into output grid adjacent to the previous position (e.g., column 1 is repeated).
4.  **Output the Result.** return the new (output) grid.
