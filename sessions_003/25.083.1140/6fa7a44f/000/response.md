Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The transformation seems to involve a specific type of repetition or mirroring of the input grid to create the output grid. The output grid is always larger and appears symmetrical along a horizontal axis. The transformation changes size but never changes color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: "grid"
    description: "2D array of integers (0-9)"
    roles: ["input", "output"]

  - property: "size"
    description: "Dimensions of the grid (rows x columns)"
    related_to: "grid"

  - property: "color"
    description: "The value representing the color of the cell"
    related_to: "grid"

  - observation: "size_change"
    description: "Output grid is larger than the input grid."

  - observation: "symmetry"
    description: "Output grid shows horizontal symmetry, potentially mirroring."
    related_to: ["size_change","repetition"]

  - observation: "repetition"
    description: "rows of the input grid appear to be repeated in a pattern."
    related_to: ["symmetry"]
  - action: "reverse_rows_and_append"
    description: "The order of input rows is reversed and added below the original grid."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Receive** the input grid.
2.  **Reverse** the order of the rows of the input grid, this will create a mirrored grid
3.  **Concatenate** the original input and mirrored grid vertically, combining to create the output grid.
