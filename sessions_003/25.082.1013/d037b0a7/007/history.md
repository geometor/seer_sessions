"""
1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:**  Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0.

2.  **Conditional Horizontal Propagation (Leftward):**
    *   For each non-zero pixel, examine the pixels to its *left* in the same row.
    *   If a pixel to the left has a value of 0, change that pixel's value to match the non-zero pixel.
    *   Stop this leftward propagation when either the left edge of the grid is reached or a non-zero pixel is encountered.

3.  **Conditional Vertical Propagation (Downward):**
    *  For each pixel in the *output* grid:
    * If a pixel is not zero valued, fill down with that value until the end of the column.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial program overgeneralized from the first example. It correctly identified the leftward and downward propagation but applied the leftward fill too aggressively.  The first example, where all non-zero values are on the diagonal, misled the program into filling the *entire* grid with the last non-zero value encountered (6, in that case). Example 2 shows this clearly, where the '2' propagates too far to the left. Example 3 happens to work correctly because the propagation and required fills align, masking the underlying error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze how the non-zero values propagate in *each* example, focusing on *where* the propagation stops.
2.  **Refine Propagation Rules:** The leftward propagation should stop at the *first* 0 it encounters. The critical error is continuing horizontal fill *past* zeros. The vertical fill seems correct.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Clarify the stopping condition for horizontal propagation.
4. Test and Refactor

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification where needed):**

I can observe this directly, no code execution needed to make these simple calculations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3, three non-zero pixels (6, 4, 3).
    *   Output (Incorrect): All pixels become 6.
    *   Error: Over-propagation of '6' horizontally and vertically.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x3, three non-zero pixels (2, 7, 8).
    *   Output (Incorrect): '2' propagates one step too far left.
    *   Error: Incorrect horizontal propagation of '2'.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 3x3, two non-zero pixels (4, 2).
    *   Output (Correct):  Propagation aligns with the expected output.
    *   Note: This example masks the error in the horizontal propagation rule.

**YAML Fact Representation:**

```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid with values other than 0.

2.  **Conditional Horizontal Propagation (Rightward):**
    *   Iterate through the grid from left to right *and* top to bottom.
      * if the current value is not 0:
         * save value
      * if the current value *is* 0:
         * if there is a saved value, set this value to the saved value

3.  **Conditional Vertical Propagation (Downward):**
      - Iterate through the grid from top to bottom and left to right.
      - if the current value is not 0:
        - save the value
      - if the current value *is* 0:
        - if there is a saved value, set this value to the saved value
