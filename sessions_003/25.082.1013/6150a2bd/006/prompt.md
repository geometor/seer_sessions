The transformation takes each column of the input grid and uses it to create rows in the output grid, starting with the last row.  Specifically:

1.  The first column of the input grid becomes the *last* row of the output grid.
2.  The second column of the input grid becomes the *second-to-last* row of the output grid.
3.  The third column of the input grid becomes the *first* row of the output grid.
4.  This pattern continues for any number of columns: the *nth* column in the input becomes the *n*th to last row in the output.  The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
