Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid.\n*   Each grid consists of single-digit integers (0-9), which can be interpreted as colors.\n*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical within each pair, but they vary between example pairs (3x3 in `train_1`, and 3x3 in `train_2`).\n*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the input grid's elements to produce the output grid. It looks like a rotation and mirroring of some kind, combined.\n*\t  The input and output are both 3x3 grids.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
