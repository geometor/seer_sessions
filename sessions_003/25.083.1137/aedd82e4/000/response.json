The transformation seems to focus on specific digits/colors, particularly '2' (red) and '0' (white), and introduces '1' (blue) in the output. The position and arrangement of '2's seem crucial. Specifically, the transformation appears to be related to the lower-rightmost '2' in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
