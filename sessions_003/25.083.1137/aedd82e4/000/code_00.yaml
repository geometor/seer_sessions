facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The digit '2' (red) is prevalent in the input.
  - observation: The digit '0' (white) is also common in both input and output.
  - observation: The digit '1' (blue) appears only in the output.
  - observation: The digit '1' (blue) replaces a '2' or a '0'
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
