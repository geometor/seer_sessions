observations:
  - input_grid_size: Matches output grid size in all examples.
  - input_color_dominance: '0' (white) is the dominant color in all input grids.
  - input_trigger_color: '2' (red) appears to be the trigger for transformation.
  - output_color_variety: Output grids contain a greater variety of colors compared to the input.
  - spatial_relationship: The position of '2' in the input doesn't directly correspond to the same position of any specific color in the output, however they are mirrored on x or y axis.
  - output_values: "3", "6", "7" and "8" are the output values that correspond to the input value "2".
  - mirroring: |
    if "2" is at input[x][y] then the replacement values occur at output[x][y] when they are
    mirrored along an axis, for example:
    train_1, y axis mirroring - 
    - input[1][1] = "2", output[1][1] = "3"
    - input[1][1] = "2", output[1][3] = "6"
    train_1, x axis mirroring -
    - input[1][1] = "2", output[0][1] = "8"
    - input[1][1] = "2", output[3][1] = "7"
    train_2, y axis mirroring - 
    - input[2][4] = "2", output[2][3] = "3"
    train_3, x axis mirroring -
    - input[0][2] = "2", output[1][2] = "8"
    - input[0][2] = "2", output[1][4] = "7"
    train_4, y axis mirroring -
    - input[1][3] = "2", output[0][2] = "3"
    - input[1][3] = "2", output[0][4] = "6"
    train_4, x axis mirroring -
    - input[1][3] = "2", output[2][2] = "8"
    - input[1][3] = "2", output[2][4] = "7"
