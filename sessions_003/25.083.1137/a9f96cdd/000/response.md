Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The most prominent feature is the presence of the digit '2' (red) in the input grids, and its apparent replacement or influence on the output grids with various other digits/colors. The positions of '2's in the inputs don't directly correlate to output. Instead there is some mirroring of the values across axis. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic or direct color substitution. It appears that the location of 2s trigger a specific, complex placement of other colors.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid_size: Matches output grid size in all examples.
  - input_color_dominance: '0' (white) is the dominant color in all input grids.
  - input_trigger_color: '2' (red) appears to be the trigger for transformation.
  - output_color_variety: Output grids contain a greater variety of colors compared to the input.
  - spatial_relationship: The position of '2' in the input doesn't directly correspond to the same position of any specific color in the output, however they are mirrored on x or y axis.
  - output_values: "3", "6", "7" and "8" are the output values that correspond to the input value "2".
  - mirroring: |
    if "2" is at input[x][y] then the replacement values occur at output[x][y] when they are
    mirrored along an axis, for example:
    train_1, y axis mirroring - 
    - input[1][1] = "2", output[1][1] = "3"
    - input[1][1] = "2", output[1][3] = "6"
    train_1, x axis mirroring -
    - input[1][1] = "2", output[0][1] = "8"
    - input[1][1] = "2", output[3][1] = "7"
    train_2, y axis mirroring - 
    - input[2][4] = "2", output[2][3] = "3"
    train_3, x axis mirroring -
    - input[0][2] = "2", output[1][2] = "8"
    - input[0][2] = "2", output[1][4] = "7"
    train_4, y axis mirroring -
    - input[1][3] = "2", output[0][2] = "3"
    - input[1][3] = "2", output[0][4] = "6"
    train_4, x axis mirroring -
    - input[1][3] = "2", output[2][2] = "8"
    - input[1][3] = "2", output[2][4] = "7"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scan the input grid:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.

2.  **Identify Trigger:** If a cell's value is '2' (red), record its x,y coordinates.

3.  **Mirror positions:**
    *   find x and y mirroring position.

4. **Apply Transformation based on mirroring**: There are two cases

    *  y axis mirroring:
    - find mirrored position by moving across the center of the y axis
    - at mirrored y position 1 set to output "3"
    - at mirrored y position 2 set to output "6"
    *   x axis mirroring:
    - find mirrored position by moving across the center of the x axis
    - at mirrored x position 1 set to output "8"
    - at mirrored x position 2 set to output "7"

5.  **Default:** If a cell's value is not '2', copy its value directly to the corresponding cell in the output grid.

6.  **Construct Output:** Build the output grid based on steps 3, 4, and 5.
