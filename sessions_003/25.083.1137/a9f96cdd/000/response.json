The most prominent feature is the presence of the digit '2' (red) in the input grids, and its apparent replacement or influence on the output grids with various other digits/colors. The positions of '2's in the inputs don't directly correlate to output. Instead there is some mirroring of the values across axis. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic or direct color substitution. It appears that the location of 2s trigger a specific, complex placement of other colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
