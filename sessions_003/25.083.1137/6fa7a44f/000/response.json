Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The core elements are 2D grids of varying sizes, composed of single-digit integers (0-9), which represent colors.\n*   **Repetition:** There's a clear pattern of repetition in the output grids.\n*   **Symmetry:** The output grids appear to have a symmetrical structure, constructed by repeating and possibly inverting the input grid.\n*   **No object manipulation:** There's no apparent movement, rotation, or color change of individual elements within the grid. The transformation seems to operate on the grid as a whole.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
