Okay, I'm ready to analyze these examples and determine the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The core elements are 2D grids of varying sizes, composed of single-digit integers (0-9), which represent colors.
*   **Repetition:** There's a clear pattern of repetition in the output grids.
*   **Symmetry:** The output grids appear to have a symmetrical structure, constructed by repeating and possibly inverting the input grid.
*   **No object manipulation:** There's no apparent movement, rotation, or color change of individual elements within the grid. The transformation seems to operate on the grid as a whole.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - width: integer (number of columns)
      - height: integer (number of rows)
      - cells: 2D array of integers (0-9)
    relationships:
      - input_to_output: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.

actions:
  - name: repeat_and_invert
    description: >
      The input grid is repeated and inverted to construct the output grid.
      Specifically, the input is repeated once, inverted vertically, and then repeated again at the very beginning.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy:** Take the input grid and copy it.
2.  **Reverse:** Reverse the order rows on the copy.
3.  **Combine:** Duplicate original grid and the copy. First the original grid, next copy, and place the reversed version on top of both.
