            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code's logic is too simplistic. It removes a digit only if *both* its immediate neighbors are zero. The test results show this isn't the correct rule.  The expected outputs often remove *runs* of a non-zero digit when surrounded by zeros, not just single instances. The strategy needs to shift from checking immediate neighbors to identifying \"runs\" (contiguous sequences) of non-zero digits bordered by zeros.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Identify Runs:** Instead of individual elements, the code should detect contiguous sequences of the same non-zero digit.\n2. **Boundary Check:** Determine if a run is \"bounded\" by zeros on both the left and right *within the entire input*.\n3. **Conditional Removal:** Remove the entire run if it's bounded by zeros.\n4. use python to develop precise details on the boundaries of runs\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nI will now use a code block to extract more insights of where the run boundaries are by examining each of the training examples.\n\n"
