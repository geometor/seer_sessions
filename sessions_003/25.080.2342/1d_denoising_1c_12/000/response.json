The primary operation seems to be removing certain pixels of a specific color based on their position and the presence of other pixels of the same color. It appears that the transformation focuses on retaining a contiguous block of the target color while eliminating isolated pixels or smaller groups of that color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"

If a pixel matches the target color, and is not within the largest contiguous block identified, change the color to black (0).\n4. **Preserve Contiguous Block:** If within the contiguous block, retain the value (color)\n5. **Preserve All 0s:** If the color is 0, retain it.\n\nIn simpler terms, the rule is to keep only the largest continuous sequence of a non-zero color and remove all other instances of that color.
