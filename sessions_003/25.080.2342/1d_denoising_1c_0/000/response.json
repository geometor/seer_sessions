The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4), red (2), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve a selective removal of certain colored pixels based on their position and possibly their neighbors. Specifically, isolated colored pixels (surrounded by white pixels) are removed, while contiguous blocks of the same color are retained.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
