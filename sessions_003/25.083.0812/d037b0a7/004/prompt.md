1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Examine the top row (row 0) and the leftmost column (column 0) of the input grid. The non-zero pixels on these edges are the "seed" pixels.

2.  **Column Propagation:** For each non-zero pixel in the top row, change all pixels in its column to match the color of that top-row pixel.

3.  **Row Propagation, with Override:** For each non-zero pixel in the left column, iterate through its row. *However*, only change the color of a cell in that row if it hasn't *already* been changed during the column propagation step. In other words, column propagation takes precedence.
