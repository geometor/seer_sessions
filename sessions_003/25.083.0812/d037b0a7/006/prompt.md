1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Find non-zero pixels along the top edge (row 0) and the left edge (column 0) of the input grid. These are the "seed" pixels.

2.  **Column Propagation:** For each seed pixel in the top row, change the color of all *originally zero* pixels in its column to the color of the seed pixel.

3.  **Row Propagation:** For each seed pixel in the left column, change the color of all *originally zero* pixels in its row to the color of the seed pixel.

4. **Precedence/Interaction:** If both a row seed and a column seed want to change an originally zero cell, the expected result must be checked. Based on the available examples: it seems the output should take the color of the seed pixel in the first row or column of the *input grid*.
