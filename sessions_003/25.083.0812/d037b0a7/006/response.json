However, it incorrectly handled the interaction between row and column propagation. It appears there's a precedence rule that wasn't fully captured. The initial assumption that *both* row and column propagation occur independently and simultaneously is incorrect.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine the incorrect pixels in each example to determine the precise rule governing the interaction of row and column propagation.\n2.  **Prioritize Propagation:** The examples suggest a more defined order of operations, likely either row-first or column-first, but with a twist.\n3.  **Refine Logic:** Update the natural language program to reflect the corrected propagation order and interaction rules.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use `numpy` to calculate more detailed metrics for each example.\n\n"

If a seed pixel exists in the top row (row 0) for that column, change all originally zero pixels *in that column* to the seed pixel's color.\n    *   Second, iterate through each row. If a seed pixel exists in the left column (column 0) for that row, change all originally zero pixels *in that row* to the seed pixel's color *only if* the cell hasn't already been changed during the column propagation step.\n\nThis revised program prioritizes column propagation (based on the top row seeds) and then applies row propagation (from the leftmost column seeds), but only to cells not *already* modified by the column propagation. This accounts for the interaction observed in the examples. The key change is that column propagation takes full precedence, and row propagation is conditional.\n"
