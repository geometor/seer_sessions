objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - name: seed_pixels
    type: subset of grid cells
    properties:
      - location: top row (row 0) and left column (column 0)
      - value: non-zero

actions:
  - name: propagate_color
    description: Change the color of originally zero cells based on seed pixels.
    precedence:
        - description: "if both row and column want to change the same cell, the value from the seed pixel in the top row (if exists) takes precedence. Otherwise, the column takes precedence."
    steps:
      - 1: Iterate through columns, propagating color from top row seed pixels downwards.
      - 2: Iterate through rows, propagating color from left column seed pixels rightwards, but respecting precedence.
