facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 3x3.
  - observation: |
      Only values of pixels adjacent to top and left seem to affect pixels below or to the right respectively
  - observation: |
      Non-zero pixel colors on the top edge of the input grid influence the colors of pixels below them.
  - observation: |
      Non-zero pixel colors on the left edge of the input grid influence the colors of pixels to the right.
  - observation:  |
       Bottom right pixel in train_1 and train_2 is equal to the pixel above and to the right.
  - rule: |
      If a column has a non-zero pixel on the top edge, all the cells below will turn into this color, if they're not already.
  - rule: |
      If a row has a non-zero pixel on the left edge, all the cells in the row, to the right of it and not yet filled, will turn into this color.
