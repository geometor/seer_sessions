The transformation seems to involve identifying the non-zero, non-black pixels along the top and left edges of each grid.  It appears there is a relationship (potentially a kind of fill or spread) between pixels on the top and left.  Colors also seem quite important, and not all colors change.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
