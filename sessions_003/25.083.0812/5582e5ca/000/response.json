The output grid consists of a single, repeating digit. The key seems to be identifying which digit from the input grid becomes the repeated digit in the output. It's not immediately obvious which input digit is selected, and basic operations like min, max, or mode don't seem to consistently explain the choice.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
