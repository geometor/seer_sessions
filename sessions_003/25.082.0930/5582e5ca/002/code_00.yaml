examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      last_row_last_element: 0
      output_grid_value: 4
    observations: "The output grid is filled with the value 4. The input has no clear relation to 4, other than it appears in row 0 and row 1."
  - example_id: 2
    input_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      last_row_last_element: 9
      output_grid_value: 9
    observations: "The output grid is filled with value 9, which is also the last element of the first and last row of the input."
  - example_id: 3
    input_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      last_row_last_element: 6
      output_grid_value: 6
      
    observations: "The output grid is filled with the value 6, matching the last element of the input's last row."

overall_observations:
  - "The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid."
  - "The output grid is always filled with a single, uniform value."
  - "The fill value appears to correspond with the last element of the last row of the input grid"
