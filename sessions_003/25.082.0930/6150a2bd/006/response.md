Here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to address the errors:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a 90-degree clockwise rotation, which is incorrect based on the provided examples. The code works structurally (it rotates), but the direction of rotation and potentially some edge cases in the transformation are not handled correctly. The pixel differences and visual mismatches in the transformed outputs confirm this. The primary strategy is to re-evaluate the examples to determine the correct rotation (or other transformation) and modify the natural language program and code accordingly. It seems that not only the direction is wrong but also the rows and columns are switched.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze the input and expected output pairs, paying close attention to how the position of *each* pixel changes.
2.  **Identify Correct Transformation:** Determine the precise transformation (e.g., 90-degree *counter*-clockwise rotation, reflection, etc.). Visually inspect the images for clues, especially the relative position of unique colors or patterns.
3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language description to accurately reflect the identified transformation.
4.  **Modify and Retest Code:** Adjust the Python code based on the revised natural language program and re-run the tests.

**Gather Metrics:**

I will use python code to confirm dimensions and calculate the required rotation parameters.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_rotation(input_grid, expected_output_grid):
    input_np = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output_np = np.array(expected_output_grid)

    # Check dimensions
    input_shape = input_np.shape
    expected_output_shape = expected_output_np.shape
    print(f'{input_shape=}')
    print(f'{expected_output_shape=}')


    # try rotations and compare
    for k in range(-3,4):
        rotated_input_np = np.rot90(input_np, k=k)
        if rotated_input_np.shape == expected_output_np.shape:
            if np.array_equal(rotated_input_np, expected_output_np):
                print(f'rotation {k=}')
                return

    print('No simple rotation found')

example1_input = [
    [3, 3, 8],
    [3, 7, 0],
    [5, 0, 0]
]
example1_expected_output = [
    [5, 3, 3],
    [0, 7, 3],
    [0, 0, 8]
]

example2_input = [
    [5, 5, 2],
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
]
example2_expected_output = [
    [0, 1, 5],
    [0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 2]
]

analyze_rotation(example1_input, example1_expected_output)
analyze_rotation(example2_input, example2_expected_output)

```
```
input_shape=(3, 3)
expected_output_shape=(3, 3)
rotation k=-1
input_shape=(3, 3)
expected_output_shape=(3, 3)
rotation k=-1

**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. The colors of each pixel are maintained during the rotation, and the dimensions of the grid remain the same. The previous code was close, just off by the direction of the turn. k=-1 is a 90-degree *clockwise* rotation. k=1 is counter clockwise.
