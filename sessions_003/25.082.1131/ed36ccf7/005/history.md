Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (90-degree clockwise rotation) is incorrect. While the output grid dimensions are correct (swapping rows and columns), the pixel arrangement within the grid is wrong in all test cases. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the understanding of the transformation. A simple rotation is not sufficient to explain the changes. We need to re-evaluate the relationship between input and output, looking for a different pattern. It's likely a mirroring or reflection operation, potentially combined with some conditional logic.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Careful Visual Inspection:**: Visually compare each input-output pair, paying very close attention to how individual pixels or groups of pixels change position. Label each pixel with its coordinates.
2.  **Identify Invariants:** Look for pixels that *don't* change, as these can be clues to the underlying rule.
3.  **Hypothesize and Test:** Formulate new hypotheses about the transformation (e.g., reflection across a vertical or horizontal axis, or a more complex rearrangement) and write the natural language program.
4.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use code to perform targeted analysis of color shifts.
5. **Refine Natural Language Program and code:** improve on the generated program and test it again until all examples pass.

**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**

Since the visual comparison is the key here, and the prior run provided the pixel differences, I'm going to focus on analyzing one specific example more deeply to illustrate a different approach, and I will use the code tool. I'll take Example 1 and compare it with the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a **vertical reflection (mirroring)** of the input grid. Imagine a vertical line running down the center of the grid. The colors on the left side of this line are swapped with the colors on the right side, creating a mirrored image. This can be achieved by exchanging the values of columns while retaining the row indices.

The core process is:

1.  **Identify the central vertical axis:** For grids with an odd number of columns, this is the middle column. For grids with an even number of columns, the "axis" conceptually falls between the two central columns.
2.  **Swap Columns:** For each row, swap the pixel value at column *i* with the pixel value at column *(width - 1 - i)*, where *width* is the number of columns in the grid. Do this for all columns to the left of the central axis.
3. The result is a mirrored version of the input grid.
