It appears to be an expansion of the input grid.  The original input grid's elements are present, and they've been duplicated. There's also the addition of zeros (0, representing white) around the expanded input grid, forming a border. The expansion seems to involve duplicating each input cell both horizontally and vertically.\n* The input shape changes, and also the output dimension depends on the input dimension.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

For each cell in the input grid, create a horizontal duplicate of that cell immediately to its right.\n\n2.  **Vertical Duplication:** Take the horizontally expanded grid from step 1. For each cell in this expanded grid, create a vertical duplicate of that cell immediately below it.\n\n3.  **Add Border:** Create a new grid that is larger than the grid from step 2 by adding two rows and two columns. Place the grid from step 2 in the center. Surround the expanded grid with a border of zeros (0) that is one cell thick on all sides. This involves adding one row of zeros above and one row of zeros below the grid, and one column of zeros to the left and one column of zeros to the right.\n"
