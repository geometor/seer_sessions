The examples primarily use 1 (blue), 6 (magenta), and 8 (azure).\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves expanding the input grid. Specifically, each column in the input grid is duplicated to its immediate right in the output grid. The dimensions are changed. The output width is 2x of input width.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
