Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The core element is a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   **Colors:** Each number corresponds to a color. The examples primarily use 1 (blue), 6 (magenta), and 8 (azure).
*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves expanding the input grid. Specifically, each column in the input grid is duplicated to its immediate right in the output grid. The dimensions are changed. The output width is 2x of input width.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        - height: integer (number of rows)
        - width: integer (number of columns)
      cells:
        type: integer (0-9, representing colors)
        
actions:
  - name: duplicate_column
    description: Replicates a column of the grid immediately to its right.
    input: original_grid, column_index
    output: modified_grid

relationships:
 - type: spatial
   description: Each column of the input is adjacent to its duplicate in the output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate:** For each column in the input grid.
2.  **Duplicate:** Create an exact copy of the current column.
3.  **Insert:** Insert the duplicated column immediately to the right of the original column in the output grid.
4. **Output:** The output grid should have twice the width compared to input, height stays the same.

In short: The rule is to duplicate each column of the input grid and place it to its right.
