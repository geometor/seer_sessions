The transformation appears to involve some form of rotation or reflection of the grid, as the relative positions of the numbers (colors) change, but the numbers themselves, and thus the colors, are maintained. The transformation is consistent across all given examples. The core operation is a rearrangement of the grid elements, not a change in the elements themselves.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
