The output grid appears to be a \"doubled\" or \"mirrored\" version of the input grid, with each column of the input grid being duplicated. The colors (represented by digits) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid. The dimensions of the output grid are always double the width of the input grid, and the height is the same. The transformation effectively stretches the input grid horizontally.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
