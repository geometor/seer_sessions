Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The output grid appears to be a "doubled" or "mirrored" version of the input grid, with each column of the input grid being duplicated. The colors (represented by digits) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid. The dimensions of the output grid are always double the width of the input grid, and the height is the same. The transformation effectively stretches the input grid horizontally.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        width: 3
        height: 3
        cells: 2D array of color values (integers 0-9)
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        width: 6
        height: 3
        cells: 2D array of color values (integers 0-9)

actions:
  - duplicate_column:
      input: column of input_grid
      output: two identical columns in output_grid
      description: Each column in the input grid is replicated immediately to its right in the output grid.

relationships:
  - output_grid_width: 2 * input_grid_width
  - output_grid_height: input_grid_height
  - output_grid_cells: derived from input_grid_cells by column duplication
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same height as the input grid and twice the width.
2.  **Column Iteration:** Iterate through each column of the input grid.
3.  **Column Duplication:** For each column in the input grid, copy its contents to the corresponding column in the output grid. Then immediately copy the same contents to the adjacent column on the right in the output grid.

The core concept is to stretch the input grid horizontally by duplicating each column once.
