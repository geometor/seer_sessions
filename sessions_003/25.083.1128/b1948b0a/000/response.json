The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a specific color change, primarily focusing on the color `6` (magenta) changing to `2` (red), while `7` (orange) remains the same. The change doesn't appear to be based on simple global substitution, as some `6`s remain unchanged. The positions of the changing `6`s seem significant, hinting at a spatial or pattern-based rule.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
