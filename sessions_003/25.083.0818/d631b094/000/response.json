The input grids are 3x3, while the output grids vary in size (2x1, 3x1, 1x1, 4x1). The transformation seems to focus on extracting and repeating non-zero values from the input grid. The zero values seem to act as a background or filler. There's no clear spatial relationship maintained between the input and output; instead, it seems to be based on the *presence* and *value* of non-zero digits, not their *position*.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
