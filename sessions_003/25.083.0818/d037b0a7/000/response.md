Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The output grids appear to be derived from the input grids through a specific transformation rule related to the propagation or filling of colors. It seems like non-zero values in the top row propagate downwards, possibly influenced by the presence of other non-zero values.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Non-zero values in the top row of the input grid seem to be "sources".
  - observation: |
      The propagation stops if it encounters another non-zero value.

  - objects:
    - name: grid
      description: 2D array of integers
      properties:
        - dimensions: rows x columns
        - cells: individual elements in the grid, identified by row and column indices
        - values: integers from 0 to 9, representing colors

  - actions:
      - name: propagate
        description: |
           A non-zero value from the top row extends downwards in its column, replacing 0 values.
        parameters:
          - source_value: The non-zero value that propagates.
          - source_column: The column in which the value propagates.

  - relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: |
        The vertical position of cells relative to each other is crucial for the transformation.
        The propagation is column-wise.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Sources:** Find all non-zero values in the top row of the input grid. These are the "source" values.

2.  **Column-wise Propagation:** For each source value:
    *   Iterate down the column starting from the top row.
    *   If the current cell is 0, replace it with the source value.
    *    If it is not zero, the source value changes to it.

3.  **Output:** The modified grid is the output.
