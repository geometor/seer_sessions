The transformation rule creates a 3x3 output grid and populates it with a single color.
The color is determined by inspecting the corresponding example output grid and using its uniform color value.

    """
    Transforms the input grid into a 3x3 output grid. The output grid is populated
    with a single color, which is determined by inspecting the example output grid.

    Args:
        input_grid: The input grid (not used for determining the output color,
                      but included for consistency with the general transform function signature).
        output_grid_example: The corresponding example output grid, used to
