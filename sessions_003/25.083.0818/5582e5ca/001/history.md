## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```


**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```


**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```


**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x3 grid. The output grid consists of a single, repeating digit. The repeating digit in the output grid appears to be derived from the input grid, specifically, the top-right element, which represents azure, green, and maroon in the provided examples.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids are 3x3."
  - observation: "Each cell in the grids contains a single digit integer, representing a color."
  - observation: "Output grid contains a single repeating digit."
  - observation: "The repeating digit in the output grid corresponds to a digit present in the input grid."
  - relationship: "The output digit is the same value found at input grid coordinates (0,2) - i.e. top-right element"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the top-right element:** Locate the element at the first row and last column (index (0, 2)) in the input grid.
2.  **Create the output grid:** Create a new 3x3 grid.
3.  **Populate the output:** Fill every cell of the output grid with the value identified in step 1.
