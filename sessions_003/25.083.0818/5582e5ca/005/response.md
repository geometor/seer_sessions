The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Analyze Input: Examine the input grid and count the occurrences of each color (digit).
2.  Identify Dominant Color: Determine the color that appears most frequently in the input grid.
3.  Create Output: Create a new 3x3 grid.
4.  Populate Output: Fill the entire 3x3 output grid with the most frequent color identified in the input grid.
