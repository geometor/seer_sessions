examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [3, 3]
    output_value: 4
    transformation: "All pixels in the output grid are set to the value 4."

  - example_id: 2
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [3, 3]
    output_value: 9
    transformation: "All pixels in the output grid are set to the value 9."

  - example_id: 3
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [3, 3]
    output_value: 6
    transformation: "All pixels in the output grid are set to the value 6."

general:
  - observation: "The output grid is always 3x3."
  - observation: "All pixels in the output grid share the same value."
  - observation: "The shared output value may vary between examples."
