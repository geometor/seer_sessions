The input and output grids have identical dimensions (3x3 in all provided examples). There are no apparent geometric transformations, object manipulations, or complex spatial reasoning involved. The core operation appears to be a simple color substitution based on a one-to-one mapping. There is no use of adjacency, counting, or sorting.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
