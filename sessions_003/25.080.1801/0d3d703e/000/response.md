Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a direct mapping or substitution of individual pixel values within a grid. The input and output grids have identical dimensions (3x3 in all provided examples). There are no apparent geometric transformations, object manipulations, or complex spatial reasoning involved. The core operation appears to be a simple color substitution based on a one-to-one mapping. There is no use of adjacency, counting, or sorting.

      - "1 -> 5"

      - "8 -> 9"
      - "5 -> 1"
      - "9 -> 8"
      - "4 -> 3"
  - objects:
      - description: grid pixels
        properties:
            - name: color value
              type: integer (0-9)
        actions:
            - name: substitute
              description: Replace the pixel's color value with a new value based on a predefined mapping.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  For each pixel, **look up** its value in the following mapping table:
    *   3 becomes 4
    *   1 becomes 5
    *   2 becomes 6
    *   8 becomes 9
    *   5 becomes 1
    *   9 becomes 8
    *   4 becomes 3
3.  **Replace** the pixel's original value with the corresponding value from the mapping table.
4.  The resulting grid with the replaced values is the output grid.

Essentially - perform a modular addition, incrementing each pixel color code
by a fixed amount, wrapping around as in modular arithmetic.
