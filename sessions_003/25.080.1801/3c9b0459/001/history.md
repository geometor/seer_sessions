## train_1

**input:**
```

```


**output:**
```

```


## train_2

**input:**
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples.
*   The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement or mirroring of the grid elements. It's not a simple rotation or reflection along a single axis.
* Looking at pairs, it becomes obvious, it's mirroring the input along the main diagonal

**YAML Block (Facts):**

    properties:
        - row index
        - column index
        - color value
    actions:
        - swap: coordinates are swapped based on mirror operation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to transpose the input grid. This means the input grid is mirrored along its main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right). The element at row `i` and column `j` in the input grid will be placed at row `j` and column `i` in the output grid. In other words, swap the row and column indices of each element to obtain the output grid.
