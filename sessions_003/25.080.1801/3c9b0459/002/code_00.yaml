observations:
  - type: grid_transformation
    details:
      - input_grids: 3x3 grids in all examples.
      - output_grids: 3x3 grids in all examples.
      - transformation_type: Not a simple transpose. It seems to be a combination of row and/or column reversal, possibly based on position or content.
      - pixel_displacement:  Pixels are systematically misplaced.
      - example_1:
          input_output_mapping:
              row_1: [2, 2, 1] -> [1, 8, 2] (column reversed, with changes of 1<->2 and 2 <-> 8)
              row_2: [2, 1, 2] -> [2, 1, 2] (no change)
              row_3: [2, 8, 1] -> [1, 2, 2] (column reversed, with changes of 1<->2 and 8 <-> 2)
      - example_2:
          input_output_mapping:
            row_1: [9, 2, 4] -> [2, 9, 2]
            row_2: [2, 4, 4] -> [4, 4, 2]
            row_3: [2, 9, 2] -> [4, 2, 9]
      - example_3:
          input_output_mapping:
            row_1: [8,8,8] -> [5,5,8]
            row_2: [5,5,8] -> [8,5,5]
            row_3: [8,5,5] -> [8,8,8]
      - example_4:
          input_output_mapping:
            row_1: [3,2,9] -> [3,3,2]
            row_2: [9,9,9] -> [9,9,9]
            row_3: [2,3,3] -> [9,2,3]
