task_type: grid_transformation
input_grid_dimensions: variable (but consistent within each example)
output_grid_dimensions: same as input
input_values: integers 0-9
output_values: integers [0, 5]
objects:
  - type: row
    properties:
      - color_distribution: frequency of each color (digit) in the row
      - most_frequent_color: the color (digit) with the highest frequency
transformations:
  - type: row-wise replacement
    rule: >
      Identify the most frequent color in the input row.
      In the output row, set cells corresponding to the positions
       of the most frequent color to 5, and all others to 0.
