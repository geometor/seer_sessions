The output grids seem to consist of only 0s and 5s, while the input grids have a wider variety of digits. A key observation is that the output grid's 5s correspond to the positions of the most frequent color along each *row* of the input grid. All other positions are 0 in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
