Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid.\n*   Each grid contains single-digit integers representing colors.\n*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair, but may vary between different pairs.\n*   The arrangement of numbers (colors) changes from the input to the output grid. It appears to be a rearrangement rather than a mathematical operation on the numbers themselves.\n*\tThe transformation appears to be a rotation, specifically by 180 degrees.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
