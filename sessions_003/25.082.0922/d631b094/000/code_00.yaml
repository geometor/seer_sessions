objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        size: NxN (where N is an integer between 1 and 30)
        elements: integers (0-9)
        description: Represents the initial state, a square grid of color values.
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        size: MxP (where M and P are integers)
        elements: integers (0-9)
        description: Represents the transformed state, a rectangular grid derived from the input.
  - non_zero_elements:
      type: list
      properties:
          elements: integers (0 is excluded)

actions:
    - extract_non_zero: finds elements in input which are not zero, and place their values into a list

relationships:
  - input_to_output: The output grid is derived from the input grid by extracting and arranging the non-zero elements.
  - spatial_relationship: seems the original location of the non-zero element is discarded
