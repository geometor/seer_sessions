Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output examples and try to understand the underlying transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are square grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.
*   The outputs are smaller rectangular grids.
*   The outputs seem to be composed of the non-zero values from the input grids.
*   The input grids have sparse data, many cells are zero.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        size: NxN (where N is an integer between 1 and 30)
        elements: integers (0-9)
        description: Represents the initial state, a square grid of color values.
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        size: MxP (where M and P are integers)
        elements: integers (0-9)
        description: Represents the transformed state, a rectangular grid derived from the input.
  - non_zero_elements:
      type: list
      properties:
          elements: integers (0 is excluded)

actions:
    - extract_non_zero: finds elements in input which are not zero, and place their values into a list

relationships:
  - input_to_output: The output grid is derived from the input grid by extracting and arranging the non-zero elements.
  - spatial_relationship: seems the original location of the non-zero element is discarded
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all non-zero elements.
3.  **Extract** those Non-zero elements.
4.   **Construct** an output list by repeating the non-zero numbers as many time as they are detected in input.
5.  **Create** the output as 1 row and return.

Essentially, the transformation rule identifies and replicates the non-zero elements, repeating each value a number of times, corresponding to its own count, to create a single row.
