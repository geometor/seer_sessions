Okay, I'm ready to analyze this task. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The most prominent colors are green (3), blue (1), and yellow (4). White (0) acts as a background. The key difference between input and output seems to involve the blue and yellow pixels in the lower right corner of the input grids, which disappear in the output grids. The green pixels in the top left of each input grid remain, although their shape might change.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - colors: [0, 1, 3, 4]
  - type: object_group
    properties:
       - color: 3
       - location: top_left
       - shape: variable # shape changes, could be a single block of multiple blocks
  - type: object_group # could be one or two objects
    properties:
       - color: [1, 4]
       - location: bottom_right
       - shape: variable # adjacent, could be a 2x2 square or two 1x2 rectangles

actions:
  - remove:
      target: object_group
      properties:
        - color: [1,4]
  - keep/transform:
      target: object_group
      properties:
        -color: 3

relationships:
   - spatial: object of color 3 are in top left of grid
   - spatial: objects of color 1 and 4 are in bottom right
   - spatial: objects of color 1 and 4 are adjacent in input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the green (3) object(s) in the top-left region of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** the object with blue and yellow pixels in the bottom-right corner.
3.  **Remove** the identified blue (1) and yellow (4) object(s).
4. **Keep** the green object(s) in place. Its shape may be adjusted, but overall it should occupy positions near where they were originally. It appears that if there is a 2x2 green object, it is transformed to a 1xN or Nx1 object.
5.  **Clear** all other pixels to white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

Essentially the program removes blue/yellow objects in the bottom-right and keeps/transforms any green object(s) in the top-left.
