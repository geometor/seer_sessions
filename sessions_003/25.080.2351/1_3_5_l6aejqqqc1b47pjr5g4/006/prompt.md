1.  **Identify Yellow Regions:** Locate all contiguous blocks (or individual pixels) of color `4` (yellow) within the input grid.
2.  **Downward Expansion:** For each yellow region, extend it downwards.  This means changing all `0` (white) pixels directly below any yellow pixel to `4` (yellow).
3.  **Boundary Condition:** Continue the downward expansion until the bottom edge of the grid is reached.  The overall size of the grid remains constant. Essentially, yellow 'falls' or 'fills down' the grid.
4. **Preserve Grid Size.** Make sure there are no new rows and the number of rows in the output equals the number of rows in the input.
