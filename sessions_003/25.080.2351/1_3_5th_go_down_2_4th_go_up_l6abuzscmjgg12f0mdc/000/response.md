Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 5x5 grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   **Objects:** Non-zero pixels seem to be the primary objects.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves a change in the grid's structure, suggesting some form of object interaction, duplication, or movement. The zeros seem like a background.
*   **Symmetry:** A vertical symmetry or reflection seems relevant based on a casual observation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x5

actions:
  - name: reflect_and_fill
    description: Reflects non-zero color from the input.
    parameters:
      axis: vertical

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - type: color_based
    description: Pixels with the same color are related by color, consider 0 as background.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero value (i.e., not white).
2.  **Vertical Midpoint:** Determine the vertical midpoint of the grid. For a 5x5 grid, this is column index 2 (the third column, as indexing starts at 0).
3.  **Reflection Logic**:
    The non-zero pixels in each row from original matrix form a vertical line.
    If there is a zero value in the original matrix, make a value in the same row
    by selecting the nearest non-zero value of same row.
4.  **Construct Output:** Form the output matrix as described above.
