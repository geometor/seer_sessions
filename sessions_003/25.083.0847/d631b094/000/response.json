Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are square grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).\n*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.\n*   The outputs are also grids, but smaller than the inputs.\n*   The outputs seem to contain only the non-zero values from the input, and the number of times is equal to the number of times that number appears in a column on the original input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
