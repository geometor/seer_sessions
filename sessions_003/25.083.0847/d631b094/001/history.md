Okay, I'm ready to analyze these examples and try to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are square grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.
*   The outputs are also grids, but smaller than the inputs.
*   The outputs seem to contain only the non-zero values from the input, and the number of times is equal to the number of times that number appears in a column on the original input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, smaller than input
      - values: integers present in input_grid, excluding 0

object_interactions:
  - action: filtering
    description: Non-zero values are extracted from the input grid.
  - action: resizing:
    description: creates an output grid that has a length equal to the number of instances.
  - action: repetition
    description: The non zero number is repeated.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all unique, non-zero values (colors) present in the input grid.
3. For each of the non-zero values:
4. **Count** how many instances of that value there are along any of the columns.
5. **Create** an output with length equal to the number of instances.
6. **populate** output with the non-zero number.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the non-zero values from the input, then creates an ouput for each non-zero value that is made of that value, and has length is equal to the count of the number of instance of that non-zero number in any column.
