facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The numbers in the cells represent colors.
  - observation: |
      The transformation preserves the grid structure.
  - observation: |
      Specific digits in the input grid get propagated to fill other positions.
      The transformation replicates the last row to the rows below and the last column to the columns on the right of it.
  - objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: 3x3
        - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - actions:
    - type: fill
      description: |
         Some cells that are '0' are being replaced by non-zero value from cells in the input grid, filling them with a specific logic.
    - type: propagation
      description: |
        The last non-zero value of each row propagates downwards to fill the row below.
        The last non-zero value of each column propagates right to fill to the columns on the right.
  - relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: |
            Changes seem to propagate downwards from the non-zero values.
