task: d037b0a7
observations:
  - object_types:
      - grid: The entire input and output are 2D grids of digits.
      - cell: Each element within the grid is a cell containing a single digit (0-9).
      - zero_cell: A cell with the value 0.
      - non_zero_cell:  A cell with a value other than 0.
  - actions:
      - propagation:  A non-zero cell's value replaces the value of an adjacent zero cell.
      - downward_propagation: Propagation from a cell to the cell directly below it.
      - rightward_propagation: Propagation from a cell to the cell immediately to its right.
  - properties:
      - adjacency: Cells are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonal).
      - propagation_direction: The direction (down or right) in which a value propagates.
  - constraints:
      - zero_filling: Propagation only occurs into cells that are initially zero.
      - single_step: This seems to apply to example 2 specifically.
  - example_2_analysis:
    - initial_state: "[0,2,0],[7,0,8],[0,0,0]"
    - correct_final_state: "[0,2,0],[7,2,8],[7,2,8]"
    - incorrect_final_state_by_old_code: "[0,2,2],[7,2,8],[7,2,8]"
    - error_description: "The top middle 2 propagated to the right when it should have waited for the 7 to move down"
  - example_3_analysis:
    - initial_state: "[4,0,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]"
    - correct_final_state: "[4,0,0],[4,2,0],[4,2,0]"
    - incorrect_final_state_by_old_code: "[4,4,4],[4,2,2],[4,2,2]"
    - error_description: "Too much propagation in all directions"
