            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial program implemented a two-step propagation: downward and then rightward. While it correctly handled the first example, it failed on the second and third. The core issue seems to be the order of propagation and potentially missing a combined propagation effect. The code propagates downwards *then* rightwards. The errors indicate it's doing *too much* propagation. It should only be propagating *into* zeros.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Carefully examine the failed examples:**  Understand *why* the extra propagation happened and how the expected output differs. Pay very close attention to the interaction of the downward and rightward propagation.\n2.  **Re-evaluate the order of operations**: It might not be strictly downward *then* rightward. It seems propagation in any direction fills zeros, and this continues until no zeros can be changed.\n3. **Consider a combined propagation**: Instead of separate loops, explore combining propagation.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Report Assumptions:**\n\nI need to quantify the errors more precisely. For instance \"pixels_off\" doesn't tell me which pixels are wrong. I'll use a tool to generate a diff-like view.\n\n"
