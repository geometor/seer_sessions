1. Iterative Zero Filling: Scan the grid. If a cell is *not* zero, check its neighbors (directly below and to the right).
2. Conditional Propagation: If a neighboring cell (down or right) is zero, copy the non-zero cell's value into the zero cell.
3. Repeat: Continue scanning and propagating until no more changes can be made, i.e. perform steps 1 and 2 until a complete scan of the grid results in zero changes.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a "fill-down and fill-right" strategy. It works perfectly for the first example, but fails on the second and third. The core issue is that the propagation logic is too simplistic. It only considers immediate neighbors (down and right) and stops. It doesn't account for cases where the filling should propagate further, potentially filling an entire region defined by non-zero "walls". The errors in examples 2 and 3 clearly demonstrate this limitation. The second example requires values to be copied in the row instead. The third requires filling both below *and* to the right and then below *and* to the right again, cascading the copied values.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze the failures:** Examine examples 2 and 3 closely to pinpoint *why* the current logic fails.  The key is to understand the "boundaries" of the filling operation.
2.  **Refine the concept of propagation:**  Instead of just "down and right", we need a more general concept of "filling a region bounded by non-zero values".
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language description to capture this refined concept.
4. Metrics Gathering
    I am going to count the objects and bounding shapes as preparation.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangle encompassing all non-zero pixels in the input grid. This defines the active region for the transformation.
2.  **Iterative Filling:** Within the bounding box, locate zero-valued cells.
3.  **Neighbor Propagation:** For each zero-valued cell, check its non-zero neighbors (up, down, left, and right).
    *   If a zero has non-zero neighbor to the up or left: copy the value.
    *   If a zero has non-zero neighbor to the right or below, copy the value
4. If there is any changes in the grid, repeat the process.
5. **Repeat:** Iterate steps 2 and 3 until the entire region within the bounding box is filled, with all original objects being merged into one.

Essentially, the non-zero values "flood fill" the areas of zeros contained by them, including the entire bounding box.
