1. Iterative Zero Filling: Scan the grid. If a cell is *not* zero, check its neighbors (directly below and to the right).
2. Conditional Propagation: If a neighboring cell (down or right) is zero, copy the non-zero cell's value into the zero cell.
3. Repeat: Continue scanning and propagating until no more changes can be made, i.e. perform steps 1 and 2 until a complete scan of the grid results in zero changes.
