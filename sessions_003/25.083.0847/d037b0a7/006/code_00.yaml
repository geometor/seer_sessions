examples:
  - id: 1
    input_objects: 3  # Number of distinct non-zero regions in the input
    output_objects: 1 # Number of distinct non-zero regions in the output
    input_bounding_box: ((0, 0), (2, 2)) # Top-left and bottom-right corners of the region containing all non-zero pixels
    output_bounding_box: ((0, 0), (2, 2)) #Top-left and bottom-right corners
    transformation: "Fill zeros within the bounding box with values from adjacent non-zero cells, prioritizing down and right."
    notes: "The original objects merge to one"
