facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable  # Number of rows
      columns: variable  # Number of columns
      cells: contain color values 0-9
  - action: propagation

        - action:  Cell below takes the value of the current cell.
      rightward:
        - condition: Cell to the right is empty (value 0)
        - action: Cell to the right takes the value of the current cell.
  - observation: The propagation fill the zeros with values from cells above and to the left.
