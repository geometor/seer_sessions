The output grid appears to consist of a single color repeated across all cells. The key seems to be identifying which color from the input grid becomes the uniform color of the output grid. It's not immediately obvious which input color is chosen - it's not the most frequent, nor a simple corner/center selection. The third element is selected.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
