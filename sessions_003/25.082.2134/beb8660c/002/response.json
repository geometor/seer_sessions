            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of stacking data rows (rows with non-black pixels) at the *bottom* of the output grid.  The results show this isn't always the case. The examples reveal a more complex reordering, specifically a rotation and/or shifting of rows, rather than simply stacking them at the bottom. Example 3 seems to almost shift, and example 2 also indicates shifting and not simple stacking. Example 1, which was the basis of the initial code does, infact stack the rows at the bottom. However, looking more carefully at this example, the order of the non-black pixels seems incorrect, especially when reviewed column by column. The second, third, fifth, and sixth columns all have their values shifted one position to the left.\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Row Order:** Determine the precise rule governing how rows are reordered, not just stacked.\n2.  **Column Preservation/Transformation** - determine how values are reordered in the columns.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the description to reflect the actual transformation.\n4.  **Revise the code based on updated description.**\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and reasoning - I will use code execution when required):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Original Observation (Incorrect): Data rows stacked at the bottom.\n    *   Revised Observation: Data rows are stacked at the bottom. Within columns, it seems like a cyclic shift of values to the left, only among the non-black pixels.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Original Observation (Incorrect): Data rows stacked at the bottom.\n    *   Revised Observation: Data rows are stacked at the bottom, similar to Example 1. However, in this example, since all the non-black values are at the end of the rows, it is difficult to determine if there is a cyclic shift.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Original Observation (Incorrect): Data rows stacked at the bottom.\n    *   Revised Observation: This is the most informative example, as the shift is very visible. The second row becomes the first, the first becomes the second, and the last row stays the same.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
