The core concept seems to be a vertical reordering or shifting of these rows. The colors themselves don't seem to change; rather, their positions (specifically, their row indices) are altered. It appears there is no horizontal translation. Empty rows (all black) are introduced and play an important role, perhaps serving as padding or separators. The transformation rule has to include when and where to add these padding rows.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

These are the \"data rows.\"\n\n2.  **Preserve Order:** Maintain the relative order of these data rows.  If data row A is above data row B in the input, then row A should still be above row B in the output (though their absolute positions may change).\n\n3.  **Stack at Bottom:**  Arrange the identified data rows at the *bottom* of the output grid.  The lowest data row in the input becomes the lowest row in the output, the second-lowest input data row becomes the second-lowest output row, and so on.\n\n4. **Fill with Padding**: Fill all remaining rows at the top of the output grid with black pixels (all 0s). These are the \"padding rows.\" The number of padding rows will be equal to output grid height minus the number of data rows.\n"
