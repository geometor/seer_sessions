The input grids are larger and contain more variety in colors and shapes, while the output grids are consistently 2x2 and contain only one color (besides background '0').  The output grid's color seems to be derived from a prominent object within the input grid. The crucial element appears to be identifying a specific object in the input and extracting its color. It seems like there are two main large objects in each input. The lower object's color is always the one in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This can be found by looking at the y coordinates.\n3.  **Extract Color:** Determine the color (numerical value) of the pixels composing the bottom object.
