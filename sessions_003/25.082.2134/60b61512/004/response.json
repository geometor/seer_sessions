            "text": "Okay, here's an assessment of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors, along with the requested deliverables:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code are too simplistic. The code correctly identifies white (0) pixels adjacent to yellow (4) pixels and changes them to orange (7). However, it doesn't account for the spatial arrangement and extent of the yellow and white pixels correctly, as is clear from the failed test cases. Specifically, the code changes *too many* white pixels to orange. It seems to be \"leaking\" the orange color beyond the intended boundaries. The core issue is that the transformation shouldn't just check for *any* adjacent yellow pixel, it must follow some rules for \"clusters\".\n\nThe strategy to fix this is to:\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly define what constitutes a \"cluster\" of yellow pixels. The examples suggest it's a contiguous horizontal or vertical line.\n2.  **Constrain Transformation:**  Instead of changing *all* neighboring white pixels, we only want to change specific ones based on their position relative to the yellow cluster. It looks as if only the pixels that extend the line formed by the yellow cluster are changed.\n3. Use the additional examples to help improve our definitions and constrain the program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification)**\n\nI need to analyze the *differences* between the expected output and the transformed output. Let me verify the reported `pixels_off` and calculate a few other metrics. I'll focus on example 1, since I can get additional useful info about locations.\n\n"
