facts:
  - object: yellow_cluster
    description: Contiguous horizontal or vertical line of yellow (4) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: line
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical
  - object: white_pixel
    description: A pixel with the value 0.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
  - action: transform_white_to_orange
    description: Change white pixels to orange based on adjacency to yellow clusters.
    preconditions:
      - white_pixel is adjacent to a yellow_cluster, extending the cluster's line.
    postconditions:
      - white_pixel becomes orange (7).
    constraints:
      - Only change white pixels that directly extend the line of the yellow_cluster.
      - Do not change white pixels that are diagonally adjacent.
      - Do NOT change pixels adjacent to newly changed orange pixels.
  - observation: example_1
    details: code incorrectly transforms too many pixels to orange - "leaking"
