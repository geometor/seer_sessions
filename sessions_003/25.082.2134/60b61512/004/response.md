Okay, here's an assessment of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors, along with the requested deliverables:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code are too simplistic. The code correctly identifies white (0) pixels adjacent to yellow (4) pixels and changes them to orange (7). However, it doesn't account for the spatial arrangement and extent of the yellow and white pixels correctly, as is clear from the failed test cases. Specifically, the code changes *too many* white pixels to orange. It seems to be "leaking" the orange color beyond the intended boundaries. The core issue is that the transformation shouldn't just check for *any* adjacent yellow pixel, it must follow some rules for "clusters".

The strategy to fix this is to:

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly define what constitutes a "cluster" of yellow pixels. The examples suggest it's a contiguous horizontal or vertical line.
2.  **Constrain Transformation:**  Instead of changing *all* neighboring white pixels, we only want to change specific ones based on their position relative to the yellow cluster. It looks as if only the pixels that extend the line formed by the yellow cluster are changed.
3. Use the additional examples to help improve our definitions and constrain the program.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification)**

I need to analyze the *differences* between the expected output and the transformed output. Let me verify the reported `pixels_off` and calculate a few other metrics. I'll focus on example 1, since I can get additional useful info about locations.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 1 data (from the provided information)
transformed_output = np.array([
    [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 4, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 7, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [7, 7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0],
    [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 7, 7],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 4, 4, 7],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 7, 4, 7],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

expected_output = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 7, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

# Calculate the difference
difference = transformed_output - expected_output

# Find where the differences are non-zero (indicating errors)
error_locations = np.where(difference != 0)

# Count the number of errors
num_errors = len(error_locations[0])

# Print results and error locations
print(f"{num_errors=}")  # Verify against reported pixels_off
print(f"{error_locations=}")

# Analyze pixel values at error locations in transformed output

incorrect_pixels = transformed_output[error_locations]
print(f"Incorrect Pixel Values: {incorrect_pixels}")



```
```
num_errors=25
error_locations=(array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7,
       7, 7, 7]), array([0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 5,
       6, 7, 8]))
Incorrect Pixel Values: [7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7]

```
The code execution confirms that there are 25 incorrect pixels in the first example, and all of those pixels are orange (7). It's over-applying the orange. The locations of the errors clearly show the leakage - it spreads from the yellow clusters but overwrites the correct results.

**YAML Fact Block**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: yellow_cluster
    description: Contiguous horizontal or vertical line of yellow (4) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: line
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical
  - object: white_pixel
    description: A pixel with the value 0.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
  - action: transform_white_to_orange
    description: Change white pixels to orange based on adjacency to yellow clusters.
    preconditions:
      - white_pixel is adjacent to a yellow_cluster, extending the cluster's line.
    postconditions:
      - white_pixel becomes orange (7).
    constraints:
      - Only change white pixels that directly extend the line of the yellow_cluster.
      - Do not change white pixels that are diagonally adjacent.
      - Do NOT change pixels adjacent to newly changed orange pixels.
  - observation: example_1
    details: code incorrectly transforms too many pixels to orange - "leaking"
    metrics:
       pixels_off: 25
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Yellow Clusters:** Find all clusters of yellow (4) pixels that form horizontal or vertical lines.
2.  **Extend Lines:** For each yellow cluster, identify white (0) pixels that *extend* the line of the cluster. This means the white pixels must be directly adjacent (not diagonally) to the *ends* of the yellow line, continuing the same direction.
3.  **Transform:** Change the identified white pixels from step 2 to orange (7).
4. **Do not iterate:** Do not transform white cells adjacent to newly changed orange pixels.

This revised program emphasizes the crucial constraint of *extending* the existing lines of yellow, rather than simply being adjacent to any yellow pixel. This should prevent the "leaking" observed in the initial code's output.
