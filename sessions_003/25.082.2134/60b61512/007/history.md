Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a revised strategy.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code have a fundamental flaw: they only consider white (0) pixels *directly* adjacent to the yellow (4) clusters for transformation to orange (7). The examples reveal a more nuanced rule: the white pixels must be part of a contiguous "extension" of the yellow cluster's line, regardless of distance, but only if there isn't any intervening pixel of any color *other* than white. Also, the rule appears to only change white pixels that are *directly adjacent to only one end* of the yellow line, not both.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Cluster Identification:** The `get_yellow_clusters` function seems adequate in identifying horizontal and vertical yellow lines. No immediate change needed there.
2.  **Improve Extension Logic:** The `get_extending_pixels` function needs significant modification. Instead of just checking immediate neighbors, it should perform a search along the line of the cluster, stopping only when it encounters a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid.
3. **Clarify direction**: The direction must be strictly west and east or north
   and south.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use code execution to build upon the existing findings and verify the hypothesis. We'll explicitly verify the extending behavior.

My apologies, the previous code block had a scoping issue because I redefined `get_yellow_clusters` and `get_extending_pixels` *after* calling `analyze_example`, which uses them. Let's fix that by moving the function definitions to the top. I'll also add the correct logic to check for extending white pixels.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Yellow Clusters:** Find all contiguous horizontal or vertical lines of yellow (4) pixels with a length greater than 1. These are the "yellow clusters."

2.  **Extend the Line:** For each yellow cluster:
    *   Determine the orientation (horizontal or vertical).
    *   **Horizontal:**
        *   Check for white (0) pixels extending the line to the *west* of the westernmost yellow pixel. Continue extending and marking white pixels as potential changes until a non-white pixel or the grid edge is encountered. Only change the *first* white pixel adjacent to the end.
        *   Check for white (0) pixels extending the line to the *east* of the easternmost yellow pixel. Continue extending and marking white pixels as potential changes until a non-white pixel or the grid edge is encountered. Only change the *first* white pixel adjacent to the end.
    *   **Vertical:**
        *   Check for white (0) pixels extending the line to the *north* of the northernmost yellow pixel. Continue extending and marking white pixels as potential changes until a non-white pixel or the grid edge is encountered. Only change the *first* white pixel adjacent to the end.
        *   Check for white (0) pixels extending the line to the *south* of the southernmost yellow pixel. Continue extending and marking white pixels as potential changes until a non-white pixel or the grid edge is encountered. Only change the *first* white pixel adjacent to the end.

3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the white pixels identified in step 2 to orange (7).
