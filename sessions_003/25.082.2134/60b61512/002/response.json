            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were too simplistic. The code correctly identifies yellow (4) and adjacent white (0) pixels, changing the white pixels to orange (7). However, it over-generalizes the spread of orange. It seems to change *all* reachable white pixels to orange and also changes *all* yellow pixels adjacent to *any* orange pixel to orange as well. This creates a \"flood fill\" effect of orange, which is not what the expected outputs show. The core issue is that the transformation should be more localized and iterative, not a complete fill.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Neighbor Identification:** The current `get_neighbors` function is correct, so we'll keep it.\n\n2.  **Constrain Orange Spread:** The code needs to be more precise about *which* white pixels turn orange and *which* yellow pixels are affected. It should only affect pixels *directly* adjacent to the *initial* yellow pixels, and the change from yellow to orange occurs as a function of direct adjacency to an initial yellow cluster.\n\n3. **Iterative application:** The spread is applied iteratively - white adjacent to yellow turns orange, then check the state again.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\nLet's analyze the provided examples to identify specific patterns in how the transformation occurs:\n\n"
