Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were too simplistic. The code correctly identifies yellow (4) and adjacent white (0) pixels, changing the white pixels to orange (7). However, it over-generalizes the spread of orange. It seems to change *all* reachable white pixels to orange and also changes *all* yellow pixels adjacent to *any* orange pixel to orange as well. This creates a "flood fill" effect of orange, which is not what the expected outputs show. The core issue is that the transformation should be more localized and iterative, not a complete fill.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Neighbor Identification:** The current `get_neighbors` function is correct, so we'll keep it.

2.  **Constrain Orange Spread:** The code needs to be more precise about *which* white pixels turn orange and *which* yellow pixels are affected. It should only affect pixels *directly* adjacent to the *initial* yellow pixels, and the change from yellow to orange occurs as a function of direct adjacency to an initial yellow cluster.

3. **Iterative application:** The spread is applied iteratively - white adjacent to yellow turns orange, then check the state again.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

Let's analyze the provided examples to identify specific patterns in how the transformation occurs:


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)
    
    yellow_pixels_input = np.sum(input_grid == 4)
    white_pixels_input = np.sum(input_grid == 0)
    orange_pixels_expected = np.sum(expected_output == 7)
    yellow_pixels_expected = np.sum(expected_output==4)

    print(f"Yellow Pixels (Input): {yellow_pixels_input}")
    print(f"White Pixels (Input): {white_pixels_input}")
    print(f"Orange Pixels (Expected): {orange_pixels_expected}")
    print(f"yellow Pixels (Expected):{yellow_pixels_expected}")
    print("---")

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: yellow_cluster
    color: 4
    description: One or more contiguous yellow pixels.
    initial_state: Present in the input grid.
    behavior: "If adjacent to a white pixel, the white pixel transforms to orange in the next step. If adjacent to an orange pixel that was transformed from white, the cluster remains unchanged."

  - name: white_pixel
    color: 0
    description: An empty pixel.
    initial_state: Present in the input grid.
    behavior: "Transforms to orange if adjacent to a yellow_cluster."

  - name: orange_pixel
    color: 7
    description: A pixel that was previously white.
    initial_state: Not present in the input grid (except as a result of transformation).
    behavior: "Does not further propagate the transformation after initial change from white."

actions:
  - name: transform_white_to_orange
    trigger: "Adjacency of a white_pixel to a yellow_cluster."
    result: "The white_pixel changes color to orange."
  - name: stop_yellow
    trigger: "yellow_cluster becomes adjacent to an orange_pixel that was transformed from a white_pixel"
    result: "yellow_cluster does not change to orange"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Initial Clusters:** Locate all "yellow\_clusters," which are groups of one or more connected yellow (4) pixels.

2.  **Transform Adjacent Whites:** For each yellow\_cluster, find all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right, and diagonal) white (0) pixels. Change these white pixels to orange (7).

3. **Stabilize:**  Do not change yellow clusters adjacent to newly changed orange.

The key improvement here is making explicit that we only convert white pixels *adjacent to the original yellow clusters*, and yellow remains the same.
