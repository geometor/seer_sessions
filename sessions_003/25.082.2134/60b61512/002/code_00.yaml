objects:
  - name: yellow_cluster
    color: 4
    description: One or more contiguous yellow pixels.
    initial_state: Present in the input grid.
    behavior: "If adjacent to a white pixel, the white pixel transforms to orange in the next step. If adjacent to an orange pixel that was transformed from white, the cluster remains unchanged."

  - name: white_pixel
    color: 0
    description: An empty pixel.
    initial_state: Present in the input grid.
    behavior: "Transforms to orange if adjacent to a yellow_cluster."

  - name: orange_pixel
    color: 7
    description: A pixel that was previously white.
    initial_state: Not present in the input grid (except as a result of transformation).
    behavior: "Does not further propagate the transformation after initial change from white."

actions:
  - name: transform_white_to_orange
    trigger: "Adjacency of a white_pixel to a yellow_cluster."
    result: "The white_pixel changes color to orange."
  - name: stop_yellow
    trigger: "yellow_cluster becomes adjacent to an orange_pixel that was transformed from a white_pixel"
    result: "yellow_cluster does not change to orange"
