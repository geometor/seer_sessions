            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a flawed understanding of the transformation. It correctly identified the central columns and attempted to mirror based on their contents. However, it failed to correctly mirror and also incorrectly handled rows in the center. The mirroring logic is applied incorrectly, and additional conditions, particularly the rows, are not well handled. The strategy should be to first, correct the mirroring implementation to be more robust and, second, extend it to handle edge cases in the row processing.\n\n**Information Gathering and Metrics:**\nFirst, let's clarify the understanding by focusing on some specific pixel transformations in the provided input/output pairs. I'll pay attention to the location of input pixels, and the location and value of corresponding output pixels. I'll manually inspect a few cases, then generalize.\n\n*Example 1*:\nInput:\n"
