objects:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
      - center_col1: Index of the first central column (cols // 2 - 1).
      - center_col2: Index of the second central column (cols // 2).

  - name: source_row
    description: A row in the grid with at least one non-zero value in the central two columns.
    properties:
      - index: Row index.

  - name: target_row
    description: A row in the grid with all zero values in the central two columns.
    properties:
      - index: Row index.

actions:
  - name: mirroring
    description: Replaces a segment of a target row with a mirrored segment from a source row, or transforms a target row by mirrowing with itself.
    parameters:
      - source_row_index: Index of the source row to use (if applicable).
      - target_row_index: Index of the target row.
      - center_col1: the index of the column two left of center
      - center_col2: the index of the column two right of center
    details: >
        Mirroring involves taking a two-element sequence left of the center of the row
        and another to the right. The left sequence is replaced with the
        reverse of the sequence to the right, and vice versa.

  - name: transform
    description: The main transformation process.
    steps:
      - 1: Identify source rows.
      - 2: Identify target rows.
      - 3: For each target row, if a corresponding source row is found, perform the mirroring operation using a source row.
      - 4: If no source rows are found, perform the mirroring using the target row itself.
