The transformation involves conditionally mirroring segments of rows in a grid. The condition for mirroring
is based on whether the two central columns of a row contain any non-zero values. If they do, the two
cells to the left and right of the central columns are mirrored; otherwise, the row remains unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a flawed understanding of the transformation. It correctly identified the central columns and attempted to mirror based on their contents. However, it failed to correctly mirror and also incorrectly handled rows in the center. The mirroring logic is applied incorrectly, and additional conditions, particularly the rows, are not well handled. The strategy should be to first, correct the mirroring implementation to be more robust and, second, extend it to handle edge cases in the row processing.

**Information Gathering and Metrics:**
First, let's clarify the understanding by focusing on some specific pixel transformations in the provided input/output pairs. I'll pay attention to the location of input pixels, and the location and value of corresponding output pixels. I'll manually inspect a few cases, then generalize.

*Example 1*:
Input:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 9 3 0 0
0 0 7 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Expected Output:

```
8 8 0 0 7 7
8 8 0 0 7 7
0 0 9 3 0 0
0 0 7 8 0 0
3 3 0 0 9 9
3 3 0 0 9 9
```


-   Row 0, center columns are (0, 0). Row is NOT mirrored.
-   Row 1, center columns are (0, 0). Row is NOT mirrored.
-   Row 2, center columns are (9, 3). Row is NOT mirrored.
-   Row 3, center columns are (7, 8). Row is NOT mirrored.
-	Row 4, center columns are (0, 0). Output row is '3 3 0 0 9 9'. The values (9,3) are taken from row 2 and mirrored around the center.
-	Row 5, center columns are (0, 0). Output row is '3 3 0 0 9 9'. The values (9,3) are taken from row 2 and mirrored around the center.

*Example 2*:
Input:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 4 6 0 0 0
0 2 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Expected Output:

```
1 0 0 2 2 0
0 4 6 0 0 0
0 2 1 0 0 0
6 0 0 4 4 0
6 0 0 4 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```


- Row 0: Output `1 0 0 2 2 0` comes from mirroring Row 2: `0 2 1 0 0 0`
- Row 3: Output `6 0 0 4 4 0` comes from mirroring Row 1: `0 4 6 0 0 0`
- Row 4: Output `6 0 0 4 4 0` comes from mirroring Row 1: `0 4 6 0 0 0`

*Example 3*:
Input:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 6 0 0
0 0 5 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Expected Output:

```
2 2 0 0 5 5
2 2 0 0 5 5
0 0 3 6 0 0
0 0 5 2 0 0
6 6 0 0 3 3
6 6 0 0 3 3
```

- Row 0: Output `2 2 0 0 5 5` comes from mirroring Row 3: `0 0 5 2 0 0`
- Row 1: Output `2 2 0 0 5 5` comes from mirroring Row 3: `0 0 5 2 0 0`
- Row 4: Output `6 6 0 0 3 3` comes from mirroring Row 2: `0 0 3 6 0 0`
- Row 5: Output `6 6 0 0 3 3` comes from mirroring Row 2: `0 0 3 6 0 0`

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Source Rows:** Iterate through the input grid and identify rows where at least one of the two central columns has a non-zero value. These are the "source rows".
2.  **Preserve Source Rows:** Copy the source rows directly to the output grid.
3.  **Identify Target Rows**: For any row, identify the rows where at least one of the two central columns have zero value.
4. **Process Target Rows**: Process target rows by replacing them with a mirrored version of a source row.
    -   If there are multiple source rows, alternate between them when replacing target rows, using a top to bottom processing order.
    -   Mirroring: If `R` is the source row, and `C1` and `C2` are the indices of the two central columns:
        -   The two cells to the left of the center in the target row (`C1-2` and `C1-1`) are replaced with the reversed values of the two cells to the right of the center in the source row (`C2+2` and `C2+1`).
        -   The two cells to the right of the center in the target row (`C2+1` and `C2+2`) are replaced with the reversed values of the two cells to the left of the center in the source row (`C1-1` and `C1-2`).
5. **Output:** return the transformed grid.
