The transformation involves identifying rows with non-zero values in the central columns ("source rows") and using them to replace rows with all zeros in the central columns ("target rows").

The mirroring affects a four-element segment around the center of the row.

Here's a breakdown of the errors, a strategy for improvement, and a revised natural language program:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was too simplistic and made incorrect assumptions about how the mirroring and row replacement worked. It correctly identified "source rows" (rows with non-zero values in the central two columns) and "target rows" (rows with all zeros in the central two columns). However, the mirroring logic and the conditions for applying the transformation were flawed. The main issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Mirroring Range:** The mirroring should affect elements in the two positions left of the center and two to the right. However, the way that mirroring is occurring, seems to be incorrect
2.  **Incorrect Boundary Conditions:** The boundary condition checks (`if center_col1 - 2 >= 0 and center_col2 + 3 <= cols:`) are not robust.
3.  **Incorrect Row Selection:** The assumption about which rows to use in the final output is also wrong.
4. Incorrect central column identification

Strategy for Resolution:

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine *all* training examples to understand the exact mirroring pattern and under what conditions it's applied. The test cases show that target rows may be transformed using source rows, but may also take on their own, independent mirrored reflection.
2.  **Refine Mirroring Logic:** Correct the indices involved in the mirroring operation.
3.  **Refine Row Selection Logic:** Identify when target rows receive transformed source rows, and when they transform independently
4. **Revisit boundary conditions.** Remove premature optimizations.

**Metrics Gathering (using code execution)**

    details: >
        Mirroring involves taking a two-element sequence left of the center of the row
        and another to the right. The left sequence is replaced with the
        reverse of the sequence to the right, and vice versa.

  - name: transform
    description: The main transformation process.
    steps:
      - 1: Identify source rows.
      - 2: Identify target rows.
      - 3: For each target row, if a corresponding source row is found, perform the mirroring operation using a source row.
      - 4: If no source rows are found, perform the mirroring using the target row itself.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Source and Target Rows:**
    *   Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    *   Define `center_col1` as `cols // 2 - 1` and `center_col2` as `cols // 2`.
    *   If a row has at least one non-zero value in either of the two central columns (`center_col1`, `center_col2`), classify it as a "source row".
    *   If a row has all zero values in the two central columns, classify it as a "target row".

2.  **Process Target Rows:**
    *   Iterate through each "target row".
    *   Check if there are any source rows:
    *     If there are source rows, take the current row and copy it, then transform elements around the two central columns using the mirroring rule.
        *   **Mirroring Rule**: Select elements in the `center_col1 - 2 : center_col1` range and in the `center_col2 + 1 : center_col2 + 3` range in the current target row. Reverse and swap these two sections into their opposite positions.
    *   If there are no source rows at all for the entire input grid, take each of the target rows and perform the Mirroring Rule using elements from within the target row itself

3.  **Preserve Source Rows:** Source rows remain unchanged in the output grid.

4.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the processed target rows and the original source rows.
