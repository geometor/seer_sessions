Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the discrepancies between the expected outputs and the transformed outputs:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While the idea of mirroring central columns was partially correct, the implementation failed to accurately capture the row-wise mirroring and the conditions under which this mirroring occurs. The code only mirrors the two central columns to the edges, but the transformation is more complex than that. It seems that parts of rows are being mirrored, not the entire column across the whole output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to *which* parts of the rows are mirrored and *where* they are placed in the output. The current code assumes a simple column mirroring, which is incorrect.
2.  **Identify Trigger Conditions:** The examples hint at a conditional mirroring. It's not happening for *all* rows. We need to determine the criteria that trigger the mirroring within a row. This probably has to do with a specific pattern present in the center of the row.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, we'll rewrite the natural language program to describe the *precise* row-wise mirroring and the conditions that govern it.
4.  **Revised Code:** The coder will use this revised program to develop new, more accurate code.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**

Let's analyze the differences between the expected and transformed outputs using numpy. This will give us more objective data than visual inspection.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Central Columns:** Determine the two central columns of the input grid.
2.  **Row Iteration:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  **Conditional Mirroring Check:** For each row, check if the two central columns contain any non-zero values.
4.  **Mirroring (if applicable):** If the central columns of the row *do* contain non-zero values:
    *   Identify the segment of two cells to the *left* of the two central columns.
    *   Identify the segment of two cells to the *right* of the two central columns.
    *   Mirror the right segment by reversing the values of the two cells and place the reflected values in the two cells to the left of center.
    *   Mirror the left segment by reversing the values of the two cells and place the reflected values int he two cells to the right of the center.
5.  **Row Preservation (if not applicable):** If the central columns of the row contain only zeros, leave the entire row unchanged in the output grid.
6.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying steps 2-5 to all rows of the input grid.

**Summary of Differences and Key Insights**

The code execution and analysis reveal important details.

*   It is not the *entire* row that is mirrored, it is sections to the left and right.
*   It is specifically two cells being mirrored.
*   The "trigger" condition is the presence of non-zero elements in the *two* central columns of each row. This explains why some rows are mirrored and others aren't. The prior code missed this critical condition and the two-element constraint.

The new natural language program captures the row-segment mirroring and the crucial condition based on the central elements, providing much more accurate details.
