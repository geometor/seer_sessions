            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the discrepancies between the expected outputs and the transformed outputs:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While the idea of mirroring central columns was partially correct, the implementation failed to accurately capture the row-wise mirroring and the conditions under which this mirroring occurs. The code only mirrors the two central columns to the edges, but the transformation is more complex than that. It seems that parts of rows are being mirrored, not the entire column across the whole output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to *which* parts of the rows are mirrored and *where* they are placed in the output. The current code assumes a simple column mirroring, which is incorrect.\n2.  **Identify Trigger Conditions:** The examples hint at a conditional mirroring. It's not happening for *all* rows. We need to determine the criteria that trigger the mirroring within a row. This probably has to do with a specific pattern present in the center of the row.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, we'll rewrite the natural language program to describe the *precise* row-wise mirroring and the conditions that govern it.\n4.  **Revised Code:** The coder will use this revised program to develop new, more accurate code.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nLet's analyze the differences between the expected and transformed outputs using numpy. This will give us more objective data than visual inspection.\n\n"
