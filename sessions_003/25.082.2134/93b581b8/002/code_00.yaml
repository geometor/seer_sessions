facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves a conditional mirroring of row segments.
  - object_identification:
      - object: Row segments
        properties:
          - type: Sub-arrays of the input grid
          - characteristic: Can be mirrored
  - mirroring_condition:
      - condition: |
          Rows containing non-zero values in the two central columns are candidates for mirroring.
      - details: |
          The two central columns act as a "pivot" for the mirroring.
  - mirroring_action:
    - action: |
        If a row is a candidate for mirroring, the segments to the left and right of the two central
         columns are mirrored. The left two become a mirror of the right two, in reverse order.
    - specifics:
        - left_segment: |
            The two cells to the left of the central columns are replaced with mirror of the
            two cells to the right of the center.
        - right_segment: |
            The two cells to the right of the central columns are replaced by a mirror of the
            two cells to the left of the central columns
  - row_invariance:
      - condition: |
          Rows with only zeros in the two central columns remain unchanged.
  - grid_size:
      - columns: Even number of columns.
      - note: this is required to allow for "two central columns"
