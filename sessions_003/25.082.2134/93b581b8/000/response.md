Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and try to discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids (matrices) of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair.
*   The transformation seems to involve mirroring and potentially inverting certain portions of the input grid. It is likely row and or column based.
*   The '0' (white) pixels seem to act as a background or separator.
*    A distinct pattern is visible, it appears like some elements from the input grid are replicated and repositioned in the output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x6 (all examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - type: sub-grid
    properties:
     - description: contiguous block of same value
     - relationship: inside the full grid
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: mapped from value

actions:
  - name: mirror_and_invert
    description: The core and right columns are mirrored, then the order of these two pairs are swapped.
    parameters:
      - axis: horizontal or vertical (to be determined)

relationships:
   - type: Input-Output
     description: the output is derived from the input by a transformation

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Center:** Divide the input grid in half, by columns.
2.  **Mirror:** the right two center columns are mirrored to the left two columns.
3.  **Mirror:** the left two center columns are mirrored to the right two columns.
4. **Swap:** switch position of the pairs of new copied column (left pair to right and vice-versa)

In simple terms, the input grid's central columns are used as a source. Copies are created of those rows by reflecting the content, and placing them on the edge.
