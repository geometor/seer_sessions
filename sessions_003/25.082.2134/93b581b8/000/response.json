Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids (matrices) of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair.\n*   The transformation seems to involve mirroring and potentially inverting certain portions of the input grid. It is likely row and or column based.\n*   The '0' (white) pixels seem to act as a background or separator.\n*    A distinct pattern is visible, it appears like some elements from the input grid are replicated and repositioned in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
