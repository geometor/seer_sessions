Specifically, I notice:\n\n*   **Colors:** The input grids contain various colors (represented by digits 0-9). The output grids mostly retain the input grids' structure, but with an addition of yellow (4) pixels in the last non-empty row of input.\n*   **Shapes:**\u00a0There are no specific geometric shapes formed other than lines of color. The key seems to be the row structure.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The most important spatial relationship appears to be \"last non-empty row,\".\n*    **Conditional change:** Yellow is placed in the last row, and it appears to be a conditional replacement based on whether the rows above had only empty(0) color or some colored blocks.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Examine it and move on to next step if it is all empty (all zeros).\n3.  **Iterate Columns:** For each column, do the following:\n    a. Check cells of the input grid starting from the first row to the second-to-last row: if they are all zero, keep zero in the last row of that column\n    b. If you find any non-zero color along the column, change the last row of the output grid to yellow(4) for that column.\n\nIn essence, the program copies the input, then conditionally adds yellow pixels in the last non-empty row if, the respective column contains a non-zero pixel.\n"
