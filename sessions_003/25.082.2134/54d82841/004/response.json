            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was close but made a consistent error in applying the yellow (4) color to the last row. It seems the code applied the yellow to the entire last row *if any non-zero pixel existed in the column*, instead of only applying the yellow *directly below* a non-zero pixel in the column. The strategy will be to focus on correcting this \"column-wise\" application of the yellow color to be more precise, pixel by pixel.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nI'll use a manual approach to gather metrics (since I am the dreamer, I don't write code), but my descriptions should be clear enough for the coder agent to create verification code.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)\n    *   Output Shape: (8, 8)\n    *   Pixels Off: 4 (Columns 2,3,4,6,7,8 are incorrect)\n    *   Error Description: Yellow pixels are incorrectly placed in the last row. Column 3 and 7 should have a yellow pixel, but the rest should not.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Pixels Off: 2 (column 2 and 4 incorrect)\n    *   Error Description: Yellow pixels in the last row are incorrectly placed. columns 3 should have yellow.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Pixels Off: 4 (columns 2,3,4,5,6 incorrect)\n    *   Error Description: Incorrect yellow placement. column 3 and 6 should have yellow\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Previous attempt did modify all of the last row if ANY non-zero pixel has been found in the entire grid.\n"
