      - description: The region within the grid containing all non-zero pixels.

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_region
    input: grid

  - name: modify_row
    input: [grid, non_zero_region]
    output: modified_grid
    description: >
        Sets pixels in a specific row of the grid to yellow (4).
