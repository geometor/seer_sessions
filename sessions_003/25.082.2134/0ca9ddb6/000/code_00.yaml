facts:
  - observation: "The input grids contain single instances of blue (1), red (2), magenta (6) pixels in otherwise all white (0) grids"
  - observation: "The input grid dimensions are 9x9. The output grid dimensions are also 9x9."
  - observation: "There are new colours in the output, specifically yellow (4) and orange (7)."
  - observation: "The original colors (blue, red, magenta) stay in place."
  - observation: "Orange pixels (7) appear next to blue pixels (1). Three orange 7 are placed cardinally adjacent to it."
  - observation: "Yellow (4) is added. It appears in rows where a red (2) existed and has two copies, cardinally adjacent, horizontally with a white pixel (0) in between."
  - action: "The output is constructed by adding yellow and orange pixels relative to red and blue in the input."
