The most prominent changes seem to revolve around the locations of specific colors (blue, red, magenta, represented by digits 1, 2 and 6) and adding orange and gray in specific places. It is also possible that yellow (4) plays an intermediate role in generating the new color.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The output grid dimensions are also 9x9.\"\n  - observation: \"There are new colours in the output, specifically yellow (4) and orange (7).\"\n  - observation: \"The original colors (blue, red, magenta) stay in place.\"\n  - observation: \"Orange pixels (7) appear next to blue pixels (1). Three orange 7 are placed cardinally adjacent to it.\"\n  - observation: \"Yellow (4) is added. It appears in rows where a red (2) existed and has two copies, cardinally adjacent, horizontally with a white pixel (0) in between.\"\n  - action: \"The output is constructed by adding yellow and orange pixels relative to red and blue in the input.\"\n```"

All colors stay in the same place.\n2.  **Add Yellow (4)**: For each red pixel (2) in the input:\n    *   Place a yellow pixel (4) one row directly above the original red one, in the same column.\n    *   Place a yellow pixel (4) one column to the left of first yellow one (if possible).\n    *   Place a yellow pixel (4) one column to the right of the first yellow one (if possible).\n3.  **Add Orange (7):** For each blue (1) pixel:\n    *   Place three orange (7) pixels cardinally adjacent to the blue, below, left and right.\n    *   If an orange (7) has to be placed in the location of another, the original takes precedence, so orange is not added.\n    *   Orange only added adjacent to blue, yellow only added adjacent to red.\n\nIn other words, red introduces yellow, and blue introduces orange. The transformation adds color objects around some of the existing ones.\n"
