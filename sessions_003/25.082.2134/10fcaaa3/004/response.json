            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a reasonable, but incomplete, interpretation of the transformation. The core idea of expanding each pixel to a 2x2 block and using azure (8) as a \"marker\" is partially correct. However, the placement and replication logic is flawed, as evidenced by the mismatches in all test examples. The errors aren't random; there's a systematic misinterpretation of how the 2x2 blocks are constructed and filled. The strategy should be:\n\n1. **Re-examine Block Construction:**  The current code places '8' at the top-left and replicates the original pixel *conditionally*. We need to re-evaluate the examples to see if this conditional replication is the *actual* rule. The placement of the '8' also needs to be reconfirmed.\n2. **Focus on Relative Positions:** Instead of just thinking about \"top-left,\" \"bottom-right,\" etc., we should analyze the *relative* positions of the '8' and the original pixel's color within the 2x2 block *in relation to the original pixel's position in the input*.\n3. **Iterative Debugging:** Use the `tool_code` to construct small test cases that isolate specific aspects of the transformation (e.g., a single non-zero pixel, a single zero pixel, a 2x2 block of mixed values) and compare the expected and actual output.\n4. **YAML for clarity**: create clear objects to examine the details.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary)**\n\nLet's review each example individually and then look for cross-example patterns. I will focus first in a detailed report of the first example, followed by summary of issues with the other examples.\n\n**Example 1 Detailed Analysis**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    "
