      - name: input_grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable (smaller)
          - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - name: output_grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable (larger than input_grid)
          - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - name: non_zero_pixels
        properties:
          - description: Pixels in the input grid with a value other than 0.
          - color: variable (depends on input)
          - behavior: replicated in a pattern in the output grid
      - name: azure_pixels
        properties:
          - description: Pixels with the value 8 (azure).
          - color: azure (8)
          - behavior: appear in specific pattern, seemingly related to input non zero object location.
  - actions:
      - name: replication
        description: The non-zero pixels from the input grid are repeated in the output grid.
      - name: framing_pattern
        description: Azure (8) pixels appear in the locations of non zero objects in input grid, seemingly expanding or framing them.
      - name: output_expansion:
        description: output_grid dimensions seem to always be a multiplication of input_grid.
  - relationships:
      - description: non_zero_pixels appear with a frame of azure.
      - description: output_grid is larger than input_grid
