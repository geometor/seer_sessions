Here's my breakdown of the task, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program.\n\n**Perception of the Elements**\n\nThe task involves transforming a smaller input grid into a larger output grid. The most prominent feature is the appearance of the color azure (8) in the output grids, seemingly surrounding or framing existing colors from the input, or existing in locations of the grid. The relationship between existing object size and repetition, and the introduced object, seem important.\n\n**YAML Block Documentation of Facts**\n\n"
