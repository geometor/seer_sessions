Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program.

**Perception of the Elements**

The task involves transforming a smaller input grid into a larger output grid. The most prominent feature is the appearance of the color azure (8) in the output grids, seemingly surrounding or framing existing colors from the input, or existing in locations of the grid. The relationship between existing object size and repetition, and the introduced object, seem important.

**YAML Block Documentation of Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_types:
      - name: input_grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable (smaller)
          - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - name: output_grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable (larger than input_grid)
          - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - name: non_zero_pixels
        properties:
          - description: Pixels in the input grid with a value other than 0.
          - color: variable (depends on input)
          - behavior: replicated in a pattern in the output grid
      - name: azure_pixels
        properties:
          - description: Pixels with the value 8 (azure).
          - color: azure (8)
          - behavior: appear in specific pattern, seemingly related to input non zero object location.
  - actions:
      - name: replication
        description: The non-zero pixels from the input grid are repeated in the output grid.
      - name: framing_pattern
        description: Azure (8) pixels appear in the locations of non zero objects in input grid, seemingly expanding or framing them.
      - name: output_expansion:
        description: output_grid dimensions seem to always be a multiplication of input_grid.
  - relationships:
      - description: non_zero_pixels appear with a frame of azure.
      - description: output_grid is larger than input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0.

2.  **Determine expansion rate:** find the multiplier of both the height and width between the input and output grids

3.  **Replicate Non-Zero Pixels:** the non-zero input pixels exist in the output grid, duplicated but with a row or column of space between them.

4.  **Place Azure Pixels**: place azure pixels adjacent to non-zero pixels, including corners. The locations of non-zero pixels of input are now azure pixels.

5. **Expansion:** The output grid dimensions will always be an expansion of the input grid.
