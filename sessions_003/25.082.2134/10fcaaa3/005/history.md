The transformation rule involves expanding each pixel from the input grid into a 2x2 block in the output grid. The top-left pixel of each 2x2 block is azure (8). If the original input pixel is non-zero, the remaining three pixels of the 2x2 block match the original pixel's color. If the original input pixel is zero, the remaining three pixels of the 2x2 block are also zero.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a reasonable, but incomplete, interpretation of the transformation. The core idea of expanding each pixel to a 2x2 block and using azure (8) as a "marker" is partially correct. However, the placement and replication logic is flawed, as evidenced by the mismatches in all test examples. The errors aren't random; there's a systematic misinterpretation of how the 2x2 blocks are constructed and filled. The strategy should be:

1. **Re-examine Block Construction:**  The current code places '8' at the top-left and replicates the original pixel *conditionally*. We need to re-evaluate the examples to see if this conditional replication is the *actual* rule. The placement of the '8' also needs to be reconfirmed.
2. **Focus on Relative Positions:** Instead of just thinking about "top-left," "bottom-right," etc., we should analyze the *relative* positions of the '8' and the original pixel's color within the 2x2 block *in relation to the original pixel's position in the input*.
3. **Iterative Debugging:** Use the `tool_code` to construct small test cases that isolate specific aspects of the transformation (e.g., a single non-zero pixel, a single zero pixel, a 2x2 block of mixed values) and compare the expected and actual output.
4. **YAML for clarity**: create clear objects to examine the details.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary)**

Let's review each example individually and then look for cross-example patterns. I will focus first in a detailed report of the first example, followed by summary of issues with the other examples.

**Example 1 Detailed Analysis**

*   **Input:**
    
```
    0 0 0 0
    0 5 0 0
    ```


*   **Expected Output:**
    
```
    8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    8 0 8 5 8 0 8 0
    0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0
    ```

* **Transformed Output:**

    
```
    8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    8 0 8 5 8 0 8 0
    0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0
    ```


*Differences and Key Observations*:
Original Pixel (1,1) = 5. Expected 2x2 block:

```
8 0
0 5
```


Transformed 2x2 Block:

```
8 0
0 0
```

Then:

```
8 5
5 5
```


* **YAML for first example input (1,1) cell value = 5**


```yaml
object: pixel_block
original_position: (1, 1)
original_value: 5
expected_2x2_block:
  top_left: 8
  top_right: 0
  bottom_left: 0
  bottom_right: 5
transformed_2x2_block_part_1:
  top_left: 8
  top_right: 0
  bottom_left: 0
  bottom_right: 0
transformed_2x2_block_part_2:
    top_left: 8
    top_right: 5
    bottom_left: 5
    bottom_right: 5
```


**Example 2, 3, 4 summary**
The remaining examples show the same consistent error, the code is generating the correct dimensions, but the placement of the transformed pixels is incorrect.

**Revised YAML (General)**


```yaml
transformation_type: pixel_expansion
expansion_factor: 2x2
marker_pixel:
  value: 8
  relative_position: top_left
original_pixel_replication:
  condition: always # if original pixel is non-zero
  relative_position_if_nonzero: bottom_right
  relative_position_if_zero: none
zero_pixel_fill:
    relative_position: [top_right, bottom_left]

```


**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Expansion:** Each pixel in the input grid is transformed into a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid.

2.  **Marker:** The top-left pixel of each 2x2 block is *always* set to azure (8).

3. **Original value replication**:
    - when the original value is not zero, the bottom right pixel is set to the
      original value
    - when the original value is zero, do not change the bottom right pixel

4.  **Zero Fill:**
    - The top-right and bottom-left pixels of the 2x2 block are *always* set to 0.
