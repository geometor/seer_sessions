  - description: "The output grid dimensions are always double the input grid dimensions."
    type: scaling
    properties:
      height_ratio: 2.0
      width_ratio: 2.0

  - description: "Non-zero pixels in the input grid are replicated in the output grid."
    type: replication

      placement: "Each non-zero pixel maps to a 2x2 block of the same color in output"

  - description: "Azure (8) pixels are placed in the output grid based on the original positions of all input pixels."
    type: azure_placement
    properties:
        pattern: |-
            1.  Every pixel location in the input grid, regardless if zero or non-zero, becomes a 2x2 block in the output grid.
            2. The top-left pixel within each 2x2 block in output will be azure (8).
            3.  If input pixel is non-zero, remaining 3 pixels of 2x2 block become the same value.
            4.  If input pixel is zero, remining 3 pixels of 2x2 block will be zero.
