The subsequent tests revealed inconsistencies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs. The primary issue is the incorrect replication of the original pixel values and handling of zero values, particularly in the bottom-right pixel of each 2x2 block. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine each example where the transformed output differs from the expected output. Identify the specific pixels that are incorrect.\n2.  **Refine the Rule:** Adjust the natural language program to correctly describe the placement of the azure marker, zeros, and the original pixel values, fixing the identified errors.\n3. **Bottom-Right**: Modify this rule, copying across the original pixel if it is not zero. Do not modify this when it is zero.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**\nTo obtain a clearer and automated understanding, I will provide metrics for later review.\n\n**YAML Fact Base**\n\n"
