facts:
  - observation: |
      Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid.
  - property:
      size: The output grid is always twice the height and width of the input grid.
  - object:
      input_pixel: An element (pixel) in the input grid.
  - object:
      output_block: A 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid, corresponding to an input pixel.
  - property:
      top_left: The top-left pixel of each output_block is always azure (8).
  - property:
      top_right: The top-right pixel of each output_block is always black (0).
  - property:
      bottom_left: The bottom-left pixel of each output_block is always black (0).
  - property:
      bottom_right_behavior: |
        If input_pixel value is not 0, bottom_right pixel of output_block takes the value of the original input_pixel.
        If input_pixel is 0, bottom_right is 0.
