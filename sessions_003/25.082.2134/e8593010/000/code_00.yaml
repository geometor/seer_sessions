  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - color_representation:  {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - color_representation: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}
  - observation: color_change
    description: "White (0) pixels in the input grid are replaced, and sometimes adjacent gray (5) pixels, with a seemingly patterned arrangement of other colors in output_grid"
  - observation: "white_pixel_replacement_colors"
    description: "The replacement colors around original white pixels follow an identifiable ordering"
  - observation: spatial_relationship
    description: "The transformation is local - the changes are in and around where the white pixels are in the input"
  - observation: "dimension_preservation"
    description: "The dimensions of the grid are identical between input and output"
