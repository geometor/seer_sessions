The predominant color in all inputs is gray (5), with scattered pixels of white (0).  The outputs introduce several new colors: blue (1), red (2), green (3), and in some cases azure (8). The changes seem to be localized around the white (0) pixels in the input. The shapes formed by white pixels are not maintained, rather, some white pixels become a core around which other colors are placed.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts**\n\n"
