1.  **Identify White Pixels:** Locate all pixels within the input grid that have a value of 0 (representing the color white).

2.  **Conditional Color Transformation (Parity-Based):** For each identified white pixel, determine the parity (evenness or oddness) of its row index and column index. Apply the following transformation rules:

    *   If *both* the row and column indices are even, replace the white pixel with the color red (value 2).
    *   If *both* the row and column indices are odd, replace the white pixel with the color green (value 3).
    *   If the row index is even and the column index is odd, replace the white pixel with the color blue (value 1).
    *   If the row index is odd and the column index is even, replace the white pixel with the color blue (value 1).

3.  **Preservation of Non-White Pixels:** All pixels in the original input grid that are *not* white (i.e., have values other than 0) remain unchanged in the output grid.

4. **Output** The final output is a new grid where all identified transformations have been implemented.
