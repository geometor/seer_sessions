facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (small)
      - elements: single-digit integers (colors)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (larger than input)
      - elements: single-digit integers (colors)
      - structure: tiled replication of input_grid

  - relation: expansion
    properties:
      - factor: 3x3 (each input cell expands to a 3x3 block in output)
      - type: replication of input cells' color

  - action: transform
    description: input_grid is transformed into output_grid by expanding each cell into a 3x3 block of the same color.
