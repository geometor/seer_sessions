The core elements appear to be:\n\n*   **Input Grid:** A small 2D array of single-digit integers (colors).\n*   **Output Grid:** A larger 2D array, also of single-digit integers.  It seems to be a patterned expansion of the input grid.\n*   **Colors:** Each digit represents a color. The output grid maintains the colors present in the input grid.\n*   **Expansion:** The input grid seems to be replicated and tiled to form the output grid. The replication factor appears uniform. Each cell in the input becomes 3x3 block.\n* **Object as Cell:** Considering single color cell as an object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
