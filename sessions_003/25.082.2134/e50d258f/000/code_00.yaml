facts:
  - observation: Input is a 2D grid of integers (pixels).
  - observation: Output is a 2D grid of integers (pixels).
  - observation: Output grid dimensions are smaller or equal to the input grid dimensions.
  - observation: The background color of the input is 0 (white).
  - observation: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - observation: The output subgrid consists of all contiguous non-zero values.
  - observation: The output excludes complete rows or columns of 0s that form a border around the object
  - observation: the subgrid does not maintain the original x,y of the input - i.e. it is translated to 0,0
