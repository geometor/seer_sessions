The subgrid seems to be defined by the largest contiguous non-zero region within the input. The background is consistently color 0 (white). The subgrids contain various colors and shapes, but always exclude any rows or columns that consist entirely of 0.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Effectively, this means finding the edges of the smallest rectangle possible with the content.\n2.  **Extract the subgrid:** Create a new grid using the dimensions derived from the bounding box. Copy the corresponding pixel values from the input grid to the output grid.\n3. **Translate to origin:** the top-left corner of extracted grid should begin at 0,0\n\nEssentially, the rule is to crop the input grid to the smallest rectangle containing all non-zero pixels.\n"
