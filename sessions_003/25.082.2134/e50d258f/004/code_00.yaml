  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - object_id: output_shape
        type: rectangle
        color: mixed (2, 8, 1) # Colors present in the output
        description: The output is a rectangular section of the input. The defining feature isn't *all* non-zero pixels, but a specific cluster.  It appears to be defined by a contiguous region of non-zero, and non-background pixels.

  - example_id: 2
    objects:
      - object_id: output_cluster
        type: rectangle
        color: mixed (2)
        description: The output is a small rectangular cluster of color 2, with a tail.  It's a subregion within a larger area of various colors.

  - example_id: 3
    objects:
      - object_id: output_region
        type: rectangle
        color: mixed (1, 2, 8)
        description: A larger rectangular extract, containing multiple colors, but still significantly smaller than the input. The selection seems to prioritize a region containing color '8', possibly a rectangle.
