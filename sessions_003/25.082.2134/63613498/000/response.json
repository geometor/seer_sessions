The most prominent feature is the presence of horizontal lines of pixels of the same color, often interrupted by stretches of white (0) pixels. Some of these lines seem to be unaffected by the transformation. Specifically, color 5 (gray) lines are seemingly unchanged. There appears to be a consistent replacement of one color by another nearby, but only for certain colors. It is a local operation.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
