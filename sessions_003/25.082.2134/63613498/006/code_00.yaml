objects:
  - name: pixel_group
    description: A contiguous set of pixels of the same color (excluding white).  Contiguous means pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    properties:
      color: The color of the pixels in the group (integer 0-9).
      locations: A list of (row, col) tuples representing the coordinates of each pixel in the group.
      adjacent_to_gray: A boolean indicating whether *any* pixel in the group is adjacent to a gray (5) pixel.

actions:
  - name: change_color
    description: Changes the color of all pixels within a pixel group.
    preconditions:
      - If pixel_group.color == 9, then always change.
      - If pixel_group.color in [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8], change only if adjacent_to_gray is False.
    postconditions:
      - pixel_group.color becomes 5 (gray).
