```python
"""
Transforms an input grid by changing the color of pixels based on their adjacency to gray (5) pixels.

1. Identify Pixel Groups: Divide the input grid into connected groups of pixels.
   A "connected group" is a set of pixels of the same color where each pixel is
   directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one
   other pixel in the group. Exclude white pixels (color 0).
2. Check for Gray Adjacency: For each identified pixel group, determine if *any*
   of its pixels are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a gray
   pixel (color 5).
3. Apply Color Change Rules:
    * If a pixel group has the color 9 (maroon), change all pixels in that group to 5 (gray).
    * If a pixel group has a color in the set [1 (blue), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta), 7 (orange), 8 (azure)],
      and *none* of the pixels in that group are adjacent to a gray pixel, change all pixels in that group to 5 (gray).
    * Otherwise, the pixel group's color remains unchanged.
