objects:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels, each with a color value (0-9).
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
      - pixels: Individual color values within the grid.

  - name: pixel_group # Changed from horizontal_line
    description: a set of connected pixels
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the group.
      - locations: A list of (row, col) coordinates for each pixel.
      - adjacent_to_gray:  Boolean, True if any pixel in the group is next to a gray pixel, False otherwise. # all directions

actions:
  - name: identify_pixel_group
    description:  Locates all connected sets of the same non-white color
    input: grid
    output: list of pixel groups

  - name: check_adjacency
    description: Determines if a pixel group is adjacent to a gray (5) pixel in any of the eight directions.
    input:  grid, pixel group
    output: Boolean (adjacent_to_gray)

  - name: transform_color
    description: Changes the color of pixels in a pixel group based on color and if they are adjacent_to_gray
    input: grid, list of pixel_groups
    output: transformed grid

rules:
  - "All pixels with color 9 are changed to 5"
  - "Pixels with color in [1,3,4,6,7,8] are changed to gray (5) IFF they are NOT adjacent to a gray pixel"
