            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and focused on horizontal lines and adjacency to gray (5) pixels. The results show that the code doesn't correctly handle all cases, especially in examples 1 and 3, the code seems to incorrectly change colors, it also shows that the adjacent check only performs checks to the left and right of the pixel line. The core issue is that the transformation rule is incomplete and needs to consider a more comprehensive definition of adjacency (not just horizontal) and potentially other factors beyond simple adjacency.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Gather Metrics:** Analyze each example to pinpoint exactly where the code's output deviates from the expected output.\n2.  **Refine Adjacency:** Expand the `is_adjacent_to_gray` function to check for adjacency in all eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).\n3.  **Revisit the Rules:** Based on a more accurate adjacency check, re-evaluate the color transformation rules. It appears there's a conditional replacement: colors are sometimes replaced by gray (5) and sometimes not, and adjacency to existing gray pixels is a key factor.\n4.  **Horizontal line is only an assumption:** At the current moment the fact we have decided to detect horizontal is just and assumption.\n5.  **Document and Program:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the refined understanding.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Detailed Analysis**\n\nHere is a detailed analysis by comparing the `input_grid` and `expected_output`\n"
