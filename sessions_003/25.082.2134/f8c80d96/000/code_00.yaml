facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Input grids contain pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - observation: Output grids mostly consist of '5' (gray), and the colors presented at non-zero locations of the input grid.
  - observation: '0' (white) in the input is often, but not always, replaced by '5' (gray) in the output.
  - observation: Non-zero pixels in the input grid seem to influence the replacement of '0' pixels.
  - hypothesis:  A rule determines when a '0' is replaced by a '5' or by the color of non-zero adjacent cells. The rule will prioritize non-zero colored pixels, starting from left.
