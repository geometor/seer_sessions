            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The most prominent feature seems to be the replacement of '0' (white) pixels with '5' (gray) pixels. However, this replacement isn't uniform. It appears to be conditional, related to the positions and potentially the colors of non-zero pixels in the input grid. The non-zero pixels in the input grid could define some areas or borders where the '0' replacement rule applied, the pixels outside of that will be replaced by the color to the left, or by 5, if the color to the left is also 0.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

            "text": "```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n  - observation: Input grids contain pixels of various colors (0-9).\n  - observation: Output grids mostly consist of '5' (gray), and the colors presented at non-zero locations of the input grid.\n  - observation: '0' (white) in the input is often, but not always, replaced by '5' (gray) in the output.\n  - observation: Non-zero pixels in the input grid seem to influence the replacement of '0' pixels.\n  - hypothesis:  A rule determines when a '0' is replaced by a '5' or by the color of non-zero adjacent cells. The rule will prioritize non-zero colored pixels, starting from left.\n```"

The rule seems to be, replace 0's with the closest non-zero color to its left. If there are no non-zero colors to the left, the cell becomes 5.\n"
