Previous Code:
```python
"""
Replaces '0' (white) pixels in the input grid based on these rules:

1. Leading Zeros: At the beginning of each row, before any non-zero pixel:
    - If the first non-zero color is 8, replace leading zeros with 5.
    - If the first non-zero color is 1 and all non-zero values in the row are 1, replace with 5.
    - If the first non-zero color is 2 and all non-zero values in the row are 2, replace with 5.
    - Otherwise, replace leading zeros with the first non-zero color.
2. Propagation: For remaining '0's, replace them with the value of the nearest non-zero pixel to their left within that row.
3. All-Zero Rows: If a row is all '0's after step 1:
    - If the previous row is uniform (all same non-zero color) and did *not* derive its color from *its* previous row, set the current row to the previous row's color.
    - Otherwise, set the row to '5'. The very first row, if all zeros, is always set to '5'.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed to correctly transform all three training examples. The core issues seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Propagation:** The propagation rule (filling '0's with the nearest non-zero value to the left) isn't consistently applied or is overridden by other rules.
2.  **Inaccurate All-Zero Row Handling:** The logic for handling all-zero rows, especially the dependency on the previous row's uniformity and derivation, is not correctly capturing the observed pattern in the examples. There seems to be a propagation of uniformity downwards, as shown in example 3.
3. **Incorrect Leading Zero Replacement** The replacement criteria is too complex - particularly the use of `_all_non_zero_same`
The first training examples is incorrect with pixel differences, and the other
two are showing as "None".

The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Simplify the Leading Zero Logic**: Remove checking all non-zeros for
    sameness
2.  **Re-evaluate Propagation:** Ensure propagation works correctly *after* the initial leading-zero replacement.
3.  **Revise All-Zero Row Logic:** Focus on propagating the uniform color of the *previous* row downwards if the previous row is uniform, but only if it did not *itself* get its color from *its* previous row. The first all-zero row will be 5

**Metrics and Observations**

Let's get precise pixel differences.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Leading Zeros:** At the beginning of each row (before any non-zero pixel), replace all '0' (white) pixels with '5' (gray) *unless* a different non-zero color is encountered first. If a different non-zero color is encountered first, replace the leading zeros with that color.

2.  **Propagation:** After processing leading zeros, replace any remaining '0' pixels in each row with the value of the nearest non-zero pixel to their left within the same row.

3.  **All-Zero Rows:**
    *   If a row is entirely composed of '0's *after* the leading zero replacement, check the row immediately above it.
    *   If the preceding row has a uniform color (all pixels in that row have the same non-zero color) AND that row's color was *not* derived from its own preceding row, set the current all-zero row to that same uniform color.
    *   Otherwise (if the preceding row is not uniform, or if it was itself derived from its preceding row, or if it is the first row), set the current all-zero row to '5' (gray).

This revised program simplifies the leading zero replacement rule, keeps the propagation rule, and clarifies/corrects the handling of all-zero rows.
