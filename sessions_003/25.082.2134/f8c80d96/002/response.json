            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple rule: replace '0' with '5' or the nearest non-zero pixel to the left. However, the results of testing on all three examples show that this rule is incorrect and needs refinement. The expected outputs reveal a more complex pattern involving the propagation of non-zero values and potentially some alternating behavior or filling based on row position relative to non-zero pixels. It's not a simple left-to-right replacement. The strategy will be to carefully examine each input-output pair, determine precisely how zeros are being replaced, and identify any contextual dependencies.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's create a detailed observation of the examples:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains a row of '8's (azure) and scattered '8's in other rows. Many '0's (white).\n*   **Output:** '0's are replaced by '8' if there are any '8's in that line. White pixels at the beginning of each row are converted to 5.\n*   **Mismatch:** The code replaces all '0's in a row with the leftmost non-zero color. It doesn't consider filling the leading zeros with gray.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains '1's (blue) in specific columns, with '0's elsewhere.\n*   **Output**: Leading zeros become 5. Zeros to the right of the first non-zero digit copy it.\n*   **Mismatch:** Similar to Example 1, the code fails at propagating colors correctly and handling leading zeros.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** Alternating '2's (red) and '0's in the first few rows.\n*   **Output:**  Leading zeros become 5. Zeros to the right of the first non-zero digit copy it. Rows with all zeros can either be all 5 or match the color of the line above.\n*   **Mismatch:** The code copies too much and doesn't handle cases where an all zero line must become non-zero.\n\n**YAML Fact Base:**\n\n"

It's more complex than the original, reflecting the increased understanding from analyzing all three examples.\n"
