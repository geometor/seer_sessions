    postconditions:
      - Leading zeros are replaced by '5' or the first non-zero color.
    rules:

        then: replace with '5' up to that index
      - elif: First non-zero color in row is '1', and the all of the non zero values in the row are 1.
        then: replace with a '5' up to that index
      - elif: First non-zero in row '2', and all of the non-zero values in the row are 2.

    preconditions:
      - object: row
      - condition: Contains '0' values after the first non-zero value.
    postconditions:
      - '0' values are replaced by the nearest non-zero value to their left.

    preconditions:
      - object: row
      - condition: All elements are '0'.
    postconditions:
      - Row is filled with '5' or the uniform color of the preceding row (under certain conditions).
    rules:

        then: set all elements to the previous row's uniform color.

        then: set all pixels to '5'
      - else: set all pixels to '5'.
