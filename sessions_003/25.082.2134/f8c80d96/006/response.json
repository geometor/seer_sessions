The core issues seem to stem from:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Propagation:** The propagation rule (filling '0's with the nearest non-zero value to the left) isn't consistently applied or is overridden by other rules.\n2.  **Inaccurate All-Zero Row Handling:** The logic for handling all-zero rows, especially the dependency on the previous row's uniformity and derivation, is not correctly capturing the observed pattern in the examples. There seems to be a propagation of uniformity downwards, as shown in example 3.\n3. **Incorrect Leading Zero Replacement** The replacement criteria is too complex - particularly the use of `_all_non_zero_same`\nThe first training examples is incorrect with pixel differences, and the other\ntwo are showing as \"None\".\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Leading Zero Logic**: Remove checking all non-zeros for\n    sameness\n2.  **Re-evaluate Propagation:** Ensure propagation works correctly *after* the initial leading-zero replacement.\n3.  **Revise All-Zero Row Logic:** Focus on propagating the uniform color of the *previous* row downwards if the previous row is uniform, but only if it did not *itself* get its color from *its* previous row. The first all-zero row will be 5\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nLet's get precise pixel differences.\n\n"
