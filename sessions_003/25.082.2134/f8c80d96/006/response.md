Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed to correctly transform all three training examples. The core issues seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Propagation:** The propagation rule (filling '0's with the nearest non-zero value to the left) isn't consistently applied or is overridden by other rules.
2.  **Inaccurate All-Zero Row Handling:** The logic for handling all-zero rows, especially the dependency on the previous row's uniformity and derivation, is not correctly capturing the observed pattern in the examples. There seems to be a propagation of uniformity downwards, as shown in example 3.
3. **Incorrect Leading Zero Replacement** The replacement criteria is too complex - particularly the use of `_all_non_zero_same`
The first training examples is incorrect with pixel differences, and the other
two are showing as "None".

The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Simplify the Leading Zero Logic**: Remove checking all non-zeros for
    sameness
2.  **Re-evaluate Propagation:** Ensure propagation works correctly *after* the initial leading-zero replacement.
3.  **Revise All-Zero Row Logic:** Focus on propagating the uniform color of the *previous* row downwards if the previous row is uniform, but only if it did not *itself* get its color from *its* previous row. The first all-zero row will be 5

**Metrics and Observations**

Let's get precise pixel differences.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Leading Zeros:** At the beginning of each row (before any non-zero pixel), replace all '0' (white) pixels with '5' (gray) *unless* a different non-zero color is encountered first. If a different non-zero color is encountered first, replace the leading zeros with that color.

2.  **Propagation:** After processing leading zeros, replace any remaining '0' pixels in each row with the value of the nearest non-zero pixel to their left within the same row.

3.  **All-Zero Rows:**
    *   If a row is entirely composed of '0's *after* the leading zero replacement, check the row immediately above it.
    *   If the preceding row has a uniform color (all pixels in that row have the same non-zero color) AND that row's color was *not* derived from its own preceding row, set the current all-zero row to that same uniform color.
    *   Otherwise (if the preceding row is not uniform, or if it was itself derived from its preceding row, or if it is the first row), set the current all-zero row to '5' (gray).

This revised program simplifies the leading zero replacement rule, keeps the propagation rule, and clarifies/corrects the handling of all-zero rows.
