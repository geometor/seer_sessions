"""
Transforms an input grid by expanding and interacting colored pixels.

1. **Identify** all non-zero pixels in the input grid. These are the "source" pixels.
2. **Iterate** through each cell in the output grid.
3. **For each cell**, check if it's adjacent to any number of current colored, same color pixels.
4. **Mirror**: for cells that are outside the original input colored pixels, reflect the colored pixels across an axis of other, same colored, non-zero pixels
5. **Connect**: Grow colored pixels out to meet each other.
6. **The result** is that all the non-zero pixels in the original are replicated, then the surrounding area is filled until it connects with other filled areas
