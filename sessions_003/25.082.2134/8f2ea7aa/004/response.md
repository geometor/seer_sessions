Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code correctly identified the reflection concept, but the expansion phase is overzealous. It expands all colored pixels to fill the entire grid, regardless of the expected output's structure. The core issue is that the expansion should be constrained not just by meeting other colors, but also by the pattern suggested by the reflections. It appears that expansion is meant to extend the reflections and maintain some sense of symmetry, not to flood-fill.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1. **Refine Reflection Logic:** The current reflection is too simplistic. It reflects across *every* pixel of the same color.  Instead, we should consider the geometry more carefully. It's likely reflecting across a central axis or point defined by the initial object's shape. We need to detect this axis.
2. **Constrain Expansion:** Instead of a full flood-fill, expansion should be limited.  It might extend only along the lines established by the reflection.
3. **Consider Symmetry:** The expected outputs demonstrate a high degree of symmetry. The natural language program and code should explicitly incorporate symmetry as a guiding principle.  The type of symmetry (reflectional, rotational) needs to be determined.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

First, let's analyze the shape and properties of the initial objects and see if that gives more information to the type of reflection expected.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of non-zero pixels (colored objects) within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Center:** Calculate the geometric center of each object by averaging the row and column indices of its constituent pixels.
3. **Reflect:** Reflect each initial object across both a horizontal and a vertical line that cross the object's center. The position of the reflected pixels will be determined by calculating the inverse distance to the center coordinates.
4. **Expand (Limited):** After reflection, expand the colored regions (original and reflected pixels). Expansion occurs one layer at a time.  A blank pixel is filled with a color if and only if: a. It is adjacent to a colored pixel (of the original object color). b. The colored pixel does not cross the reflection axes, except at the original points.

The key difference from the previous program is the more precise definition of reflection (around the object's center) and, crucially, the *limited* expansion.  The expansion respects the symmetry established by the reflection and does not continue indefinitely.
