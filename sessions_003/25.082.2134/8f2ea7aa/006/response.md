Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of reflecting and then expanding has some merit, but the expansion logic is clearly flawed. It seems to be overly aggressive in some cases (Example 3) and insufficient in others (Example 1 & 2). The reflection part seems almost correct in the second example, but the expansion expands too far beyond and misses some key spots. The current strategy doesn't fully capture the "symmetrical filling" aspect suggested by the examples. The expansion shouldn't just expand one layer at a time, it has problems with corners, and it's incorrectly coupling expansion with the location of the *original* object, rather than locations of *all* pixels of that color.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1. **Re-evaluate Expansion:** Instead of expanding from the original object's coordinates only, expand from *all* pixels of a given color, iteratively.
2. **Control Expansion:** Limit expansion so that it doesn't overwrite existing pixels, respecting a sense of symmetry/reflection.
3. **Symmetry is key:** Recognize that the transformation isn't just reflection, but some kind of 'symmetrically constrained fill' based on initial seed points. It creates almost like a Voronoi diagram but bounded by center lines.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**
Since no specific metrics are asked for I'll skip this step for now.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: 8f2ea7aa
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: 8
          shape: L-shape
          initial_position: top-left
          notes: Two separate groups of color 8 exist.
      output_objects:
        - color: 8
          shape: reflected and filled, forming rectangular blocks
          notes: Reflection and a constrained fill create almost rectangular blocks.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: 7
          shape: T-shape like object
          initial_position: center
          notes: ""
      output_objects:
        - color: 7
          shape: Reflected T, expanded to form a cross-like shape.
          notes: Reflection is perfect, but the fill seems to create 9-patch cells.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - color: 6
          shape: reverse-L-shape
          initial_position: Top middle.
          notes: Two separate groups of color 6
      output_objects:
        - color: 6
          shape: Reflected and filled in, diamond shaped.
          notes: Filling is constrained by reflections and forms a symmetric diamond.
  - general_observations:
      - transformation_type: reflection and constrained_fill
      - symmetry: The output is always symmetrical around both the horizontal and vertical centerlines of *each* input object, before expansion.
      - fill_constraint: The fill operation respects the object's initial shape.
      - color_behavior: Colors don't interact; each color's transformation is independent.
      - expansion: The expansion from any object is dependent on the reflection lines, and the expansion seems limited by diagonals.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find each contiguous region of non-zero (colored) pixels. Each of these regions is an object.
2. **Reflect:** For each object, determine its geometric center. Reflect the object across the horizontal and vertical lines passing through that center.
3. **Constrained Fill:**  Iteratively expand all pixels of each color.
   - A cell can be filled with color C if:
     - It is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a cell that is already color C.
     - It does *not* cross a reflection line of the initial object of that color. Specifically if the center of object O is (x,y), a cell at (r,c) can be filled with color C (of original object O), IF the original object occupies cells that would allow filling from (r,c) to its own reflection across both axes through center of the object.
4. Repeat step 3, until no new cells can be filled.

Essentially, the fill operation expands outward from both the original object *and* its reflections, but the expansion is constrained such that it doesn't "cross" the reflection lines defined by the original object's center. The original reflection lines act as barriers to expansion.
