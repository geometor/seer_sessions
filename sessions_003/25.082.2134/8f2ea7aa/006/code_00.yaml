  - task_id: 8f2ea7aa
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: 8
          shape: L-shape
          initial_position: top-left
          notes: Two separate groups of color 8 exist.
      output_objects:
        - color: 8
          shape: reflected and filled, forming rectangular blocks
          notes: Reflection and a constrained fill create almost rectangular blocks.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: 7
          shape: T-shape like object
          initial_position: center
          notes: ""
      output_objects:
        - color: 7
          shape: Reflected T, expanded to form a cross-like shape.
          notes: Reflection is perfect, but the fill seems to create 9-patch cells.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - color: 6
          shape: reverse-L-shape
          initial_position: Top middle.
          notes: Two separate groups of color 6
      output_objects:
        - color: 6
          shape: Reflected and filled in, diamond shaped.
          notes: Filling is constrained by reflections and forms a symmetric diamond.
  - general_observations:
      - transformation_type: reflection and constrained_fill
      - symmetry: The output is always symmetrical around both the horizontal and vertical centerlines of *each* input object, before expansion.
      - fill_constraint: The fill operation respects the object's initial shape.
      - color_behavior: Colors don't interact; each color's transformation is independent.
      - expansion: The expansion from any object is dependent on the reflection lines, and the expansion seems limited by diagonals.
