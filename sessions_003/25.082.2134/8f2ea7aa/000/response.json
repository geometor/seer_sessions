The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), orange (7), and magenta (6).  The transformation seems to involve a complex interaction with non-zero colored pixels. It looks like the non-zero pixels are expanding and potentially interacting with each other. There is no simple mirroring or rotation. The key must lie in how existing non-zero pixels in the input influence the placement and color of non-zero pixels in the output. The pattern seems to suggest a kind of \"growth\" or \"reflection\" of the colored pixels, but not in a geometrically simple way, more based on relative positions.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
