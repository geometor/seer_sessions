"""
Transforms an input grid by expanding and interacting colored pixels.

1. **Identify** all non-zero pixels in the input grid. These are the "source" pixels.
2. **Iterate** through each cell in the output grid.
3. **For each cell**, check if it's adjacent to any number of current colored, same color pixels.
4. **Mirror**: for cells that are outside the original input colored pixels, reflect the colored pixels across an axis of other, same colored, non-zero pixels
5. **Connect**: Grow colored pixels out to meet each other.
6. **The result** is that all the non-zero pixels in the original are replicated, then the surrounding area is filled until it connects with other filled areas

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was based on a combination of mirroring and expanding/connecting colored pixels. It seems the mirroring logic is too simplistic and applied inconsistently. The expansion logic (filling adjacent cells with the most frequent color) seems to generally work, but needs to be more constrained and integrated with a corrected mirroring idea. The core issue seems to be incorrectly handling of propagation of original pixels, causing them to expand across the whole output. Also, the "connect" and "mirror" logic is not well ordered, causing some fill to take priority when it shouldn't.

**Strategy:**

1. **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine where the current code fails in each example. Use the results and visual output to identify the specific logical flaws.
2. **Prioritize Mirroring:** Develop a more precise mirroring logic. It appears that reflection/mirroring needs to happen first.
3. **Constrain Expansion:** Limit the expansion so it doesn't overwrite other mirrored parts and doesn't fill areas it isn't supposed to.
4. **Reorder Operations:** Ensure that mirroring is calculated before pixel expansion, then adjust expansion to properly integrate.

**Gather Metrics & Evidence:**

Let's use code execution to get some concrete metrics about the expected output grids:

                color = grid[r, c]
                if color not in nonzero_pixels:
                    nonzero_pixels[color] = 0
                nonzero_pixels[color] += 1

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** Find all non-zero pixels in the input grid. These constitute the initial objects and their colors.
2.  **Mirror/Reflect:** For each color, reflect the existing pixels across axes formed by pixels of that color, ensuring that the reflections stay within the grid boundaries. This creates new object pixels.
3.  **Constrained Expansion:** After all reflections are complete, expand the colored pixels (including the reflected ones). Iterate over each cell, determine which colored pixels are adjacent (8-way), select the most frequent color from the neighbors, then assign that color to the empty cells. Stop expansion when all colored areas meet.

The critical changes here are: (1) separating the mirror and expansion logic, (2) applying mirroring *before* expansion, and (3) defining a more specific and iterative expansion strategy.
