1.  **Identify Horizontal Blue Lines:** Find all horizontal lines consisting of one or more blue (1) pixels.

2.  **First Blue Line Transformation:** If the *first* (topmost) horizontal blue line contains any non-blue pixels (isolated pixels), replace *all* pixels in that blue line with the color of the isolated pixel. If there are multiple isolated pixels of differing colors on the same blue line, it is unclear how to proceed and clarification is needed from prior examples.

3.  **Subsequent Blue Line Transformations:** For any *subsequent* horizontal blue line, find if there are isolated pixels. If present, replace the isolated pixel and any immediately adjacent blue pixels to the left and right with the isolated pixel's color.

4. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels that are not part of the transformed blue lines should remain unchanged.
