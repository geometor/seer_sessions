            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\nThe task involves transforming grids of colored pixels. The most prominent feature is the presence of horizontal \"objects\" composed of blue (1) pixels. Within these blue objects, there are sometimes single pixels of other colors (red (2) in train_1, green (3) in train_2, magenta (6) and azure (8) in train_3). The transformation seems to involve replacing these isolated, non-blue pixels, and sometimes also replacing the blue pixels immediately adjacent to it, *within the bounds of the blue object*. The lower blue object is transformed based on where the isolated color is.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
