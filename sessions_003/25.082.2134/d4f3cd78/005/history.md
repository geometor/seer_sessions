Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies gray (5) objects and attempts to fill adjacent and internal white (0) spaces with azure (8). However, it's clear from the results of both examples that the logic for determining "inside" and "adjacent" is too broad, and the rule application for the row above is not correctly picking the top row. It is adding to *any* horizontal surface, and in fact is adding the azure (8) *beside* the gray shapes.

The strategy will involve:

1.  **Refine "inside" and "adjacent" logic:** The current implementation incorrectly fills cells.
2.  **Correct the "row above" logic:** Make the row above addition conditional and specific, picking the topmost edge.
3.  **Re-evaluate assumptions**: Consider the diagonal pixels when checking for neighbors to ensure correct behavior.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis for now, code execution would ideally generate these):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has two gray (5) objects.
    *   Output incorrectly fills the entire row above *and beside* both objects.
    *   Pixels off: 32 (many incorrectly filled azure pixels)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has two gray (5) objects.
    *   Output incorrectly adds azure (8) above only the bottom object, but
        also *beside* it.
    *    Pixels off: 23

**YAML Fact Representation:**

example_1:
  objects:
    - id: 1
      color: 5
      type: horizontal_line
      top_left: [2, 2]
      bottom_right: [2, 7]
    - id: 2
      color: 5
      type: irregular_shape
      top_left: [3, 2]
      bottom_right: [7, 7]
  transformations:
    - object_id: 1
      action: fill_adjacent_and_internal
      fill_color: 8
    - object_id: 2
        action: fill_adjacent_and_internal
        fill_color: 8

example_2:
  objects:
    - id: 1
      color: 5
      type: irregular_shape
      top_left: [5, 2]
      bottom_right: [9, 7]
  transformations:
    - object_id: 1
      action: fill_adjacent_and_internal
      fill_color: 8
```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels. Each contiguous block is considered an object.
2.  **Fill Inside:** For each gray object, identify white (0) pixels that are completely surrounded by gray pixels (including diagonals). Change these white pixels to azure (8).
3.  **Fill Adjacent, with constraints:** For each gray object, identify all immediate neighboring white pixels (0) (including diagonals) around the gray pixels. Change those to azure (8).
4. **Fill above, one layer:** For each gray object, locate it's top edge. If there is an empty (0) row directly above *any* part of this topmost edge, fill *only* those empty pixels that *directly* border this edge with azure (8).

This refined natural language program clarifies the "inside" condition, adds constraints to the adjacency filling, and correctly describes adding the azure (8) line.
