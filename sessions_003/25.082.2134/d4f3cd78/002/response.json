            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of filling white (0) cells adjacent to gray (5) objects with azure (8). The threshold for filling was set to >= 2 gray neighbors. This works partially, but it's clearly too aggressive, leading to overfilling in both examples. The results show a significant number of pixels are off, indicating the rule needs adjustment. The second example shows a different configuration of where the azure gets added. It seems that the key is not directly adjacent, but filling in empty spaces *inside* and near edges. The approach needs adjustment.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Pixel Differences:** Carefully examine the differences between the \"Expected Output\" and \"Transformed Output\" for both examples. Pay close attention to *where* the azure (8) pixels are placed correctly and incorrectly.\n2.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the differences, modify the neighbor-counting rule. Consider a lower threshold or even explore alternative rules, that could include a condition of a fully enclosed \"pocket\" of empty space and edge detection.\n3. **Examine Row/Column placement:** Observe is azure fills happen on all empty cells, or only specific locations.\n4. **Iterate:** Propose a refined natural language program, which can then be used to generate updated code.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection of the images, counts are checked below in the YAML):**\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Expected Output:** Azure (8) fills the internal space enclosed by the gray (5) object and extends to single cells adjacent to this space.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Overfills, extending azure beyond the enclosed area and some of the single adjacent cells.\n*   **Pixels Off:** 28\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Expected Output:** Azure (8) appears in the row above the main gray object structure, and also within the enclosed part of gray area.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Overfills below, and within the gray object, as well as some single adjacent cells.\n* **Pixels off**: 21\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
