Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of filling white (0) cells adjacent to gray (5) objects with azure (8). The threshold for filling was set to >= 2 gray neighbors. This works partially, but it's clearly too aggressive, leading to overfilling in both examples. The results show a significant number of pixels are off, indicating the rule needs adjustment. The second example shows a different configuration of where the azure gets added. It seems that the key is not directly adjacent, but filling in empty spaces *inside* and near edges. The approach needs adjustment.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Pixel Differences:** Carefully examine the differences between the "Expected Output" and "Transformed Output" for both examples. Pay close attention to *where* the azure (8) pixels are placed correctly and incorrectly.
2.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the differences, modify the neighbor-counting rule. Consider a lower threshold or even explore alternative rules, that could include a condition of a fully enclosed "pocket" of empty space and edge detection.
3. **Examine Row/Column placement:** Observe is azure fills happen on all empty cells, or only specific locations.
4. **Iterate:** Propose a refined natural language program, which can then be used to generate updated code.

**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection of the images, counts are checked below in the YAML):**

**Example 1:**

*   **Expected Output:** Azure (8) fills the internal space enclosed by the gray (5) object and extends to single cells adjacent to this space.
*   **Transformed Output:** Overfills, extending azure beyond the enclosed area and some of the single adjacent cells.
*   **Pixels Off:** 28

**Example 2:**

*   **Expected Output:** Azure (8) appears in the row above the main gray object structure, and also within the enclosed part of gray area.
*   **Transformed Output:** Overfills below, and within the gray object, as well as some single adjacent cells.
* **Pixels off**: 21

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels. These are considered the primary objects.

2.  **Fill Internal Spaces (Conditional):** For each white (0) pixel *inside* a gray object (fully enclosed by gray pixels, including diagonals), change its color to azure (8).

3. **Fill one layer of adjacent cells (Conditional)** For each white (0) pixel *adjacent* a gray object (fully enclosed by gray pixels, including diagonals), change its color to azure (8).

4.  **Fill Row Above (Example 2 Specific):** In Example 2 (and possibly others with a similar structure), fill the entire row of white pixels directly above a horizontal gray object with azure (8).

5. *Prioritize filling empty cells inside of a grey object before moving to edge detection or checking neighbours*
