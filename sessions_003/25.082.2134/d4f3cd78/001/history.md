Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The primary colors involved are white (0) and gray (5).
*   The output introduces a new color, azure (8).
*   The gray (5) shapes in the input seem to be mostly preserved in the output.
*    Azure (8) appears to fill in gaps *within* and adjacent to gray objects, in the empty areas.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: gray_shape_1
    color: gray (5)
    type: irregular
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - bounded

  - name: azure_fill
    color: azure (8)
    type: fill
    properties:
      - replaces white (0)
      - adjacent to gray_shape_1

relationships:
  - azure_fill fills inside gray_shape_1
  - azure_fill is placed where there where adjacent empty spaces on input

actions:
  - identify gray_shape_1 in input
  - identify empty/white (0) cells that bound by a threshold of gray
  - replace those empty cells with azure (8)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. These form the "gray shapes."

2.  **Inner Fill:**
    *   Check the cells that were originally white (0)
    *   If a white pixel is surrounded by or significantly adjacent to gray cells, replace the white with azure.
        *   train\_1 azure replaces cells with 3 or more adjacent gray
        *   train\_2 azure replaces cells with 2 or more adjacent gray

3.  **Preserve Original:** The original gray (5) pixels remain unchanged.
    The result will be same dimension with same gray object and azure instead of
    some white cells.

Essentially, the transformation identifies gray objects and fills in internal
and bordering "empty" (white) spaces with azure based on how many gray cells
are adjacent to that white cell.
