The transformation identifies gray (5) objects in the input grid and fills
internal and adjacent "empty" (white, 0) spaces with azure (8) based on the
shape and location of the gray objects. It also has a specific rule for filling
a single row segment above horizontal gray objects in some cases, only directly
above and only for the top edge of the object.
