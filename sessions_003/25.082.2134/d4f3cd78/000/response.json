Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (10x10).\n*   The primary colors involved are white (0) and gray (5).\n*   The output introduces a new color, azure (8).\n*   The gray (5) shapes in the input seem to be mostly preserved in the output.\n*    Azure (8) appears to fill in gaps *within* and adjacent to gray objects, in the empty areas.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
