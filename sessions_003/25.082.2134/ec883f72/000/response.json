The most salient feature seems to be horizontal lines of a single, non-white, color. These lines appear to be \"sources\" that \"drop\" pixels of the same color or a different color to the top of the grid.  The position of the dropped pixels maintains the x coordinate. The dropped pixels seem to be a fixed number of pixels above the detected line or appear at the top of the grid if there is not enough room to keep the fixed distance.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts**\n\n"

A horizontal line is defined as a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color (excluding white/0) that has a length greater than one.\n\n2. **Determine Drop Color and Target Row:** For each identified horizontal line, determine the color of the pixel to be \"dropped\" and what the target row will be.\n    - In these examples, if the line is at the top of the grid, new pixels, if any, appear to be inserted at a constant offset *below* the line, potentially of a *different* color (example 2).\n   - If the horizontal line has a length greater than 1 and is not at the top of the input grid, place pixels with same x coordinate at the top of the grid. The newly placed pixels will have the same color as the source line, *except* when the source line consists of red (color 2) pixels. In those cases the added pixels are white/0.\n\n3. **Generate Output:** Create the output grid. Copy the input grid. Add the new pixels on the output grid, setting the specified color at the identified x coordinate at the top of the grid or at the offset below the source line.\n"
