facts:
  - object: horizontal_line
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color (not white/0) extending horizontally.
    properties:
      color: The color of the pixels in the line.
      length: The number of pixels in the line.
      y_coordinate: The row index of the line.
      x_coordinates: The column indices of the line
  - action: drop_pixel
    description:  A pixel of a specified color appears at the top of the grid, with its x-coordinate matching a pixel in the trigger.
    parameters:
      source_line: The horizontal_line triggering the drop.
      drop_color: The color of the pixel placed on the output grid.
      target_y: The target row to drop pixel
  - relationship: drop_above
    description:  the x coordinate of dropped pixel will match one of the x coordinates of the source_line
    properties:
      source: horizontal_line
      target: drop_pixel
  - observation: constant_offset
    description: The vertical distance between the source line and the dropped pixel may be constant, or adjusted if it will go off the top of the grid.
