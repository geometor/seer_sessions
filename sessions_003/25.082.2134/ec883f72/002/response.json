            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved identifying horizontal lines and \"dropping\" them to the top or inserting them with a fixed offset if source is in the top edge. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex rule. The code struggles with:\n\n1.  **Conditional Dropping/Insertion:** The dropping/insertion behavior is conditional - and sometimes pixels from the source are not added at all.\n2.  **Color Changes:** The color of the dropped pixels isn't always the same as the source line.\n3.  **Position Shifting**: sometimes, the x-coordinates are changing and being shifted\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting the specific changes and conditions.\n2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent rules governing when pixels are dropped/inserted, their color, and their final position.\n3.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to incorporate these rules.\n4. **Prioritize observations**: Focus on the observations that can apply to all training examples, instead of a single case.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution is not necessary for now):**\n\nThe provided results already offer many relevant metrics:\n\n*   `match`: Indicates whether the transformed output matches the expected output (all are `False`).\n*   `pixels_off`: Number of pixels that differ between the transformed and expected outputs.\n*   `size_correct`: Whether the output grid has the correct dimensions (all are `True`).\n*   `color_palette_correct`: Whether the output grid uses only colors present in the input or allowed by the problem (all are `True`).\n\n**YAML Fact Base:**\n"
