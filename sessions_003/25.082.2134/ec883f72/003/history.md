"""
Transforms an input grid by identifying horizontal lines of a single, non-white color.
For each of these lines, it "drops" pixels of the same color (or a different color if the source is red) 
to the top of the grid, maintaining the x-coordinate. If the source line is on the top edge, pixels are inserted
below at a constant offset.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved identifying horizontal lines and "dropping" them to the top or inserting them with a fixed offset if source is in the top edge. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex rule. The code struggles with:

1.  **Conditional Dropping/Insertion:** The dropping/insertion behavior is conditional - and sometimes pixels from the source are not added at all.
2.  **Color Changes:** The color of the dropped pixels isn't always the same as the source line.
3.  **Position Shifting**: sometimes, the x-coordinates are changing and being shifted

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting the specific changes and conditions.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent rules governing when pixels are dropped/inserted, their color, and their final position.
3.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to incorporate these rules.
4. **Prioritize observations**: Focus on the observations that can apply to all training examples, instead of a single case.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution is not necessary for now):**

The provided results already offer many relevant metrics:

*   `match`: Indicates whether the transformed output matches the expected output (all are `False`).
*   `pixels_off`: Number of pixels that differ between the transformed and expected outputs.
*   `size_correct`: Whether the output grid has the correct dimensions (all are `True`).
*   `color_palette_correct`: Whether the output grid uses only colors present in the input or allowed by the problem (all are `True`).

**YAML Fact Base:**

        action: insert
        insert_y: 0,1,2,3,4
        insert_x_shift: +2

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Horizontal Lines:** Find all horizontal lines of non-white pixels within the input grid. A horizontal line is defined as a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color in a single row.
2.  **Conditional Action:**
    *   If a line color is 6, insert copies of this pixel at a specific, fixed y offset from its original position and shift x to the left.
    *   If a line of color 2 is found, insert copies of this pixel at a specific, fixed y offset from its original position and shift x to the left.
    *   If a line of color 4 is found, insert copies of this pixel at a specific, fixed y offset from its original position and shift x to the right.
    *   Lines of other colors are ignored.
