            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code focuses on identifying horizontal lines of colors 2, 4, and 6 and then attempting to reposition copies of these lines based on some complex, and ultimately incorrect, offset logic. The core issue is that the offset logic doesn't correctly capture the relationships between the original line positions and their new positions in the output grids. The code also unnecessarily handles each color separately with duplicated logic, making it harder to maintain and understand. The strategy should be shifted to focus on simplifying the transformation logic based on the observed patterns.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Simplify the Offset Logic:** Instead of complex calculations based on row and column indices, try to identify a more direct relationship, like relative row displacement.\n2.  **Consolidate Color Handling:** Instead of separate `if` blocks for each color, use a more general approach that applies the same transformation logic (with color-specific parameters if needed).\n3. **Focus on relative position:** the new copies of the lines are always relative to the original lines, so the algorithm needs to change from determining the absolute postion of copied lines and instead focus on a relative position transformation.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI will use manual analysis to avoid the limitations of calculating complex differences within numpy arrays inside the `tool_code` environment.\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has a maroon (9) line at row 3.\n    *   Output has two new gray(3) lines.\n    *   Displacement: +1 row and +2 rows; no x shift, but the lines stop short, likely due to the edge of the grid.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has a magenta (6) line at row 2.\n    *   Output adds 2 magenta (6) pixels above the original line with an offset of 2 rows.\n    *   Displacement of the magenta line: -2 in x, -3 in y, and -1,-4.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has yellow(4) line on row 5 and a red (2) line on rows 7 and 8.\n    *   Output has red (2) lines at row 3 and 4.\n    *    Yellow(4) displacement: No yellow line added.\n    *   Red (2) displacement: x shift of -2, y shift varies.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    Input has gray(5) lines on rows 5 and 6 and yellow lines (4) on rows 7-11.\n    *   Output only shows yellow(4) lines and a y shift upward.\n    *   Displacement: of yellow +2,+3,+4,+5,+6\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Consider colors 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta), 9 (maroon) and 5 (gray).\n2. **Copy and reposition line:** based on the color and row number, copy the detected lines to a new position on the output grid, with possible x shift.\n    *   **Maroon (9):** If a maroon line is found, insert a shorter gray(3) line one row below and and another gray(3) line two rows below.\n    *   **Magenta (6):** If a magenta line is found, add two magenta pixels, shifted two columns to the left and 3 and 4 rows above.\n    *    **Red (2):** Copy a red(2) line with an x-shift of -2, to rows 3 and 4.\n    *    **Yellow (4):** copy the yellow line two columns to the right with an upward y shift, starting at -y of the object + 2.\n    *   **Gray(5):** Gray lines are not copied.\n3. **Ignore other lines**: Lines of colors other than 2, 4, 6, 9, or 5. are not transformed.\n\n"
