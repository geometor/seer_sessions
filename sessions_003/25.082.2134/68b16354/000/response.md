Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are rectangular grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   **Reversal:** The most prominent visual feature is the apparent vertical flipping or mirroring of the grid. Rows seem to be reordered in reverse.
*   **No Change in Content:** The individual pixel values (colors) within the grid appear to be preserved; only their positions change.
* **Objects:** There are not very complex objects. The objects are pixels and the entire grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: N
      - columns: M
      - elements: integers (0-9)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: N
      - columns: M
      - elements: integers (0-9)

  - action: reverse_rows
    description: Reorders the rows of the input grid in reverse order.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

  - relationship:
      - input_grid rows are vertically flipped to produce output_grid rows.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Reverse the order of the rows.
3.  The resulting grid with reversed rows is the output grid.

Essentially, the output is a vertically flipped version of the input.
Or another way, reverse the order of the array elements, where each element is a row from the input grid.
