"""
1. **Identify Gray Runs:** Examine the input grid and identify contiguous "runs" of gray (5) pixels. A run is defined as a sequence of adjacent gray pixels either horizontally or vertically. Diagonal adjacency does not constitute a run.

2. **Horizontal Runs:** For each horizontal run of gray pixels:
    - Start counting from the leftmost pixel of the run (index 0).
    - Change the color of gray pixels at *odd* indices (1, 3, 5, ...) to green (3).

3. **Vertical Runs:** For each vertical run of gray pixels:
    - Start counting from the topmost pixel of the run (index 0).
    - Change the color of gray pixels at *even* indices (0, 2, 4, ...) to green (3).

4. **Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not part of a gray run remain unchanged.
