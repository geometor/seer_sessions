Runs can be either horizontal (adjacent pixels in the same row) or vertical (adjacent pixels in the same column). Diagonal adjacency does not form a run.\n\n2.  **Process Horizontal Runs:** Iterate through each row of the grid. For every horizontal run of gray pixels:\n    *   Starting from the leftmost pixel of the run (index 0), change the color of gray pixels at *odd* indices (1, 3, 5, ...) to green (3).\n\n3.  **Process Vertical Runs:** Iterate through each column of the *modified* grid (i.e. after processing horizontal runs). For every vertical run of gray pixels:\n    *   Starting from the topmost pixel of the run (index 0), change the color of the gray pixels at *even* indices (0, 2, 4, ...) to green (3).\n\n4. **Preserve Other Pixels**: Any pixel that is not gray, or that is gray, but not part of an alternating pattern to be modified as described above, retains its original color.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Process Horizontal Runs\n    for r in range(rows):\n        c = 0\n        while c < cols:\n            if output_grid[r, c] == 5:\n                # Find horizontal run length\n                run_length = 0\n                while c + run_length < cols and output_grid[r, c + run_length] == 5:\n                    run_length += 1\n\n                # Change color of gray pixels at odd indices within the run\n                for i in range(run_length):\n                    if i % 2 != 0:  # Odd index (0-based)\n                        output_grid[r, c + i] = 3\n\n                # Move to the next cell after the run\n                c += run_length\n            else:\n                c += 1\n\n    # Process Vertical Runs (on the modified grid)\n    for c in range(cols):\n        r = 0\n        while r < rows:\n            if output_grid[r, c] == 5:\n                # Find vertical run length\n                run_length = 0\n                while r + run_length < rows and output_grid[r + run_length, c] == 5:\n                    run_length += 1\n\n                # Change color of gray pixels at even indices within the run\n                for i in range(run_length):\n                    if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index (0-based)\n                        output_grid[r + i, c] = 3\n                \n                # Move to next cell after run\n                r += run_length\n\n            else:\n                r+=1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
