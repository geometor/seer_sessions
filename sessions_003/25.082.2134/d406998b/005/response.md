"""
1.  **Identify Gray Runs:** Examine the input grid to find contiguous sequences ("runs") of gray (5) pixels. Runs can be either horizontal (adjacent pixels in the same row) or vertical (adjacent pixels in the same column). Diagonal adjacency does not form a run.

2.  **Process Horizontal Runs:** Iterate through each row of the grid. For every horizontal run of gray pixels:
    *   Starting from the leftmost pixel of the run (index 0), change the color of gray pixels at *odd* indices (1, 3, 5, ...) to green (3).

3.  **Process Vertical Runs:** Iterate through each column of the *modified* grid (i.e. after processing horizontal runs). For every vertical run of gray pixels:
    *   Starting from the topmost pixel of the run (index 0), change the color of the gray pixels at *even* indices (0, 2, 4, ...) to green (3).

4. **Preserve Other Pixels**: Any pixel that is not gray, or that is gray, but not part of an alternating pattern to be modified as described above, retains its original color.
