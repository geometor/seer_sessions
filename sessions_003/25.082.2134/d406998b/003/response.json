A run is defined as a sequence of adjacent gray pixels either horizontally or vertically. Diagonal adjacency does not constitute a run.\n\n2. **Horizontal Runs:** For each horizontal run of gray pixels:\n    - Start counting from the leftmost pixel of the run (index 0).\n    - Change the color of gray pixels at *odd* indices (1, 3, 5, ...) to green (3).\n\n3. **Vertical Runs:** For each vertical run of gray pixels:\n    - Start counting from the topmost pixel of the run (index 0).\n    - Change the color of gray pixels at *even* indices (0, 2, 4, ...) to green (3).\n\n4. **Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not part of a gray run remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell to find and process runs\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if output_grid[r, c] == 5:\n                # Check for horizontal run\n                run_length = 0\n                while c + run_length < cols and output_grid[r, c + run_length] == 5:\n                    run_length += 1\n                \n                # Apply horizontal rule\n                if run_length > 0 :\n                  for i in range(run_length):\n                      if (i+1) % 2 != 0 and output_grid[r,c+i] == 5:  # use +1 because instructions use 1-based\n                        output_grid[r, c + i] = 3\n                  c += run_length # move past checked values\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if output_grid[r, c] == 5:\n\n                # Check for vertical run\n                run_length = 0\n                while r + run_length < rows and output_grid[r + run_length, c] == 5:\n                    run_length += 1\n\n                # apply vertical rule\n                if run_length > 0:\n                    for i in range(run_length):\n                        if (i+1) % 2 == 0 and output_grid[r+i,c] == 5: # use +1 because instructions use 1-based\n                            output_grid[r + i, c] = 3\n                    r += run_length\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
