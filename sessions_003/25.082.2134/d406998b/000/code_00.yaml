objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x10, 3x12, 3x13, 3x14)
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
        - white (0)
        - gray (5)
        - green (3)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: replace
    properties:
      - source_color: gray (5)
      - target_color: green (3)
      - selection_criteria:  "gray (5) becomes green (3) when on an 'odd' y position of a gray 'object' from left-to-right, and also gray (5) becomes green (3) when on an 'even' x position of a gray 'object' from top-to-bottom. 'odd' and 'even' are evaluated independently for x and y.

relationships:
  - pixels form a grid
  - replacement occurs based on pixel color and possibly position
  - x (horizontal) positions alternate
  - y (vertical) positions alternate
