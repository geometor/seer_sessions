The dominant colors are gray (5) and white (0), with a notable change to green (3) in the output grids. The grids appear to have varying dimensions but maintain similar arrangements of gray and white pixels. The core transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of gray pixels (5) with green pixels (3). The selection criteria is not immediately obvious and needs to be discovered in relationship to the rest of the patterns and the priors (objects, goal directedness, numbers/counting, and geometry/topology).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
