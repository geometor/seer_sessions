These could be single pixels or small groups of pixels of the same color.\n*    The shapes made by the non-black pixels can be different - train\\_1 has blues, train\\_2 has yellows, train\\_3 has reds.\n*   The outputs are consistently smaller 3x3 grids.\n*   The outputs seem to retain some of the colored pixels from the input, but in a more compact and rearranged form.\n*   The position of the colors and the background changes in all examples.\n*\tThe colored shapes in input appear to be re-arranged into a new configuration on the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
