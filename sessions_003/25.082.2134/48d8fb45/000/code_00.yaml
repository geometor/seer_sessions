facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 10x10, output grids are 3x3.
  - observation: Input grids contain a majority of black (0) pixels.
  - observation: Non-black pixels form small, distinct objects.
  - observation: Output grids contain a subset of the colored pixels from the input.
  - observation: The spatial arrangement of colored pixels changes from input to output.
  - observation: There is no change of colors of the non-black pixels from input to output.
  - object: Colored_Pixels
    properties:
      - color: Varies (blue, yellow, red in the examples).
      - shape: Can be single pixels or connected groups.
    actions:
      - moved: Their position changes from input to output.
      - selected: Only a subset is included in the output.
  - relationship: Output_Grid contains a re-arranged subset of Colored_Pixels from Input_Grid.
