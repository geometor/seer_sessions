1.  **Identify** all the non-black colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extract** a 3x3 subgrid that encloses the colored non-black pixels where the colored pixels are at a minimal bounding box.
3.  **Transpose** the pixels from this bounding box area in the input grid to the output grid, preserving their original colors. The order in the output grids from left to right, top to bottom are organized by row then column of their position in the input grid.
