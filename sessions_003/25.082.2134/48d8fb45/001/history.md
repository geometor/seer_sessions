Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to understand the transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are larger grids (10x10) filled mostly with black (0) pixels.
*   There are a few colored objects within each input grid, often near the center. These could be single pixels or small groups of pixels of the same color.
*    The shapes made by the non-black pixels can be different - train\_1 has blues, train\_2 has yellows, train\_3 has reds.
*   The outputs are consistently smaller 3x3 grids.
*   The outputs seem to retain some of the colored pixels from the input, but in a more compact and rearranged form.
*   The position of the colors and the background changes in all examples.
*	The colored shapes in input appear to be re-arranged into a new configuration on the output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 10x10, output grids are 3x3.
  - observation: Input grids contain a majority of black (0) pixels.
  - observation: Non-black pixels form small, distinct objects.
  - observation: Output grids contain a subset of the colored pixels from the input.
  - observation: The spatial arrangement of colored pixels changes from input to output.
  - observation: There is no change of colors of the non-black pixels from input to output.
  - object: Colored_Pixels
    properties:
      - color: Varies (blue, yellow, red in the examples).
      - shape: Can be single pixels or connected groups.
    actions:
      - moved: Their position changes from input to output.
      - selected: Only a subset is included in the output.
  - relationship: Output_Grid contains a re-arranged subset of Colored_Pixels from Input_Grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all the non-black colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extract** a 3x3 subgrid that encloses the colored non-black pixels where the colored pixels are at a minimal bounding box.
3.  **Transpose** the pixels from this bounding box area in the input grid to the output grid, preserving their original colors. The order in the output grids from left to right, top to bottom are organized by row then column of their position in the input grid.

In summary the task asks for the colored shape in the center to be extracted and re-arranged in reading order into the 3x3 output grid.
