Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly handles the first example but fails on the second and third. The core issue is how the checkerboard pattern's origin is calculated. The current logic seems to assume a direct relationship between the input '1' position and the output checkerboard origin that doesn't hold true across all examples. Specifically, the `output_origin_row` calculation is flawed. It calculates an offset based on column, which isn't universally correct. The goal should be to produce a consistent, 2x2, checkerboard patter, and it is clear that the origin for the checkerboard pattern is based on the original location of the '1' in the input, but it needs to be corrected from the previous calculation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Assumptions:** Use the provided examples to double-check our assumptions:
    *   The output is always a checkerboard pattern of 0s and 1s.
    *   The '1' in the last row of the input grid dictates the starting point (origin) of the checkerboard.

2.  **Re-evaluate Origin Calculation:** The current `output_origin_row` calculation is incorrect. The transformed output should calculate the checkerboard origin in relationship with the input origin.

3.  **Refine Algorithm:** Instead of calculating an offset, the origin of the checkerboard will change its parity based on the parity of the coordinates.

**Gather Metrics & Example Analysis:**

I'll use code execution to get precise information.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_examples(examples):
    results = []
    for i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
        expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
        rows, cols = input_grid.shape

        # Find input origin
        input_origin_row, input_origin_col = None, None
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[rows - 1, c] == 1:
                input_origin_row, input_origin_col = rows - 1, c
                break

        results.append({
            "example": i + 1,
            "input_shape": (rows, cols),
            "input_origin": (input_origin_row, input_origin_col),

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Input Origin:** Locate the single blue pixel (value 1) in the last row of the input grid. This pixel's coordinates (row, column) are the input origin.

2.  **Generate Checkerboard:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.

3.  **Determine Pixel Values:** For each cell in the output grid, calculate its value as follows:
    *   `value = (input_origin_row + input_origin_col + current_row + current_col) % 2`

4. The result will be checkerboard pattern, where cells with an even sum will be white(0), and odd sum will be blue(1).

5. return the output grid.
