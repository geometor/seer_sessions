facts:
  - task: "Create a checkered pattern based on a starting point."
  - objects:
    - name: "Grid"
      properties:
        - "2D array of integers (0-9)"
        - "Represents colors"
    - name: "Pixel"
      properties:
        - "A single cell in the grid"
        - "Has a color value (0-9)"
    - name: "Starting Pixel"
      properties:
        - "A pixel with value 1 in the last row of the input grid"
        - "Determines the origin of the checkerboard pattern"
  - actions:
    - name: "Locate Starting Pixel"
      description: "Find the pixel with value 1 in the bottom row."
      input: "Input Grid"
      output: "Column index of the starting pixel"
    - name: "Generate Checkerboard"
      description: "Create a checkerboard pattern emanating from the starting pixel."
      input: "Starting Pixel position, Input Grid dimensions"
      output: "Output Grid with checkerboard pattern"
      rules:
        - "The cell with the starting pixel will always have value 1."
        - "Adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically) have alternating values (0 and 1)."
        - "The alternation pattern extends upwards from the bottom row."
