objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1]  # Black and white
      - dimensions: variable (rows, cols)
      - pattern: checkerboard
  - name: origin_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: 1 (initially)
      - location: bottom row, leftmost '1' in input
      - derived_location:  # Describes how to find it in output
          row: input_grid.rows - 1 - (output_grid.cols -1 - col_index of '1' in input last_row)

actions:
  - name: create_checkerboard
    input: origin_pixel
    process: |
       Manhattan distance from each cell to the origin pixel
       determines the cell's value.  If the origin is (r,c) a
        cell's value is given by (r+c+row+col) % 2
    output: filled grid
