The input grids consistently have a single row of '1' at the bottom, with all other pixels being '0'. The output grids seem to have a checkered or alternating pattern of '0' and '1', which is generated based on the position of the initial '1' in the input. The transformation appears to involve a kind of \"flipping\" or inverting of values based on an expanding pattern, originating from the location of the initial '1' value in the last row of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The checkerboarding is performed by starting from the last row and alternating the color moving up each row.\n"
