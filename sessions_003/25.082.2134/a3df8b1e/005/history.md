Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to improve the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the core concept of a checkered pattern emanating from a starting point (the '1' pixel). However, it incorrectly assumed the checkerboard pattern would *always* alternate between 0 and 1 based on Manhattan distance. The errors in examples 2 and 3 reveal that the pattern isn't a simple alternation. The origin point is not simply defined either. It seems the output is still a checkerboard, but with a different origin or calculation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze the expected outputs of all three examples to pinpoint the *exact* rule governing the checkerboard. The origin must be determined.
2.  **Refine Origin Identification:** The current code assumes the '1' in the last row is always the origin. This might be wrong. We need logic to robustly identify the *true* origin of the checkerboard.
3.  **Adjust Checkerboard Logic:** Once the origin is clear, determine what defines a cell as a '1' or a '0'.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use code execution to get more precise information. I'll check for a relationship by using python to print some of the grid metrics.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1]  # Black and white
      - dimensions: variable (rows, cols)
      - pattern: checkerboard
  - name: origin_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: 1 (initially)
      - location: bottom row, leftmost '1' in input
      - derived_location:  # Describes how to find it in output
          row: input_grid.rows - 1 - (output_grid.cols -1 - col_index of '1' in input last_row)

actions:
  - name: create_checkerboard
    input: origin_pixel
    process: |
       Manhattan distance from each cell to the origin pixel
       determines the cell's value.  If the origin is (r,c) a
        cell's value is given by (r+c+row+col) % 2
    output: filled grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Origin:** Find the leftmost pixel with a value of '1' in the last row of the *input* grid.  The origin pixel's row and column will be used to compute the origin of the checkerboard pattern.

2.  **Calculate Output Grid Origin Row:** Calculate the output grid's checkerboard origin row using the following: `output_origin_row = input_rows - 1 - (output_cols - 1 - input_origin_col)`. Where the `input_origin_col` is the column where the '1' appears in the bottom row of the input grid.

3.  **Calculate Output Grid Origin Column:** The output grid's origin column (`output_origin_col`) is the same as `input_origin_col`.

4. **Checkerboard Generation:** Iterate through each cell of the output grid (which has the same dimensions as the input grid). For each cell (row, col):
    *   Calculate `value = (output_origin_row + output_origin_col + row + col) % 2`.
    * Assign `value` to output_grid\[row, col].

5.  **Return:** Return the completed `output_grid`.

Key changes and why:

*   **Origin Calculation:** The most significant change is the explicit definition of the origin and *how it relates between the input and output*.  The original assumption was that the input '1' *was* the origin for the distance calculation, but the expected output showed it was more nuanced. The origin for the checkerboard calculation is derived but related to the location of the input '1'.
*    **Checkerboard Formula**: instead of just distance % 2, use a formula involving both origin and target coordinates.
*    **Clarity:** The steps are explicitly numbered for easier translation into code.
