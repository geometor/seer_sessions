Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of varying dimensions.\n*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color.\n*   The transformation seems to focus on extracting a specific sub-grid from the input.\n*   The sub-grid appears to be defined by the largest square of a non-zero, uniform color in the top-left section, before color changes happen along rows or columns.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It focuses on finding the largest top-left connected component of the same, non-zero color. The other colors and arrangements in the input grid are seemingly irrelevant to the output.\n"
