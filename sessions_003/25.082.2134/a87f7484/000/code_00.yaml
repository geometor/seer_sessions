task_description: |
    The task involves extracting a specific sub-grid from the input grid. The output grid
    is the largest square section from the top-left of the input grid that forms a block with uniform color (other than 0), before color changes along either rows or columns.

observations:
  - object_types:
      - input_grid: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
      - output_grid: A 2D array, a sub-grid of the input grid.
      - cell: An individual element within a grid, represented by an integer.
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: Height and width of the grids (variable).
      - cell_color: The integer value (0-9) of a cell.
      - object_shape: The shape of the largest contiguous same-color non zero section found from top-left.
  - actions:
      - identify_subgrid: Locate the relevant sub-grid within the input.
      - extract_subgrid: Copy the identified sub-grid to form the output.
  - relationships:
      - subgrid_of: The output grid is a sub-grid of the input grid.
      - top_left: The position to begin searching the object.
      - uniform_color: The initial color to form the basis of the object.
