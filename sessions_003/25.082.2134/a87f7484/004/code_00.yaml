facts:
  - object: square_pattern
    description: A 3x3 square subgrid.
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - pattern_types:
        - type_1: |
            A 0 A
            0 A 0
            A 0 A
          where: A is a non-zero digit and 0 is zero.
        - type_2: |
            A B A
            C D C
            A B A
          where: A, B, and C are non-zero, D can be non-zero. A, B, C and D do not need to be unique.
    examples:
      - input_1: Contains at least one instance of pattern_type_1 and pattern_type_2, output is pattern_type_2 with A=8
      - input_2: Contains instance of pattern_type_1, output is pattern type 1 with A = 7
      - input_3: Contains instance of pattern_type_2, output is pattern_type_2 with A = 4, B=0, C=4, D=4
      - input_4: Contains instance of pattern_type_2, output is pattern_type_2, with A=7, B=7, C=7, D=7

  - action: extract
    description: Extract the specific 3x3 square pattern from the input grid.
    details:
      - The extracted square pattern consistently adheres to the properties defined, not simply being the largest possible uniform square.
      - The specific instance extracted seems to prioritize based on position, and pattern type.
