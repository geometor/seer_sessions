Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of varying dimensions.
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color.
*   The transformation seems to focus on extracting a specific sub-grid from the input.
*   The sub-grid appears to be defined by the largest square of a non-zero, uniform color in the top-left section, before color changes happen along rows or columns.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: |
    The task involves extracting a specific sub-grid from the input grid. The output grid
    is the largest square section from the top-left of the input grid that forms a block with uniform color (other than 0), before color changes along either rows or columns.

observations:
  - object_types:
      - input_grid: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
      - output_grid: A 2D array, a sub-grid of the input grid.
      - cell: An individual element within a grid, represented by an integer.
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: Height and width of the grids (variable).
      - cell_color: The integer value (0-9) of a cell.
      - object_shape: The shape of the largest contiguous same-color non zero section found from top-left.
  - actions:
      - identify_subgrid: Locate the relevant sub-grid within the input.
      - extract_subgrid: Copy the identified sub-grid to form the output.
  - relationships:
      - subgrid_of: The output grid is a sub-grid of the input grid.
      - top_left: The position to begin searching the object.
      - uniform_color: The initial color to form the basis of the object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start at the top-left cell (0,0) of the input grid. Note the color of this cell.
2.  **Find Dimensions:** Find the largest possible square that has dimensions such that every row and column has a uniform color, excluding color `0`.
3. **Output:** construct a new grid based on the extracted color.

I believe this natural language program accurately captures the transformation rule. It focuses on finding the largest top-left connected component of the same, non-zero color. The other colors and arrangements in the input grid are seemingly irrelevant to the output.
