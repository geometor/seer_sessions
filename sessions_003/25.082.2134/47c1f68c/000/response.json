            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output pairs and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, including my perceptions, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of numbers, where each number corresponds to a color.\n*   **Horizontal Line:** In each input, there's a prominent horizontal line of a single color that stretches across the entire width of the grid.\n*   **Color Change:** It appears the color of the horizontal line in the input changes in the output. And it uses that line's color in the input to replace some other colors.\n*   **Object Swapping**: There exist some single color squares above and below the horizontal line in the input. These squares get replaced by the horizontal line color in the output.\n*   **Symmetry**: There seems to be a preservation of symmetry relative to the original square positions.\n*\t**Background**: All the 0's (white/background) in the input grid stay white in the output.\n\n**YAML Block Documentation:**\n\n"

The horizontal line is blanked out in the final output.\n"
