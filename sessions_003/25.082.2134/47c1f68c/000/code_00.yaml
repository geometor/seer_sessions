facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: horizontal_line
    type: line
    properties:
      - orientation: horizontal
      - length: width of grid
      - color: variable (changes between input and output)
      - position: row index (variable)
  - object: colored_squares
    type: square
    properties:
      - color: variable (matches horizontal_line color in output)
      - size: single cell or small contiguous blocks
      - position: variable (above and below horizontal_line)
      - symmetry: symmetrical around a central vertical axis
  - action: color_replacement
    description: Replace colored_squares with the color of horizontal_line in the input.
  - action: line_color_change
    description: Change the color of the horizontal_line. Keep it's color value and use it to recolor the squares.
  - relationship: spatial
    description: Colored squares are positioned above and below the horizontal line, often symmetrically.
  - constant: background
    value: 0
    description: areas with 0 values in the input maintain the value of 0 in the output
