Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output pairs and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, including my perceptions, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of numbers, where each number corresponds to a color.
*   **Horizontal Line:** In each input, there's a prominent horizontal line of a single color that stretches across the entire width of the grid.
*   **Color Change:** It appears the color of the horizontal line in the input changes in the output. And it uses that line's color in the input to replace some other colors.
*   **Object Swapping**: There exist some single color squares above and below the horizontal line in the input. These squares get replaced by the horizontal line color in the output.
*   **Symmetry**: There seems to be a preservation of symmetry relative to the original square positions.
*	**Background**: All the 0's (white/background) in the input grid stay white in the output.

**YAML Block Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: horizontal_line
    type: line
    properties:
      - orientation: horizontal
      - length: width of grid
      - color: variable (changes between input and output)
      - position: row index (variable)
  - object: colored_squares
    type: square
    properties:
      - color: variable (matches horizontal_line color in output)
      - size: single cell or small contiguous blocks
      - position: variable (above and below horizontal_line)
      - symmetry: symmetrical around a central vertical axis
  - action: color_replacement
    description: Replace colored_squares with the color of horizontal_line in the input.
  - action: line_color_change
    description: Change the color of the horizontal_line. Keep it's color value and use it to recolor the squares.
  - relationship: spatial
    description: Colored squares are positioned above and below the horizontal line, often symmetrically.
  - constant: background
    value: 0
    description: areas with 0 values in the input maintain the value of 0 in the output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Horizontal Line:** Locate the single, horizontal line of uniform color that spans the entire width of the input grid.
2.  **Note the Horizontal Line's color:** Remember that the horizontal line original color.
3.  **Identify Colored Squares:** Find the colored squares (single cells or small groups of adjacent cells of the same color) located above and below the horizontal line, that DO NOT match the horizontal line's color.
4.  **Replace Square Colors:** Change the color of these identified squares to the color of the horizontal line, *from the input grid*.
5.  **Blank out Horizontal line:** Blank out (fill with '0') the horizontal line.
6.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all cells with a value of 0 (white) in the input grid remain 0 in the output grid.

In summary, the transformation involves identifying a horizontal line and colored squares, and then swapping the colors of the squares with the color of the horizontal line from the input, while keeping the 0's unchanged. The horizontal line is blanked out in the final output.
