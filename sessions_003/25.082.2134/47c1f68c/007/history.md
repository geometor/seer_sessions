"""
1.  **Identify Horizontal Line:** Find the single horizontal line of a uniform, non-zero color that spans the entire width of the input grid. Record the row index and color of this line.
2.  **Identify Objects:**  Identify all contiguous shapes (objects) in the input grid. An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color. Exclude pixels that are part of the horizontal line found in step 1, and also exclude background pixels (color 0).
3.  **Mirror Objects:** For each object found in step 2, mirror its position *vertically* across the horizontal line identified in step 1.  The mirrored position's row index will change, but the column index will remain the same.
4.  **Recolor Objects:** Change the color of all mirrored objects to the color of the horizontal line (from step 1).
5.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid, initially filled with 0s. The size of this grid should be the smallest possible rectangle that can contain *all* the mirrored objects. The horizontal line itself is *not* included in the output, only the mirrored objects.
6. **Blank Horizontal Line** Ensure that all pixels from the original horizontal line from the input grid are set to color 0 (white).

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The current code correctly identifies the horizontal line and attempts to mirror objects across it. However, it fails to accurately calculate the output grid size and position the mirrored objects correctly within that grid. The primary issue seems to be in determining the correct dimensions of the output grid and properly offsetting the mirrored object positions relative to the bounding box of *all* mirrored objects. The generated outputs are much smaller than the expected outputs.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Bounding Box Calculation:** The bounding box calculation needs to account for *all* mirrored objects collectively, not just individual objects. Then output grid dimensions should be calculated to encompass the entire extent, accounting for the shift due to the mirroring.
2.  **Negative Row Handling**: The mirror operation can result in negative row indices. The logic needs to correctly handle mirroring to account for objects that may extend "above" row 0 after reflection.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution where necessary):**

I'll use a manual analysis of bounding boxes here, since I'm in the dreamer phase.

**Example 1:**

*   Input Shape: (11, 11)
*   Horizontal Line: Row 5, Color 2
*   Objects Above Line: One object of color 1
*   Mirrored Object (raw):  Rows: (9, 8, 7, 6, 9), Cols: (1, 1, 1, 2, 1)
*   Bounding Box (raw): Min Row: 6, Max Row: 9, Min Col: 1, Max Col: 2
    *   shift_row: -6
*   Adjust Bounding box: Min row: 0, max row: 3, min col: 1, max col: 2
*   Output Shape (expected):  (10, 10)
*   Actual output shape: (3,3)
*  Error: Output grid did not properly create the output image, only a portion was created

**Example 2:**

*   Input Shape: (9, 9)
*   Horizontal Line: Row 4, Color 8
*   Objects: Two of color 3
*   Mirrored Objects: (raw)  Rows: (7,6,5) ,(7,5,8). Cols: (0, 0, 0),(2,2,2)
*   Bounding Box(raw): Min Row: 5, Max Row: 8, Min Col: 0, Max Col: 2
    * shift_row: -5
*  Adjust Bounding box: Min row: 0, max row: 3, min col: 0, max col: 2
*   Output Shape (expected): (8, 8)
*   Actual output shape: (3,3)

**Example 3:**

* Input size (7,7)
* horizontal line: row 3, color 4
* objects: One object of color 2.
* mirrored objects: (raw): (5,4,6), (4,5,4)
* Bounding box: min_row: 4, max_row: 6, min_col: 0, max_col: 2
   * shift_row: -4
* Adjust Bounding box: min row = 0, max row = 2, min col=0, max col = 2
* Output Shape (expected): (6,6)
* Output shape: (3,3)

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Horizontal Line:** Scan the input grid to find a single horizontal line. This line must be of a uniform, non-zero color and extend across the entire width of the grid. Note the line's row index and color.

2.  **Object Identification:** Locate all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same color. Exclude pixels belonging to the horizontal line found in step 1, as well as background pixels (color 0).

3.  **Mirror Objects:** For each object, mirror its position vertically across the horizontal line identified in step 1.  The mirrored row index is calculated as `2 * horizontal_line_row - original_row`. The column index stays the same.

4.  **Recolor Objects:** Change the color of all mirrored objects to be the same as the horizontal line's color.

5. **Determine Output Grid**
    * calculate a bounding box that contains all the mirrored objects from all the previous steps
    * if any of the mirrored object extend past row 0, add a shift to all objects so that the minimum row is 0
    * the output dimensions are determined by (max_row - min_row +1, max_col - min_col +1)
    * Create an output grid filled with background pixels

6.  **Populate Output Grid**: Place each mirrored and recolored object onto the output grid.
   *  Adjust object positions using the following offsets:
        *   row_offset = - min_row_of_bounding_box
        *   col_offset = - min_col_of_bounding_box

7.  **Final Output:** Return the created output grid. The horizontal line itself is *not* part of the output; only the mirrored and recolored objects are included.
