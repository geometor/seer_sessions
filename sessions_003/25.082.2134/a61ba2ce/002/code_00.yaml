      output_arrangement:
        - description: Objects are arranged from left to right and top to bottom based on their top-left position in the input, preserving their original shapes.
        - note: The fill order within each object appears to proceed from top-left.
      output_grid:
        - dimensions: [4,4]
        - inferred_rule: "The objects are combined without overlapping, the dimensions appear to be based on the maximum extents of the objects as placed"
