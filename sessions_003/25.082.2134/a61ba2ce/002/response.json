            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code correctly identifies contiguous blocks of color (objects) and extracts them. It also orders them, seemingly by their top-left corner. However, the core issue is in how it reconstructs these objects into the output grid. The code calculates a roughly square output grid based on the *total number of pixels* in all objects. It then fills this grid sequentially, object by object. This approach fails to preserve the *shapes* of the individual objects and their relative positioning within each object. The fill order is correct - left to right top to bottom, but the number of columns in the result is not being correctly computed. It also appears there is some error in the placement when an object does not fit into the row and must be placed at the beginning of the next row.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe key to fixing this is to:\n\n1.  **Preserve object shape:** Instead of just counting total pixels, we need to track the dimensions (width and height) of each extracted object.\n2.  **Arrange by object:** we are close on the ordering of the objects, but it appears there are errors.\n3.  **Accurate Output Dimension:** Instead of trying to make a near-square output, infer the output dimensions from the objects and their relative positions.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**\n\nLet's get some concrete data about the objects in each example. I'll focus on:\n\n*   Number of objects\n*   Dimensions of each object\n*  Dimensions of the output\n\n"
