Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves extracting colored objects from a larger grid and placing them into a smaller, condensed grid. The background color (0 or white) is discarded. The order of the extracted objects appears to be significant, with the objects placed to form a smaller rectangle. The objects themselves seem to retain their original 2x1, 1x2, 1x1, or 2x2 shapes, and the relative locations of the pixels within those shapes seem to be maintained.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8] # Colors other than 0
      shapes: [2x1, 1x2, 1x1, 2x2] # Possible shapes the colored objects can take
      positions:
        original: [row, col] # Original position in the input grid
        transformed: [row, col] # Position in the output grid
    actions:
      - move:
          description: Objects are moved from their original position to a new position.
      - extract:
          description: Only non-zero colored objects are kept; the zero-colored background is discarded.
      - condense:
          description: Reduce all gaps between objects to zero.

relationships:
  - spatial:
      description: Objects maintain their shapes, but are packed to form a smaller rectangular grid.
  - order:
    description: The order of the objects seems related to their position from top-left to right and then down, but a more defined order can be determined in the coding phase, ordering first by row then by column.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Extract:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero (non-white) colored pixels. These blocks represent the objects.
2.  **Order Objects:** Order these identified objects, prioritizing those with the top-most row, and for objects in the same row, prioritizing by leftmost column.
3. **Create Output Grid**: Create a new smaller output grid.
4.  **Place Objects:** Place the objects into the new output grid from top to bottom, left to right without spaces, such that the objects fill the smaller grid in order. Maintain the objects original shape and size.
