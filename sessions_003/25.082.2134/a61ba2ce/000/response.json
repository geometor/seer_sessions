The background color (0 or white) is discarded. The order of the extracted objects appears to be significant, with the objects placed to form a smaller rectangle. The objects themselves seem to retain their original 2x1, 1x2, 1x1, or 2x2 shapes, and the relative locations of the pixels within those shapes seem to be maintained.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
