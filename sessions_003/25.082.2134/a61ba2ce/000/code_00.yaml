objects:
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8] # Colors other than 0
      shapes: [2x1, 1x2, 1x1, 2x2] # Possible shapes the colored objects can take
      positions:
        original: [row, col] # Original position in the input grid
        transformed: [row, col] # Position in the output grid
    actions:
      - move:
          description: Objects are moved from their original position to a new position.
      - extract:
          description: Only non-zero colored objects are kept; the zero-colored background is discarded.
      - condense:
          description: Reduce all gaps between objects to zero.

relationships:
  - spatial:
      description: Objects maintain their shapes, but are packed to form a smaller rectangular grid.
  - order:
    description: The order of the objects seems related to their position from top-left to right and then down, but a more defined order can be determined in the coding phase, ordering first by row then by column.
