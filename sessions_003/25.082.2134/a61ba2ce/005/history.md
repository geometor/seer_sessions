Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code attempts to extract colored objects and rearrange them based on their top-left origin. However, it's failing to correctly reconstruct the output grid. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Object Placement:** The code doesn't correctly calculate where to place the objects on the horizontal axis, causing overlaps and incorrect object alignment.
2.  **Incorrect Output Size:** It appears there is a bug in calculating `output_cols` and `output_rows` which can cause overlaps or truncate results.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Placement Logic:** The core issue is that object are being stacked from the top-left, regardless of existing object locations. I'll revise the natural language program to calculate how objects should be placed in each row.
2.  **Revisit Output Size Calculations:** Ensure that we correctly determine the final size of the output array before placing objects.

**Metrics Gathering (via observation):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 13x13
    *   Output Size (Expected): 4x4
    *   Output Size (Actual): 6x2
    *   Objects Identified: 4 (blue, red, green, azure)
    *   Objects' original positions are all unique.
    *   Objects are incorrectly aligned - they should maintain their original shapes in the output grid.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 13x13
    *   Output Size (Expected): 4x4
    *   Output Size (Actual): 6x2
    *   Objects Identified: 4 (blue, azure, red, yellow)
    *   Objects' original positions are all unique.
    *   Objects are incorrectly aligned - they should maintain their original shapes in the output grid.

  description: >
    Extract all distinct colored contiguous objects. Maintain their original shape.
    Arrange them in the output grid from top-left to bottom-right.
    Objects in each row are arranged next to each other, from left-to-right.
    The next object will start on the left side, on the next row, if it does not fit within the current row's bounds.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to identify distinct, contiguous colored objects. Treat each contiguous block of non-zero pixels of the same color as a single object.
2.  **Extract Object Information:** For each object, store its color, shape (as a set of relative coordinates), and the coordinates of its top-left corner in the original grid.
3. **Sort Object:** Order objects based on their top-left coordinates (first by row, then by column).
4.  **Create Output Grid:**
  - Initialize an empty output grid.
  - Initialize the current row and current column to 0.
5.  **Place Objects:** Iterate through the sorted objects:
    *   Calculate each object's height and width.
    *   If the object fits horizontally in current row, place there, updating current column
    *   If it doesn't fit, move to the next row and place at start, updating current row and column
    *   Calculate the maximum row and column needed
6.  **Reconstruct Objects:** Use stored information about each object, reconstruct each object and place in the output at the coordinates determined.
