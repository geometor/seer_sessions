However, it's failing to correctly reconstruct the output grid. The primary issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Object Placement:** The code doesn't correctly calculate where to place the objects on the horizontal axis, causing overlaps and incorrect object alignment.\n2.  **Incorrect Output Size:** It appears there is a bug in calculating `output_cols` and `output_rows` which can cause overlaps or truncate results.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Placement Logic:** The core issue is that object are being stacked from the top-left, regardless of existing object locations. I'll revise the natural language program to calculate how objects should be placed in each row.\n2.  **Revisit Output Size Calculations:** Ensure that we correctly determine the final size of the output array before placing objects.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (via observation):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 13x13\n    *   Output Size (Expected): 4x4\n    *   Output Size (Actual): 6x2\n    *   Objects Identified: 4 (blue, red, green, azure)\n    *   Objects' original positions are all unique.\n    *   Objects are incorrectly aligned - they should maintain their original shapes in the output grid.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 13x13\n    *   Output Size (Expected): 4x4\n    *   Output Size (Actual): 6x2\n    *   Objects Identified: 4 (blue, azure, red, yellow)\n    *   Objects' original positions are all unique.\n    *   Objects are incorrectly aligned - they should maintain their original shapes in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Treat each contiguous block of non-zero pixels of the same color as a single object.\n2.  **Extract Object Information:** For each object, store its color, shape (as a set of relative coordinates), and the coordinates of its top-left corner in the original grid.\n3. **Sort Object:** Order objects based on their top-left coordinates (first by row, then by column).\n4.  **Create Output Grid:**\n  - Initialize an empty output grid.\n  - Initialize the current row and current column to 0.\n5.  **Place Objects:** Iterate through the sorted objects:\n    *   Calculate each object's height and width.\n    *   If the object fits horizontally in current row, place there, updating current column\n    *   If it doesn't fit, move to the next row and place at start, updating current row and column\n    *   Calculate the maximum row and column needed\n6.  **Reconstruct Objects:** Use stored information about each object, reconstruct each object and place in the output at the coordinates determined.\n\n"
