  description: >
    Extract all distinct colored contiguous objects. Maintain their original shape.
    Arrange them in the output grid from top-left to bottom-right.
    Objects in each row are arranged next to each other, from left-to-right.
    The next object will start on the left side, on the next row, if it does not fit within the current row's bounds.
