Each block is an object, characterized by its color and pixel coordinates.\n\n2.  **Center Lines:** Define a vertical and horizontal center line dividing the grid into four quadrants. For a 10x10 grid, the vertical center is between columns 5 and 6, and the horizontal center is between rows 5 and 6.\n\n3.  **Left-Side Transformation:** Any object located entirely to the left of the vertical center line is moved to the vertical center line. The left most pixel is placed on the center line, maintaining the original row of that pixel.\n\n4.  **Right-Side Transformation:** Any object located entirely to the right of the vertical center line is moved diagonally. The object effectively \"slides\" down and to the left such that it's top right corner pixel's distance to the top right corner of it's quadrant, is maintained with it's new location to the top right corner of the grid. So if an object's top right pixel is 1 down and 1 right of the top right corner of it's quadrant, it will end up 1 down and one right of the top right corner of the grid.\n\n5.  **Horizontal Mirroring:** Any object that has any pixel with a row index equal to horizontal_center - 1 or horizontal_center has it's x coordinates mirrored. For each pixel at `(r, c)` in the original object, a pixel at `(r, cols - 1 - c)` exists in the output.\n\n6.  **Output:** Create a new grid initialized with zeros (white). Place the transformed objects onto the output grid based on the transformation rules.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects in a grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, obj_color, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != obj_color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n            dfs(r + dr, c + dc, obj_color, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], current_object)\n                objects.append((grid[r,c], current_object))  # Store color and object\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    vertical_center = cols // 2\n    horizontal_center = rows // 2\n\n    # Find objects\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n    \n    #change output pixels\n    for color, obj in objects:\n        #find top most pixel of object\n        top_row = min(r for r, c in obj)\n        \n        # --- Left Side Transformation ---\n        if all(c < vertical_center for r, c in obj):\n            #find left most column of this object\n            left_most_col = min(c for r, c in obj)\n            # Move to vertical center, same row\n            for r,c in obj:\n              output_grid[r,vertical_center - (left_most_col - min(c_temp for r_temp, c_temp in obj)) -1] = color  #added -1\n              \n\n        # --- Right Side Transformation ---        \n        elif all(c >= vertical_center for r, c in obj):\n            # objects to right of vertical center\n            \n            #find top right corner\n            top_right_r = min(r for r, c in obj)\n            top_right_c = max(c for r, c in obj)\n\n            #calculate distance from top right of quadrant\n            quadrant_top_right_r = 0\n            quadrant_top_right_c = cols -1\n            \n            dist_r = top_right_r - quadrant_top_right_r\n            dist_c = quadrant_top_right_c - top_right_c\n\n\n            #move all pixels\n            for r,c in obj:\n                new_r = r + (horizontal_center-1-top_right_r) #move down amount from horizontal center\n                new_c = c - (top_right_c - vertical_center) - (top_right_c- (vertical_center -1))  #go left by amount it was to the right, then one more for each column to center\n                \n                if new_r < rows and new_c >=0: #check bounds\n                    output_grid[new_r,new_c] = color\n\n        # --- Horizontal Center Transformation ---\n        if any(r == horizontal_center - 1 or r == horizontal_center for r, _ in obj):\n            for r_orig, c_orig in obj:\n                output_grid[r_orig, cols - 1 - c_orig] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
