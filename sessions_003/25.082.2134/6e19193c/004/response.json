            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies objects and has the concept of a vertical and horizontal center line. However, the transformation rules are not accurately implemented, especially for objects on the right side of the vertical center and those intersecting the horizontal center. The first example fails because the left-side object movement doesn't account for existing objects at the center. The second fails on both right side diagonal and horizontal flip transform logic.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current object identification seems robust, so we'll keep it.\n2.  **Improve Left-Side Transformation:** Correct placement of the objects to the correct position.\n3.  **Revise Right-Side Transformation:** Implement the diagonal movement rule more accurately, probably involving sorting and relative positioning.\n4.  **Correct Horizontal Mirroring:** Revisit the horizontal mirroring logic to ensure it correctly flips objects across the horizontal center.\n5.  **Iterative Testing:** Test after each major rule adjustment.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (using manual inspection first, then code for confirmation if needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Two objects: `7` at (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) and `7` at (4,6), (4,7), (5,7).\n    *   **Expected Output:** Objects repositioned and one mirrored.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Left object moved incorrectly, right object not transformed, horizontal mirror incomplete.\n    *   **Issues:** Left side logic overwrites, right-side logic absent, mirror logic incomplete.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Two Objects: `9` at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4) and object `9` at (6,3) and (7,3), (7,4).\n    *   **Expected Output:** Objects positioned on diagonal and another is mirrored\n    *   **Actual Output:** Right object not moved to a diagonal, horizontal mirror absent.\n    *   **Issues:** Right-side transformation incorrect, horizontal mirroring absent.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. Each block is an object, characterized by its color and pixel coordinates.\n\n2.  **Center Lines:** Define a vertical and horizontal center line dividing the grid into four quadrants. For a 10x10 grid, the vertical center is between columns 5 and 6, and the horizontal center is between rows 5 and 6.\n\n3.  **Left-Side Transformation:** Any object located entirely to the left of the vertical center line is moved to the vertical center line. The left most pixel is placed on the center line, maintaining the original row of that pixel.\n\n4.  **Right-Side Transformation:** Any object located entirely to the right of the vertical center line is moved diagonally. The object effectively \"slides\" down and to the left such that it's top right corner pixel's distance to the top right corner of it's quadrant, is maintained with it's new location to the top right corner of the grid. So if an object's top right pixel is 1 down and 1 right of the top right corner of it's quadrant, it will end up 1 down and one right of the top right corner of the grid.\n\n5.  **Horizontal Mirroring:** Any object that has any pixel with a row index equal to horizontal_center - 1 or horizontal_center has it's x coordinates mirrored. For each pixel at `(r, c)` in the original object, a pixel at `(r, cols - 1 - c)` exists in the output.\n\n6.  **Output:** Create a new grid initialized with zeros (white). Place the transformed objects onto the output grid based on the transformation rules.\n"
