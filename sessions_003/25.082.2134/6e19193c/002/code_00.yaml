example1:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: 7  # Orange
        positions: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]  # Left side object
        shape: L #describes the relative shape
      - color: 7  # Orange
        positions: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7)]  # Right side object
        shape: reverse_L #describes the shape
  output:
    objects:
      - color: 7
        positions: [(0,4),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1), (3,2),(4,6),(4,7),(5,7),(6,5),(7,4),(8,3),(9,2)] #describe what created, in order
        notes: object created at center, and on the diagonal correctly, and created with correct mirroring
  transformation:
    - action: move_to_center_left
      condition: object_left_of_center
      details: Objects on the left move to the center vertical line, maintaining row.
    - action: create_diagonal_bottom_left
      condition: object_right_of_center
      details: Objects on the right move to the diagonal, top right to bottom left.
    - action: mirror
      condition: object_crosses_horizontal_center
      details: object is mirrored across horizontal center
example2:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: 9  # Maroon
        positions: [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4)]  # Left side object, top
        shape: L
      - color: 9  # Maroon
        positions: [(6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4)]  # Left side object, bottom
        shape: L
  output:
     objects:
      - color: 9
        positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4),(3,2),(4,1),(5,0),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4)] #describe what created
        notes: object placed with correct mirroring.
