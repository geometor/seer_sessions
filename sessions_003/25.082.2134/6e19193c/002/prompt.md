"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels in the input grid. Consider each block as a separate object.

2.  **Vertical Center Line:** Imagine a vertical line down the center of the grid (between columns 5 and 6).

3. **Horizontal Center Line:** Imagine a horizontal line down the center of the grid (between rows 5 and 6).

4.  **Object Transformation:**
    *   Any object to left of the vertical center line will be replicated or moved to the vertical center line, maintaining the object's original row.
    *  Any object to the right of the vertical line are placed, in order, on a diagonal line with a slope of -1, moving towards the bottom left.
    *   Any object that crosses the horizontal center line will be replicated so that the same object appears on the right of the grid with the same y position.

5.  **Output:** Create a new 10x10 grid, initially filled with 0 (white). Place the transformed objects onto this new grid according to the rules in step 4.
