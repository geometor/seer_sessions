  - observation: output 1 object |
      the left vertical orange line from the input is moved to the vertical middle of the grid.
 - observation: output 1 object |
      the right vertical orange line from the input forms a diagonal line moving from the center to the bottom left.
 - observation: input 2 object |
      two maroon(9) pixels, side-by-side, on the second row
- observation: input 2 object |
      a maroon(9) on the third row, one pixel to the right from the start of the maroon pair on the previous row
- observation: input 2 object |
      a maroon(9) on the seventh row, three pixels from the left edge.
- observation: input 2 object |
     a 2x2 block of maroon(9) pixels is on the 8th row, starting three pixels from the left edge.
 - observation: output 2 object |
     A copy of the upper 2x2 maroon object from the input appears on the right edge of the grid.
- observation: output 2 object |
     A diagonal line from the maroon pixel in the input, goes from row 3 column 5, to row 6 column 2.
