Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output pairs and try to figure out the transformation rule. Here's my attempt at a structured analysis:

**Perception of Task Elements**

*   **Grids:** The inputs and outputs are 10x10 grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, represented by digits 0-9. Color 0 (white) appears to be the background.
*    Orange (7) and Maroon(9) are present.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same non-zero color seem to form objects.
*   **Transformations:** There's a clear change in the position and potentially the arrangement of colored objects between the input and output. It's not a simple mirroring or rotation of the entire grid. It seems like objects, or parts of objects, are being moved or replicated. It resembles a cross stitch pattern.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 10x10.
  - observation: |
      Color 0 (white) is the background.
  - observation: |
    Orange(7) objects in example 1.
    Maroon(9) objects in example 2.
  - observation: |
      Objects are formed by contiguous, non-zero colored pixels.
  - observation: input 1 object |
      a 2x2 block of orange(7) pixels is split vertically.
  - observation: input 1 object |
      an orange line extending from the vertical middle to the left.
  - observation: output 1 object |
      the left vertical orange line from the input is moved to the vertical middle of the grid.
 - observation: output 1 object |
      the right vertical orange line from the input forms a diagonal line moving from the center to the bottom left.
 - observation: input 2 object |
      two maroon(9) pixels, side-by-side, on the second row
- observation: input 2 object |
      a maroon(9) on the third row, one pixel to the right from the start of the maroon pair on the previous row
- observation: input 2 object |
      a maroon(9) on the seventh row, three pixels from the left edge.
- observation: input 2 object |
     a 2x2 block of maroon(9) pixels is on the 8th row, starting three pixels from the left edge.
 - observation: output 2 object |
     A copy of the upper 2x2 maroon object from the input appears on the right edge of the grid.
- observation: output 2 object |
     A diagonal line from the maroon pixel in the input, goes from row 3 column 5, to row 6 column 2.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels in the input grid. Consider each block as a separate object.

2.  **Vertical Center Line:** Imagine a vertical line down the center of the grid (between columns 5 and 6).

3. **Horizontal Center Line:** Imagine a horizontal line down the center of the grid (between rows 5 and 6).

4.  **Object Transformation:**
    *   Any object to left of the vertical center line will be replicated or moved to the vertical center line, maintaining the object's original row.
    *  Any object to the right of the vertical line are placed, in order, on a diagonal line with a slope of -1, moving towards the bottom left.
    *   Any object that crosses the horizontal center line will be replicated so that the same object appears on the right of the grid with the same y position.

5.  **Output:** Create a new 10x10 grid, initially filled with 0 (white). Place the transformed objects onto this new grid according to the rules in step 4.
