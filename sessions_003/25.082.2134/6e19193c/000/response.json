            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output pairs and try to figure out the transformation rule. Here's my attempt at a structured analysis:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n*   **Grids:** The inputs and outputs are 10x10 grids.\n*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, represented by digits 0-9. Color 0 (white) appears to be the background.\n*    Orange (7) and Maroon(9) are present.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same non-zero color seem to form objects.\n*   **Transformations:** There's a clear change in the position and potentially the arrangement of colored objects between the input and output. It's not a simple mirroring or rotation of the entire grid. It seems like objects, or parts of objects, are being moved or replicated. It resembles a cross stitch pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

Consider each block as a separate object.\n\n2.  **Vertical Center Line:** Imagine a vertical line down the center of the grid (between columns 5 and 6).\n\n3. **Horizontal Center Line:** Imagine a horizontal line down the center of the grid (between rows 5 and 6).\n\n4.  **Object Transformation:**\n    *   Any object to left of the vertical center line will be replicated or moved to the vertical center line, maintaining the object's original row.\n    *  Any object to the right of the vertical line are placed, in order, on a diagonal line with a slope of -1, moving towards the bottom left.\n    *   Any object that crosses the horizontal center line will be replicated so that the same object appears on the right of the grid with the same y position.\n\n5.  **Output:** Create a new 10x10 grid, initially filled with 0 (white). Place the transformed objects onto this new grid according to the rules in step 4.\n"
