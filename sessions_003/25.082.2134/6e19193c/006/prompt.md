"""
1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. Each block is an object, characterized by its color and pixel coordinates.

2.  **Center Lines:** Define a vertical and horizontal center line dividing the grid into four quadrants. For a 10x10 grid, the vertical center is between columns 5 and 6, and the horizontal center is between rows 5 and 6.

3.  **Left-Side Transformation:** Any object located entirely to the left of the vertical center line is moved to the vertical center line. The left most pixel is placed on the center line, maintaining the original row of that pixel.

4.  **Right-Side Transformation:** Any object located entirely to the right of the vertical center line is moved diagonally. The object effectively "slides" down and to the left such that it's top right corner pixel's distance to the top right corner of it's quadrant, is maintained with it's new location to the top right corner of the grid. So if an object's top right pixel is 1 down and 1 right of the top right corner of it's quadrant, it will end up 1 down and one right of the top right corner of the grid.

5.  **Horizontal Mirroring:** Any object that has any pixel with a row index equal to horizontal_center - 1 or horizontal_center has it's x coordinates mirrored. For each pixel at `(r, c)` in the original object, a pixel at `(r, cols - 1 - c)` exists in the output.

6.  **Output:** Create a new grid initialized with zeros (white). Place the transformed objects onto the output grid based on the transformation rules.
