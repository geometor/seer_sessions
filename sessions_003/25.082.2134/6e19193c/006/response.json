            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for updating the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program captured some aspects of the transformation, but failed to accurately model the complex interactions between objects based on their positions relative to the center lines. The errors in both examples indicate issues with the right-side and horizontal mirroring transformations. Specifically, Example 1 shows errors in object placement after the left-side transformation, and both examples show major issues when objects should move from right to left, and mirror across the horizontal center.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The object identification seems correct, so this can be re-used.\n2.  **Revisit Transformations:** Break down each transformation rule (left, right, horizontal mirror) into more precise sub-steps. Pay very close attention to the conditions under which each rule applies.\n3.  **Coordinate System:** Consider using a more explicit coordinate system and relative positioning when describing the transformations, instead of relying on terms like \"move to\". Specify *from where* and *to where* in more detail.\n4. **Horizontal Mirroring**: Review carefully how this is meant to interact on objects crossing the horizontal center, and note that it is not a reflection across the horizontal center, rather specific x-coordinate changes.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via manual inspection, supplemented with print statements):**\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Two objects: Orange (7) on the left, Orange (7) on the right.\n*   **Expected Output:** Left object moves to the vertical center. Right object slides down and left. Object crossing horizontal center mirrors in x-coordinate.\n*   **Actual Output:** Left object incorrectly placed. Right object not moved/transformed. Horizontal mirroring incorrect.\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   Left-side transformation: The vertical positioning is correct, but the final position is shifted too far left.\n    *   Right-side transformation: The object disappears, indicates failure to apply any of the transform rules.\n    *   Horizontal Mirror: Not applied correctly on central object.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Two objects: Maroon (9) on the left-middle, Maroon (9) on the right.\n*   **Expected Output:** Left object moves adjacent to vertical center. Right object slides down and left. Left central object x-coordinate mirrors.\n*   **Actual Output:** Both objects only appear in their original position with no movement or mirroring.\n* **Observations:**\n    *   Left-side transformation: Object did not translate right.\n    *   Right-side transformation: The object disappears, indicates failure to apply any of the transform rules.\n    *  Horizontal Mirror: Did not apply.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"

Each block is considered an object and is defined by its color and the coordinates of its pixels.\n\n2.  **Center Lines:** Define a vertical and a horizontal center line dividing the grid into four quadrants.\n\n3.  **Left-Side Transformation:**\n    *   Condition: If all pixels of an object are entirely to the left of the vertical center line.\n    *   Action: Move the object to the right such that the leftmost pixel of the object is one position left of the vertical center line. The row coordinates of all pixels within the object remain unchanged.\n\n4.  **Right-Side Transformation:**\n    *   Condition: If all pixels of an object are entirely to the right of the vertical center line.\n    *   Action:\n        1. Determine the top-right pixel (r, c) of the object.\n        2.  Calculate the vertical distance (dv) from the horizontal center: `dv = horizontal_center - 1 - r`\n        3.  Move the entire object down by `dv` rows.\n        4. Calculate distance (original_dist) between the leftmost column of the object and vertical center.\n        5. Move the entire object left such that the rightmost pixel of the transformed object is at `c = vertical_center - 1 - original_dist`.\n\n5. **Horizontal Mirroring:**\n    *    Condition: If an object contains one or more pixels with a row index of either `horizontal_center - 1` or `horizontal_center`.\n    *     Action: For each pixel `(r, c)` in the object, create a new pixel at `(r, cols - 1 - c)` in the output. Note that other transformations are applied *before* the mirroring.\n\n6.  **Output:** Create a new grid filled with zeros (white). Place the transformed objects onto this grid according to the transformations above. If multiple transformations apply, apply them in the order: Left-Side, Right-Side, then Horizontal Mirroring.\n"
