Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels (objects) and attempts to consolidate them horizontally. However, the consolidation logic is flawed, as it doesn't correctly maintain the relative vertical positions of the objects *within* their original rows. It appears to be stacking all the objects to the top or moving objects down based on shape. The examples demonstrate that objects need to maintain their relative vertical positions, specifically aligning at the row level.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Refine Object Placement:** Instead of simply tracking `next_col`, the code needs to consider original object's row to properly position the output object's pixels.
2.  **Object bounding box:** Compute each object's minimum row, minimum column and maximum row and maximum column
3.  **Vertical Alignment:** Objects are aligned relative to their input rows.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, code execution not strictly needed here as we have the output):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Three objects (red, blue, yellow).
    *   Expected Output: Objects shifted to the left, aligned to preserve the relative rows they appear in the input, stacked to the top of the rows they use, then moved to be adjacent.
    *   Actual Output: Objects shifted, but stacked with the blue shape on top of the red shape.
    *   Issue: Vertical positioning within the row is incorrect. The heights of the rows are not correct.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Three objects (yellow, red, blue).
    *   Expected Output: Objects on the same row, shifted left.
    *   Actual Output: Objects shifted, but vertically misaligned, stacked to the top of output.
    *   Issue: Vertical positioning is incorrect.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Three objects across different rows (blue, red, and yellow).
    *    Expected: All objects combined into rows 3 and 4, objects placed on same rows.
    *   Actual Output: The blue and yellow shapes are placed based on their minimal row value.
    *   Issue: The row heights are not being computed correctly.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: red
    type: rectangle
    positions: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1], [1,2]] # Example 1, Input
    action: shift_left
  - id: 2
    color: blue
    type: rectangle
    positions:  [[1,7], [1,8], [2,7], [2,8]] # Example 1, Input
    action: shift_left
  - id: 3
    color: yellow
    type: rectangle
    positions: [[2,4], [2,5], [3,4], [3,5]] # Example 1, Input
    action: shift_left

transformations:
  - type: horizontal_consolidation
  - description: Objects are moved to the left, maintaining their relative vertical positions based on the top row of their combined height.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct contiguous blocks (objects) of non-zero (non-white) pixels in the input grid. Each block is a separate object, even if they share the same color.
2.  **Bounding box:** Calculate the bounding box of each object - this is the upper left and bottom right corners of a box containing all parts of the object.
3.  **Determine Object Order:** Sort the objects based on the horizontal position (leftmost column) of their bounding box in the input grid.
4.  **Consolidate Horizontally:** Place the objects in the output grid from left to right, maintaining each object's original shape.
5.  **Vertical position:** The object's vertical position in the input is used to position it in the output.
