The transformation rule involves identifying distinct contiguous blocks of non-zero (non-white) colored pixels in the input grid and consolidating them horizontally while preserving their vertical positions and shapes. Blocks of the same color that are not adjacent are treated as separate objects. The objects are placed adjacent to each other from left to right in the output grid, based on their original horizontal positions.
