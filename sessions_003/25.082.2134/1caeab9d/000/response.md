Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes.
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer representing a color.
*   The transformation seems to involve rearranging, combining, or modifying colored objects within the grid.
*   Empty areas (represented by 0, or white) are significant and can be altered by the transformation.
*   It appears adjacent objects may be consolidated, or that objects are moved, or areas filled.
*   There might be a specific order or priority in which these operations are applied.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: colored_block
    description: Contiguous block of one or more cells with the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer representing the color (0-9).
      - shape: Can be any shape, not restricted to basic geometric shapes.
      - size: Number of cells in the block.
      - position: Location within the grid (row, column indices).

actions:
  - name: consolidate
    description: Combine two or more separate blocks into a single block
  - name: move_object
    description: move objects around the plane, filling empty space
  - name: fill_area
    description: create object by filling an area, maybe empty space
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Two blocks are adjacent if they share a side or corner.
  - type: relative_position
    description: positional relationship between colored and empty areas
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero (non-white) colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Consolidation or movement:**
    *   In train\_1, two 2x2 blocks of color become one horizontal block.
    *   In train\_2, three separate horizontal 3-unit wide blocks become one consolidated block
    *   In train\_3, two objects are moved together on the horizontal plane.
3.  **Priority:** There doesn't seem to be a change in the order or relative layout of colored blocks.
4.  It appears colored blocks are moved to be adjacent, consolidating by color

I will now construct a Python function to perform this transformation.
