Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes.\n*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer representing a color.\n*   The transformation seems to involve rearranging, combining, or modifying colored objects within the grid.\n*   Empty areas (represented by 0, or white) are significant and can be altered by the transformation.\n*   It appears adjacent objects may be consolidated, or that objects are moved, or areas filled.\n*   There might be a specific order or priority in which these operations are applied.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
