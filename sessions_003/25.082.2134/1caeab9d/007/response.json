Blocks of the same color that are not adjacent are treated as separate objects. The objects are placed adjacent to each other from left to right in the output grid, based on their original horizontal positions.  The vertical position is determined by considering a combined, 2-row bounding box.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_distinct_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all distinct contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, obj):\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        obj.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, obj)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, obj)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, obj)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, obj)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] != 0 and not visited[row, col]:\n                obj = []\n                dfs(row, col, grid[row, col], obj)\n                objects.append((grid[row, col], obj))  # Store color and object pixels\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a zero-filled grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Get distinct objects from the input grid\n    objects = get_distinct_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Sort objects by their leftmost pixel's column (min_col)\n    objects_sorted = sorted(objects, key=lambda x: min(p[1] for p in x[1]))\n\n    # Consolidate and place objects horizontally\n    next_col = 0  # Track the next available column in the output\n    occupied_rows = set() #track rows used\n\n    for color, obj_pixels in objects_sorted:\n        # Get object's bounding box information\n        rows, cols = zip(*obj_pixels)\n        min_row = min(rows)\n        max_row = max(rows)\n        #min_col = min(cols) #not needed\n        height = max_row - min_row + 1\n        width = max(cols) - min(cols) + 1\n\n        #find rows for object\n        target_row = min_row\n        \n        # Copy the object into the output grid\n        for r_offset in range(height):\n            for c_offset in range(width):\n                output_grid[target_row + r_offset, next_col + c_offset] = color\n                \n        #update occupied rows and next available col\n        next_col += width\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
