The most prominent feature is the presence of the digit '5' (gray) in the input grids, which seems to be a focal point for the transformation. The output grids contain '1's (blue) seemingly surrounding or emanating from the '5's. The '0's (white) in the input are largely preserved as '0's in the output, but some are replaced by '1's. The relationship between input '5's and the placement of output '1's is key. The output grid appears to create a 3x3 area of 1s centered on any input 5.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

For a cell at (row, col), the 3x3 region includes cells from (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1).\n    *   Within the output grid, set the value of all cells within this 3x3 region to '1'. Ensure the coordinates are within the bounds of the output grid. If the coordinates exceed the boundaries then do not include those out of bounds pixels.\n    *   Set the value of the center cell (original '5' cell) to '5'.\n\n5. **Output** The output grid will have 3x3 blocks of 1's centered on any input 5, with the center pixel remaining a 5.\n"
