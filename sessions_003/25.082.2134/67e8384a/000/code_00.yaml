objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: [rows, cols] #variable
        elements: integers (0-9)
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: [2 * rows, 2 * cols] #double the input
        elements: integers (0-9)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: output_grid is a mirrored and expanded version of input_grid
  - type: element-wise
    description: >
      output grid pattern:
        top-left quadrant is identical to the input_grid
        top-right is a reflection of the input along the y-axis
        bottom-left is a relection of the input along the x-axis
        bottom-right is a double reflection - first along the x axis, then along the y axis
actions:
  - type: expansion
    description: The input grid's dimensions are doubled.
  - type: mirroring (reflection)
    description: >
      The input grid's content is mirrored horizontally, vertically, and
      diagonally to form the output grid.
