The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid. The core pattern seems to be a mirroring or reflection of the input grid, both horizontally and vertically. The dimensions of the output grid are always double that of the input grid in both height and width (rows and columns). The values within the grids are single digits, which represent distinct objects (likely based on color in a visual representation, although I only see the numbers here).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This is the subgrid of the output grid from (0,0) to (rows-1,cols-1).\n\n4.  **Populate Top-Right Quadrant:** Mirror the input grid horizontally (reflect along the vertical axis) and place the result in the top-right quadrant of the output grid.

This is ouput grid cells from (rows, cols) to (2\\*rows-1, 2\\*cols-1) filled with input grid cells from (rows-1, cols-1) down and back to (0,0).\n\n7.  **Output:** Return the populated output grid.\n"
