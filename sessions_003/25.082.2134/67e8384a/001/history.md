Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller rectangular grid (input) into a larger rectangular grid (output). The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid. The core pattern seems to be a mirroring or reflection of the input grid, both horizontally and vertically. The dimensions of the output grid are always double that of the input grid in both height and width (rows and columns). The values within the grids are single digits, which represent distinct objects (likely based on color in a visual representation, although I only see the numbers here).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: [rows, cols] #variable
        elements: integers (0-9)
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: [2 * rows, 2 * cols] #double the input
        elements: integers (0-9)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: output_grid is a mirrored and expanded version of input_grid
  - type: element-wise
    description: >
      output grid pattern:
        top-left quadrant is identical to the input_grid
        top-right is a reflection of the input along the y-axis
        bottom-left is a relection of the input along the x-axis
        bottom-right is a double reflection - first along the x axis, then along the y axis
actions:
  - type: expansion
    description: The input grid's dimensions are doubled.
  - type: mirroring (reflection)
    description: >
      The input grid's content is mirrored horizontally, vertically, and
      diagonally to form the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Obtain Input:** Get the input grid's dimensions (rows and columns) and its element values.

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new empty grid (output\_grid) with dimensions twice that of the input grid (2\*rows, 2\*cols).

3.  **Populate Top-Left Quadrant:** Copy the input grid directly into the top-left quadrant of the output grid. This is the subgrid of the output grid from (0,0) to (rows-1,cols-1).

4.  **Populate Top-Right Quadrant:** Mirror the input grid horizontally (reflect along the vertical axis) and place the result in the top-right quadrant of the output grid.  This is output grid cells from (0, cols) to (rows-1, 2\*cols-1) filled with input grid cells from (0, cols-1) back to (0,0).

5.  **Populate Bottom-Left Quadrant:** Mirror the input grid vertically (reflect along the horizontal axis) and place the result in the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid. This is output grid cells from (rows, 0) to (2\*rows-1, cols-1) filled with input grid cells from (rows-1, 0) back to (0,0).

6.  **Populate Bottom-Right Quadrant:** Mirror the input grid both horizontally and vertically (a double reflection, or equivalently, a 180-degree rotation) and place the result in the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid. This is ouput grid cells from (rows, cols) to (2\*rows-1, 2\*cols-1) filled with input grid cells from (rows-1, cols-1) down and back to (0,0).

7.  **Output:** Return the populated output grid.
