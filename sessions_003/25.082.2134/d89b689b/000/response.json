The most notable change is the replacement of certain single-color pixels and the removal of a 2x2 block. It appears there's a pairing or association of colors happening, where isolated pixels of certain colors are replaced with other colors in a specific pattern. The 2x2 block of azure pixels, is completely removed.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
