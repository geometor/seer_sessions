            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the provided information, analysis of the errors, and an updated natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies 2x2 azure blocks and attempts a transformation. However, it fails to correctly apply the color replacement logic within the azure blocks, as evidenced by the consistent \"pixels_off: 4\" error in all examples. The logic for selecting colors to fill the blocks is based on the output, but needs consider the input grid. The outside of block masking also appears correct, as the background is set to black.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct Color Source:** The `get_cyclic_colors` function must take its color inputs from non-azure pixels within the *input* grid, not the output, and the list of colors MUST be sorted in ascending order, as they will be placed in clockwise order starting from the top-left.\n2.  **Guaranteed Color Placement:** The code needs to cycle through the *unique* sorted colors and apply them *sequentially*.\n3.  **Handle Edge Cases** If there are not colors that are not 0 available, the default value for a cell should be 0 (black).\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and reasoning, supplemented with the results):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has a 2x2 azure block at (4,4).\n    *   Other colors present in input outside of the block: 7, 6, 4, 9.\n    *   Expected output has colors 6, 7, 4, 9 in the azure block.\n    *   Actual output has all 0s.\n    *   Error: Color replacement within the block failed.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has a 2x2 azure block at (4,4).\n    *   Other colors present in the input outside the block: 5, 9, 2, 1.\n    *   Expected output has colors 5, 9, 2, 1 in the azure block.\n    *   Actual output has all 0s.\n    *   Error: Color replacement within the block failed.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has a 2x2 azure block at (2, 5).\n    *   Other colors present outside the block: 1, 4, 3, 6.\n    *   Expected output has 1, 4, 3, 6 within the azure block.\n    *    Actual output has all 0s.\n    *   Error: Color replacement within the block failed.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
