1.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have the value 5 (gray).

2.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each gray pixel:
    *   If the gray pixel is in the top row change it to zero.
    *   Check the pixels directly to the *left* and *right* of the current gray pixel.
        *   If a neighbor exists and *is not* gray (and not 0), replace gray by that neighbor's value in the output grid.
        *   If both neighbors exist, and meet the conditions, prioritize change to the left pixel color.

3.  **Preserve Unchanged Pixels:** All other pixels that are not gray, or gray pixels with no non-gray/non-zero neighbors to the left or right, should remain unchanged in the output grid.

4. If there is no non-gray and non-zero neighbor on either side,
 - if the gray is to the left of a non-gray, non-zero color - change the gray to zero
 - otherwise,
    - If the row of the gray contains a non-zero, non-gray color on the left of gray, change gray to the color furthest to the left.
    - if none of the above, change gray to zero
