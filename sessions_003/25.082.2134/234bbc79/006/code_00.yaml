objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - pixels: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - rows: can be removed if all pixels are 0 in the input grid
      - gray_pixels: pixels with value 5, subject to transformation

actions:
  - name: find_source_color
    input: grid, row, column (of a gray pixel)
    output: color, direction
    description: >
      Searches for the nearest non-gray, non-zero pixel to the left or right
      of the input gray pixel.  If no source is found on either side, color zero
      is applied to the gray pixel.
  - name: propagate_color
    input: grid, row, column, color, direction
    output: modified grid
    description: >
      Replaces gray pixels in the given row, starting from the given column,
      with the given color, moving in the specified direction. Propagation
      stops when a non-gray pixel (any value other than 5, *including* 0)
      or the grid edge is encountered.
  - name: remove_zero_rows
    input: grid
    output: modified grid
    description: >
      Removes rows that consist *entirely* of zeros *in the input grid*. Rows
      that become all zeros due to color propagation are *not* removed.
  - name: preserve_non_gray
    input: grid, row, and column
    output: modified grid
    description: If a pixel is not gray (5), its original value is preserved.
