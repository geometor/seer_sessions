"""
1.  **Top Row Rule:** If a pixel is gray (value 5) and is located in the top row (row index 0) of the input grid, change it to 0 (white) in the output grid.

2.  **Color Propagation:** For all other gray pixels (not on the top row):
    *   Scan the same row to the *left* of the gray pixel.  If a non-gray, non-zero color is encountered, propagate that color *rightward* to the current gray pixel, and continue propagating to all contiguous gray pixels to its right, until a non-gray and non-zero pixel, or the edge of the grid is encountered.
    *   If no non-gray, non-zero color is found to the left, repeat the process scanning to the *right* of the gray pixel. If a non-gray, non-zero color is encountered, propagate that color *leftward* to the original gray pixel and any contiguous gray pixels to its left, until a non-gray, non-zero pixel or grid edge stops the propagation.
    * If after checking left and right, no non-gray, non-zero color exists in the row, change gray pixel to 0.

3.  **Preservation:** Pixels that are not gray remain unchanged in the output grid.

4. **Dimension Change** The dimensions of the grid can change. If a complete row consists of only zero's, it is removed in the output grid.
