1.  **Top Row Rule:** If a pixel is gray (value 5) and is located in the top row (row index 0) of the input grid, change it to 0 (white) in the output grid.

2.  **Color Propagation:** For all other gray pixels (not on the top row):
    *   Scan the same row to the *left* of the gray pixel.  If a non-gray, non-zero color is encountered, propagate that color *rightward* to the current gray pixel, and continue propagating to all contiguous gray pixels to its right, until a non-gray and non-zero pixel, or the edge of the grid is encountered.
    *   If no non-gray, non-zero color is found to the left, repeat the process scanning to the *right* of the gray pixel. If a non-gray, non-zero color is encountered, propagate that color *leftward* to the original gray pixel and any contiguous gray pixels to its left, until a non-gray, non-zero pixel or grid edge stops the propagation.
    * If after checking left and right, no non-gray, non-zero color exists in the row, change gray pixel to 0.

3.  **Preservation:** Pixels that are not gray remain unchanged in the output grid.

4. **Dimension Change** The dimensions of the grid can change. If a complete row consists of only zero's, it is removed in the output grid.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code have several critical flaws, made evident by the consistent failure across all test examples. The core issues seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Color Propagation Logic:** The propagation logic doesn't correctly identify the source and target of color changes. It appears to be overwriting colors incorrectly and doesn't handle the "contiguous gray pixels" rule properly.

2. **Incorrect removal of all zero rows.** The program is intended to remove any row that has only zero values, but appears to be implemented incorrectly.

3.  **Incorrect Top Row Rule**: The program incorrectly assumes any gray pixel in the top row must be white.

The strategy for improvement will involve a detailed re-examination of *each* example, focusing on step-by-step tracing of how colors *should* change according to the intended rule. This will involve creating a detailed "trace" for each example and comparing it to the observed behavior of the current code.

**Metrics and Analysis (using code execution):**

I'll use `tool_code` to perform a more precise comparison of the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. This is crucial for pinpointing *exactly* where the code's logic deviates from the expected behavior.

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid as the output grid.

2.  **Gray Pixel Processing:** Iterate through each cell of the *input* grid. Only process cells that are gray (value 5) in the *input* grid.

3.  **Color Source Determination (for gray pixels):**
    *   **Left Scan:** Examine the cells in the same row, to the *left* of the current gray pixel. Stop at the first cell that is *not* gray (5) and *not* zero (0).  If such a cell is found, remember its color.
    *   **Right Scan (if no color found on the left):** If no suitable color was found to the left, examine the cells to the *right* of the current gray pixel, using the same criteria (non-gray, non-zero). Remember the color if found.
    * **Zero Assignment (if no color found)**: If, after scanning left and right, no source color is determined, set output to zero (0)

4.  **Color Propagation:**
    * If a source color was found (either left or right):
        * Change the current (originally gray) pixel in the output grid to the source color.
        * **Contiguous Gray Propagation:** Continue propagating this source color *in the same direction the color was found* along the current row in the output grid. Only overwrite pixels that were originally gray (5) in the *input* grid. Stop propagation when a non-gray pixel or the edge of the grid is reached.

5.  **Non-Gray Pixel Preservation:** If a cell in the input grid is *not* gray (5), its value is directly copied to the output grid without change.

6.  **Row Removal:** After processing all pixels, iterate through the rows of the *output* grid.  If *any* row contains only zeros (0), remove that entire row from the output grid. The final output grid's dimensions may be smaller than the input grid's dimensions.

**Key Changes and Clarifications:**

*   **Input vs. Output:** The original program mixed operations on the input and output grids.  The revised program clearly distinguishes:  We *check* the input grid's original state to decide *how* to modify the output grid.
*   **Contiguous Propagation:** The program now explicitly states that propagation continues only over pixels that *were originally gray* in the input.
*   **Directionality:** The propagation direction is tied to where the source color was found (left or right).
* **Zero Assignment**: if no non-gray, non-zero color found in the row, gray is changed to zero.
*   **Row Removal:** Row removal is the *final* step, applied to the fully processed output grid.
*   **Top Row Rule Removed:** The rule about gray pixels in the top row being automatically set to 0 is incorrect and has been removed. The general color propagation rules apply to all rows.
