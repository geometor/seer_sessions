facts:
  - observation: |
      Inputs and outputs are grids of digits 0-9.
  - object_identification: |
      Objects are contiguous regions of the same color.
  - color_significance: |
      Color 5 (gray) appears to be a trigger or marker for changes.
  - spatial_relationships: |
      Horizontal and vertical adjacency are crucial.
  - transformation_type: |
      The transformation is not a simple mathematical operation but involves conditional replacements and movements based on color and proximity.
  - input_output_size: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions within each example pair, but dimensions vary between pairs.
  - train_example_1:
    - input_gray_positions: [(0,1), (1,3), (1,5), (2,4)]
    - output_changes: |
        Gray at (0,1) becomes 0; Gray at (1,3) becomes 1; Gray at (1,5) becomes 2; Gray at (2,4) becomes 0.
  - train_example_2:
    - input_gray_positions: [(0,3), (0,5), (2,1), (2,7)]
    - output_changes: |
        Gray at (0,3) becomes 0; Gray at (0,5) becomes 0; Gray at (2,1) becomes 2, Gray at (2,7) becomes 3
  - train_example_3:
      - input_gray_positions: [(0,6), (1,4), (2,2), (2,8)]
      - output_changes: |
          Gray at (0,6) becomes 0; Gray at (1,4) becomes 0; Gray at (2,2) becomes 2; Gray at (2,8) becomes 0
  - train_example_4:
        - input_gray_positions: [(0,2), (1,4), (2,5)]
        - output_changes: |
            Gray at (0,2) becomes 1; Gray at (1,4) becomes 2; Gray at(2,5) becomes 0
