The transformation seems to focus on specific colors and their spatial relationships, particularly horizontal and vertical adjacency. There's a strong indication of object manipulation, where objects might be defined by contiguous regions of the same color. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic or global grid operations but rather localized interactions and replacements. Color 5 (gray) appears to play a key role in the transformations.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
