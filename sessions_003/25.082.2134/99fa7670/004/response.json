            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined strategy.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code have several issues, as evidenced by the mismatches in the train set results. The core problems seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Horizontal Expansion:** The horizontal expansion logic isn't quite right. It appears to copy pixels *before* the expanded one incorrectly. It should simply fill to the right edge.\n2.  **Incorrect Vertical Replication:** The vertical replication logic is also flawed. It's not correctly placing or replicating the expanded rows based on the count of non-zero pixels *below* the current row. It needs to place the specified number of rows, not just stop at the original input boundry.\n3. Zero preservation is incorrect - needs to preserve all 0 rows encountered.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Careful Re-examination of the Examples:** We'll meticulously analyze each input-output pair to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails.\n2.  **Precise Metric Gathering:** Using `tool_code`, we'll gather specific metrics about pixel counts, row/column dimensions, and color distributions to quantify the discrepancies.\n3.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Based on the re-examination and metrics, we'll develop a more accurate and detailed natural language description of the transformation.\n4. **Fact Documentation in YAML:** We'll create a YAML block summarizing key observations about objects, properties, and actions.\n5. **Prepare for code update** Ensure a clear plan exists for updating the `transform` function.\n\n**Metric Gathering with `tool_code`**\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to get some more information about example 2, as it is the simplest failing case.\n\n"
