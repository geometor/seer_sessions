"""
Transforms an input grid by expanding non-zero pixels horizontally and vertically.

1. **Iterate:** Go through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
2. **Horizontal Expansion:** Within each row, examine each pixel. If a pixel is non-zero, expand it horizontally to the right edge of the grid, creating a continuous line of that color. This forms a new, expanded row.
3. **Count and Replicate:** Count the total number of non-zero pixels in the *original* input grid that are in the *current row or below*.
4. **Vertical Placement:**
    * Place the first horizontally-expanded row in the output.
    * Place subsequent copies of the expanded row directly *below* the previous one until the required number of vertically stacked rows are created (from Step 3). If the output grid would exceed the boundaries, complete only the rows that fit, ensuring we never write out of bounds.
5. **Zero Preservation:** Zero-valued pixels in the input remain zero-valued pixels in the output, and are not expanded.

Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined strategy.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code have several issues, as evidenced by the mismatches in the train set results. The core problems seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Horizontal Expansion:** The horizontal expansion logic isn't quite right. It appears to copy pixels *before* the expanded one incorrectly. It should simply fill to the right edge.
2.  **Incorrect Vertical Replication:** The vertical replication logic is also flawed. It's not correctly placing or replicating the expanded rows based on the count of non-zero pixels *below* the current row. It needs to place the specified number of rows, not just stop at the original input boundry.
3. Zero preservation is incorrect - needs to preserve all 0 rows encountered.

The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Careful Re-examination of the Examples:** We'll meticulously analyze each input-output pair to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails.
2.  **Precise Metric Gathering:** Using `tool_code`, we'll gather specific metrics about pixel counts, row/column dimensions, and color distributions to quantify the discrepancies.
3.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Based on the re-examination and metrics, we'll develop a more accurate and detailed natural language description of the transformation.
4. **Fact Documentation in YAML:** We'll create a YAML block summarizing key observations about objects, properties, and actions.
5. **Prepare for code update** Ensure a clear plan exists for updating the `transform` function.

**Metric Gathering with `tool_code`**

Let's use `tool_code` to get some more information about example 2, as it is the simplest failing case.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate through Rows:** Process the input grid row by row, starting from the top.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each row:
    *   Create a new, initially empty (all zeros) row of the same width as the input grid.
    *   Iterate through the original row's pixels.
    *   If a pixel is non-zero:
        *   Fill all elements in the new row *from the current column to the right edge* with the non-zero pixel's value.
        * Copy all elements in the new row *from 0 to the current column* from the original row.
    *   If a pixel is zero, the output row will have a zero in that location (handled by initialization).
3.  **Vertical Replication:**
    *   For each processed row (after horizontal expansion):
        *   Count the number of non-zero pixels in the *original* input grid that are in the current row or any row below it.
        *   Place the horizontally expanded row into the output grid.
        *   Repeat the horizontally expanded row, placing each copy directly below the previous one, for the number of times calculated in the previous step. Do *not* exceed the bounds of the input grid.
4. **Zero Rows**: If a row is all zeros, copy it to the output
