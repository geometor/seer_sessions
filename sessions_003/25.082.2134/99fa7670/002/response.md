Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The current code has a fundamental flaw in how it handles vertical expansion. It's not correctly replicating the expanded rows based on the count of non-zero pixels *below* the current pixel's row, AND it seems to be stopping the fill too early. The horizontal expansion seems to be working correctly, but the core logic of vertical duplication and positioning is incorrect. The strategy is to fix these by:

1.  **Correct Vertical Expansion:** Refactor the vertical expansion to ensure the right number of copies are created *and placed correctly*.
2.  **Output Indexing:** Correct the output\_row\_index usage.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution where helpful):**

I'll use numpy for easier grid manipulation and analysis.  Here are detailed reports for each example:


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)

    print(f"Input:\n{input_grid}\n")
    print(f"Expected Output:\n{expected_output}\n")
    print(f"Transformed Output:\n{transformed_output}\n")

    diff = (expected_output != transformed_output)
    print(f"Differences (pixels that don't match):\n{diff}\n")
    num_diff = np.sum(diff)
    print(f"Number of differing pixels: {num_diff}\n")

    print("---")

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate:** Go through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** Within each row, examine each pixel. If a pixel is non-zero, expand it horizontally to the right edge of the grid, creating a continuous line of that color. This forms a new, expanded row.
3. **Count and Replicate:** Count the total number of non-zero pixels in the *original* input grid that are in the *current row or below*.
4.  **Vertical Placement:**
   *  Place the first horizontally-expanded row in the output.
   * Place subsequent copies of the expanded row directly *below* the previous one until the required number of vertically stacked rows (from step 3) are created. If the output grid is filled before creating the correct number of copies, stop placing rows.
5. **Zero Preservation:** Zero-valued pixels in the input remain zero-valued pixels in the output, and are not expanded.
