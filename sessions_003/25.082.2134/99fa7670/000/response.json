The primary elements are colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9) arranged in a 2D grid. The transformation seems to involve identifying non-zero colored pixels in the input and expanding them both horizontally and vertically in the output. The background (0 or white) remains unchanged. The key seems to be identifying isolated, non-zero pixels and replicating them to form lines.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
