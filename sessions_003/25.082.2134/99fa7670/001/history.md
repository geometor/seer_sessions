Here's my analysis of the provided examples, outlining my perception of the task, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming input grids to output grids. The primary elements are colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9) arranged in a 2D grid. The transformation seems to involve identifying non-zero colored pixels in the input and expanding them both horizontally and vertically in the output. The background (0 or white) remains unchanged. The key seems to be identifying isolated, non-zero pixels and replicating them to form lines.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (MxN)
      - elements: pixels (integers 0-9)
      - background: 0 (white)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_pixels
    description: Locate pixels with values other than 0.
  - name: expand_horizontally
    description: Replicate a pixel's color to the right, filling the remaining row.
  - name: expand_vertically
    description: Duplicate the expanded row downwards, based on the original pixel's position and how many original non-zero pixels appear after it in the input.

relationships:
  - non-zero pixels are expanded
  - expansion fills to the edges of original grid size

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify:** Iterate through the input grid, row by row, and identify all non-zero pixels.
2. **Expand Horizontally:** For each non-zero pixel found, replicate its color value horizontally to the right edge of the grid, creating a row of that color.
3. **Expand Vertically:** Create copies of the the horizontally-expanded rows. Make copies until you've created N new rows, including the first expanded row, where N is the count of all non-zero pixels in the original input grid found at and below the row of current non-zero pixel.
4.  **Maintain Background**: If a pixel in the input is 0, it remains 0 in the output.
