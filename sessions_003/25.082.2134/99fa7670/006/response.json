            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a good first attempt, implementing a horizontal expansion and vertical replication based on non-zero pixel counts. However, the results show consistent errors across all examples, indicating a flaw in how the vertical replication and possibly the termination of the horizontal expansion are handled. The core issue seems to be in how and when the code duplicates rows, it is counting from the current row to the bottom. The code is also prematurely stopping the expansion after finding the first non-zero.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Horizontal Expansion Revisited:** The original idea of filling to the right edge is correct, but we must copy any zeros *before* finding a non-zero. Currently, the code stops processing the row once it finds a non-zero, which will not work for inputs with interior zeros.\n\n2.  **Vertical Replication Logic:** Instead of counting non-zero pixels *below* the current row, we need to base vertical repetition from the index *after* the current colored block.\n\n3. **Object Identification**: Explicitly identify \"blocks\" of consecutive non-zero pixels of same color within each row.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary):**\n\nWe already have some key metrics from the test, like the number of pixels off, color correctness, and whether the size is correct.\n\n"
