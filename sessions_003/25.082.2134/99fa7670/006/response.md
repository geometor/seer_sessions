Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good first attempt, implementing a horizontal expansion and vertical replication based on non-zero pixel counts. However, the results show consistent errors across all examples, indicating a flaw in how the vertical replication and possibly the termination of the horizontal expansion are handled. The core issue seems to be in how and when the code duplicates rows, it is counting from the current row to the bottom. The code is also prematurely stopping the expansion after finding the first non-zero.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Horizontal Expansion Revisited:** The original idea of filling to the right edge is correct, but we must copy any zeros *before* finding a non-zero. Currently, the code stops processing the row once it finds a non-zero, which will not work for inputs with interior zeros.

2.  **Vertical Replication Logic:** Instead of counting non-zero pixels *below* the current row, we need to base vertical repetition from the index *after* the current colored block.

3. **Object Identification**: Explicitly identify "blocks" of consecutive non-zero pixels of same color within each row.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary):**

We already have some key metrics from the test, like the number of pixels off, color correctness, and whether the size is correct.


```yaml
example_1:
  input_shape: [6, 6]
  output_shape: [6, 6]
  input_non_zero_count: 2
  output_non_zero_count: 9
  pixels_off: 17
  colors: [0, 2, 3]

example_2:
  input_shape: [3, 3]
  output_shape: [3, 3]
  input_non_zero_count: 1
  output_non_zero_count: 3
    pixels_off: 1
  colors: [0, 6]

example_3:
  input_shape: [6, 6]
  output_shape: [6, 6]
  input_non_zero_count: 2
  output_non_zero_count: 10
  pixels_off: 17
  colors: [0, 8, 5]

example_4:
  input_shape: [7, 5]
  output_shape: [7, 5]
  input_non_zero_count: 3
  output_non_zero_count: 12
  pixels_off: 15
  colors: [0, 8, 7, 6]
```


**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      cells:  # Individual pixels
        - value: integer (0-9 representing color)
          properties:
            color:  # Derived from value using COLOR_MAP
              - white (0)
              - blue (1)
              - red (2)
              - green (3)
              - yellow (4)
              - gray (5)
              - magenta (6)
              - orange (7)
              - azure (8)
              - maroon (9)
            position: (row_index, column_index)

  - type: horizontal_block
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      start_row: integer
      start_column: integer
      end_column: integer #inclusive

actions:
  - name: expand_horizontally
    description: Extends a horizontal_block to the right edge of the grid.
    input: horizontal_block
    output: expanded_row

  - name: replicate_vertically
    description:  Copies a horizontal_block vertically, with zeros between.
    input:  expanded_row, row position of colored block
    output: modified_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate through Rows:** Process the input grid row by row.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:**
    *   Create a new, initially empty (all zeros) row.
    *   Iterate through the input row. Copy pixels to the new row.
    *   If a non-zero pixel is encountered:
        *   Set a flag to indicate a color block was found.
        *    Fill all subsequent elements (to the right edge) in the *new* row with this non-zero pixel's value.
        *   Record start and end of non-zero block

3.  **Vertical Replication:**
    *   Place the expanded row in the output.
    *   For each *subsequent* row:
        * insert a row of zeros
        * insert expanded row

4. **Complete**: Once all rows have been processed, return the output grid.
