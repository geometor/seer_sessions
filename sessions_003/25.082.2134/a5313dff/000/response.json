The transformation seems to focus on the red pixels within each input grid. Specifically, it looks like areas *within* the red regions are being filled with a new color, blue(1), based on some geometric rule. The black(0) background seems unchanged. The defining characteristic seems to be \"enclosed\" red (2) regions which are then changed by the infill. The outer \"frame\" of red remains.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This region must form a closed shape, meaning it completely surrounds an internal area, without \"leaks\". If some red areas are not closed shapes and do not fully surround anything, ignore.\n2. **Identify Enclosed Area:** Determine the area enclosed *within* the red shape. This is the collection of connected pixels completely surrounded by the red shape found in step 1.\n3. **Fill Enclosed Area with Blue (1):** Change the color of all the connected pixels *inside* the identified enclosing shape to blue (1), while leaving the outer border red(2). If there are no internal enclosed areas in the red shape, there is nothing to fill, resulting in no changes.\n4. **Background Preservation:** Ensure the black (0) background pixels remain unchanged.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies closed shapes made of red (2) pixels and fills the area they enclose with blue(1) pixels, leaving a red(2) boundary, while leaving any other regions untouched.\n"
