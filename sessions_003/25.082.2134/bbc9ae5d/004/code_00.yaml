facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 1D array of integers.
  - observation: |
      The output is a 2D array of integers.
  - observation: |
      The first row of the output is identical to the input.
  - observation: |
    The height of the output array is equal to index of the last non-zero element + 1
  - observation: |
      Subsequent rows are created by replacing zeros in the input array with the last non-zero value.
  - observation: |
      The number of zeros replaced increases by one in each subsequent row.
  - observation: |
    Zeros are replaced sequentially from left to right.
  - observation: |
    Only zeros *before* the position of last non-zero element in the original input are eligible for replacement.
