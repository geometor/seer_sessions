facts:
  - object: input_row
    type: 1D array
    properties:
      - contains: integers
      - elements: can be zero or non-zero
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - shape: derived from input_row
      - first_row: identical to input_row
      - subsequent_rows: "expansion" of non-zero elements
    actions:
      - expand:
        - description: >
            The last non-zero element of the input_row is repeated. Each
            subsequent row adds one more repetition of this element, creating
            a triangular pattern. Zero elements remain unchanged.
        - property: non-zero elements
        - direction: top-left to bottom-right
