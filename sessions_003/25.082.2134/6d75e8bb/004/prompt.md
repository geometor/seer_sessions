"""
Transforms an input grid by replacing certain azure (8) pixels with red (2) pixels.
The replacement strategy focuses on azure pixels that are part of a contiguous azure region
that is adjacent to white (0) pixels. Azure pixels are considered on the "outside" if they are
directly adjacent to a white pixel, or are part of a connected "line" of azure pixels that
leads to a white pixel. "Inside" azure pixels (those surrounded entirely by other azure pixels,
and not part of a chain leading to white) are preserved.
