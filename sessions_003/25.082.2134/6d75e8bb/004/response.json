            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of replacing \"outside\" azure (8) pixels with red (2) pixels. The definition of \"outside\" was based on adjacency to white (0) pixels and tracing along connected azure pixels. However, the results across the three examples show that the current implementation is too aggressive in replacing azure pixels. It seems to misinterpret the \"line\" condition and incorrectly classifies some \"inside\" azure pixels as \"outside\". The code is replacing too many azure pixels to red.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Analyze Pixel Differences:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Use python code to identify the exact locations where the transformed output differs from the expected output. This will pinpoint the specific azure pixels that are being incorrectly replaced (or not replaced).\n2. **Refine Outside Definition**: Revisit and clarify conditions of outside pixels vs. interior. The \"line\" condition seems wrong.\n3. **Revise Natural Language Program:** Based on error analysis and the corrected definition, update the natural language program to be more accurate and complete.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Errors:**\n\nLet's use code execution to get precise information about the differences.\n\n"
