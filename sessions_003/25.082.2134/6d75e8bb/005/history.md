"""
Transforms an input grid by replacing certain azure (8) pixels with red (2) pixels.
The replacement strategy focuses on azure pixels that are part of a contiguous azure region
that is adjacent to white (0) pixels. Azure pixels are considered on the "outside" if they are
directly adjacent to a white pixel, or are part of a connected "line" of azure pixels that
leads to a white pixel. "Inside" azure pixels (those surrounded entirely by other azure pixels,
and not part of a chain leading to white) are preserved.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of replacing "outside" azure (8) pixels with red (2) pixels. The definition of "outside" was based on adjacency to white (0) pixels and tracing along connected azure pixels. However, the results across the three examples show that the current implementation is too aggressive in replacing azure pixels. It seems to misinterpret the "line" condition and incorrectly classifies some "inside" azure pixels as "outside". The code is replacing too many azure pixels to red.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Analyze Pixel Differences:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Use python code to identify the exact locations where the transformed output differs from the expected output. This will pinpoint the specific azure pixels that are being incorrectly replaced (or not replaced).
2. **Refine Outside Definition**: Revisit and clarify conditions of outside pixels vs. interior. The "line" condition seems wrong.
3. **Revise Natural Language Program:** Based on error analysis and the corrected definition, update the natural language program to be more accurate and complete.

**Gather Metrics and Analyze Errors:**

Let's use code execution to get precise information about the differences.

    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
        # Defines whether the region consists of orthogonally connected pixels of the same color.
      - enclosed: False
        # Initially assume not enclosed, determine through analysis

  - name: white_region
     color: white (0)
     properties:
       - contiguous: True

actions:
  - name: identify_enclosed_azure
    description: Determine if an azure region is completely enclosed by other azure regions or the edge of the image.
    parameters:
      - azure_region
    result: Sets 'enclosed' property of the azure_region

  - name: replace_color
    description: Replace the color of specific pixels within an azure region.
    parameters:
      - azure_region
      - target_color: red (2) #new color
    conditions:
      - not azure_region.enclosed # Replace only if the region is not enclosed.

```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify White Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
3.  **Determine Enclosure:** For each azure region:
    *   Check if the azure region is adjacent to a white region.
    *   An azure region is considered "enclosed" if it has *no* adjacent white pixels, *and* all of its azure pixels have at least 3 neighboring pixels which are either the edge of the image or another azure.
4.  **Replace Non-Enclosed Azure:** Iterate through each azure region. If an azure region is *not* "enclosed", change all the azure pixels on the "edge" to red (2), where edge means they are adjacent to a 0 or have fewer than 3 azure neighbors.

Key improvements and clarifications in the natural language program:

*   **Explicit Enclosure Definition:**  The concept of "enclosed" is now much more precise. It's not just about being *near* white, but about being fully surrounded by other azure pixels or the image boundary, and not directly touching a white region.
* "Edge" pixels are explicitly defined.
* Order of operations is clarified.

This revised program aims to capture the core transformation logic more accurately by refining the definition of which azure pixels should be replaced.
