            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the observation that azure (8) pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels are replaced with red (2) pixels. However, the test results on the training examples reveal that this rule is not entirely accurate. The provided code replaces *all* azure pixels adjacent to white with red, regardless of the context of surrounding azure pixels. The expected outputs show a more nuanced replacement pattern. It appears there's a concept of \"enclosed\" azure regions being preserved, and only azure pixels on the \"border\" with white pixels, and potentially part of a contiguous \"line\" connected to the border, are replaced.\n\nMy strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Analyzing the Differences:** Carefully examine the differences between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` for each example. I will use numpy to calculate more accurate comparison data to see exactly which pixels changed, or did not.\n2.  **Refining the Rule:** Develop a more precise description of when an azure pixel should be replaced, considering connectivity and enclosure. This is very likely to involve ideas about \"inside\" and \"outside\".\n3.  **Updating the Natural Language Program:** Clearly articulate the refined rule in the natural language program.\n\n**Gathering Metrics and Analysis with Code Execution**\n\nI'll use `numpy` to compare the expected and transformed outputs to get precise pixel-level differences. This will help identify patterns in the errors.\n\n"
