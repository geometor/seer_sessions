The transformation seems to involve introducing red (2) pixels within the azure regions. The placement of the red pixels appears to be related to the shape and connectivity of the azure regions, often replacing azure pixels in the \"interior\" or creating a \"border\" effect.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
