Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of two colors: azure (8) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve introducing red (2) pixels within the azure regions. The placement of the red pixels appears to be related to the shape and connectivity of the azure regions, often replacing azure pixels in the "interior" or creating a "border" effect.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (dependent on example)
      - cells: contain integer values representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - white (0)
          - azure (8)
          - red (2)  # Introduced in the output
      - position: (row, column) within the grid

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Change the color of a pixel from azure to red.
    constraints:
      - location: Appears to occur within existing azure regions.
      - pattern: Seems to prioritize interior pixels or create borders/outlines.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and sometimes diagonally.
  - type: containment
    description: Red pixels are always introduced within areas originally occupied by azure pixels.
  - type: pattern_based_replacement
    description: The placement of red pixels follows a discernible pattern based on local pixel configurations.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Interior/Border Detection:** For each azure region, determine 'interior' and/or 'border' pixels based on different strategies:
    *   **Strategy 1 (Example 1):** Check the borders for inward intrusions, and fill those parts of the border.
    *   **Strategy 2 (Example 2 and 3):** If any azure pixel has at least one orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) white (0) pixel, replace that segment/border with red.

3.  **Replace with Red:** Change the color of the selected azure pixels (determined in step 2) to red (2).

4.  **Output:** Present the modified grid as the output.
The main point to check will be the specific method for locating how the red pixels replace the blue pixels. The pattern is not a solid shape replacement, it involves checking adjacency.
