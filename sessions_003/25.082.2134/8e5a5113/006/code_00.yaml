facts:
  - description: "The input grid is divided into sections by separator columns of color 5 (gray)."
  - description: "The leftmost section, before the first separator, is referred to as the 'Left Section'."
  - description: "Separator columns are copied to the output grid."
  - description: "The Left Section is copied directly to the beginning of the output grid."
  - description: "A mirrored version of the Left Section (rotated 180 degrees) appears in the output grid."
  - description: "The middle section, between the first and second separators, is a 180-degree rotated copy of the Left Section."
  - description: "The rightmost section, after the second separator (if it exists), is also a 180 degree rotated copy of the Left Section."
  - description: "If no separator exists, then the output is the same as input"
  - observation: "The positions and number of separator columns are crucial for determining section boundaries."
  - observation: "The mirroring (180-degree rotation) is consistent across all examples."
