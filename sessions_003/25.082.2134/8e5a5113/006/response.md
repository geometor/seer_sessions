Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of sectioning and mirroring. However, the results show consistent errors across all three examples, indicating a flaw in how the middle section is handled. The mirrored section overwrites pixels that should either be from a flipped version, or overwrites the second separator. The strategy is to carefully re-examine the middle section's placement and mirroring logic, specifically focusing on the boundaries and how they interact with the separator columns.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1. **Precise Boundary Calculation:** The core issue seems to be incorrect indexing when placing the mirrored section. We need to ensure that the start and end points of the middle section are calculated *dynamically* based on the width of the left section and the positions of the separator columns, and that the middle section does not extend past a following separator.
2. **Correct Mirroring:** Ensure only the section between separators is considered.
3. **Separator Handling:** Explicitly handle cases with one, two or more separators, and potentially zero separator. Ensure separator columns are copied correctly and are not overwritten.
4. **Dynamic Resizing:** It seems like the right-most section should always begin mirroring so that it ends at the end of the input grid, but should be bounded by the second separator if it exists.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Separators:** Find all columns in the input grid where all cells have the color 5 (gray). These are the separator columns.
2.  **Handle No Separators:** If there are no separator columns, the output is identical to the input.
3.  **Left Section:** Extract the portion of the input grid to the left of the first separator column. This is the "Left Section".
4.  **Copy Left Section:** Copy the Left Section to the beginning of the output grid.
5.  **Copy First Separator:** Copy the first separator column to the output grid, immediately following the Left Section.
6.  **Middle Section (Mirrored):**
    *   Calculate the start position of the middle section: one column after the first separator.
    *   If a second separator exists:
        *    Calculate the end position as one column *before* the second separator.
    *    If no second separator exists
        *   Calculate the end position so the length of this section is same as Left Section.
    *   Create a mirrored (180-degree rotated) copy of the Left Section.
    *    If length of mirrored Left Section is larger than (end position - start position)
          * Truncate mirrored left section to fit between the separators
    *   Place the mirrored Left Section into the middle section of the output grid.
7.  **Right Section (Mirrored):**
    *   Create mirrored version of Left Section
    *   Calculate Start Position: Output grid width - width of Left Section
    *   If a second separator exists:
         *    Calculate the start position: immediately after the second separator.
         *    Place section here (truncating if necessary).
    *    Else
         *   Place Mirrored section at Start Position
8.  **Copy Second Separator (if present):** If a second separator column exists, copy it to the output grid at the same index as in the input grid.
