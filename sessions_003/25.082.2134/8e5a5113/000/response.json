The final four columns of zeros appear to act as padding/background.\n*    The right side of input is always all zeros.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves some form of mirroring and/or replication of the left side of the input grid to construct the output. There's a specific pattern, and the central vertical line of 5's seems to act as a \"mirror\" or pivot point.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This is our pivot point (column 4).\n2.  **Mirror Left Side:** Take the section of the input grid to the *left* of the separator (columns 0-2).\n3.  **Reverse Columns:** Reverse the order of these columns. So, column 2 becomes the new column 4, column 1 becomes the new column 5, and column 0 becomes new column 6.\n4.    **Copy Separator:** The separator remains in place - column 3 is copied.\n5.  **Mirror Bottom Right corner**: the input is read from bottom up, and copied to the output beginning 3 cells to the right of the seperator.\n6.  **Output Construction:** Combine the original left side (columns 0-2), copied seperator, the reversed columns (new columns 4-6) and bottom up mirror (8-10).\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes the left side of the input grid, reverses the order of the columns, and places those after column of 5s. Then copies the bottom row of the left side of input grid, and copies it to the rightmost section of the output, reading upwards.\n"
