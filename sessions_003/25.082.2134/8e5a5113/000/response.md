Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are rectangular grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   **Objects:** It appears contiguous blocks of the same color could constitute "objects." The most obvious objects are the horizontal lines of identical colors on the left and the vertical lines of `5` in the middle. The final four columns of zeros appear to act as padding/background.
*    The right side of input is always all zeros.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves some form of mirroring and/or replication of the left side of the input grid to construct the output. There's a specific pattern, and the central vertical line of 5's seems to act as a "mirror" or pivot point.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 11
      - height: 3
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - left_part: Contains colored horizontal lines.
      - middle_part: Contains a vertical line of 5s.
      - right_part: Contains only 0s (padding).

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 11
      - height: 3
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - structure: Appears to be a mirrored and potentially altered version of the input_grid's left_part.

  - object: vertical_separator
    type: line
    properties:
      - color: 5 (gray)
      - position: column 4 (index 3, zero indexed).
      - role: Acts as a dividing line or pivot for the transformation.

  - relationship: mirroring
    between: [input_grid.left_part, output_grid]
    description: The output grid appears to be generated by mirroring/replicating the input grid's left part around the vertical separator.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Separator:** Locate the vertical line of 5s in the input grid. This is our pivot point (column 4).
2.  **Mirror Left Side:** Take the section of the input grid to the *left* of the separator (columns 0-2).
3.  **Reverse Columns:** Reverse the order of these columns. So, column 2 becomes the new column 4, column 1 becomes the new column 5, and column 0 becomes new column 6.
4.    **Copy Separator:** The separator remains in place - column 3 is copied.
5.  **Mirror Bottom Right corner**: the input is read from bottom up, and copied to the output beginning 3 cells to the right of the seperator.
6.  **Output Construction:** Combine the original left side (columns 0-2), copied seperator, the reversed columns (new columns 4-6) and bottom up mirror (8-10).

In essence, the transformation takes the left side of the input grid, reverses the order of the columns, and places those after column of 5s. Then copies the bottom row of the left side of input grid, and copies it to the rightmost section of the output, reading upwards.
