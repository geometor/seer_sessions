            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single example and failed to generalize to the other training examples. The core issue is that the transformation is more complex, particularly in how the right side of the output grid is constructed. It's not simply a reversed copy of the left side, nor is it a simple bottom-up copy of the left side. Instead a mirroring effect is happening on the right side of the output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Use code execution to compute differences between the predicted and expected outputs for each example. This will pinpoint exactly *where* the errors occur and potentially reveal patterns in the discrepancies.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Focus on the \"objects\" present. Here, the left side section (before the first '5' separator), and the sections to the right of this separator are the most important.\n3.  **Refined Transformation Description:** Based on the detailed analysis, modify the natural language program to accurately reflect:\n    *   How the left side is copied.\n    *   How separator columns are treated.\n    *   How the section to the right of the separator is generated.\n    *   How final section is created.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** We might need to go through a few cycles of code modification, testing, and natural language program updating.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Facts:**\n\nLet's generate detailed reports using code execution.\n\n"
