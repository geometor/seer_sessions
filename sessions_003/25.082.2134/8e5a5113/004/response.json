            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information and a plan to address the discrepancies:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code capture the basic idea of dividing the input grid based on columns of 5s and mirroring sections. However, the mirroring and placement of the mirrored sections in the middle are not entirely accurate, leading to pixel mismatches in all three examples. The right-most section placement logic seems mostly correct (based on the provided outputs, though a thorough validation will be necessary). A key issue is the middle section calculation and copying. It should be calculated based on distance from the first separator, not just simple mirroring.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Middle Section Logic:** The core problem is how the middle section is determined and placed. Instead of just mirroring the left section and placing it immediately after the first separator, we need to consider some transformation of left side and place at distance that is same from the next seperator.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Mirroring:** Ensure that the mirroring (180-degree rotation) is applied correctly *conceptually*. The code uses `np.rot90(grid, 2)`, which is correct, but the conceptual application needs review in context of other code changes.\n3.  **Dynamic Section Sizing:** Verify that the code correctly handles sections of different sizes, not just the sizes in the first example. The `get_left_section` and `get_separator_columns` functions appear correct for this, but their interaction with the placement logic needs to be double-checked.\n4. **Second Separator:** ensure it exists and copied when it should.\n5.  **Iterative Testing:** After each code modification, test against *all* training examples to ensure improvements in one area don't introduce regressions in others.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's gather precise metrics about each example and its results. This will help pinpoint where the code's logic deviates from the expected behavior.\n\n"
