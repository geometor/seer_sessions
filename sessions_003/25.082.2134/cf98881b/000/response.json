The output grids are consistently smaller than the input grids, specifically 4x4. A key observation is the presence of the digit '2' in all input grids, which seems to act as a separator or delimiter. The digits to the left of '2' and a few to the right appears to be the important parts of the transformation, though the exact logic isn't immediately clear. It appears that the color '4' (yellow) is prominent in the examples. It also seems the digit '9' to the right of '2' is kept in some scenarios.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
