            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to improve the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a flawed assumption: that a simple pattern in the first row of the input could reliably identify the location of the 4x4 output subgrid. The testing results clearly demonstrate this is incorrect. The code fails to extract the correct 4x4 subgrid in all five examples, consistently returning a 4x4 grid of zeros.  The core issue is that the logic for identifying the subgrid's location is insufficient. It tries to find a fixed pattern (derived incorrectly even from the examples) or use predefined expected output grids. The approach needs to dynamically identify features of the output grids *within* the input grids. The current approach of providing the function expected output grids is backwards, this is not how ARC tasks work.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Abandon the hardcoded expected outputs:** The current strategy of pre-defining expected output grids and searching for them is not generalizable. We must derive the rule from how the inputs are transformed and not by guessing the expected output.\n2.  **Focus on Subgrid Identification:** The key is to correctly locate the 4x4 subgrid within the input grid *without prior knowledge of its content*.  We must develop a robust rule.\n3.  **Re-examine Examples for Common Features:**  We need to go back to the *original* input/output pairs (not the incorrect transformed outputs) and look for consistent relationships *between* each input and its corresponding output. What properties distinguish the 4x4 output region from the rest of the input grid?\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:**  The natural language program and the corresponding code will likely need several iterations.  After each iteration, test against *all* examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use `tool_code` to calculate some useful metrics. This won't directly solve the core problem (which is conceptual), but it helps in documenting the current state.\n\n"
