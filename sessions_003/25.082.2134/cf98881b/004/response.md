Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were overly simplistic and focused too narrowly on the first example. It correctly identified that the output grid is 4x4 and takes the first four rows from input. However, The initial hypothesis about using columns starting after first '2' or the last 4 columns from first four rows is incorrect, as demonstrated by the mismatches in all test cases. The core issue is that the column selection logic is wrong, all the examples provided were failing.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided input-output pairs, not just the first one. Look for common patterns and relationships that hold true across *all* examples.
2.  **Focus on Output:** Instead of trying to find a rule based only on the first '2', shift focus to how the output grid is constructed. What parts of the input consistently appear in the output, and in what arrangement?
3.  **Forget First '2':** Discard the initial idea related to the first '2'. It's clearly a misleading pattern.
4. **Consider last columns**: Consider if the last columns of the input have an effect on the output columns.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

I'll use Python to calculate the average difference between the expected output pixels and the actual output pixels to further confirm the observed behavior. Also check input shapes.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      shape: 4x4
      source: input_grid
      row_selection: first_four_rows
      column_relation: "Input grid contains the values of the output grid inside a 4x4 subgrid, but its location inside is not obvious."

  - object: input_grid
    properties:
       shape: varies
       contains: output grid values
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Output Grid Size:** The output grid is always 4x4.
2.  **Row Selection:** The output grid always consists of the first 4 rows of the input grid.
3. **Values Extraction**: The values from the output grid are present inside the input grid as 4x4 subgrid.
4. **Subgrid location**: The main challenge is figuring out the correct (x,y) location of the 4x4 area inside input grid.
