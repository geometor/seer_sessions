Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming input grids of digits (representing colors) into smaller output grids. The primary elements are:

*   **Rows of Uniform Color:**  The input grids seem to contain horizontal rows where all pixels within that row share the same color.  Crucially, rows of all black (0) seem to be ignored or serve as separators.
*   **Color Selection:** The output grid appears to be constructed by selecting specific, non-black colored rows from the input.
*   **Order Preservation:** The order of the selected rows in the output seems to match their order of appearance (from top to bottom) in the input.
*   **Ignoring partial rows:** Rows with mixed color values are ignored.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: |
  Extracts specific rows of uniform color from the input grid and stacks them to create the output grid.
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: list of rows
      - columns: list of columns
      - cells: individual pixels with color values (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: list of rows
      - size: smaller than input_grid
  - name: color_row
    type: row object
    properties:
      - color: single integer value
      - uniform: boolean (true if all cells in the row have the same color)
actions:
  - name: identify_uniform_rows
    input: input_grid
    output: list of color_row objects
    description: Scans the input grid row by row, identifying rows with uniform color.
  - name: filter_black_rows
    input: list of color_row objects
    output: filtered list of color_row objects
    description: Removes rows where the color is black (0).
  - name: stack_rows
    input: filtered list of color_row objects
    output: output_grid
    description: Vertically stacks the selected rows to form the output grid, preserving original order.
relationships:
  - input_grid contains multiple color_rows
  - output_grid is composed of selected color_rows from input_grid
  - color_rows are ordered (top to bottom)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  For each row, **check** if all pixels in the row have the same color (i.e., the row is uniform).
3.  **If** a row is uniform, **and** its color is not black (0), **add** that row to a list of "selected rows".
4. **After** processing all the rows in the input, **stack** the collected "selected rows" vertically, maintaining their original order, to create the output grid.
5.  **Return** this stacked set of rows as the output grid.

In essence, the program identifies and extracts all the solid-colored, non-black, horizontal lines from the input grid and presents them in the output grid, preserving the order in which they appeared.
