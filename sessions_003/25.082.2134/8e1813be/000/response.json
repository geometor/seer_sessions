The primary elements are:\n\n*   **Rows of Uniform Color:**  The input grids seem to contain horizontal rows where all pixels within that row share the same color.  Crucially, rows of all black (0) seem to be ignored or serve as separators.\n*   **Color Selection:** The output grid appears to be constructed by selecting specific, non-black colored rows from the input.\n*   **Order Preservation:** The order of the selected rows in the output seems to match their order of appearance (from top to bottom) in the input.\n*   **Ignoring partial rows:** Rows with mixed color values are ignored.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
