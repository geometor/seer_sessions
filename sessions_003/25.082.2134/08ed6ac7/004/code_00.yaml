objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents a grid of pixels with integer values.
  - name: pixel
    type: integer
    description: Represents the color of a cell in the grid.
  - name: contiguous_block
    type: list of (row, col) tuples
    description: Represents a group of adjacent pixels with the same color.
  - name: replacement_sequence
    type: integer
    description:  A counter used to assign unique values to pixels in contiguous blocks.

actions:
  - name: identify_contiguous_blocks
    input: grid, pixel_value
    output: list of contiguous_block
    description: Finds all contiguous blocks of a given pixel value in the grid.
  - name: sort_blocks
    input: list of contiguous_block
    output: sorted list of contiguous_block
    description: Sorts the blocks based on their top-left coordinates (smallest row first, then smallest column).
  - name: replace_pixels
    input: grid, list of contiguous_block, replacement_sequence
    output: modified grid
    description: Iterates through each block and replaces the original pixel value with values from the replacement sequence.
