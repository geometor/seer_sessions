```python
"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on the following rules:

1.  Locate the Divider: Find the horizontal line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Focus on the Upper Section: The output grid will be derived solely from the upper section (above the blue line).
3.  Column-wise Transformation: Iterate through each column of the upper section.
    *   If a pixel is not black (0), copy its value to the output.
    *   If a pixel is black (0):
        *   Look *below* the blue line in the *same* column in the lower section.
        *   Find the first non-zero pixel.
        *   Copy the value/color of this non-zero pixel to the corresponding position in the output grid.
4. Output Dimensions: The output is the shape of the upper section
