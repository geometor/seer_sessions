            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\nThe task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output).  A consistent feature across all examples is a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels dividing the input grid. The output grid seems to be derived from the section *above* this blue line. The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple cropping, as the colors and their arrangements change. There appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between the columns of the upper section and the columns of the output and the number of rows is consistent. It also appears as though the output grid \"reads\" down each column, replacing a 0 with the color of the pixel above the blue line directly in line with the 0.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts**\n\n"
