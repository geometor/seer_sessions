facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: All input grids contain a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels.
  - observation: Output grids appear to be derived from the section of the input grid *above* the blue line.
  - observation: The transformation is not a direct crop; colors change.
  - observation: Columns in the output grid correspond to columns in the input's upper section.
  - observation: Number of rows are the same.
  - observation: output grid is derived by "reading" down each column in upper section of input
  - rule: "0" pixels in the upper section of the input are replaced based on the color below the blue line.
  - rule: If a non-zero pixel is encountered, the pixel in that position in the output will be that non-zero value.
  - rule: If a '0' pixel is encountered, read down input column until non-zero pixel below blue line is encountered, and put the value in this position in the output.
