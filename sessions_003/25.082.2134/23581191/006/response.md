Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised strategy.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code failed to correctly transform the input grids for both examples. The primary issues seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Horizontal Expansion:** The expansion of the azure ('8') and orange ('7') pixels is not replicating the intended pattern. It seems to only expand '8' to the left, and the expansion amount appears to be off. The expansion doesn't account for the original position of '7'.
2.  **Misplaced Diagonal:** The red ('2') diagonal is not positioned correctly relative to the expanded azure and orange sections. The rule for stopping the diagonal also seems inaccurate.
3. **Incorrect replication:** The row replication is not done correctly. The rule replicates the whole row instead of the part between 8 and 7.

The strategy will be to:
1. Address example 1 to identify fundamental flaws in the approach
2. Address each identified issue, focusing on getting the horizontal expansion and diagonal placement correct.
3. Use example 2 to verify.

**Gather Metrics and Verify Assumptions (using `tool_code`):**

Since the provided examples already gives a `pixels_off` count I won't compute that here. Let's check the row and column counts and sizes of important objects.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Key Pixels:** Find the single azure ('8') pixel and the single orange ('7') pixel in the input grid. Note their row and column indices.
2.  **Calculate:**
    *   `rows_above`: The number of rows above the azure pixel.
    *   `rows_below`: The number of rows below the azure pixel.
    *    `separation`: The horizontal distance (number of columns) between the azure and orange pixels (column index of orange - column index of azure).
3.  **Create Base Row:** Extract the section of the row that goes from the azure pixel to the orange pixel (inclusive).
4.  **Vertical Expansion:**
    - Duplicate the base row `rows_above` times *above* the original azure pixel's row.
    - Duplicate the base row `rows_below` times *below* the original azure pixel's row, *including* duplicating the original row containing the azure and orange.
5. **Extend Regions:**
    - Find the position of 8 in the original row. Extend all 8s to the left edge of the grid.
    - Find the position of 7 in the original row. Extend all 7s to the right edge of the grid.
6.  **Insert Red Diagonal:**
    *   Starting Point:  The red diagonal starts in the row immediately below the last row of the upper duplicated section (at row index `rows_above`) and at column equal to the original column index of the '7'.
    *   Traversal: Move one row down and one column to the left with each step, placing a red ('2') pixel.
    *   Stopping Condition: Stop adding red pixels when you reach the row which contains the original base row.
