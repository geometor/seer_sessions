Both grids consist of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The grids appear to have the same dimensions. The most prominent feature is the presence of two distinct non-zero digits in the input grids, '8' (azure) and '7' (orange), which are positioned along a single row, separated, with '8' always on the left side. the output grid appears to be an altered arrangement of the input, expanding the individual pixels to encompass more of the grid. There is a new color element, '2' (red).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The number of rows duplicated above should match original number of rows above the '8' and '7' row and vis versa for down.\n3. **Horizontal Expansion**: Duplicate the '8' to the left and '7' to the right. The number of columns extended needs to match the number of columns that originally separated the '7' and '8'.\n4. **Create New Row:** Construct a new row to insert and to separate the expanded 7 and 8 regions.\n5. **Color Change:** the new row will have red '2' color.\n6. **Locate Insertion Point:** count how many rows until the original 7 and 8. This will tell you which column the '2' starts in. The '2' will continue on a diagonal.\n\n"
