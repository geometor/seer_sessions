            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was on the right track, focusing on alternating yellow pixels to magenta. However, it incorrectly applied the transformation to *all* even-indexed yellow pixels, regardless of their position relative to other colors in the row. The core issue is that the transformation should *selectively* change even-indexed yellow pixels to magenta, but *only when the yellow appears next to other non-yellow*.\n\nHere's the key observation: The transformation consistently fails on the third row of nearly every example, which is either a copy of the first row or a mirrored first row. All of the failed rows start with the same two values as the first row. The first row is transformed properly, so it is likely that there is a subtle, and likely simple condition that must be added.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input/output/transformed output meticulously to pinpoint exactly where the discrepancies occur.\n2.  **Conditional Logic Refinement:** Modify the conditions. The current logic checks if a row is \"all yellow\" which isn't the core concept. The rule seems to apply to yellow cells that are *not* part of an uninterrupted block of only yellow cells, where \"block\" includes partial blocks at the edges, where an uninterrupted block is at least two cells..\n3.  **Precise Language:** Use clear, unambiguous language in the updated natural language program.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"
