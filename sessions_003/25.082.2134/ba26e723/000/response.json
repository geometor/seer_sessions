            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers, representing colors. The primary colors present are yellow (4) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of yellow (4) pixels with magenta (6) pixels. The replacement isn't uniform; it appears to be conditional, based on the position or surroundings of the yellow pixels. The white(0) pixels are not modified.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

            "text": "```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n  - observation: |\n      The grids contain only yellow (4), white(0), and magenta(6) pixels.\n  - observation: |\n       Only a subset of yellow pixels change to magenta between input and output.\n  - observation: |\n      White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n  - relationship: |\n      The position of yellow (4) to change may depend on a local pattern.\n  - pattern: |\n      There are horizontal lines of only yellow(4) pixels and there are horizontal lines that alternate between yellow(4) and white(0).\n```"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.\n2.  **Identify** pixels which are yellow (value 4).\n3.  **Check** to see if the yellow pixel is in a row that alternates between yellow and white:\n    *   If the yellow pixel is on a row that alternates between yellow and white, **AND** is the first yellow pixel or the yellow pixel before a white pixel, change it to magenta (6).\n    * If the yellow pixels is on a solid horizontal row of yellow pixels **AND** is the pixel before a white space to the right or if it is the first pixel, change it to magenta(6).\n4.  **Keep** all other pixels (including other yellow (4) pixels, and all white (0) pixels) the same as in the input.\n5.  Output is the resulting grid.\n\nIn summary, the core rule appears to be that only a subset of yellow(4) pixels becomes magenta(6). The condition is if a yellow pixel in an alternating line has a white pixel to the left, or it's the first yellow in the series, it changes to magenta. And on a solid row of yellow, the first and the yellow(4) that appear immediately before a white space(0) to the right in the input grid get converted.\n"
