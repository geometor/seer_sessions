"""
Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
Identify yellow (4) pixels.
Check the neighboring cells:
    If a yellow pixel in an alternating line has a white pixel to the left, or it's the first yellow in the series, it changes to magenta (6).
    If a yellow pixel is in a solid row of yellows, and is at the first position, or is immediately to the left of a white pixel, it changes to magenta(6).
Keep all other pixels (white (0) pixels, and other yellow (4) pixels the same.
Output the resulting grid.
