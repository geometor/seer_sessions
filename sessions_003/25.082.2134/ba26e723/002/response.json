The primary issue is the handling of yellow (4) pixels that should change to magenta (6). The logic for alternating lines and solid rows needs refinement. The current implementation seems to over-apply the transformation to magenta in the alternating rows, changing all the yellow when it should only change the correct one. It does not detect the solid rows correctly at all.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Analyze Misclassified Pixels:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Identify the specific yellow pixels that were incorrectly changed or not changed.\n2. **Refine Conditions:** Adjust the conditions in the natural language program (and subsequently the code) to correctly identify when a yellow pixel should become magenta.\n3. **Solid Row Logic:** The logic is too simplistic. The description should be changed and the implementation should detect solid yellow by scanning left and right, not the entire row.\n4. **Alternating Row/Column Logic:** Revisit the alternating pattern detection, ensure that it only affects yellow pixels adjacent to white ones, and check the index of the yellow pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and reasoning - code execution is not necessary for this high-level analysis):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Top row: Changes every yellow to magenta, should only be the first and those before a white.\n    *   Middle row: Correct solid row detection but missing end change.\n    *   Bottom row: All incorrect, similar to top row.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Top row: All incorrect similar to example 1.\n    *   Middle row: Correct solid row detection but missing end change.\n    *   Bottom Row: All incorrect.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Top row: Changes every yellow to magenta, should only be the first and those before a white.\n    *   Middle row: Correct solid row detection but missing end change.\n    *   Bottom Row: All incorrect\n*    **Example 4:**\n    *   Top row: Changes every yellow to magenta, should only be the first and those before a white.\n    *   Middle row: Correct solid row detection but missing end change.\n    *   Bottom row: All incorrect, changes every yellow\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Top row: All incorrect similar to example 4.\n    *   Middle row: Correct solid row detection but missing end change.\n    *   Bottom row: All incorrect similar to other examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"
