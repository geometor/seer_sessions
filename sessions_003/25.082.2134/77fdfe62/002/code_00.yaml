observations:
  - object: blue_line
    description: Horizontal line(s) of blue pixels (value 1).
    properties:
      - color: blue
      - orientation: horizontal
      - role: separator
  - object: corner_pixels
    description: Pixels at the corners of the regions defined by the blue lines.
    properties:
      - location: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
      - relative_position: Determined by the blue line(s).
  - object: output_grid
    description: The resulting grid after transformation.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Variable, influenced by number of blue lines
      - structure: two rows per section separated by blue line

actions:
  - action: identify_blue_lines
    description: Locate all horizontal blue lines in the input grid.
  - action: extract_corner_pixels
    description: Get the corner pixels of regions above and below/between each blue line.
  - action: construct_output
    description: Build the output grid by arranging extracted corner pixels into pairs for the top and bottom of the output.
