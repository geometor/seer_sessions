facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0-9]
      - has_blue_line: true # Observation: All inputs have a horizontal blue line.
      - height: variable
      - width: variable

  - object: blue_line
    type: horizontal line
    properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - role: separator # Divides the input grid into two regions.

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0-9]
      - height: smaller than input_grid
      - width: smaller than input_grid
      - structure: compact, specific arrangement

  - action: select_pixels
    description: Pixels of certain colors, excluding blue (1), are selected from the input grid.
    criteria:
        - position: Not on the blue line.
        - color: appears selection is influenced by position and perhaps repetition

  - action: arrange_pixels
    description: Selected pixels are arranged into a new, smaller output grid.
    rule: Adjacent pairs in output grid. Top row seems to come from the section of the input *above* the blue line, and the bottom rows comes from the section of the input grid *below* the blue line.

  - relation: input_output
    type: transformation
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid by selecting and arranging specific pixels.
