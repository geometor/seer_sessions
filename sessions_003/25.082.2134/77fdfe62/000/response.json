            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** The input grids appear to be larger and contain a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels.  Above and below this line are other colored pixels, potentially acting as some form of data. The key seems to be the pixels *not* on the blue dividing line.\n*  **Output Grids:** Output Grids are much smaller. It captures some, but not all, of the colors from the non-blue-line pixels of the input. It has a very specific, compact structure.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation rule *selects* certain colors from the areas *above* and *below* the blue line, discards the line itself, and arranges those colors in a new, condensed output grid. The selected cells of the original seem to become adjacent in the result.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Separator:** Find the horizontal line of blue (1) pixels within the input grid. This line divides the input into an \"above\" region and a \"below\" region.\n\n2.  **Select Pixels Above:** In the \"above\" region (excluding the blue line itself), select the colors of the pixels that are in the top-left and top-right corners, ignoring pixels with color of '0'. If the region is empty or only has '0' skip this. If the input has width N, select the corners at positions [0,0] and [0, N-1].\n\n3. **Condense Above**: Put the top-left-selected color next to the to-right-selected color in the output, then put the top-left-selected color below and to the left, and finally the top-right-selected color below and to the right. If step 2. was skipped, make a row of two '0' and put another row of two '0's below.\n\n4.  **Select Pixels Below:** In the \"below\" region (excluding the blue line), select the colors of the bottom-left and bottom-right pixels. If the region is empty or only has '0' skip this. If the input has width N, select the corners at positions [M-1, 0] and [M-1, N-1], where the input matrix is of dimensions M x N.\n\n5.  **Condense Below**: Put the bottom-left-selected color next to the bottom-right-selected color in the output, then put the bottom-left-selected color below and to the left, and finally the bottom-right-selected color below and to the right. If step 4. was skipped, make a row of two '0' and put another row of two '0's below.\n\n6. **Stack**: vertically concatenate rows obtained in steps 3. and 5. to form the output matrix.\n"
