Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids appear to be larger and contain a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels.  Above and below this line are other colored pixels, potentially acting as some form of data. The key seems to be the pixels *not* on the blue dividing line.
*  **Output Grids:** Output Grids are much smaller. It captures some, but not all, of the colors from the non-blue-line pixels of the input. It has a very specific, compact structure.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation rule *selects* certain colors from the areas *above* and *below* the blue line, discards the line itself, and arranges those colors in a new, condensed output grid. The selected cells of the original seem to become adjacent in the result.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0-9]
      - has_blue_line: true # Observation: All inputs have a horizontal blue line.
      - height: variable
      - width: variable

  - object: blue_line
    type: horizontal line
    properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - role: separator # Divides the input grid into two regions.

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0-9]
      - height: smaller than input_grid
      - width: smaller than input_grid
      - structure: compact, specific arrangement

  - action: select_pixels
    description: Pixels of certain colors, excluding blue (1), are selected from the input grid.
    criteria:
        - position: Not on the blue line.
        - color: appears selection is influenced by position and perhaps repetition

  - action: arrange_pixels
    description: Selected pixels are arranged into a new, smaller output grid.
    rule: Adjacent pairs in output grid. Top row seems to come from the section of the input *above* the blue line, and the bottom rows comes from the section of the input grid *below* the blue line.

  - relation: input_output
    type: transformation
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid by selecting and arranging specific pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Separator:** Find the horizontal line of blue (1) pixels within the input grid. This line divides the input into an "above" region and a "below" region.

2.  **Select Pixels Above:** In the "above" region (excluding the blue line itself), select the colors of the pixels that are in the top-left and top-right corners, ignoring pixels with color of '0'. If the region is empty or only has '0' skip this. If the input has width N, select the corners at positions [0,0] and [0, N-1].

3. **Condense Above**: Put the top-left-selected color next to the to-right-selected color in the output, then put the top-left-selected color below and to the left, and finally the top-right-selected color below and to the right. If step 2. was skipped, make a row of two '0' and put another row of two '0's below.

4.  **Select Pixels Below:** In the "below" region (excluding the blue line), select the colors of the bottom-left and bottom-right pixels. If the region is empty or only has '0' skip this. If the input has width N, select the corners at positions [M-1, 0] and [M-1, N-1], where the input matrix is of dimensions M x N.

5.  **Condense Below**: Put the bottom-left-selected color next to the bottom-right-selected color in the output, then put the bottom-left-selected color below and to the left, and finally the bottom-right-selected color below and to the right. If step 4. was skipped, make a row of two '0' and put another row of two '0's below.

6. **Stack**: vertically concatenate rows obtained in steps 3. and 5. to form the output matrix.
