The '2's seem to form a regularly spaced grid structure themselves. The spacing of red is every other pixel.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves the introduction of '4' (yellow) in specific locations relative to the '2' (red) pixels.\n*    Yellow is on the right and bottom of red.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
