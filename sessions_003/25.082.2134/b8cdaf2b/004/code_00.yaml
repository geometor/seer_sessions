      - description: Bottom-most horizontal contiguous objects.
        properties:
          - Contiguous: Pixels of the same color are adjacent horizontally.
          - Horizontal: All pixels in the object are on the same row.
          - Bottom-most: The object resides on the last row of the grid.
  - transformations:
      - description: Mirroring and propagation.
        steps:
          - Find bottom-most object.
          - Select highest (minimum row index) object.
          - Mirror row above bottom object based on selected object.
          - Propagate pattern upwards
        details:
          mirroring:
            axis: Vertical center of the selected bottom-most object.
            scope: Only the colors in the row directly above the bottom-most object are mirrored.
          propagation:
            method: The single mirrored row replaces all rows above it.
            direction: Upwards, from the mirrored row to the top of the grid (row 0).
