Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the bottom-most horizontal object and attempts to mirror the row above it. However, it makes a crucial mistake: it copies the *entire* mirrored row upwards, instead of only mirroring the colors directly above the selected object and *then* propagating the mirrored pattern. The mirroring logic itself seems generally correct (calculating the reflection point), but the propagation is flawed. All examples failed to match, with the pixel differences increasing with grid size, indicating an issue with repeated row copying.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Mirroring:** Ensure the mirroring operation *only* affects the row directly above the bottom object, and only for the pixels that are reflections of the object's width.
2.  **Correct Propagation:** After mirroring the single row, propagate this *mirrored* row upwards, replacing all rows above, until row 0.
3.  **Object Selection (Edge Cases):** Although it was stated there is no need to select the leftmost in case of ties, the test set can reveal otherwise. It's fine to add this now, to make the code robust.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution - not necessary, analysis by inspection is sufficient):**

Since the images and results are given, I'll summarize here, rather than writing code to reproduce what is visually provided.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 3x3
    *   Pixels Off: 3
    *   Mirrored Row Index (from bottom): 1
    *   Bottom Object: `[(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]` (color 2, 4, 2)
    *   Mirrored Colors: 0, 2, 0. Expected: 4,0,4
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 5x5
    *   Pixels Off: 7
    *   Mirrored Row Index: 1
    *   Bottom Object: `[(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]` (color 8, 8, 3, 8, 8)
    *   Mirrored colors: 0,0,8,0,0 Expected: 0,3,0,3,0
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 5x5
    *   Pixels Off: 11
    *   Mirrored Row Index: 1
    *   Bottom Object: `[(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]` (color 6, 1, 1, 1, 6)
    *   Mirrored colors: 0,6,6,6,0. Expected: 1,0,0,0,1
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Size: 7x7
    *   Pixels off: 19
    *   Mirrored Row Index: 1
    *   Bottom object: `[(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)]` (color 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2)
    *   Mirrored Colors: 0,0,2,2,2,0,0 Expected: 4,0,0,0,0,0,4

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: b8cdaf2b
  - objects_identified:
      - description: Bottom-most horizontal contiguous objects.
        properties:
          - Contiguous: Pixels of the same color are adjacent horizontally.
          - Horizontal: All pixels in the object are on the same row.
          - Bottom-most: The object resides on the last row of the grid.
  - transformations:
      - description: Mirroring and propagation.
        steps:
          - Find bottom-most object.
          - Select highest (minimum row index) object.
          - Mirror row above bottom object based on selected object.
          - Propagate pattern upwards
        details:
          mirroring:
            axis: Vertical center of the selected bottom-most object.
            scope: Only the colors in the row directly above the bottom-most object are mirrored.
          propagation:
            method: The single mirrored row replaces all rows above it.
            direction: Upwards, from the mirrored row to the top of the grid (row 0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Bottom Objects:** Find all contiguous horizontal objects along the bottom row of the input grid.
2.  **Select Topmost Object:** Among the objects found, select the one that appears highest in the grid (lowest row index). If multiple objects share the same row, select the one that start most to the left.
3.  **Mirror:** Calculate the vertical center (column index) of the selected object. Mirror the colors of the row *immediately* above the selected object across this vertical center.  This means if a pixel is *x* units to the right of the center, its color will be copied to the pixel *x* units to the left of the center, and vice-versa. Only the pixels directly above this bottom object participate in the mirror.
4.  **Propagate Upwards:** Copy the now-mirrored row, replacing all rows above it, working upwards until the top of the grid (row 0) is reached.
