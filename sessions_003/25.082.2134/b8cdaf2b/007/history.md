1.  **Identify Bottom Objects:** Find all contiguous horizontal objects along the bottom row of the input grid.
2.  **Select Topmost Object:** Among the objects found, select the one that appears highest in the grid (lowest row index). If multiple objects share the same row, select the one that start most to the left.
3.  **Mirror:** Calculate the vertical center (column index) of the selected object. Mirror the colors of the row *immediately* above the selected object across this vertical center.  This means if a pixel is *x* units to the right of the center, its color will be copied to the pixel *x* units to the left of the center, and vice-versa. Only the pixels directly above this bottom object participate in the mirror.
4.  **Propagate Upwards:** Copy the now-mirrored row, replacing all rows above it, working upwards until the top of the grid (row 0) is reached.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code have significant flaws. While the code attempts to identify bottom objects and mirror the row above, it doesn't correctly perform the mirroring operation or propagate the mirrored row upwards as intended. The core issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Mirroring:** The mirroring logic seems to only copy the same row and does not actually flip it around center.
2.  **Incorrect Propagation:** The propagation simply copies the mirrored row (which itself is not correctly mirrored) to all rows above, rather than performing a selective propagation.
3. **Incorrect Topmost Object Selection:** The `select_topmost_object` is finding multiple object, selecting based on criteria that are not fully aligned with the problem description.

The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:
1.  **Fixing the Mirroring:** Modify `transform` and get it right
2.  **Fixing the Propogation:** Modify `transform` function to select pixels to move up
3.  **Re-evaluating Examples:** Carefully review all examples to ensure the revised natural language program and code accurately capture the transformation rule. Specifically, pay close attention to edge cases and variations in input grid configurations.

**Gathering Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**

I don't need tool use here, since results are provided in the prompt.

**Example Analysis**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3
    *   Expected: Mirroring of row above "2 4 2" around the center (index 1).
    *   Actual: The row above is not copied.
    *   *Observation:* The error is in mirroring, not propagation.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5
    *   Expected: Mirroring of row above "8 8 3 8 8" and propagation of the two rows above the bottom.
    *   Actual: Only copied "0 0 8 0 0".
    *   *Observation:* Both mirroring and propagation are incorrect.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 5x5
    *   Expected: The '1's on the row above the bottom get mirrored across the vertical axis of the shape '6 1 1 1 6'.
    *   Actual: The '6's are propogated, incorrectly.
    *   *Observation:* Both mirroring and propagation are incorrect.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 7x7
    *   Expected: Mirror the row '0 0 2 2 2 0 0' and correctly mirror/propagate two rows above.
    *   Actual: Does not propagate correctly.
    *  *Observation:* Both mirroring and propagation are incorrect.

**YAML Fact Representation**

```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: b8cdaf2b
  - observations: |
      Each example involves identifying a horizontal object at the bottom of the grid.
      The row immediately above the bottom object is mirrored based on the vertical center of the bottom object.
      The mirrored section from the row above is then propagated upwards, replacing the content of rows above it.
      The mirroring and propagation are specific to the extent of the bottom object, not the entire grid width.
  - object_properties:
      - object_type: horizontal_line
        attributes:
          - bottom_row: Located on the last row of the grid.
          - contiguous: Pixels of the same color are adjacent horizontally.
          - center:  The horizontal center of the object, calculated as (min_col + max_col) / 2.
  - actions:
      - action_type: mirror
        description: The row immediately above the bottom object is mirrored around the object's vertical center.
        details: If a pixel is 'x' units to the right of the center, its color is copied to the pixel 'x' units to the left of the center, and vice-versa.
      - action_type: propagate
        description: The mirrored portion of the row is copied upwards to replace the rows above it.
        details: Only the mirrored segment, corresponding to the width of the bottom object, is propagated.
```


**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Bottom Object:** Find the contiguous horizontal line object along the bottom row of the input grid. If no such object is present, make no changes.
2.  **Determine the Mirroring Region:**
    *   Calculate the vertical center (column index) of the identified bottom object using the formula: `center = (min_col + max_col) / 2`, where `min_col` and `max_col` are the leftmost and rightmost column indices of the bottom object, respectively.
    *   Identify the row immediately above the bottom object. This is the source row for mirroring.
3.  **Mirror the Source Row Segment:**
    *   Within the source row, mirror the colors of the pixels across the calculated vertical center. The mirroring only affects the segment of the source row that lies directly above the bottom object.  Specifically, for each pixel in the source row segment, calculate its horizontal distance (`delta_c`) from the center. Copy the color of the pixel at `center + delta_c` to the pixel at `center - delta_c`, and vice versa, ensuring both positions are within the grid boundaries.
4.  **Propagate Upwards:**
    *  Identify a range of columns based on bottom object: `[min_col...max_col]`
    *  Copy the mirrored section of source row to higher rows.
    *  Working upwards from the source row to the top of the grid (row 0), replace only the pixels in range `[min_col...max_col]` with the corresponding pixels from the mirrored section of the source row.
