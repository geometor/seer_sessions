      Each example involves identifying a horizontal object at the bottom of the grid.
      The row immediately above the bottom object is mirrored based on the vertical center of the bottom object.
      The mirrored section from the row above is then propagated upwards, replacing the content of rows above it.
      The mirroring and propagation are specific to the extent of the bottom object, not the entire grid width.
  - object_properties:
      - object_type: horizontal_line
        attributes:
          - bottom_row: Located on the last row of the grid.
          - contiguous: Pixels of the same color are adjacent horizontally.
          - center:  The horizontal center of the object, calculated as (min_col + max_col) / 2.
  - actions:
      - action_type: mirror
        description: The row immediately above the bottom object is mirrored around the object's vertical center.
        details: If a pixel is 'x' units to the right of the center, its color is copied to the pixel 'x' units to the left of the center, and vice-versa.
      - action_type: propagate
        description: The mirrored portion of the row is copied upwards to replace the rows above it.
        details: Only the mirrored segment, corresponding to the width of the bottom object, is propagated.
