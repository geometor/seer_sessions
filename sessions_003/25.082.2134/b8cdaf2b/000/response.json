The core operation seems to be selectively mirroring, or \"flipping,\" a portion of the topmost, distinct, horizontal object at the bottom boundary of the grid. It focuses only on the *topmost* such object, disregarding the lower objects. The mirroring centers around a perceived vertical axis, but the mirrored part copies colors from above and below.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

We divide the object in half vertically, the we reflect a porting of the object around the center line replacing the values in the object with the value from the reflected position, but one unit above the selected object for positions left of center and below for positions right of center.\n"
