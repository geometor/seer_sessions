  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - description: Vertical bars of different colors (blue, red, green, gray).
          properties:
            - color: variable
            - shape: vertical bar
      output_objects:
        - description: Horizontal lines replicating the color of the leftmost non-zero pixel of that row.
          properties:
            - color: inherited from the left
            - shape: horizontal line segment

      transformations:
        - action: Color propagation
          condition: "If a pixel has a non-zero neighbor to the left, and if the pixel isn't the same color, change current pixel color"
          scope: "limited to contiguous blocks with different color, not propagating beyond pixels of the same color"
  - example_2:
    input_objects:
      - description: Left section of vertical lines, then some blank space, and then another set of vertical lines
        properties:
          - colors: green, gray, yellow
    output_objects:
      - description: Same colors, but colors have propagated horizontally to the next zero
        properties:
          - colors: green, gray, yellow
    transformations:
        - action: Color propagation
          condition: "If a pixel has a non-zero neighbor to the left, and if the pixel isn't the same color, change current pixel color"
          scope: "limited to contiguous blocks with different color, not propagating beyond pixels of the same color or zero"
