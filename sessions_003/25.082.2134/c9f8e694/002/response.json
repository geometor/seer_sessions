            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code are too simplistic. The code propagates the leftmost non-zero color across the entire row, effectively \"smearing\" the color. The expected outputs, however, show a more nuanced behavior. The color propagation seems to be limited to contiguous regions of a *different* color, stopping when it encounters a pixel of the *same* color or a zero. We need to incorporate this \"stopping condition\" into our revised program.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nI will use a simplified approach to get basic information, rather then using code.\n*Example 1*: The image starts with vertical bars that turn into multiple horizontal bars. Input is 12 by 12.\n*Example 2*: The image has two main sections, one on the left and one on the right. The left is composed by a rectangle that spans the image height. The right is similar, but with empty columns. The colors seem to be copied from left to right but only in the horizontal line.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
