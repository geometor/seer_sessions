Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code are too simplistic. The code propagates the leftmost non-zero color across the entire row, effectively "smearing" the color. The expected outputs, however, show a more nuanced behavior. The color propagation seems to be limited to contiguous regions of a *different* color, stopping when it encounters a pixel of the *same* color or a zero. We need to incorporate this "stopping condition" into our revised program.

**Gather Metrics**

I will use a simplified approach to get basic information, rather then using code.
*Example 1*: The image starts with vertical bars that turn into multiple horizontal bars. Input is 12 by 12.
*Example 2*: The image has two main sections, one on the left and one on the right. The left is composed by a rectangle that spans the image height. The right is similar, but with empty columns. The colors seem to be copied from left to right but only in the horizontal line.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: c9f8e694
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - description: Vertical bars of different colors (blue, red, green, gray).
          properties:
            - color: variable
            - shape: vertical bar
      output_objects:
        - description: Horizontal lines replicating the color of the leftmost non-zero pixel of that row.
          properties:
            - color: inherited from the left
            - shape: horizontal line segment

      transformations:
        - action: Color propagation
          condition: "If a pixel has a non-zero neighbor to the left, and if the pixel isn't the same color, change current pixel color"
          scope: "limited to contiguous blocks with different color, not propagating beyond pixels of the same color"
  - example_2:
    input_objects:
      - description: Left section of vertical lines, then some blank space, and then another set of vertical lines
        properties:
          - colors: green, gray, yellow
    output_objects:
      - description: Same colors, but colors have propagated horizontally to the next zero
        properties:
          - colors: green, gray, yellow
    transformations:
        - action: Color propagation
          condition: "If a pixel has a non-zero neighbor to the left, and if the pixel isn't the same color, change current pixel color"
          scope: "limited to contiguous blocks with different color, not propagating beyond pixels of the same color or zero"

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid, row by row, and column by column.
2.  For each pixel, check if there is a pixel immediately to its **left**.
3.  If a left neighbor exists, and the left neighbors color is not black (0):
    a. Check what is the current pixel's color
    b. If the left neighbor's color is different from the color of the current pixel, set the current pixel with the same color as the left neighbor.
    c. otherwise (if the colors are the same, or current pixel's color is black (0), do nothing)
4.  Return the modified grid.
