            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code's logic is too simplistic. It assumes that *any* non-zero pixel to the left should dictate the color of the current pixel, regardless of whether they are part of the same \"object\" or contiguous block. This is clearly not the intended behavior, as evidenced by the mismatches in both examples. The code propagates the leftmost non-zero color across the entire row, overwriting distinct colored regions.  The core issue is a lack of object/region awareness. The algorithm needs to consider connected components, not just immediate left neighbors.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Definition:**  We need a better definition of an \"object.\"  The current implementation treats any non-zero pixel as influential.  Instead, objects should be defined as contiguous regions of the same color.\n\n2.  **Conditional Propagation:** The color propagation should only happen within the bounds of what can be considered a single, originally contiguous, region, or *only* when there is a 0 valued pixel in between.\n\n3. **Analyze Example 2:** Pay close attention to the 2nd training example.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example 1):**\n\nThe first example originally had multiple vertical bars.  The result smeared these bars into a monochromatic set of rows.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example 2):**\nThe second example seems to indicate two distinct objects (color 3 and 4) and the object on the left overwrites any colors in the horizontal position of that object, when there is a zero separator.\n\n"
