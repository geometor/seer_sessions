Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program description of the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements of the Task**

The task involves transforming input grids to output grids. The primary transformation seems to involve replacing a specific color (object) with another color, maintaining the shape and position of the original object. The replacement color is dependent on the color to the immediate left.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_type: "contiguous blocks of pixels"
  - object_property: color (represented by integers 0-9)
  - object_property: position (row, column)
  - object_property: shape (defined by the arrangement of pixels)
  - action: "color replacement"
  - condition: relationship to the left, same row
  - relationship: "color of target object is replaced by the color of object to the left"
  - relationship_details: "if a pixel has a non-zero neighbor to its immediate left, change it to the neighbor"
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check:** Examine the pixel to the immediate left *on the same row*.
3. **Transform: If the pixel to the immediate left exists and is non zero:**
    *   Replace the color (pixel value) of the current pixel with the color (pixel value) of the pixel to the immediate left.
4. **Otherwise, If no condition apply:**
    * Leave the pixel unchanged.

Essentially any grey (5) object is being "colored in" by whatever non-zero color is to its left.
