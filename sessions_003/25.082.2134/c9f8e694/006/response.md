Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example and failed to generalize to the second example. The core issue is that the initial program only considers the *immediate* left neighbor for color propagation. It doesn't correctly handle cases where the color should propagate *across* multiple zero-separated regions of different colors. The second example demonstrates this, showing that color should "overwrite" other colors to its right, as long as those colors are separated by zeros. We need a natural language program that better models this behavior.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze the failures:** Carefully examine why the provided examples failed. I will use additional code execution to verify certain assumptions about colors, positions, and separations.
2.  **Identify the Correct Rule:** Based on *all* examples, formulate a more general rule about color propagation. It seems propagation stops only with adjacent colors of the same colors as the origin.
3.  **Revise the Natural Language Program:** Clearly articulate the updated rule, paying close attention to the conditions under which color propagation occurs and terminates.
4. **Test with a future coding agent:** Provide a clear YAML specification and natural language program so the future coding agent can generate the proper code.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when needed):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Original logic assumes propagation from left neighbor.
    *   Fails because the gray (5) is not replaced by the neighbor to the far left (1 and 2).
*    **Example 2:**
    *   Original logic will propagate the 3s correctly because no other colors are seen.
    *   The second row propagates color 3 across the 0 and replaces the 5s.
    *   Similar behavior is seen in several rows.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
      - pixels: Individual cells in the grid, each with a color value.

  - name: color_block
    description:  contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color
    properties:
        - color: color of the block

actions:
  - name: propagate_color
    description: >
      Extends a color block to the right, replacing other color blocks.
      Propagation stops if it meets another color block of the same color value
    parameters:
      - start_position: (row, col) of the leftmost pixel of the color block.
      - color: The color to propagate.
    preconditions:
      - The starting pixel must have a non-zero color.
    postconditions:
        - colors to the right are replaced with the propagating color, as long
          as they are not of same color

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate through each row of the grid.**
2.  **Within each row, identify "color blocks".** A color block is defined as a contiguous sequence of pixels with the same non-zero color, or a sequence of one or more zero-colored pixels.
3.  **For each non-zero color block:**
    *   Propagate the color of the block to the right, overwriting any subsequent zero or non-zero pixels.
    *   Stop propagation when encountering a pixel that has same color as the propagating color.

This revised program emphasizes the concept of "color blocks" and describes the propagation rule more accurately, encompassing the behavior observed in both examples. The propagation is not simply based on the immediate left neighbor but on entire blocks, and the stopping condition is clarified.
