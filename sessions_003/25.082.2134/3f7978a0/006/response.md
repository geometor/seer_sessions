Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which led to an oversimplified rule. The subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern. The core issue is that the code is not handling edge cases in the conditions for what constitutes a valid column and is not properly identifying the extent of rows to include. The code correctly identifies columns with alternating 8s and 5s, but there are problems with identifying all of the target columns. The row cropping and the column compression also appear to have problems with determining when to perform the compression.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Target Column Identification:** The `_is_target_column` function needs to consider all applicable rules for columns that contain the alternating 8s and 5s.
2.  **Correct Row Cropping:** The `_crop_rows` logic needs to consider edge cases in which rows may be empty after applying the filtering of columns.
3.  **Correct Column Compression:** The column compression must reliably determine all applicable columns to include and to exclude.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To gather more precise metrics, I'll use code execution to analyze each example.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Iterate through each column of the input grid. A column is considered a "target column" if it contains only the values 8 (azure), 5 (gray), and 0 (black), and the non-zero values within the column strictly alternate between 8 and 5. The alternation can start with either 8 or 5.
2.  **Select Target Columns:** Create a new grid containing only the target columns identified in the previous step. Maintain the original order of these columns.
3.  **Crop Rows:** Examine the new grid formed by the selected target columns. Find the indices of the first and last rows that contain any non-zero values. Remove all rows before the first non-zero row and all rows after the last non-zero row.
4.  **Compress Columns:** From the cropped grid, remove any columns that consist entirely of zeros. The resulting grid is the final output.
