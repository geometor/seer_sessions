There are also some instances of two adjacent azure (8) pixels.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are smaller, and contain a structured pattern with gray(5) and azure(8) pixels.\n*   **Transformation**: There appears to be some type of extraction that takes certain vertical stripes from the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The selected columns are kept to produce the output. The columns are compressed by removing all the columns that only contains black(0).\n"
