The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors involved appear to be 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 3 (green). The transformation seems to involve adding new rows of pixels above the existing red object, with the colors and number of new rows appearing related.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Note its length and vertical position (row index).\n2.  **Determine** the length of a green line. The first example red has width 2, and green has width 5. The second example, red has width 3, and green has width 6. The third example, red has width 4 and green has width 6. In all examples, the length of green is +3 from red.\n3.  **Create** new rows of green pixels at the top of the grid. The length of these green rows is determined by the previous step (+3 length of red object). Examples 1 and 2 create two green rows. In example 3, only two rows fit at the top of the input grid.\n4.  **Determine** how many blue rows and their length. All are 1.\n5.  **Create** new rows. Number of rows is original y-position of red object minus the final y-position of red object.\n6. The length of blue lines also seem to correlate with the y distance between red and blue, or correlated with the length of the red object.\n\n"
