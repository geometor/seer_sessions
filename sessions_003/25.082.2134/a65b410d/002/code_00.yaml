      1. Find the horizontal red line in the input and note its length and y-position.
      2. Create three green lines above the red line. The length of each green line is the length of the red line plus 3.
      3. Copy the red line at index 3
      4. copy all pixels below the original red line's y-position to the output, below the new red line.
