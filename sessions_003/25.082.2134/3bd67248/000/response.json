A single vertical line of a specific color (magenta (6) in train\\_1, gray(5) in train\\_2, and azure(8) in train\\_3) extends from the top to the bottom of the grid on the leftmost edge.\n*   **Output:** A transformed grid. The original colored line remains. A diagonal line of red (2) pixels emerges from the top-right corner, moving down and to the left. A horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels appears at the bottom, its length equal to the height of the grid minus one and start one column from the left. The intersection of red line and yellow line stops at the row before last.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Start at the top-right corner of the grid. Extend the line diagonally down and to the left, one pixel at a time. The total number of red pixels is equal to height of input grid - 1.\n3.  **Create Horizontal Line:** Create a horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels in the last row of the grid.
