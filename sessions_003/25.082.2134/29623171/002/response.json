            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a single example and, as expected, doesn't generalize perfectly to the other examples. The core idea of copying non-gray, non-white pixels from above a bottom-most gray line to below it, preserving column position, is partially correct. However, the provided transform function is not creating the correct pattern below the grey line. The examples demonstrate that the non-grey, non-white pixels form repeating solid blocks of color below the grey line, suggesting a more structured approach.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Observations:** Double-check the initial observation about copying non-gray/non-white pixels above the bottom gray line.\n2.  **Pattern Recognition:** Analyze how these copied pixels are arranged below the gray line in the correct outputs. The current implementation copies the original pixel colors in place but that isn't correct. The output has blocks of the same color.\n3.  **Refine Program:** Develop a natural language program, and modify the implementation accordingly, to accurately reflect the observed transformation, including the repeating patterns.\n\n**Gathering Metrics:**\n\nI'll use manual observation and note-taking first and then verify with `numpy`. I will summarize in the YAML block below.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input grid size: 11x11\n    *   Bottom-most gray line row: 3, 7\n    *   There is a grey vertical divider stripe at column index 3 and 7.\n    *   Colors to copy: 1 (blue) in last 3 columns\n    *   Output: The copied section consists of three blue '1' repeated in the last 3 columns.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input grid size: 11x11\n    *   Bottom-most gray line row: 3, 7\n    *   There is a grey vertical divider stripe at column index 3 and 7.\n    *   Colors to copy: 2 (red) in last 3 columns\n    *   Output: The copied section consists of three red '2' repeated in the last 3 columns.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input grid size: 11x11\n    *   Bottom-most gray line row: 3, 7\n    *   There is a grey vertical divider stripe at column index 3 and 7.\n    *   Colors to copy: 3 (green) in last 3 columns\n    *   Output: The copied section consists of three green '3' repeated in the last 3 columns.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

The columns to consider are those to the right of the rightmost grey stripe.\n4.  **Find the non-white, non-grey pixels within the identified region.** Note down each column with a color other than white and grey.\n5. **Determine the repeating block height:** Subtract the row of the top grey line plus 1, from the bottom grey line row.\n6.  **Copy and Repeat:** Create a repeating block of the colors found in the columns to the right of the grey stripe. The repeated section starts at the bottom grey line + 1. The number of repeats will depend on the height of the grid below the bottom grey line, so the block is repeated as many times as fit.\n\n"
