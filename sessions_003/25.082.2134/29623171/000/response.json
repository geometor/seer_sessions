The most prominent features are horizontal lines of '5' (gray) that seem to act as separators or boundaries.  There are also isolated instances of other colors (1/blue, 2/red, 3/green) appearing in specific locations relative to the gray lines.  The transformation appears to involve a duplication or mirroring of these non-gray colors *below* the bottom gray line, maintaining their column position. The gray lines themselves and large areas of '0' (white) seem to be unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These are the pixels to be copied. Specifically, look at the pixels in the columns to the right of the rightmost vertical line made of grey pixels.\n3.  **Copy and Position:** For each target pixel identified in step 2, copy its color value.\n4. **Placement** Place this copied color into the rows below the *bottom-most* gray separator line. Ensure the copied pixel occupies the *same column* as the original target pixel.\n5.  **Preserve:** The gray separator lines and all white (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n\nEssentially, the rule copies non-gray and non-white pixels found above the bottom-most gray line to the area below that gray line, preserving the column position.\n"
