Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids with single-digit integer values (0-9), representing different colors.  The most prominent features are horizontal lines of '5' (gray) that seem to act as separators or boundaries.  There are also isolated instances of other colors (1/blue, 2/red, 3/green) appearing in specific locations relative to the gray lines.  The transformation appears to involve a duplication or mirroring of these non-gray colors *below* the bottom gray line, maintaining their column position. The gray lines themselves and large areas of '0' (white) seem to be unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]  # white, blue, red, green, gray
      - dimensions: 11x11
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - color: 5  # gray
      - role: separator
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: [1, 2, 3] #blue, red, green
      - location:
          relation: "above or below gray separator lines, specific columns"
actions:
  - name: copy_pixels
    properties:
      - source: pixels of color 1, 2, or 3 located in the columns to the right of the last vertical gray stripe
      - destination:  rows below the bottom gray line, same column as source
      - condition: "source pixel is not 0 or 5"
  - name: preserve
    properties:
    - objects:
        - horizontal line of 5
        - 0
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Pixels of color 1, 2, or 3 maintain their column position when copied."
  - type: boundary
    description: "Gray lines act as separators; copying occurs below the last one."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Separators:** Locate all horizontal lines composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Locate Target Pixels:** Within the grid, identify all pixels that are *not* gray (5) or white (0). These are the pixels to be copied. Specifically, look at the pixels in the columns to the right of the rightmost vertical line made of grey pixels.
3.  **Copy and Position:** For each target pixel identified in step 2, copy its color value.
4. **Placement** Place this copied color into the rows below the *bottom-most* gray separator line. Ensure the copied pixel occupies the *same column* as the original target pixel.
5.  **Preserve:** The gray separator lines and all white (0) pixels remain unchanged.

Essentially, the rule copies non-gray and non-white pixels found above the bottom-most gray line to the area below that gray line, preserving the column position.
