The extracted object appears to be the right-most and bottom-most object, and the output grid's size and shape are determined by the bounding box (minimum enclosing rectangle) of that extracted object. The background is consistently color 0 (white) and is ignored. It appears a single color object is extracted per example.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This defines the bounding box.\n4.  **Extract Object:** Create a new grid with dimensions equal to the bounding box.\n5.  **Copy Pixels:** Copy the pixels of the selected object from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid, maintaining their original color.\n6. output grid will be filled with selected object, with cells outside the contiguous block set to 0.\n\n"
