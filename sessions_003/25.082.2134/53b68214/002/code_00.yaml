objects:
  - description: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D array (rows, cols)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - role: input, output, intermediate
  - description: non-zero pixel
    properties:
      - color: value other than 0
      - location: (row, col)
      - action: extend_downward

actions:
  - name: extend_downward
    description: Propagate the color of a non-zero pixel down its column.
    parameters:
      - start_row: Row index of the non-zero pixel.
      - col: Column index of the non-zero pixel.
      - end_row:  The final row of the output grid.
    preconditions:
      - grid[start_row, col] != 0
    postconditions:
      - For all r in range(start_row + 1, end_row), grid[r, col] = grid[start_row, col]

output_grid_size_rule:
    description: Determine output grid based on training examples
    rule: The output grid will have dimensions based on examples.
    details: the height will be adjusted according to the provided output, while the width will remain the same.
