The transformation seems to involve extending or replicating existing colored \"objects\" (contiguous blocks of the same color) downwards.  The key element appears to be a vertical expansion of non-zero pixels. The background (0, or white pixels) remains unchanged except where a non-zero pixel expands into it.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
