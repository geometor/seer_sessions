Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and formulate a plan to improve the natural language program and the corresponding code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code attempted to capture several transformation rules: blue extension triggered by green squares, orange/azure duplication, and magenta movement. However, the results show significant discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs in all three examples. This indicates that the implementation of these rules, and potentially the rules themselves, are flawed or incomplete.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** For each example, pinpoint the exact locations where the transformed output differs from the expected output. This will help identify which rules are being misapplied or missed.
2.  **Rule Re-evaluation:** Based on the error analysis, revisit the natural language description of each rule. Are the conditions for triggering the rule correctly defined? Are the actions performed by the rule accurately described?
3.  **Incremental Refinement:** Start by focusing on the simplest and most consistent errors. Address these first, then move on to more complex or less frequent discrepancies.
4. Consider that the current implementation is likely too aggressive.

**Gather Metrics and Error Reports**

I will use a python script to generate a difference map for each example.


``` python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """
    Compares two grids and returns a difference map.

    Args:
        grid1: The first grid (NumPy array).
        grid2: The second grid (NumPy array).

    Returns:
        A NumPy array representing the difference map.
        Cells where grids differ have a value of 1, otherwise 0.
    """
    diff_map = (grid1 != grid2).astype(int)
    return diff_map

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all blue (1), orange (7), azure (8), magenta (6) pixels, and green (3) 2x2 squares in the input grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Extension (Conditional):**
    *   Locate 2x2 green squares.
    *   For *each* column that contains *any* blue pixel, extend the blue color downwards *only within that column*.  Stop when encountering a non-empty cell or the grid boundary.
    *   The 2x2 green squares do not influence which columns the blue extends in, only if the blue should extend at all.

3.  **Orange Pixel Duplication (Conditional):**
    *   For each orange (7) pixel, duplicate it to the immediate right, *only* if the cell to the right is empty (0).  Do *not* overwrite existing pixels.

4.  **Azure Pixel Duplication (Conditional):**
    *   For each azure (8) pixel, duplicate it to the immediate left, *only* if the cell to the left is empty (0). Do *not* overwrite existing pixels.

5.  **Magenta Pixel Movement (Conditional):**
    *   For each magenta (6) pixel:
        *   Check if there is *any* green (3) pixel in the same column and *below* the magenta pixel.
        *   If green is found below, move the magenta pixel to the highest empty (0) cell directly above its current position *in the same column*.
        *   Do *not* move the magenta pixel if there is no green pixel below it in the same column, or if there are no empty cells above it.
        *   Overwrite the magenta pixel's original position with 0.
