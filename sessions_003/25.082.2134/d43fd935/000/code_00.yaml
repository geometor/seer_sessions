facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      There are multiple colors (represented by digits) in both input and output.
  - observation: |
      '3' (green) objects typically appear as 2x2 squares in the input.
  - observation: |
     '1' (blue) can appear in the input by itself
  - observation: |
      In train_1, The output includes a horizontal line of '1's (blue) extending from the 2x2 green square, of length equal to where it intersects the first vertically encountered '1'.
  - observation: |
       In train_1, '6' (magenta) changes it's vertical position.
  - observation: |
      In train_2, orange (7) and azure (8) pixels are present, and replicated horizontally
  - observation: |
      The positions of '1's (blue) seem to influence the output, acting as a kind of "stopping point" or "trigger".
  - observation: |
      In train_3, there's a vertical sequence of 1s created, stopping at other instances of 1s.
