The primary color observed is red (2) and occasionally azure (8).  The background is consistently white (0). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of some red (2) pixels with azure (8) pixels, based on their position. The overall grid size and shape remain constant during the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
