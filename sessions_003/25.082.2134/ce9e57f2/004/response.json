While it captured some aspects of the transformation, testing on subsequent examples revealed inconsistencies. The primary issue lies in the incorrect application of the row/column parity and bottom-half conditions, leading to incorrect pixel modifications. We need to refine the conditions for changing red pixels to azure.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Pay close attention to the pixels that were incorrectly changed or remained unchanged.\n2.  **Refine Conditions:** Based on the mismatches, adjust the conditions in the natural language program. Focus on the precise relationship between the row and column indices of the red pixels that should be changed to azure. Consider if 'bottom half' condition has to be adjusted.\n3. **Cross Validation of examples:** The initial hypothesis was only valid on the first training example, re-evaluate and verify how consistent the hypothesis has to be to generalize across all given cases.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, code execution not strictly necessary for this level of observation):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:** Red pixels at (5,1), (6,1), (5,3), (6,3), (5,5), (6,5) are incorrectly transformed to blue. Expected (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (4,3) ...\n    *   **Mismatch:** The parity condition is applied too restrictively. it looks like (row+col) should be an odd number. Row index should >= rows//2\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation:** Similar to the first example, multiple red pixels are misclassified.\n    *   **Mismatch:** Again, the row and parity conditions are not precise enough.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Observation:** some correct, and similar to example 1 and 2.\n    *   **Mismatch:** some correct classifications, and consistent with the 'bottom half' hypothesis, needs to be generalized.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
