1.  **Input:** A 4xN grid (where N is the number of columns) of single-digit integers (0-9).

2.  **Columnar Zero Analysis:** For each column in the input grid, determine which rows contain the value 0. Store this information as a list of row indices for each column.

3.  **Output Grid Generation (Row 1):**
    *   Iterate through the columns from left to right.
    *   Count the number of consecutive columns, starting from the leftmost column, where *all* rows contain a 0. This count determines the value for the first row of the output grid.

4.  **Output Grid Generation (Row 2):**
    *   Iterate through the columns from left to right.
    *   Count the number of consecutive columns that contain *at least one* 0. This count is used to determine the output grid's second row.

5.  **Output Grid Generation (Row 3):**
    *   Iterate through the columns from right to left.
    *   Count how many consecutive columns, starting from the rightmost, that have *at least one* zero.  This count determines the third row of the output grid.

6. **Output:** A 3x3 grid where all elements within each row are the same, derived using steps 3,4, and 5. The values should wrap to single digits (e.g., 10 becomes 0, 11 becomes 1, etc, by mod 10)
