Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** The input grids seem to consistently contain the digit `5` (gray) and `0` (white) in various arrangements. There are always four rows, but a varying number of columns, although it's always greater than 10.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are consistently 3x3 and contain digits other than `5` and `0`. The digits on each row are the same, but different between rows.\n*   **Relationship:** It seems we are mapping patterns in the input to single digits in the output. The key might lie in the vertical columns and the arrangement/number of `0`s (white pixels) within them, although some inputs are identical but result in different outputs, indicating that the entire pattern is important. The first row seems the most important, since the last three rows differ but give the same output in the second output digit (see train 1 and 2).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
