Okay, I'm ready to analyze these examples and try to figure out the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids seem to consistently contain the digit `5` (gray) and `0` (white) in various arrangements. There are always four rows, but a varying number of columns, although it's always greater than 10.
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are consistently 3x3 and contain digits other than `5` and `0`. The digits on each row are the same, but different between rows.
*   **Relationship:** It seems we are mapping patterns in the input to single digits in the output. The key might lie in the vertical columns and the arrangement/number of `0`s (white pixels) within them, although some inputs are identical but result in different outputs, indicating that the entire pattern is important. The first row seems the most important, since the last three rows differ but give the same output in the second output digit (see train 1 and 2).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      rows: 4
      columns: variable (14)
      elements: [0, 5]  # white, gray
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 3
      elements: [1-9] excluding 5, distinct per row, identical per row
  - type: vertical_columns # implicit object for transformation
    properties:
       elements_of_interest: [0]

actions:
  - type: map_pattern
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    mechanism: unknown, related to 0 positions in input

relationships:
    - input_grid *contains* vertical_columns
    - vertical_columns *maps_to* output_grid_rows
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine Input:** Take the 4xN input grid, where N is the number of columns.
2.  **Consider Columns:** Observe each vertical column.
3. **Determine Output Rows:**
   * The output is a 3x3 grid
   * The output grid's first row consists of the color corresponding to the number of times that all `0`s are in the first row is equivalent to all columns where the `0` are on the bottom, starting from the left side
   * The output grid's second row is constructed by taking the number of columns where `0` are on the bottom, starting from the right side.
   * The output grid's third row are determined by all contiguous groups of 0s, starting from the left side.

4. **Return Output Grid:** Construct and return the 3x3 output grid, where all values in each row is the same.

I am not confident in these conclusions, there may be extraneous data in the input that is skewing my pattern matching.
