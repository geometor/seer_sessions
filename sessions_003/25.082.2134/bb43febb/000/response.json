Here's my breakdown of the input-output example pairs:\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of pixels, where each pixel has a color value represented by an integer (0-9).\n*   The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), and red (2).\n*   The grids are 10x10.\n*   There are rectangular shapes formed by contiguous blocks of gray pixels.\n*   The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some gray pixels to red within these gray rectangles.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
