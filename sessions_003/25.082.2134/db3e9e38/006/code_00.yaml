objects:
  - name: vertical_line
    color: 7
    description: A contiguous set of cells with the value '7' aligned vertically.
    properties:
      start_row: row index of the top cell of the line
      column: column index of the line
      length: number of cells in the line

  - name: L_shape
    description: A pattern formed by cells of alternating colors '7' and '8', resembling the letter 'L'.
    properties:
        level: The 'nesting' level of the L shape, starting from 0 for the initial vertical line.
        top_row: The row index of the horizontal part of the 'L'.
        left_column: The leftmost column index of the horizontal part of the 'L'.
        right_column: The rightmost column index of the horizontal part of the 'L'.

  - name: background
    color: 0
    description: Cells that are not part of any L shape, retaining the value '0'.

actions:
  - name: identify_vertical_line
    input: input_grid
    output: vertical_line
    description: Locates the vertical line of '7's in the input grid.

  - name: generate_L_shapes
    input: vertical_line, level
    output: L_shape
    description: Creates an L shape pattern around the vertical line, with alternating '7's and '8's.  The horizontal part is one level above vertical line and each arm is level+1 cells in length.

  - name: expand_L_shapes
    input: previous_L_shapes
    output: next_L_shapes
    description: Creates nested L shapes, increasing the level with each expansion. The horizontal part goes left and right, the vertical part goes up.

  - name: maintain_background
    input: output_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Ensures cells not part of any L-shape remain '0'.
