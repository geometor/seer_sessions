            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the vertical line of '7's. However, it failed to generate the expanding 'L' shaped pattern of alternating '7's and '8's around the initial line. The code currently just returns the original grid with zeros and the identified vertical line. The primary issue is with the pattern generation logic (steps 2 & 3 in the code comments), which needs to correctly implement the outward expansion and alternation of colors.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Line Detection:** Ensure the `find_vertical_line` function is working as expected across all examples. Based on the prior results it seems like a problem, and the best next action is to confirm.\n2.  **Correct Pattern Generation:** The core of the update will involve rewriting the pattern generation part of the `transform` function. We need to ensure it creates the nested 'L' shapes correctly, alternating '7' and '8', expanding outwards from the initial vertical line, and respecting grid boundaries.\n3. **Debug with metrics** Use code execution to verify assumptions and gather detailed metrics and report\n\n**Gather Metrics and Verify Assumptions:**\n\nFirst, I'll re-examine the `find_vertical_line` function and also inspect the input and expected output to confirm my understanding of how the line is defined.\n\n"
