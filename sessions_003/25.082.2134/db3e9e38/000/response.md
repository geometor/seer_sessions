Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The most prominent feature is a vertical line of '7's (orange) in the input grid. The output grid seems to construct a series of alternating 7s and 8s (orange and azure), starting from the location of the original vertical orange line. and expanding outwards, decreasing in length, looking kind of like nested L-shapes. The background is '0' (white).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_vertical_line: True
      - line_color: 7  # Orange

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_alternating_pattern: True
      - pattern_colors: [7, 8]  # Orange, Azure
      - pattern_origin: "location of input line"

actions:
  - name: locate_line
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates of vertical line

  - name: create_pattern
    input: line_coordinates, input_grid_dimensions
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Output pattern is centered around the location of the input line."
  - type: transformation
    description: "Input grid's vertical line determines the starting point for the output grid's alternating pattern."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate the Vertical Line:** Find the coordinates of the vertical line of '7's (orange) in the input grid. This line serves as the central axis for the transformation.

2.  **Establish the Pattern Seed:** At the original location of the vertical '7' line start creating the pattern.

3.  **Expand the Pattern:** From the central axis we are extending an alternating sequence of '7' and '8'. The '7' will be where it already is in the input. The length of each line added shrinks at each step. The pattern is an 'L' on the top and expands until the top line is almost the full grid length and the horizontal lines extend only while space exists.

4.  **Maintain Background:** Any cells in the input grid that are not part of the vertical '7' line, and are not filled with '7' or '8' of pattern in the creation process, remain '0' (white) in the output grid.
