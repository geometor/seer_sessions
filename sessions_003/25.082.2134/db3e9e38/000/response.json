The most prominent feature is a vertical line of '7's (orange) in the input grid. The output grid seems to construct a series of alternating 7s and 8s (orange and azure), starting from the location of the original vertical orange line. and expanding outwards, decreasing in length, looking kind of like nested L-shapes. The background is '0' (white).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This line serves as the central axis for the transformation.\n\n2.  **Establish the Pattern Seed:** At the original location of the vertical '7' line start creating the pattern.\n\n3.  **Expand the Pattern:** From the central axis we are extending an alternating sequence of '7' and '8'. The '7' will be where it already is in the input. The length of each line added shrinks at each step. The pattern is an 'L' on the top and expands until the top line is almost the full grid length and the horizontal lines extend only while space exists.\n\n4.  **Maintain Background:** Any cells in the input grid that are not part of the vertical '7' line, and are not filled with '7' or '8' of pattern in the creation process, remain '0' (white) in the output grid.\n"
