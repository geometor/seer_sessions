"""
1.  **Locate Vertical Line:** Find the vertical line of '7's in the input grid. A vertical line is defined as a contiguous sequence of '7's in a single column, with a length of at least two cells. Record the starting row, column, and length of this line.
2.  **Seed Output Grid:** Create an output grid filled with '0's, with the same dimensions as the input grid. Copy the located vertical line of '7's to the corresponding position in the output grid.
3.  **Generate Nested 'L' Shapes:**
    *   Starting from the top of the vertical line, and moving upwards one row at a time (level by level):
        *   Create the horizontal part of an 'L' shape.  This part extends to the left and right of the vertical line's column. The length of each arm (left and right) should equal the current level (starting with level 1). The horizontal line colors alternate, starting with '8' to the immediate left and right, then '7', then '8', etc.
        * Create the vertical part of the 'L' shape by extending up from the leftmost end of the horizontal section. The vertical section colors should also follow the same alternating pattern 8, 7, 8.
        *   Stop expanding when any part of the 'L' shape would go outside the bounds of the grid.
4.  **Maintain Background:** Ensure all cells in the output grid that are not part of the vertical line or the generated 'L' shapes remain '0'.
