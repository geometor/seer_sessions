The transformation rule involves locating a vertical line of '7's in the input grid and using its position to generate an alternating pattern of '7's and '8's in the output grid. The pattern expands outwards from the initial line location, creating nested 'L' shapes, while maintaining the '0' background. The L shapes are formed with the horizontal part going to the left and right and the vertical part going up.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the vertical line of '7's. However, it failed to generate the expanding 'L' shaped pattern of alternating '7's and '8's around the initial line. The code currently just returns the original grid with zeros and the identified vertical line. The primary issue is with the pattern generation logic (steps 2 & 3 in the code comments), which needs to correctly implement the outward expansion and alternation of colors.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Line Detection:** Ensure the `find_vertical_line` function is working as expected across all examples. Based on the prior results it seems like a problem, and the best next action is to confirm.
2.  **Correct Pattern Generation:** The core of the update will involve rewriting the pattern generation part of the `transform` function. We need to ensure it creates the nested 'L' shapes correctly, alternating '7' and '8', expanding outwards from the initial vertical line, and respecting grid boundaries.
3. **Debug with metrics** Use code execution to verify assumptions and gather detailed metrics and report

**Gather Metrics and Verify Assumptions:**

First, I'll re-examine the `find_vertical_line` function and also inspect the input and expected output to confirm my understanding of how the line is defined.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Vertical Line:** Find the vertical line of '7's in the input grid. A vertical line is defined as a contiguous sequence of '7's in a single column, with a length of at least two cells. Record the starting row, column, and length of this line.
2.  **Seed Output Grid:** Create an output grid filled with '0's, with the same dimensions as the input grid. Copy the located vertical line of '7's to the corresponding position in the output grid.
3.  **Generate Nested 'L' Shapes:**
    *   Starting from the top of the vertical line, and moving upwards one row at a time (level by level):
        *   Create the horizontal part of an 'L' shape.  This part extends to the left and right of the vertical line's column. The length of each arm (left and right) should equal the current level (starting with level 1). The horizontal line colors alternate, starting with '8' to the immediate left and right, then '7', then '8', etc.
        * Create the vertical part of the 'L' shape by extending up from the leftmost end of the horizontal section. The vertical section colors should also follow the same alternating pattern 8, 7, 8.
        *   Stop expanding when any part of the 'L' shape would go outside the bounds of the grid.
4.  **Maintain Background:** Ensure all cells in the output grid that are not part of the vertical line or the generated 'L' shapes remain '0'.
