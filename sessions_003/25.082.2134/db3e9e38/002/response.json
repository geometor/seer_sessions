            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the vertical line of '7's as a key element. However, it failed to generate the expanding \"L\" shaped pattern of alternating '7's and '8's correctly. The transformed output simply replicated the input, indicating that the core logic for generating the pattern is missing or flawed. The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Debugging `find_vertical_line`:** Ensure it correctly identifies the *entire* vertical line, even if it's at the edge of the grid.\n2.  **Correcting Pattern Generation:** The current code attempts an expanding \"L\" pattern but doesn't implement it accurately. It has hard coded starting point and offset which is wrong. The core logic needs to:\n    *   Start from the top of the identified vertical line.\n    *   Iteratively expand outwards, creating \"L\" shapes.\n    *   Correctly alternate between '7' and '8' in the pattern.\n    *   Handle edge cases (when the expansion hits the grid boundaries).\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze each example with a focus on understanding why the transformation failed:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Vertical Line Position: Column 3 (index 3), Rows 0-3\n    *   Error: The output is identical to the input. The code finds the vertical line, but the pattern generation logic is not producing the nested Ls of 7s and 8s around the line.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 8)\n    *   Output Shape: (7, 8)\n    *   Vertical Line Position: Column 2 (index 2), Rows 0-4\n    *   Error: Similar to Example 1, the output is a copy of the input. The issue is in the pattern expansion.\n\n"

A vertical line is defined as two or more contiguous pixels of the same color in the same column. Record the starting row, ending row, and column of this line.\n\n2.  **Generate 'L' Pattern:**\n    *   Start at the top of the vertical orange line.\n    *   Iteratively expand outwards from this point, creating nested \"L\" shapes.\n    *   Each \"L\" consists of a horizontal and a vertical segment.\n    *   The horizontal segment extends to the left and right of the current origin.\n    *   The vertical segment extends *up* from the horizontal.\n    *   The colors within each \"L\" shape alternate between orange (7) and azure (8). The top-left corner pixel of the \"L\" is always 7. The pixel to the right and the pixel below is always 8.\n    *   The \"origin\" of the next L is one row above and one column to the left of the current origin.\n\n3.  **Maintain Background:** Ensure that all pixels that are not part of the generated \"L\" pattern remain black (0). The initial grid is filled with '0', which is implicitly maintain unless overwritten.\n\n4.  **Termination:** Continue generating nested \"L\" shapes until the expansion reaches the boundaries of the grid (either top, left, or right edges).\n\nThe key improvement here is that the vertical arm of the L goes *up* and the next L is placed *above and to the left*.\n"
