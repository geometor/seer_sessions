            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the vertical line of '7's. However, it fails to generate the expanding alternating pattern of '7's and '8's correctly. The core issue is with the pattern generation logic, specifically in how it expands outwards from the initial vertical line. The provided code currently only copies the vertical line, it doesn't draw the horizontal parts.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Assumptions:** Double-check the pattern generation logic against the expected outputs. It should create nested \"L\" shapes.\n2.  **Refine Pattern Generation:** Modify the code to correctly generate the alternating '7' and '8' pattern, extending outwards from the vertical line. Ensure correct indexing and boundary checks. The horizontal part of the 'L' must extend to the left and right. The vertical part of the 'L' starts at the horizontal line and goes up.\n3.   **Re-test and Iterate:** After modification, test the code on all training examples and repeat the analysis and refinement process until all examples produce correct outputs.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere are the metrics from manual inspection, before writing code to calculate them:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 5x7\n    *   Output Size: 5x7\n    *   Vertical Line Column: 3\n    *   Vertical Line Length: 4\n    *   Pixels different: 12\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 7x8\n    *   Output Size: 7x8\n    *   Vertical Line Column: 2\n    *   Vertical Line Length: 5\n    *   Pixels different: 17\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"

A vertical line is defined as two or more contiguous pixels of color '7' in the same column.\n\n2.  **Seed the Pattern:** The output grid starts with all '0's (background). Copy the located vertical line of '7's to the same position in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Expand the Pattern (Nested 'L' Shapes):** Starting from the top of the initial vertical line, and expanding outwards, create nested \"L\" shapes using an alternating pattern of '7's and '8's.\n    *   Each \"L\" shape consists of a horizontal line and a vertical line meeting at the top-left corner of the 'L'.\n    *   The horizontal part of each 'L' extends one pixel to the *left* and one pixel to the *right* of the previous 'L's horizontal segment.\n    * The first horizontal line starts at the top of the initial vertical line.\n    *   The vertical part of each 'L' extends *upwards* from the *leftmost* cell of the 'L' shape's horizontal line. The length increases with the height of the 'L'.\n    *   The colors in each 'L' shape alternate: '7', '8', '7', '8', etc., starting with '7' at the corner (the intersection of horizontal and vertical).\n\n4.  **Maintain Background:** All cells not part of the vertical line or the expanding pattern should remain '0'.\n"
