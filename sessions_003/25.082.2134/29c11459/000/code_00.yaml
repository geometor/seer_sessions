facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have identical dimensions."
  - observation: "The background color (0/white) is consistent between input and output."

  - new_object:
      - name: 'separator'
        properties:
           - attribute: 'color'
             values: 'grey(5)'
        actions:
           - name: 'appears between expansions'
           - description: 'a grey pixel separates groups of expanded pixels'
  - relationship: "Non-zero pixels in the input correspond to expanded regions of the same color in the output, separated by grey."
