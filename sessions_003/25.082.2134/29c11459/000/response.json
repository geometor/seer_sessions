Specifically:\n    * Copy input pixel value to 4 spaces to the left.\n    * Copy input pixel value to four spaces to the right\n3. **Insert Grey Separator** put a gray (5) pixel between expanded groups.\n4. **Background Preservation:** All other pixels (where the input is 0) remain 0 in the output.\n\nIn simple terms, the rule takes each colored pixel in the input, replicates its color in a horizontal line of length = the original pixel, plus four copies on each side (total nine), and then adds a gray pixel as a separator between these expansions. The white background stays the same.\n"
