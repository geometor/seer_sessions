'0' represents white, and other digits represent different colors.\n*   **Objects:** There are contiguous blocks of non-white pixels that can be considered \"objects\". These objects are made up of single colors, forming simple horizontal and vertical lines, or L-shapes. The objects appear to be mirrored, rotated, and duplicated.\n*    The input object always seems to consists of three continguous pixels, one central pixel and two \"wing\" pixels.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve a combination of reflection, expansion, and, in some cases, color changes, applied to these objects. The mirroring isn't a simple reflection across a single axis; it seems tied to the individual objects and their layout.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Each object will consist of three pixels: a central pixel, and two \"wing\" pixels that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the central pixel.\n\n2.  **Process Each Object:** For each identified object:\n    *   **Central Pixel Expansion**: The central pixel color value becomes a core and is duplicated horizontally to the left and right, resulting in three same colored pixels in output grid.\n    *   **Wing Pixel Mirroring:** The wing pixels are mirrored around central pixel.\n    *    **Wing Pixel Expansion**: The reflected wing pixels are duplicated horizontally to the left and right, resulting in three same colored pixels in output grid.\n    *   **Color Changes:**\n       * In train\\_1, orange(7) wing pixels become red (2) after mirroring, red(2) wing pixel keeps its color.\n       * In train\\_2, magenta(6) wing pixels keep their color, azure(8) wing pixels become magenta(6) after mirroring.\n\n3.  **Output:** Place the transformed object components in the output grid, maintaining their relative positions and accounting for any reflections/expansions.\n\n4. **Empty Spaces:** Keep original size of input grid and fill the rest of places in the output with white pixels\n\nIn essence, the transformation expands and mirrors/reflects each identified object, with object parts being three pixels wide. There may be a color change as well.\n"
