Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 12x12 grids.
*   **Colors:**  The grids contain pixels of various colors, represented by digits 0-9. '0' represents white, and other digits represent different colors.
*   **Objects:** There are contiguous blocks of non-white pixels that can be considered "objects". These objects are made up of single colors, forming simple horizontal and vertical lines, or L-shapes. The objects appear to be mirrored, rotated, and duplicated.
*    The input object always seems to consists of three continguous pixels, one central pixel and two "wing" pixels.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve a combination of reflection, expansion, and, in some cases, color changes, applied to these objects. The mirroring isn't a simple reflection across a single axis; it seems tied to the individual objects and their layout.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
      shape: [horizontal_line, vertical_line, L_shape]
      colors: [red, green, orange, magenta, azure]
      size: 3 # All observed objects have 3 pixels
      central_pixel: True
      wing_pixels: 2

observations:
  - input_grid_size: [12, 12]
  - output_grid_size: [12, 12]
  - object_duplication: True
  - object_reflection: True
  - object_color_change_possible: True
  - symmetry_around_central_pixel : True
  - wing_pixel_expansion: True

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous, non-white pixel groups (objects) in the input grid. Each object will consist of three pixels: a central pixel, and two "wing" pixels that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the central pixel.

2.  **Process Each Object:** For each identified object:
    *   **Central Pixel Expansion**: The central pixel color value becomes a core and is duplicated horizontally to the left and right, resulting in three same colored pixels in output grid.
    *   **Wing Pixel Mirroring:** The wing pixels are mirrored around central pixel.
    *    **Wing Pixel Expansion**: The reflected wing pixels are duplicated horizontally to the left and right, resulting in three same colored pixels in output grid.
    *   **Color Changes:**
       * In train\_1, orange(7) wing pixels become red (2) after mirroring, red(2) wing pixel keeps its color.
       * In train\_2, magenta(6) wing pixels keep their color, azure(8) wing pixels become magenta(6) after mirroring.

3.  **Output:** Place the transformed object components in the output grid, maintaining their relative positions and accounting for any reflections/expansions.

4. **Empty Spaces:** Keep original size of input grid and fill the rest of places in the output with white pixels

In essence, the transformation expands and mirrors/reflects each identified object, with object parts being three pixels wide. There may be a color change as well.
