            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to address the errors in the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code attempts to identify 3-pixel objects, expand the central pixel, and mirror/expand the wing pixels with color changes. However, the provided results show that the code produces completely blank grids. The function `get_objects` is returning an empty list. This suggest a problem either in how `get_objects` is implemented, how it handles various arrangements of input, and how the dfs determines object characteristics. The provided images show what the output looks like, rather than the result that we want. The primary problem is that `get_objects` does not correctly locate the objects as intended.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Fix `get_objects`:** The core issue is that the `get_objects` function is not working. I'll first change this to a function that assumes a much more constrained input - a 3 pixel horizontal or vertical object.\n2. **Re-evaluate Object Definition:** The previous approach did not correctly identify the core \"object\" criteria. The examples seem to indicate objects are either horizontal or vertical and have a specific, limited length of 3.\n3. **Simplify Expansion and Mirroring:** Once object identification is correct, ensure the expansion and mirroring logic is aligned with a constrained set of object properties.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution is not necessary, but a yaml block is):**\n\nHere's a YAML block summarizing the facts and observations:\n\n"

The other two pixels are the wing pixels.\n3.  **Expand Central Pixel:** The central pixel expands into a 3x1 block of pixels of the same color.\n4.  **Mirror and Expand Wing Pixels**:\n    *   Each wing pixel is mirrored across the central pixel, preserving horizontal/vertical orientation.\n    *   Each mirrored wing pixel expands to a 3x1 block.\n    *    Wing pixels that are orange are changed to red in the output and in their mirrored copies.\n    *   Wing pixels that are azure are changed to magenta in the output and in their mirrored copies.\n\nThis refined natural language program provides a more precise description, incorporating the crucial observation about horizontal and vertical lines. This will help to create a much better code function.\n"
