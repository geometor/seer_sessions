These lines define \"objects,\" and each object will be used once in the final output.\n\n2.  **Center Pixel Expansion:** For each identified 3-pixel line, expand the central pixel. The center expands to fill a 3x3 block around it, keeping its original color, but respecting grid boundaries (i.e. at the edge of the grid, this will be a 3x2, 2x3, or 2x2 block.\n\n3.  **Wing Pixel Transformation and Mirrored Block Creation:**\n    *   For each 3-pixel line, identify the two \"wing\" pixels (the pixels on either end of the line).\n    *   Determine the transformed color of the wing pixels: If a wing pixel is orange (7), its transformed color is red (2). If a wing pixel is azure (8), its transformed color is magenta (6).\n    *   For *each* wing pixel, create a new 1x3 block *mirrored* across the central pixel of the original 3-pixel line. This new block will have the *transformed* color. This new block does *not* replace the original wing pixels; it is an additional element.\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the expanded central pixels and the mirrored 1x3 blocks created from the wing pixels. Note: the original 3-pixel line's wing pixels are *not* directly present in the output, only their transformation on the opposite side of the center.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_3_pixel_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds horizontal and vertical 3-pixel objects.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    objects = []\n\n    # Check for horizontal objects\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols - 2):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and grid[r, c+1] != 0 and grid[r, c+2] != 0:\n                objects.append({\n                    'type': 'horizontal',\n                    'central': (r, c+1),\n                    'wings': [(r, c), (r, c+2)],\n                })\n\n    # Check for vertical objects\n    for r in range(rows - 2):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and grid[r+1, c] != 0 and grid[r+2, c] != 0:\n                objects.append({\n                    'type': 'vertical',\n                    'central': (r+1, c),\n                    'wings': [(r, c), (r+2, c)],\n                })\n\n    return objects\n\ndef expand_center_pixel(grid, row, col, color):\n    \"\"\"Expands the central pixel into a 3x3 block, respecting boundaries.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(max(0, row - 1), min(rows, row + 2)):\n        for c in range(max(0, col - 1), min(cols, col + 2)):\n            grid[r, c] = color\n\ndef create_mirrored_block(grid, central_row, central_col, wing_row, wing_col, color):\n    \"\"\"Creates a 1x3 mirrored block.\"\"\"\n    row_offset = wing_row - central_row\n    col_offset = wing_col - central_col\n    mirrored_row = central_row - row_offset\n    mirrored_col = central_col - col_offset\n\n    if 0 <= mirrored_row < grid.shape[0]:\n      grid[mirrored_row, max(0, mirrored_col - 1)] = color\n      grid[mirrored_row, mirrored_col] = color\n      grid[mirrored_row, min(grid.shape[1] - 1, mirrored_col + 1)] = color\n\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    objects = find_3_pixel_objects(input_grid)\n\n    for obj in objects:\n        central_row, central_col = obj['central']\n        central_color = input_grid[central_row, central_col]\n\n        # Expand central pixel\n        expand_center_pixel(output_grid, central_row, central_col, central_color)\n\n        for wing_row, wing_col in obj['wings']:\n            wing_color = input_grid[wing_row, wing_col]\n\n            # Determine transformed color\n            if wing_color == 7:\n                transformed_color = 2\n            elif wing_color == 8:\n                transformed_color = 6\n            else:\n                transformed_color = wing_color  # Should not happen, but good practice\n\n            # Create mirrored block\n            create_mirrored_block(output_grid, central_row, central_col, wing_row, wing_col, transformed_color)\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
