Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies 3-pixel lines (horizontal and vertical) and attempts to expand and mirror them. However, there's a clear misunderstanding of how the expansion and mirroring should interact, and the code incorrectly duplicates expansions in a way that does not make any geometrical sense. The transformed output does not include the central pixel expansion.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Clarify Expansion Logic:** Revisit what it means to *expand* the central and wing pixels. It seems to involve creating 1x3 blocks, but in the correct output, the central pixel is also filled.
2.  **Correct Mirroring:** The mirroring logic currently implemented is incorrect. Mirroring should be considered *before* expansion to position the new block relative to the central pixel.

**Metrics and Observations (Example-by-Example):**

Let's analyze what happens in each case and why it differs from expected, this will give use more insights on how to adjust the strategy.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 3-Pixel Lines:** Find all horizontal and vertical lines consisting of exactly 3 contiguous pixels, where all pixels in the line are non-zero. These lines define "objects," and each object will be used once in the final output.

2.  **Center Pixel Expansion:** For each identified 3-pixel line, expand the central pixel. The center expands to fill a 3x3 block around it, keeping its original color, but respecting grid boundaries (i.e. at the edge of the grid, this will be a 3x2, 2x3, or 2x2 block.

3.  **Wing Pixel Transformation and Mirrored Block Creation:**
    *   For each 3-pixel line, identify the two "wing" pixels (the pixels on either end of the line).
    *   Determine the transformed color of the wing pixels: If a wing pixel is orange (7), its transformed color is red (2). If a wing pixel is azure (8), its transformed color is magenta (6).
    *   For *each* wing pixel, create a new 1x3 block *mirrored* across the central pixel of the original 3-pixel line. This new block will have the *transformed* color. This new block does *not* replace the original wing pixels; it is an additional element.

4.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the expanded central pixels and the mirrored 1x3 blocks created from the wing pixels. Note: the original 3-pixel line's wing pixels are *not* directly present in the output, only their transformation on the opposite side of the center.

**Key Changes and Clarifications in the NL Program:**

*   **Center Expansion:** The central pixel is now expanded to a 3x3 block.
*   **Mirroring, *Then* Expansion:** It's crucial that the mirroring happens *before* the 1x3 block expansion for the wing pixels. The mirrored *position* is calculated, and *then* the 1x3 block is created at that mirrored location. The previous code was expanding, and then incorrectly expanding again at the mirrored location.
*   **No Wing Pixel Replacement:** The original wing pixels are used only to determine the location and color of the *new* mirrored blocks. They do not appear in the output grid by themselves.
*   **Output Combination:** The final output combines only the *expanded center block*, and the new, *mirrored wing-pixel blocks*.
