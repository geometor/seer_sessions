            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies 3-pixel lines (horizontal and vertical) and attempts to expand and mirror them. However, there's a clear misunderstanding of how the expansion and mirroring should interact, and the code incorrectly duplicates expansions in a way that does not make any geometrical sense. The transformed output does not include the central pixel expansion.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Clarify Expansion Logic:** Revisit what it means to *expand* the central and wing pixels. It seems to involve creating 1x3 blocks, but in the correct output, the central pixel is also filled.\n2.  **Correct Mirroring:** The mirroring logic currently implemented is incorrect. Mirroring should be considered *before* expansion to position the new block relative to the central pixel.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example-by-Example):**\n\nLet's analyze what happens in each case and why it differs from expected, this will give use more insights on how to adjust the strategy.\n\n"

These lines define \"objects,\" and each object will be used once in the final output.\n\n2.  **Center Pixel Expansion:** For each identified 3-pixel line, expand the central pixel. The center expands to fill a 3x3 block around it, keeping its original color, but respecting grid boundaries (i.e. at the edge of the grid, this will be a 3x2, 2x3, or 2x2 block.\n\n3.  **Wing Pixel Transformation and Mirrored Block Creation:**\n    *   For each 3-pixel line, identify the two \"wing\" pixels (the pixels on either end of the line).\n    *   Determine the transformed color of the wing pixels: If a wing pixel is orange (7), its transformed color is red (2). If a wing pixel is azure (8), its transformed color is magenta (6).\n    *   For *each* wing pixel, create a new 1x3 block *mirrored* across the central pixel of the original 3-pixel line. This new block will have the *transformed* color. This new block does *not* replace the original wing pixels; it is an additional element.\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the expanded central pixels and the mirrored 1x3 blocks created from the wing pixels. Note: the original 3-pixel line's wing pixels are *not* directly present in the output, only their transformation on the opposite side of the center.\n\n**Key Changes and Clarifications in the NL Program:**\n\n*   **Center Expansion:** The central pixel is now expanded to a 3x3 block.\n*   **Mirroring, *Then* Expansion:** It's crucial that the mirroring happens *before* the 1x3 block expansion for the wing pixels. The mirrored *position* is calculated, and *then* the 1x3 block is created at that mirrored location. The previous code was expanding, and then incorrectly expanding again at the mirrored location.\n*   **No Wing Pixel Replacement:** The original wing pixels are used only to determine the location and color of the *new* mirrored blocks. They do not appear in the output grid by themselves.\n*   **Output Combination:** The final output combines only the *expanded center block*, and the new, *mirrored wing-pixel blocks*.\n"
