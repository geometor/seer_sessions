objects:
  - id: yellow_pixels
    color: yellow (4)
    description:  Define boundaries for red fill.  Appear in pairs, potentially forming rectangles.
    properties:
      - bounding_box:  Determined by the extreme row and column indices of the yellow pixels in a connected set.

  - id: red_pixels
    color: red (2)
    description:  Fill the area between yellow pixels under specific conditions.
    properties:
      - fill_condition:  All pixels between yellow pixels within the bounding box must be white (0) for the fill to occur.
      - fill_area: Within a row or column, between pairs of yellow pixels. Also, fills the *interior* of the rectangle defined by yellow pixels if the corners are all yellow.

actions:
  - name: identify_bounding_box
    description:  Find the smallest rectangle containing all yellow pixels of interest. This is done implicitly by considering all pairs of yellow pixels.
  - name: fill_red
    description: Change white (0) pixels to red (2) inside the bounding box, if and only if all pixels between yellow pixels along rows and columns are white (0).
