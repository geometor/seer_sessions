"""
1.  **Find Vertical Line:** Identify a vertical line, defined as a column where all cells have the same non-zero color. Note the color and column index. If no such line exists, return the original grid.

2.  **Find Horizontal Line:** Identify a horizontal line. A horizontal line exists on a row that intersects the vertical line, is not the same color as the vertical line, and has at least one other pixel that is not color 0.

3.  **Locate Intersection:** The intersection is the point where the vertical and horizontal lines meet (share the same row and column indices).

4.  **Create Frame (Conditional):** If a horizontal line exists, create a yellow (color 4) frame around the intersection *only* on the cells adjacent to the vertical line. This frame extends:
    *   One row above the intersection.
    *   On the intersection row itself.
    *   One row below the intersection.

5.  **Preserve Unchanged Pixels:** Pixels not part of the vertical line or the frame (if it exists) should remain unchanged. Specifically, the vertical line's color should be preserved.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies vertical and horizontal lines and their intersection. However, it has issues with accurately placing the yellow frame. The primary problem is that the yellow frame is sometimes one pixel off in the vertical direction, and sometimes includes extra pixels in other places. We need to adjust how the frame is constructed, making sure that it is symmetric around the intersection point and does not include additional yellow pixels in the vertical line.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Existing Logic:** Double-check the definitions of vertical and horizontal lines to ensure they are still accurate across all examples.
2.  **Refine Frame Placement:** Carefully re-examine the conditions and logic for placing the yellow frame. We'll focus on the row above, the intersection row, and the row below, ensuring that yellow is *only* placed to the immediate left and right of the vertical line within those rows.
3.  **Example-Driven Debugging:** Use the provided examples to pinpoint specific cases where the frame placement fails. Focus on the differences between the "Expected Output" and "Transformed Output".
4. Test changes on all examples to validate fixes.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection of the output above):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** 4x4 grid. Vertical line of color 3 at column 1. Horizontal line of color 2 at row 1.
    *   **Expected:** Yellow frame surrounding the intersection (1,1).
    *   **Actual:** No transformation.
    *   **Problem:** All frame drawing logic seems to be skipped. The issue is in detection of horizontal line, intersection, or both.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** 8x8 grid. Vertical line of color 6 at column 4. Horizontal line of color 8 at row 4.
    *   **Expected:** Yellow frame.
    *   **Actual:** The yellow frame is drawn incorrectly. The frame on the row above the intersection point is placed at the same level as the intersection.
    *   **Problem:** Incorrect vertical placement of the top part of the frame.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** 6x6 grid. Vertical line of color 1 at column 2. Horizontal line of color 9 at row 2.
    *   **Expected:** Yellow frame.
    *   **Actual:** The yellow frame is drawn incorrectly. The frame on the row above the intersection point is placed at the same level as the intersection.
    *   **Problem:** Similar to Example 2, incorrect vertical placement of the top part of the frame.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Vertical Line:** Scan the grid to find a column that forms a vertical line. A vertical line is defined as a column where *all* cells have the same non-zero color. Record the column index and the color of this line. If no such column is found, the input grid remains unchanged.

2.  **Identify the Horizontal Line:** Find a horizontal line that intersects the vertical line. A horizontal line is defined as a row where:
    *   It intersects the vertical line (i.e., shares the same row index as a cell in the vertical line).
    *   It contains at least one cell with a color that is *not* 0 and *not* the same as the vertical line's color.
    *    All non-zero pixels to the left and right of the intersection in this row must have same color.
    Record the row index of this line.

3.  **Locate Intersection:** The intersection point is the cell where the identified vertical and horizontal lines meet (same row and column).

4.  **Create Yellow Frame:** If both a vertical line and a horizontal line have been found, create a yellow (color 4) frame around the intersection point. This frame consists of cells directly to the left and right of the vertical line, located:
    *   One row *above* the intersection row.
    *   On the intersection row itself.
    *   One row *below* the intersection row.

5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure that all cells that are *not* part of the yellow frame and vertical line keep their original colors. The color and placement of the vertical line must be preserved.
