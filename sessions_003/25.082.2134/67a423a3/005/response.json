A vertical line is defined as a column where *all* cells have the same non-zero color. Record the column index and the color of this line. If no such column is found, the input grid remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Identify the Horizontal Line:** Find a horizontal line that intersects the vertical line. A horizontal line is defined as a row where:\n    *   It intersects the vertical line (i.e., shares the same row index as a cell in the vertical line).\n    *   It contains at least one cell with a color that is *not* 0 and *not* the same as the vertical line's color.\n    *    All non-zero pixels to the left and right of the intersection in this row must have same color.\n    Record the row index of this line.\n\n3.  **Locate Intersection:** The intersection point is the cell where the identified vertical and horizontal lines meet (same row and column).\n\n4.  **Create Yellow Frame:** If both a vertical line and a horizontal line have been found, create a yellow (color 4) frame around the intersection point. This frame consists of cells directly to the left and right of the vertical line, located:\n    *   One row *above* the intersection row.\n    *   On the intersection row itself.\n    *   One row *below* the intersection row.\n\n5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure that all cells that are *not* part of the yellow frame and vertical line keep their original colors. The color and placement of the vertical line must be preserved.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_vertical_line(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the vertical line in the grid.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for j in range(cols):\n        first_color = grid[0, j]\n        if first_color == 0:\n            continue\n        is_vertical_line = True\n        for i in range(1, rows):\n            if grid[i, j] != first_color:\n                is_vertical_line = False\n                break\n        if is_vertical_line:\n            return j, first_color\n    return None, None\n\ndef find_horizontal_line(grid, vertical_line_col, vertical_line_color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the horizontal line intersecting the vertical line.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for i in range(rows):\n        if grid[i, vertical_line_col] == vertical_line_color:\n            # Check if there's any non-zero, non-vertical-line color in the row\n            horizontal_colors = []\n            for j in range(cols):\n                if grid[i,j] != 0 and grid[i,j] != vertical_line_color:\n                    horizontal_colors.append(grid[i, j])\n\n            if not horizontal_colors: # if horizontal_colors is empty\n                continue\n            #check if all colors in horizontal_colors are the same\n            if all(color == horizontal_colors[0] for color in horizontal_colors):\n                return i, horizontal_colors[0]\n    return None, None\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n\n    # Find the vertical line\n    vertical_line_col, vertical_line_color = find_vertical_line(grid)\n\n    if vertical_line_col is None:\n        return output_grid.tolist()  # No vertical line\n\n    # Find horizontal line\n    horizontal_line_row, horizontal_line_color = find_horizontal_line(grid, vertical_line_col, vertical_line_color)\n\n    if horizontal_line_row is None:\n        return output_grid.tolist()  # No horizontal line\n\n    # Create frame\n    for r in range(horizontal_line_row - 1, horizontal_line_row + 2):\n        if 0 <= r < rows:\n            if vertical_line_col > 0:\n                output_grid[r, vertical_line_col - 1] = 4\n            if vertical_line_col < cols - 1:\n                output_grid[r, vertical_line_col + 1] = 4\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
