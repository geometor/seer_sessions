            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies vertical and horizontal lines and their intersection. However, it has issues with accurately placing the yellow frame. The primary problem is that the yellow frame is sometimes one pixel off in the vertical direction, and sometimes includes extra pixels in other places. We need to adjust how the frame is constructed, making sure that it is symmetric around the intersection point and does not include additional yellow pixels in the vertical line.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Existing Logic:** Double-check the definitions of vertical and horizontal lines to ensure they are still accurate across all examples.\n2.  **Refine Frame Placement:** Carefully re-examine the conditions and logic for placing the yellow frame. We'll focus on the row above, the intersection row, and the row below, ensuring that yellow is *only* placed to the immediate left and right of the vertical line within those rows.\n3.  **Example-Driven Debugging:** Use the provided examples to pinpoint specific cases where the frame placement fails. Focus on the differences between the \"Expected Output\" and \"Transformed Output\".\n4. Test changes on all examples to validate fixes.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection of the output above):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** 4x4 grid. Vertical line of color 3 at column 1. Horizontal line of color 2 at row 1.\n    *   **Expected:** Yellow frame surrounding the intersection (1,1).\n    *   **Actual:** No transformation.\n    *   **Problem:** All frame drawing logic seems to be skipped. The issue is in detection of horizontal line, intersection, or both.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** 8x8 grid. Vertical line of color 6 at column 4. Horizontal line of color 8 at row 4.\n    *   **Expected:** Yellow frame.\n    *   **Actual:** The yellow frame is drawn incorrectly. The frame on the row above the intersection point is placed at the same level as the intersection.\n    *   **Problem:** Incorrect vertical placement of the top part of the frame.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** 6x6 grid. Vertical line of color 1 at column 2. Horizontal line of color 9 at row 2.\n    *   **Expected:** Yellow frame.\n    *   **Actual:** The yellow frame is drawn incorrectly. The frame on the row above the intersection point is placed at the same level as the intersection.\n    *   **Problem:** Similar to Example 2, incorrect vertical placement of the top part of the frame.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If no such column is found, the input grid remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Identify the Horizontal Line:** Find a horizontal line that intersects the vertical line. A horizontal line is defined as a row where:\n    *   It intersects the vertical line (i.e., shares the same row index as a cell in the vertical line).\n    *   It contains at least one cell with a color that is *not* 0 and *not* the same as the vertical line's color.\n    *    All non-zero pixels to the left and right of the intersection in this row must have same color.\n    Record the row index of this line.\n\n3.  **Locate Intersection:** The intersection point is the cell where the identified vertical and horizontal lines meet (same row and column).\n\n4.  **Create Yellow Frame:** If both a vertical line and a horizontal line have been found, create a yellow (color 4) frame around the intersection point.

The color and placement of the vertical line must be preserved.\n"
