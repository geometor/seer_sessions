objects:
  - name: vertical_line
    properties:
      - type: line
      - orientation: vertical
      - definition: A column where all cells have the same non-zero color.
      - color: varies (non-zero)
      - column_index: varies

  - name: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - type: line
      - orientation: horizontal
      - definition: A row that intersects the vertical line, contains at least one cell not of color 0 and not of the vertical line's color and all horizontal pixels must have same color.
      - color: varies (non-zero and different from vertical_line)
      - row_index: varies

  - name: intersection_point
    properties:
      - type: point
      - definition: The cell where the vertical and horizontal lines meet.
      - coordinates: (row_index of horizontal_line, column_index of vertical_line)

  - name: frame
    properties:
      - type: shape
      - definition: A set of yellow (color 4) cells surrounding the intersection point.
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - placement: Adjacent to the vertical line (left and right) on the row above the intersection, the intersection row, and the row below the intersection.
