Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Vertical Line:** Scan the grid to find a column that forms a vertical line. A vertical line is defined as a column where *all* cells have the same non-zero color. Record the column index and the color of this line. If no such column is found, the input grid remains unchanged.

2.  **Identify the Horizontal Line:** Find a horizontal line that intersects the vertical line. A horizontal line is defined as a row where:
    *   It intersects the vertical line (i.e., shares the same row index as a cell in the vertical line).
    *   It contains at least one cell with a color that is *not* 0 and *not* the same as the vertical line's color.
    *    All non-zero pixels to the left and right of the intersection in this row must have same color.
    Record the row index of this line.

3.  **Locate Intersection:** The intersection point is the cell where the identified vertical and horizontal lines meet (same row and column).

4.  **Create Yellow Frame:** If both a vertical line and a horizontal line have been found, create a yellow (color 4) frame around the intersection point. This frame consists of cells directly to the left and right of the vertical line, located:
    *   One row *above* the intersection row.
    *   On the intersection row itself.
    *   One row *below* the intersection row.

5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure that all cells that are *not* part of the yellow frame and vertical line keep their original colors. The color and placement of the vertical line must be preserved.
