It's the focus of the transformation.\n*   **Horizontal Object:** There's a horizontal object (a row of the same color) crossing/intersecting the vertical line.\n*   **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to center around the intersection of the vertical line and the horizontal object, creating a new frame around the intersection point.\n*   **New Color:** A new color ('4', yellow) is introduced in the output, framing elements of intersection.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
