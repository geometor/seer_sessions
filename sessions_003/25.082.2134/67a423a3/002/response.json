However, it has several shortcomings:\n\n1.  **Incomplete Frame:** The code doesn't consistently create the full frame around the intersection point. Specifically, example 3 reveals that the yellow frame should extend above *and* below the intersecting horizontal line, not *just* below. Example 1, we can now determine does *not* have a horizontal line since the potential line has the vertical line's color.\n2.  **Incorrect Horizontal Line Detection:** The current `find_horizontal_line` function has issues. It seeks colors that *are not* zero and *not* the vertical line color. This seems overly restrictive and may cause it to miss valid horizontal lines or incorrectly identify them, as seen especially in the first training example.\n3. No test for test input.\n\nThe primary strategy is to refine the framing logic to correctly handle the extension above and below the intersection, correct the horizontal line identification, and make the framing dependent of it.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution)**\n\nBecause we do not have access to interactive code execution to dynamically analyze the grids, I can only perform a static analysis with assumptions.\n\n**YAML Fact Base**\n\n"

Note the color and column index. If no such line exists, return the original grid.\n\n2.  **Find Horizontal Line:** Identify a horizontal line. A horizontal line exists on a row that intersects the vertical line, is not the same color as the vertical line, and has at least one other pixel that is not color 0.\n\n3.  **Locate Intersection:** The intersection is the point where the vertical and horizontal lines meet (share the same row and column indices).\n\n4.  **Create Frame (Conditional):** If a horizontal line exists, create a yellow (color 4) frame around the intersection *only* on the cells adjacent to the vertical line. This frame extends:\n    *   One row above the intersection.\n    *   On the intersection row itself.\n    *   One row below the intersection.\n\n5.  **Preserve Unchanged Pixels:** Pixels not part of the vertical line or the frame (if it exists) should remain unchanged. Specifically, the vertical line's color should be preserved.\n"
