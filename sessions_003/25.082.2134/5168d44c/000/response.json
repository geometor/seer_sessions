The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement or shifting of colored blocks within the grid.  The key colors involved appear to be red (2), green (3), and white/blank (0). The shape and size of connected regions of the same color change between the input and output. There appears to be a vertical element to the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
