objects:
  - color: green (3)
    behavior: "Moves to the top of the grid, but green objects will stack and fill from the original rows upward."
    constraints: "Stops moving upwards when reaching the top edge or another green object."
  - color: red (2)
    behavior: "Moves as a unit, its position is dependent on the green object."
    constraints: "Positions itself directly above the green object, maintaining its original shape. If there's no space, it's skipped."

actions:
  - move_green: "Green objects are moved upwards, filling empty spaces and merging."
  - move_red: "Red objects are repositioned based on the final position of green objects. Red object does not overlap green"
