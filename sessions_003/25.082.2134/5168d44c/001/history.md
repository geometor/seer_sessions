Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement or shifting of colored blocks within the grid.  The key colors involved appear to be red (2), green (3), and white/blank (0). The shape and size of connected regions of the same color change between the input and output. There appears to be a vertical element to the transformation.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_block
    type: contiguous_region
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - shape: variable
      - size: variable
      - position: variable

  - name: green_pixel
    type: single_cell
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - position: variable

  - name: blank_space
    type: contiguous_region
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - shape: variable
      - size: variable
      - position: variable

actions:
  - name: shift_up
    description: Move a block or pixel upwards within the grid.
  - name: coalesce:
    description: combine multiple like colored contiguous pixels

relationships:
  - red_block and green_pixel can be adjacent.
  - blank_space fills the remaining areas of the grid.
  - vertical_position: describes the location in a grid where lower index is higher than a larger index

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of red (2) pixels, green (3) pixels, and white/blank (0) pixels.
2.  **Prioritize Green:**  Isolate the green pixels.
3.  **Vertical Shift (Green):** Move all green pixels upwards as far as possible, stopping when they reach the top edge of the grid or encounter another non-white pixel.
4.  **Vertical Shift (red):** shift the red block down, stopping when the top most pixel is one row above the original top most position
5. **Consolidate:** coalesce adjacent same color cells to be connected

Essentially, the green pixels "float" to the top, and red blocks move, while blank spaces adjust to accommodate these movements.
