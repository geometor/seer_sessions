observations:
  - example_1:
      objects:
        - color: 2  # Red
          shape: Rectangle
          initial_position: Top Row 2, extends to row 4
          action: Move to row below the green object after green object has moved
        - color: 3  # Green
          shape: Dispersed, multiple single-cell objects
          initial_position: Row 3
          action: Move to the top, filling empty (0) cells. Merge with any encountered green.
      grid_size: 7 x 13
      transformation_type: Object Movement and Placement
  - example_2:
      objects:
        - color: 2
          shape: Rectangle
          initial_position:  Rows 3-5
          action: Move down to occupy the space immediately following green
        - color: 3
          shape: Single-cell and multi-cell objects
          initial_position: Rows 0, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12
          action: Move upward filling empty cells and merging
      grid_size: 13 x 7
      transformation_type: Object Movement and Placement
  - example_3:
      objects:
      - color: 2
        shape: Rectangle
        initial_position: row 1-3
        action: Move to just below green.
      - color: 3
        shape: multiple single cells
        initial_position: row 0, row 4, row 6
        action: Move to fill available cells at top.
      grid_size: 7x7
      transformation_type: Object Movement and Placement

general_rules:
  - Green objects move to the top-most available rows, filling any blank (0) cells above their initial positions.
  - If multiple green objects have overlapping columns, they merge during the upward movement.
  - After green objects have moved, red objects move.
  - Red objects position themselves directly below the green objects. If there are no green object, they remain at the top.
  - Blank cells are represented by 0.
