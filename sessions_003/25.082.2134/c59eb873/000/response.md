Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels.
*   The output grids appear to be a scaled-up version of the input grids.
*   The scaling seems to be uniform, meaning both dimensions (height and width) are scaled by the same factor.
*   Each pixel in the input grid seems to map to a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - content: integers (representing colors)
    relationships:
      - input_grid: maps_to -> output_grid

transformations:
  - action: scale_up
    properties:
      - factor: 2
      - method: duplicate_each_pixel_to_2x2_block
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Receive the input grid.
2.  **Scaling:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Create a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid.
    *   Set the color (value) of all pixels in the 2x2 block to the color of the original pixel.
3.  **Output:** The expanded grid created by the scaling operations. The output grid is twice as tall and twice as wide.

In simpler terms, double input's height and width. Every cell in the input maps to 2x2 of the same color.
