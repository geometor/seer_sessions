Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels.\n*   The output grids appear to be a scaled-up version of the input grids.\n*   The scaling seems to be uniform, meaning both dimensions (height and width) are scaled by the same factor.\n*   Each pixel in the input grid seems to map to a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
