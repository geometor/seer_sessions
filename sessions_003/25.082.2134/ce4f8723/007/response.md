1.  **Input:** The task involves two input grids, `input_grid_1` and `input_grid_2`, and produces one output grid, `output_grid`.
2.  **Output Dimensions:** The `output_grid` has the same dimensions (height and width) as `input_grid_1`.
3. **Input_2 Role:** Consider `input_grid_2` to indicate where to apply a fill operation of green to the grid.
4.  **Transformation:** The `output_grid` is created by taking the dimensions of the first input grid, `input_grid_1`. Where ever `input_grid_2` contains a non-white (red and yellow) pixel, replace those pixels on the output grid with green, ignoring white. The non-green pixels in the output take their values directly from the first input.
5. **Output** Return the output grid.
