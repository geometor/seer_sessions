objects:
  - name: input_grid_1
    type: grid
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - shape: rectangular (rows x columns)

  - name: input_grid_2
    type: grid
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - shape: rectangular (rows x columns)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - shape: rectangular (rows x columns), same as input_grid_1

actions:
  - name: transform
    input: [input_grid_1, input_grid_2]
    output: output_grid
    description: Modifies input_grid_1 based on input_grid_2 to produce output_grid.
    rules:
      - condition: "If input_grid_2 has a value of 4 at position (r, c), and input_grid_1 has a value different than 3 at (r,c), then output_grid at (r, c) is 3."
      - condition: "If input_grid_2 has a value of 2 at position (r, c), and input_grid_1 has a value different than 3 at (r,c), then output_grid at (r, c) is 3."
      - condition: "If input_grid_2 has a value of 0 at position (r, c), and input_grid_1 has a value different than 3 at (r,c), then output_grid at (r, c) is 3."
      - condition: "Otherwise, the output_grid at (r,c) takes the value of input_grid_1"
