1.  **Initialization:** The `output_grid` has the same dimensions as `input_grid_1`.
2.  **Transformation Rule:** Iterate through each cell position (r, c) of both input grids.
    *   If the value of `input_grid_2` at (r, c) is 4, 2, or 0, *and* the value of `input_grid_1` at (r,c) is different than 3: change the corresponding cell in the `output_grid` at (r, c) to 3 (green).
    * Otherwise the value at (r,c) in `output_grid` takes the value of `input_grid_1` at (r,c).
3.  **Output:** The `output_grid` is the result of the transformation.
