The first grid appears to be the primary subject of transformation, while the second grid seems to act as a kind of filter or mask. The output grid is a modified version of the first input grid, with certain pixels changed to the color green (value 3). The dimensions of the output grid always match the dimensions of the first input grid. The second input grid's dimensions are variable and not necessarily matching to the first.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Positions where `input_grid_2` has isolated colors (no 2x2 block with same color) are used to decide where to convert in the first grid to green.\n"
