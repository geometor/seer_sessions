The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the two input grids: `input_grid_1` and `input_grid_2`.
2. Create output grid: the `output_grid` will have same shape as `input_grid_1`.
3. Locate trigger in second grid: identify cells that are NOT on a 2x2 block of the SAME color in `input_grid_2`.
4. Iterate through `input_grid_1` using location.
5. Conditional Replacement: For each cell in `input_grid_1`, change the pixel to green (value 3) if the cell location from step 4 evaluate to true.
6. Other pixels: pixels are set to value 0 in `output_grid` if not set in the previous step.
