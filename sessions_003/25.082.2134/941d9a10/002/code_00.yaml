objects:
  - id: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the input and output data.
  - id: gray_lines
    type: horizontal_lines
    color: gray (5)
    property: Completely filled with gray pixels.
    role: Separators dividing the grid into sections.
  - id: black_pixels
    type: pixels
    color: black (0)
    property: Contiguous groups.
    role: Subject to color transformation based on section.
  - id: section_top
    type: region
    boundary:
      top: Top of grid
      bottom: First gray line
    transformation: Change contiguous black pixels in the reference row to blue (1)
  - id: section_middle
    type: region
    boundary:
      top: First gray line + 1
      bottom: Second gray line (or bottom of the grid)
    transformation: Change contiguous black pixels in the reference row to red (2)
  - id: section_bottom
    type: region
    boundary:
      top: Second gray line + 1
      bottom: Bottom of grid
    transformation: Change contiguous black pixels in the reference row to green (3)
  - id: reference_row_top
    type: row
