            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code correctly identifies the horizontal gray lines and uses them as separators to divide the grid into sections. However, it incorrectly assumes that all black pixels within each section should be changed to the designated color (blue, red, or green). The examples show that only contiguous black pixels *starting from a specific point, possibly the left edge, in a reference row for each section* are changed. It is also making mistakes about which contiguous black pixels to transform - getting this wrong in all three examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Improve Contiguous Pixel Identification:** Instead of changing all black pixels in a section, the code needs to identify *contiguous* groups of black pixels. It appears the groups that are transformed have a specific relationship to the position of other pixels in the grid.\n2.  **Refine Section Logic:** The code should find horizontal lines correctly, and make three regions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere, I'll analyze each example to extract some metrics. I can see that pixels are off, but not precisely why.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input Shape: 10x10\n*   Gray Rows: \\[3, 7]\n*   Pixels Off: 42. The transformed output changes all 0s to 1s, 2s, or 3s based on the gray rows, which is too broad.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input Shape: 10x10\n*   Gray Rows: \\[1, 3, 7]\n*    Pixels Off: 44. Similar issue as Example 1. The transformed output changes too many 0s in each section.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   Input Shape: 10x10\n*   Gray Rows: \\[3, 6]\n*   Pixels Off: 40. Similar issue.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"
