The most prominent element is the consistent presence of gray (5) pixels in both input and output.  The output grids introduce new colors (blue (1), red (2), and green (3)) in specific locations relative to the gray pixels. The transformation appears to be localized and dependent on the position of grey (5) pixels and potentially rows. It seems like a pattern of insertion of new colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If there is a second all-5-row skip.\n4. **Bottom Section Transformation:** In the section *below* the second all-grey row, all the black(0) pixels that follow groups of zeros separated with grey(5) on last all-5 row will be changed to green (3) pixels.\n5.  **Preserve Gray Pixels:** All gray (5) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\nIn other word, the black pixels in the bounding box defined by columns with grey(5) pixels are colored based on which area they are between all-5-rows.\n"
