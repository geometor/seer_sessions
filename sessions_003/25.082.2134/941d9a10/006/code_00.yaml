objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - name: separator_row
    type: row
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      all_cells_same_color: true
  - name: section
    type: region of grid
    properties:
      defined_by: separator rows
      types: [top, middle, bottom]
  - name: reference_row
    type: row
    properties:
      location:
        top: first row
        middle: row immediately after first separator row
        bottom: row immediately after second separator row
  - name: contiguous_black_pixels
    type: set of cells
    properties:
      color: black (0)
      location: within reference row
      contiguity: horizontally adjacent

actions:
  - name: identify_separator_rows
    input: grid
    output: list of row indices
  - name: define_sections
    input: grid, separator_row indices
    output: top, middle, bottom sections
  - name: identify_reference_rows
    input: sections
    output: reference row for each section
  - name: find_contiguous_black_pixels
    input: reference row
    output: set of column indices
  - name: transform_pixels
    input: section, contiguous_black_pixels_columns
    logic: |
      For each section (top, middle, bottom):
        - Identify the corresponding reference row.
        - Find contiguous sets of black pixels in the reference row.
        - For each contiguous set of black pixels in ref row
          - Change the color of black pixels in the same columns within the section.
            - Top section: Change to blue (1).
            - Middle section: Change to red (2).
            - Bottom section: Change to green (3).
        - any black pixels on the ref row that is not part of a group remains
          black
        - all other pixels remain the same
    output: transformed section
