            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe code correctly identifies the gray separator rows and uses them to divide the grid into sections. It also correctly identifies contiguous black pixels in the reference rows. However, the transformation logic within each section is flawed. It appears to be coloring *all* black pixels in the section based on the reference row, rather than only those in the same columns as the contiguous black pixels in the reference row. The strategy to fix this will involve modifying the inner loops to iterate only over the relevant columns identified by `find_contiguous_black_columns`. The provided results are not great - none of the examples matched.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**\n\nI don't think there is a need for code execution in this situation. The results of running the code on each of the examples is clear and can be easily reviewed without additional tools.\n\n**Example Review**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The transformation incorrectly changes all black pixels to the section's color. For the top section all 0's are transformed to 1's, not just the 0's at the start.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, all black pixels within a section are transformed, not just those aligned with contiguous black pixels in the corresponding reference row. A full assessment across all sections is needed.\n*   **Example 3:** Shows the same fundamental error as the previous examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
