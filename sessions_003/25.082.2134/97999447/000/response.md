Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program description of the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements**

The task involves 2D grids with single-digit integer values (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to operate on rows containing non-zero single pixels. The transformation expands these single pixels horizontally. A new color (gray, represented by 5) is introduced between the expanded original colors.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (MxN)
      - cells: contain integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer (0-9)
      - location: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: horizontal_expansion
    description: Expands a single non-zero pixel in a row to the right, inserting a gray pixel (5) between each expansion.
    conditions:
      - The row contains only one non-zero pixel.

relationships:
  - original_pixel: The initial non-zero pixel.
  - expanded_pixels: The pixels resulting from the horizontal expansion.
  - inserted_pixel: The gray pixel (5) inserted between the expanded pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the current row contains exactly one non-zero pixel.
3.  **If** the condition in step 2 is true, perform the following:
    a. **Locate** the non-zero pixel and note its color.
    b. **Expand**: Starting from original position extend the pixel to the end of the row.
    c. **Insert** gray pixel (5) between each expansion, where index i + 1 is a 5.
4.  **If** the condition in step 2 is false, leave the row unchanged.
5. **Return** the resulting grid.
