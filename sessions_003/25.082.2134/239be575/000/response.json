It seems that the color that forms a straight line might be chosen.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Check if the white (0) pixels form a single, unbroken, straight line across either any rows or columns.**\n6.  **If white (0) pixels do form such a line, the output is 0.**\n7.  **If neither of these conditions above are met, the task should determine a different transformation rule. (In this data set, that is not the case).**\n\n**Reasoning for the Natural Language Program**\nI looked for how the input becomes the output. I began with counting and basic geometric operations. When these failed to yield a program I considered that the output always appeared in the input. So, the output is a selection operation of the color.\n\nThe natural language program prioritizes finding a straight line of color '8' (azure) first. If present, it's the output. Only if a straight line of 8's isn't present does it look for a straight line of 0 (white), it is the selected output. The color red (2) does not appear to play any role in the output.\n"
