description: >
  The input grid contains a vertical line of blue (1) pixels.  The output grid
  is always 5x3.  The output grid contains azure (8) pixels in specific
  configurations, apparently derived from the position of the blue line
  in the input grid. The number of 8's depends on the number of blue pixels.
  The arrangement is not a simple adjacency fill.
