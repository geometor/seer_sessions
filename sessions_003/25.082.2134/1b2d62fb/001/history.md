Okay, I'm ready to analyze these examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 2D grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The output is also a 2D grid of integers, seemingly derived from the input grid.
*   The digit '1' (blue) seems to be a significant marker or separator in all input grids.
*   The digit '9' (maroon) is very common in the input, and seems to largely be removed in the output.
*   The output grids consist almost entirely of '0' (white), with some '8' (azure) appearing.
*    The location of the 8s is somehow related to the 1 in the input.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - contains_separator: 1 # Blue pixel
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0, 8)
    properties:
      - dimensions: same height and width as input_grid
      - mostly_empty: True # Contains mostly 0 (white)
  - action: replace_value
    input_value: 9 # Maroon
    output_value: 0 # White
    description: Replace all instances of 9 with 0.
  - action: replace_value_adjacent
    input_value: 0 # White
    output_value: 8 # Azure
    condition: "adjacent to 1 in input, excluding the 1"
    description: Replace 0 with 8 based on adjacency to 1 in the input grid.
  - relationship: adjacency
    element1: 0 #White
    element2: 1 #Blue
    property: "cardinal directions only (up, down, left, right)" in input, dictates placement of 8
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid identical in dimensions to the input grid, initially filled with 0s (white).

2.  **Copy and Replace 9s:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. copy all non-9 values and place them as 0 in the output grid

3.  **Identify Markers:** Find the cell containing the value '1' (blue) in the input grid.

4.  **Transform Based on Adjacency:** In the *input* grid, locate all cells that contain '0' (white) and are *directly adjacent* (up, down, left, or right, but *not* diagonally) to the '1' (blue) cell.

5.  **Apply Transformation:** For each cell identified in step 4, change the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to '8' (azure).

6. Because the `1` (blue) has now been copied as `0` (white) and adjacent 0s
   become 8s (azure). The 1 is "transformed" to zero.
