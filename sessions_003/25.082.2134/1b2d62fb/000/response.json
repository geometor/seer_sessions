Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input is a 2D grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The output is also a 2D grid of integers, seemingly derived from the input grid.\n*   The digit '1' (blue) seems to be a significant marker or separator in all input grids.\n*   The digit '9' (maroon) is very common in the input, and seems to largely be removed in the output.\n*   The output grids consist almost entirely of '0' (white), with some '8' (azure) appearing.\n*    The location of the 8s is somehow related to the 1 in the input.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
