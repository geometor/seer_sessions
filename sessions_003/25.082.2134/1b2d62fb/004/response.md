Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a single example and made a significant, incorrect assumption: that the '8's should be placed in the output grid in the *same relative positions* as they appeared in the (modified) input grid.  The test results clearly show this is wrong. The output grid is consistently 5x3, and the '8's are placed based on a different rule related to their *order of discovery*, not their original input location. The core logic of identifying '1's as markers and changing adjacent '0's to '8's is correct, but the placement of the '8's in the output is flawed. The strategy should focus on gathering the '8' values created and place those into a specific location in the output grid.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Decouple Identification and Placement:** Separate the process of *finding* where '8's should be (which the current code does well) from the process of *placing* them in the output grid.
2.  **Ordered Placement:** Implement a clear, consistent rule for placing the '8's in the 5x3 output. Observation suggests a top-to-bottom, left-to-right fill.
3.  **Counter for 8's:** Introduce a mechanism to correctly count number of 8's discovered so that they can be assigned correctly in the output grid.

**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using code execution):**

I need to confirm my hypothesis about the order of the '8's in the output.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Example data (replace with actual data from each example)
expected_outputs = [
    np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0]]),
    np.array([[0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),
    np.array([[0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0]]),
    np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8]]),
    np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0]])
]

def analyze_output(expected_output):
    rows, cols = expected_output.shape
    eight_positions = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if expected_output[r, c] == 8:
                eight_positions.append((r, c))
    return eight_positions

for i, expected_output in enumerate(expected_outputs):
    positions = analyze_output(expected_output)
    print(f"Example {i+1}: 8 positions: {positions}")


```
```
Example 1: 8 positions: [(3, 1), (3, 2)]
Example 2: 8 positions: [(0, 1), (0, 2)]
Example 3: 8 positions: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0)]
Example 4: 8 positions: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)]
Example 5: 8 positions: [(3, 1), (3, 2)]

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:**  Receive an input grid of arbitrary dimensions containing integer values from 0 to 9.
2.  **Marker Identification:** Locate all cells within the input grid that have a value of '1' (these are the "markers").
3.  **Adjacent Transformation:** For each marker, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right). If a neighboring cell has a value of '0', change that cell's value to '8'.
4. **Output Initialization:** Create an output grid that is 5 rows by 3 columns, filled entirely with '0's.
5.  **Ordered Output Population:** Traverse the *modified* input grid and identify all the cells where the value is 8. Then add those 8s in order to a list, from top-to-bottom, and left-to-right. Finally, fill the 5x3 output grid with the '8' values found. The '8's are placed in the output grid in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with '0'.
6.  **Output:** Return the 5x3 output grid.
