The test results clearly show this is wrong. The output grid is consistently 5x3, and the '8's are placed based on a different rule related to their *order of discovery*, not their original input location. The core logic of identifying '1's as markers and changing adjacent '0's to '8's is correct, but the placement of the '8's in the output is flawed. The strategy should focus on gathering the '8' values created and place those into a specific location in the output grid.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Decouple Identification and Placement:** Separate the process of *finding* where '8's should be (which the current code does well) from the process of *placing* them in the output grid.\n2.  **Ordered Placement:** Implement a clear, consistent rule for placing the '8's in the 5x3 output. Observation suggests a top-to-bottom, left-to-right fill.\n3.  **Counter for 8's:** Introduce a mechanism to correctly count number of 8's discovered so that they can be assigned correctly in the output grid.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using code execution):**\n\nI need to confirm my hypothesis about the order of the '8's in the output.\n\n"
