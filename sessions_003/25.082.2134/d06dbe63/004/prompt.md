1.  **Find the Seed:** Locate the single azure (8) pixel within the input grid. This pixel remains unchanged in the output.
2.  **Top-Left Quadrant:** Fill the rectangular region defined by the top-left corner of the grid (0,0) and the row and column of the seed pixel with grey(5) pixels.
3. **Downward extension:** From the azure pixel, create a gray (5) pixel directly below it.
4.  **Bottom-Right Diagonal:** Extend gray (5) pixels diagonally down and to the right of the seed pixel. The extent and specific pattern are irregular and defined as follows:
    a. One gray pixel is placed to the right of the seed pixel.
    b. From there, the gray pixels are extended downwards by one every three rows.
    c. The gray pixels are extended to the right by one every three columns.
