           The gray region starts directly adjacent to the seed.
           In example 1, it extends upwards and left, and right and down,
           with the top edge of the shape aligned with the seed row.
           In example 2, the left most edge of the filled area is the final column,
           and the gray region extends downwards and right, and left and up
           with the right most edge aligned with the seed column
      - diagonal_extension: "Extends diagonally down and right from the seed pixel, one pixel at a time, forming an irregular shape bound by the edges of the grid."
