Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (13x13 in both examples).\n*   The grids contain numerical values representing colors, predominantly 0 (white), with a single 8 (azure) in the input and multiple 5s (gray) and a single 8 in the output.\n*   The position of the 8 (azure) pixel seems to be the focal point of the transformation.\n*   The output seems to be generating a pattern of 5 (gray) pixels around the location of the original 8.\n*   The pattern isn't a simple square or circle; it expands and contracts in different directions.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
