Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (13x13 in both examples).
*   The grids contain numerical values representing colors, predominantly 0 (white), with a single 8 (azure) in the input and multiple 5s (gray) and a single 8 in the output.
*   The position of the 8 (azure) pixel seems to be the focal point of the transformation.
*   The output seems to be generating a pattern of 5 (gray) pixels around the location of the original 8.
*   The pattern isn't a simple square or circle; it expands and contracts in different directions.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 13x13
      values: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - azure (8)
        - gray (5)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: identify_seed
    description: Locate the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid.
  - name: generate_pattern
    description: Create a gray (5) pattern around the seed pixel, radiating outwards.
  - name: change_color
    description: Change some of the white color to grey.
  - name: maintain original
    description: copy the orginal azure pixel to its original position

relationships:
  - seed_to_pattern: The azure pixel acts as the seed for the gray pattern generation.
  - spatial: The gray pattern is spatially related to the position of the seed pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed:** Find the location (row, column) of the single azure (8) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Maintain original**: copy the azure pixel to the same position in the output grid.
3.  **Generate Pattern (Top-Left):**
    *   From the seed pixel's position, move upwards and add grey pixels until a white border is reached (row 0).
    *   From the seed pixel location, move upwards and left and add grey until a white border is reached.
    *   From the seed pixel's position, move left and add grey pixels until a white border is reached.

4.  **Generate Pattern (Bottom Right)**
    *   From the seed position, move right, and add gray until the column is a multiple of 3 + 1.
    *   From those new grey pixels, move downwards and fill with gray until row % 3 + 1 == 1.
5.  **Filling Phase.**
    *   Fill in grey pixels between other grey pixels connected by the new gray pixels.
6.  **Copy result** The result becomes the output.
