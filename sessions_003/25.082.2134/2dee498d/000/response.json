Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The transformation seems to be a reduction in the size of the grid, specifically removing columns. The core task appears to be identifying which columns to keep and which to discard. The spatial arrangement within the kept columns, and their values, stay the same, as does the number of rows.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
