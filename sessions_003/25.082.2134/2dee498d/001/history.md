Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The transformation seems to be a reduction in the size of the grid, specifically removing columns. The core task appears to be identifying which columns to keep and which to discard. The spatial arrangement within the kept columns, and their values, stay the same, as does the number of rows.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: column_reduction
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - rows: consistent between input and output
      - columns: reduced in output compared to input
actions:
  - name: column_selection
    description: Selects specific columns from the input grid.
  - name: column_removal
    description: Removes columns that are not selected.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of pixels within the selected columns remain constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Repeating Columns:** Examine the input grid and identify columns that repeat sequentially. In other words, look for sequences of identical columns.
2.  **Keep First Instance:** Keep only the first instance of each repeating column, and discard the rest.
3.  **Construct Output:** form the output grid.

Essentially, the transformation rule is to remove duplicate, adjacent columns, retaining only the first occurrence of each unique column.
