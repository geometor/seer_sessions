Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.  The input grids transform into different output grids. The key seems to be the diagonal lines of non-zero numbers and how they interact with other non-zero pixels, particularly '5's.  The size of the grid is consistent within each example (10x10), but might vary between tasks (although we haven't seen that yet).  The crucial color changes appear to revolve around specific colors and their positions relative to the main diagonal.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: diagonal
    properties:
      - direction: top-left to bottom-right
      - color: varies (7, 9, 2 in the examples)

actions:
  - name: mirror_diagonal
    description:  Pixels of the primary color along the main diagonal are mirrored across the grid, creating a new diagonal from the bottom-left to the top-right.
  - name: remove_adjacent
    description: Pixels of a secondary color (like 5) adjacent to the primary diagonal, or its mirror, are removed.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonally).
  - type: diagonal_member
    description: A pixel is a member of the diagonal if it lies on the top-left to bottom-right line.
  - type: mirrored_position
    description:  For a pixel at (r, c), its mirrored position is (c, r).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Primary Diagonal:** Find the diagonal line of pixels running from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the input grid. Note the color of these pixels (the "primary color").

2.  **Mirror the Diagonal:** Create a mirrored diagonal by placing pixels of the primary color at positions that are reflections of the original diagonal across the center of the grid. Specifically, if a pixel on the main diagonal is at position (row, column), place a pixel of the same color at (column, row).

3.  **Remove Adjacent Secondary Colors:** Any pixels *not* of the primary color that are *horizontally or vertically* adjacent to either the original diagonal or the mirrored diagonal are set to 0 (white). In other words, remove any secondary color pixels that "touch" the main diagonal or its reflection.

4. **Output result:** The resulting grid is the output.
