objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: diagonal
    properties:
      - direction: top-left to bottom-right
      - color: varies (7, 9, 2 in the examples)

actions:
  - name: mirror_diagonal
    description:  Pixels of the primary color along the main diagonal are mirrored across the grid, creating a new diagonal from the bottom-left to the top-right.
  - name: remove_adjacent
    description: Pixels of a secondary color (like 5) adjacent to the primary diagonal, or its mirror, are removed.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonally).
  - type: diagonal_member
    description: A pixel is a member of the diagonal if it lies on the top-left to bottom-right line.
  - type: mirrored_position
    description:  For a pixel at (r, c), its mirrored position is (c, r).
