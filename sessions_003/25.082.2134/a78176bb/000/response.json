The input grids transform into different output grids. The key seems to be the diagonal lines of non-zero numbers and how they interact with other non-zero pixels, particularly '5's.  The size of the grid is consistent within each example (10x10), but might vary between tasks (although we haven't seen that yet).  The crucial color changes appear to revolve around specific colors and their positions relative to the main diagonal.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note the color of these pixels (the \"primary color\").\n\n2.  **Mirror the Diagonal:** Create a mirrored diagonal by placing pixels of the primary color at positions that are reflections of the original diagonal across the center of the grid. Specifically, if a pixel on the main diagonal is at position (row, column), place a pixel of the same color at (column, row).\n\n3.  **Remove Adjacent Secondary Colors:** Any pixels *not* of the primary color that are *horizontally or vertically* adjacent to either the original diagonal or the mirrored diagonal are set to 0 (white). In other words, remove any secondary color pixels that \"touch\" the main diagonal or its reflection.\n\n4. **Output result:** The resulting grid is the output.\n"
