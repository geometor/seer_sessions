"""
1.  **Identify Primary Color:** Determine the most frequent non-zero color present in the input grid. This is the "primary color".
2.  **Locate Primary Color Instances:** Find all positions (row, column) where the primary color appears in the *input* grid.
3.  **Construct Mirrored Positions:** For *each* position (r, c) where the primary color was found in the input, set the cell at (r, c) *and* the cell at (c, r) in the *output* grid to the primary color. Note: If (r,c) is the same as (c,r) this is the main diagonal, only place 1 pixel, not two in the same spot.
4.  **Remove Adjacent Colors:** Iterate through all cells in the output grid. If a cell's color is *not* the primary color, check for horizontal and vertical adjacency to *any* cell containing the primary color. If it is adjacent, set the cell's color to 0 (white).
5.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.
