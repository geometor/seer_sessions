task: a78176bb
observations:
  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, columns] # Not always square
      cells:
        - value: integer (0-9) representing color
          color_names: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
  - object_type: diagonal
    properties:
      main_diagonal:
        definition: pixels from top-left to bottom-right
        color: most_frequent_non_zero_color_on_main_diagonal
      mirrored_diagonal:
        definition: reflection of the main diagonal across the grid's center, where position (r, c) becomes (c, r)
  - action: mirroring
    description: Create a mirrored diagonal with the primary color.
  - action: removal
    description: Remove non-primary-color pixels adjacent to either diagonal.
    condition:
      adjacency: horizontal or vertical
      target: main diagonal or mirrored diagonal
