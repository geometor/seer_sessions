"""
1.  **Identify the Primary Diagonal:** Find the diagonal line of pixels running from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the input grid. Note the color of these pixels (the "primary color").

2.  **Mirror the Diagonal:** Create a mirrored diagonal by placing pixels of the primary color at positions that are reflections of the original diagonal across the center of the grid. Specifically, if a pixel on the main diagonal is at position (row, column), place a pixel of the same color at (column, row).

3.  **Remove Adjacent Secondary Colors:** Any pixels *not* of the primary color that are *horizontally or vertically* adjacent to either the original diagonal or the mirrored diagonal are set to 0 (white). In other words, remove any secondary color pixels that "touch" the main diagonal or its reflection.

4. **Output result:** The resulting grid is the output.
