The primary objects appear to be contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve the selective repositioning or duplication of specific colored objects (specifically, the gray (5) and red (2) blocks). The positions of the gray blocks and their relationship to the red blocks seems to be the key.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
