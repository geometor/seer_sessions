Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pairs, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), where each digit represents a color. The primary objects appear to be contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve the selective repositioning or duplication of specific colored objects (specifically, the gray (5) and red (2) blocks). The positions of the gray blocks and their relationship to the red blocks seems to be the key.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_types:
      - color_block:
          properties:
            - color: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
            - shape: contiguous_block
            - position: [row, column]
  - transformations:
    - type: reposition
      conditions:
        - object_color: gray
        - relative_position: "The gray pixel seems to move relative to its nearest object or the red pixel"
    - type: possible_duplication:
      conditions:
        - object_color: gray
  - relationships:
      - spatial: "Gray objects (5) and red objects (2) show a specific spatial relationship that drives their positioning, possibly related to duplication and relative positioning"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all gray (5) and red (2) colored contiguous blocks within the input grid.

2.  **Gray Object Relocation:** For each gray object, find if is there any red pixels exist in the input grid.
    *   If so, check if the horizontal position (column index) of the gray (5) pixel matches any of the red pixels' column. If not, it's put next to the boundary created by the red pixels on the column matching side where the gray pixel exist.
    *   If not, find the row index of the gray(5) pixel, put the gray (5) pixel into next column of the same row index.

3.  **Output:** Construct the output grid with the repositioned or duplicated gray objects, keeping all other elements unchanged.
