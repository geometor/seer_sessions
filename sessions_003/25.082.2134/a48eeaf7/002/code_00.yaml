examples:
  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - color: gray (5)
        initial_positions: [(0, 3), (3, 8), (7, 7)]
        final_positions:  [(2,3), (3, 5), (5,5)]
        action: reposition
      - color: red (2)
        initial_positions: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)]
        final_positions: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)]
        action: static
    transformation: "Gray pixels move to be adjacent to the closest red pixel, prioritizing horizontal adjacency. If there's no red pixel in the column of the gray, it will shift as required to be adjacent"
    notes: gray repositions to be with reds,

    objects:
      - color: gray (5)
        initial_positions: [(0, 8), (3, 0), (6, 9), (8, 5)]
        final_positions:  [(1,7), (3, 4), (4, 5),(4,7)]
        action: reposition
      - color: red (2)
        initial_positions: [(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6)]
        final_positions: [(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6)]
        action: static
    transformation: "Gray pixels reposition to be horizontally adjacent to the nearest red pixel, and vertically if necessary"
    notes: gray repositions to horizontally adjacent first,
