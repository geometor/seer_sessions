The transformation rule repositions gray (5) pixels relative to red (2) pixels. If a gray pixel is not in the same column as any red pixel, it's moved to the next column, maintaining its row. If it is in the same column, it seems to create a copy next to the red, or get repositioned according to some more complex logic that will be iterated.
