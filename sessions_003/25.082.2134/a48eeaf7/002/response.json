            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of repositioning gray pixels relative to red pixels. However, the test results reveal inaccuracies in handling different scenarios, particularly when gray pixels are in the same column as red pixels, or at the edges of the grid. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification of the \"repositioning\" logic. It's not just about moving to the \"next\" column, but a more context-aware placement relative to the *nearest* red pixel, and possibly involving some wrapping or boundary condition.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatched Pixels:** Carefully examine the `pixels_off` in each example. Identify *where* the gray pixels are placed incorrectly and *why* the current logic fails.\n2.  **Refine \"Nearest Red\" Logic:** The current code finds the nearest red overall, but needs more detail. Is the new position to the immediate left or right? Are there cases where the row matters, not just the column?\n3.  **Edge Cases:** Explicitly consider cases where gray pixels are at the grid boundaries. Should they \"wrap around\" or be constrained?\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Update the natural language program and code incrementally. Test after each significant change to ensure the new logic works for *all* examples, not just one.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using previous execution results):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Gray pixel at (0,3) moved to (0,4) - should have moved to row 2 beside others.\n    *   Gray pixel at (3,8) put at (3,9)\n    *   Gray pixel at (7,7) incorrectly stays at (7,7) - should be in row 5\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Gray at (0,8) incorrectly stays in row 0\n    *   Gray at (3,0) incorrectly placed at(3,2)\n    *   Gray at (6,9) goes away.\n    *   Gray at (8,5) incorrectly placed\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
