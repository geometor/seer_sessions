example_1:
  input:
    red_objects: 1
    gray_objects: 3 #incorrect assumption in original program - should be 3
    gray_object_positions: [[0,3], [3,8], [7,7]] #from input, needs to be dynamic
    red_object_positions: [[3,3], [3,4], [4,3], [4,4]] #from input
  output:
     gray_object_positions: [[2,3], [3,5], [4, 5]]
     notes: >
        gray objects relocate adjacent to closest red object. Preference for above, then to either
        side. Gray objects will shift to accommodate proximity.

example_2:
  input:
    red_objects: 1
    gray_objects: 4
    gray_object_positions:  [[0, 8], [3, 1], [6, 9], [8, 5]]
    red_object_positions: [[2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 5], [3, 6]]
  output:
     gray_object_positions:  [[1, 7], [3, 4], [4, 7], [4, 5]] #corrected
