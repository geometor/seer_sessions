Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are grids of varying sizes, containing digits 0-9, representing different colors.
*   The outputs are also grids, but consistently smaller than the inputs and primarily containing 0 (white) and 3 (green).
*   The digit '1' (blue) appears consistently in the same column in all input examples. This column seems pivotal.
*   The output grids seem to be a 3xN extraction, using the '1' column area as the only place the value is not '0'

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains_digits: 0-9
      - variable_size: true
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains_digits: [0, 3]
      - smaller_than_input: true
  - object: key_column
    type: column
    properties:
      - contains_digit: 1
      - consistent_location: true # Across all input examples
  - transformation: extraction
    description: A smaller grid is extracted based on the key column.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
  - rule: constant value other than key
    description: other than the key column, the other values are all 0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Key Column:** Find the column in the input grid that consistently contains the digit '1' (blue).
2.  **Extract Output Grid:** Create a new grid. The height is the same as the input. The width is always 3.
3.  **Populate values:** For each row in the input
    *   Locate the key column (value of '1')
    *   If a cell is in same row and is one column to the left, same column, or one column to the right relative to the key column
        * set the coresponding cell in the output to be '3' (green)
    *   Otherwise
        *   set value to '0' (white)

In essence, the transformation extracts a 3-column wide section of the input grid, centered around the column containing '1', and changes the extracted values to '3' (green) while setting all other cells in the output grid to '0' (white).
