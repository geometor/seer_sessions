This column seems pivotal.\n*   The output grids seem to be a 3xN extraction, using the '1' column area as the only place the value is not '0'\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The height is the same as the input. The width is always 3.\n3.  **Populate values:** For each row in the input\n    *   Locate the key column (value of '1')\n    *   If a cell is in same row and is one column to the left, same column, or one column to the right relative to the key column\n        * set the coresponding cell in the output to be '3' (green)\n    *   Otherwise\n        *   set value to '0' (white)\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts a 3-column wide section of the input grid, centered around the column containing '1', and changes the extracted values to '3' (green) while setting all other cells in the output grid to '0' (white).\n"
