objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - key_column: column containing the value '1'
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0 or 3)
      - dimensions: (number of rows in input_grid, 3)

actions:
  - name: find_key_column
    input: input_grid
    output: index of the key column
    description: Locates the column containing '1'.
  - name: transform_row
    input:
      - input_grid_row
      - key_column_index
    output: output_grid_row
    description: >
      Creates a row for the output grid based on the input row and key column.
      If there is a non-zero value to the immediate left or right in the
      input_grid of a cell that has a value of 1 in the Key Column, sets the output value for the entire row to Green (3), 
      except:
      - cell in position 0 is set to Green (3) only if there is non-zero value in the input grid
      one position to the left of the cell with value 1 in Key Column
      - cell in position 1 is set to Green (3) only if there is a value 1 in the input grid Key Column
      - cell in position 2 is set to Green (3) if there is non-zero value in the input grid
      one position to the right of the cell with value 1 in Key Column.
