    input_objects:
      - description: Input grid with varying dimensions.
        properties:
          - key_column: Column containing the value '1' (blue). Always present in the inputs.
          - neighbors: Cells immediately to the left and right of the key column in each row.
          - neighbor_values: Values of the neighbor cells, which can be '0' (white) or other colors.
    output_objects:
      - description: Output grid with dimensions (number of rows of input) x 3.
        properties:
          - row_mapping: Each row in the output corresponds to a row in the input.
          - center_column:  The middle column (index 1) which may contain 3.
          - left_column: The left column (index 0) which may contain 3
          - right_column: The right column (index 2) which may contain 3
          - values: Output cells can only be '0' (white) or '3' (green).
    transformations:
      - description: Determine values of output grid based on input grid's key column and its neighbors.
        rules:
          - rule_1: >
              If the input row's key column contains '1':
                The output row's center column is '3'.
                If the left neighbor exists and is non-zero, the output row's left column is '3'.
                If the right neighbor exists and is non-zero, the output row's right column is '3'.
          - rule_2: >
              If the input row's key column does *not* contain '1':
                Output row's center column is always 0
                If the left neighbor in the input is non-zero, output left column is '3'.
                If the right neighbor in the input is non-zero, the output right column is '3'.
