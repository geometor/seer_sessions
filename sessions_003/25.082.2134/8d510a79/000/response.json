The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The primary colors involved seem to be black (0), blue (1), red (2), and grey (5). There's a consistent grey row, and other colors appear in seemingly strategic positions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple mirroring, rotation, or direct substitution of colors. It appears some elements duplicate vertically.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This row is copied unchanged to the output.\n2.  **Locate Action rows**: Identify the rows that have blue or red colors.\n3.  **Duplicate**: For any other color, copy the pixel, and add another pixel to it's right if a red or blue exits at that location to its right.\n4. **Iterate**: Perform steps 2, 3 for all rows in the Input and place them at the same index in Output.\n5. **Double the height**: Repeat the rows to double the overall height of the output.\n\nIn essence, select colored pixels are duplicated with some specific changes if they have blue or red neighbor to their right, and the entire grid's height is doubled by repeating each row.\n"
