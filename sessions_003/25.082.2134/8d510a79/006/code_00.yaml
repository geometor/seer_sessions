  - object: grey_row
    description: A row consisting entirely of grey pixels.
    action: copied_directly_to_output

  - object: non_grey_row
    description: A row with at least one non-grey pixel.
    properties:
      - pattern_duplication:  Pixels adjacent to blue or red pixels initiate a pattern.
      - pattern_propagation: The initial pattern is duplicated in subsequent rows until a row of all black pixels is detected.

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Defined by integer value (0-9).
      - adjacency:  Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally.

  - action: duplicate_pattern
    description: >-
      When a pixel is adjacent to a blue (1) or red (2) pixel, its value is part
      of a pattern. This pattern is duplicated on the same line, potentially 
      both before and after the initial instance, and also in any successive lines until
      the all black pattern is detected.
