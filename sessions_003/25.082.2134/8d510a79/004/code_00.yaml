facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      datatype: integer (0-9)
      dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
    observations:
      - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
      - Each cell represents a color.

  - object: row
    properties:
      type: 1D array
      datatype: integer
    observations:
      - Rows can contain different colors.
      - A special row containing only grey (5) exists.
      - The grey row is copied unchanged from input to output, maintaining its index.
      - Non-grey rows are processed based on a pixel duplication rule.

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      type: integer (0-9)
      color: mapped to RGB values
    observations:
      - Pixel duplication occurs in non-grey rows.
      - Duplication_condition: A pixel is duplicated if the pixel to its right is blue (1) or red (2) in the input grid.
      - If a row is modified, it is duplicated.
      - If a row is NOT modified, then each of its values is replaced by 0, unless it should be duplicated.
