objects:
  - name: source_pixels
    colors: [4, 5]
    description: Pixels in the input grid with colors 4 (yellow) or 5 (gray).
  - name: target_pixels
    colors: [6, 9]
    description: Pixels in the input grid with colors 6 (magenta) or 9 (maroon).
  - name: bounding_box
    description: The smallest rectangular region containing all source and target pixels in the input grid.

actions:
  - name: identify_and_swap
    description: Find corresponding source and target pixels and swap their colors and positions.
    details: |
      A source pixel of color 4 corresponds to a target pixel of color 6.
      A source pixel of color 5 corresponds to a target pixel of color 9.
      Swapping means the source pixel takes the target pixel's color, and the target pixel takes the source pixel's color.
  - name: condense
    description: Create a new grid (output grid) containing only the swapped pixels within a new bounding box.
    details: |
        The new bounding box will be the smallest box to hold all the pixels.
  - name: reconstruct
    description: The output is reconstructed using the swapped pixels within the new bounding box defined by the original positions of the source and target pixels.
