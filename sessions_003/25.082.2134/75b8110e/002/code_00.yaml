observations:
 - In each example, colors 4 and 6, and 5 and 9, are involved in a swap.
 - Colors 4 and 5 act as "source" pixels, and colors 6 and 9 act as their respective "target" pixels
 - The relative positions of the 4 and 5 clusters within their rows and cols seem important, as well as for 6 and 9
 - the number of output pixels matches the number of source and target pixels
