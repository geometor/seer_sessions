            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding of the transformation, focusing solely on swapping color pairs (4, 6) and (5, 9) and arranging them in a condensed grid. The results across multiple examples clearly demonstrate that this approach is insufficient. The output sizes are consistently incorrect, and the arrangement logic is flawed. The core issue is that while the initial observation of swapping colors 4 and 6 and colors 5 and 9 isn't incorrect the code failed to correctly model other aspects, especially the *position* of each color.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Pair Identification:** The current `find_pairs` function is too simplistic. While pairs of (4, 6) and (5, 9) are crucial, the way they're considered \"neighbors\" needs refinement. We need to consider how to incorporate object properties and their relationship to create a more comprehensive natural language program.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Output Grid Construction:** The logic for determining the output grid's dimensions and populating it is incorrect. We need to derive a rule-based approach that considers relative positions, possibly a combination of the original grid and a separate data structure to track relationships.\n3.  **Focus on Relative Positioning:** The transformation seems to maintain some relative ordering of the color pairs. We need to capture this ordering precisely. It's not just about swapping, but *where* the swapped elements end up in relation to each other.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Detailed Analysis:**\n\nI'll use `tool_code` to compute some additional metrics for each example, which may include positions of the identified numbers, differences in their positions.\n\n"
