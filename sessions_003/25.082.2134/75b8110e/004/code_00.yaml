    description: >
        Pixels of colors 4 and 5 are identified in the input grid and considered 'source' pixels.
        Pixels of colors 6 and 9 are identified and considered 'target' pixels corresponding
        to colors 4 and 5, respectively. The positions of the corresponding
        source and target pixels are swapped. The output grid is formed by
        condensing all source and target pixels, preserving the relative row and column order
        of the original source pixels.  Source pixels change to target,
        target pixels change to source.
