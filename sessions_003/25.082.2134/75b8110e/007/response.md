"""
Pixels of colors 4 and 5 are identified in the input grid and considered 'source' pixels.
Pixels of colors 6 and 9 are identified and considered 'target' pixels corresponding
to colors 4 and 5, respectively.  A bounding box containing all source and
target pixels is defined in the input grid. The positions of corresponding
source and target pixels are swapped within a condensed output grid.
Source pixels change to target, target pixels change to source.
The output grid is formed to match size of bounding box.
