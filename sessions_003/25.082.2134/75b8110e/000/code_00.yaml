actions:
  - name: identify_pairs
    description: Locate instances of color pairs (4,6) and (5,9) within the input grid.
  - name: condense
    description: Create a smaller output grid containing only the identified color pairs.
  - name: swap_values
    description: Within each identified color pair, exchange positions of the color values in the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of color pairs in the input grid determine their arrangement in the output grid. The output grid seems to follow a top-left to bottom-right scan of the input, but *only* of paired values.
