It is likely these are the objects.\n*   **Object Interactions:** The paired objects may interact by switching values in the output grid.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** It appears that relative positions (spatial relationships) between color pairs are crucial. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation focused on these pairs.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

So, if a 4 is found adjacent to a 6 in the input, record a 6 and 4 in adjacent spaces in the output.\n4. **Discard other values** Ignore the unpaired values in the input grid.\n5.  **Output Grid Dimensions:** Determine the dimensions of the output grid based on the number of color pairs found. The output grid should be large enough to contain all the colors of all pairs found.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts specific color pairs, swaps their values, and arranges them into a condensed grid, preserving the relative order of appearance from the input grid.\n"
