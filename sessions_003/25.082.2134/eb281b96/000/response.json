The dominant colors are white (0), azure (8), and red (2).  The input grids appear to have a repeating pattern of colored pixels. The output grids have a larger dimension than the input grids, but seem to maintain the input's color pattern, while extending it, resembling a replication or expansion of the original structure.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Pattern:** Observe the input grid and identify the repeating pattern of colored pixels (azure or red) on a background of white (0) that form diagonal and vertical/horizontal lines.\n\n2.  **Determine Expansion Factor:**  The output grid appears to be approximately three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions. The pattern repeats, and the relative positions of the colored pixels are conserved, just scaled to the output grid.\n\n3. **Replicate and Extend:** Replicate the input pattern and extend it across both dimensions of the output grid. For example, the top-left 3x3 section in `train_1` input corresponds to a replicated pattern in the top-left 9x9 section in `train_1` output. Maintain the relative spacing and arrangement of colors to build an extended, larger version of the initial pattern.\n\n4. **Output generation**: For the final output, continue the pattern of the output grid across both dimensions.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule is to identify a repeating pattern within the input grid and extend that pattern proportionally to create a larger output grid. The pattern is created using color, shape and adjacency.\n"
