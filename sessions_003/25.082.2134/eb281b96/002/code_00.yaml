example_1:
  input:
    shape: [3, 17]
    colors: [0, 8]
  output:
    shape: [9, 17]
    colors: [0, 8]
  transformation:
    height_ratio: 3
    width_ratio: 1
    rule: "Replicate the input pattern vertically 3 times, keeping the width the same."
example_2:
  input:
    shape: [4, 17]
    colors: [0, 2]
  output:
    shape: [13, 17]
    colors: [0, 2]
  transformation:
    height_ratio: 3.25
    width_ratio: 1
    rule: "Replicate the input pattern vertically, extending the height to 13, and keeping the width the same. The output height is exactly 3.25 times the input height"
