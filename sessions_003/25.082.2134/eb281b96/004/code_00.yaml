  - example_id: 1
    input_grid:
      height: 3
      width: 17
      pattern: "Alternating color pattern of 0 and 8."

      width: 17
      pattern_repetition:
        height: 3
        width: 1
    transformation: "Replicate the input pattern vertically three times. The width stays the same."

  - example_id: 2
    input_grid:
      height: 4
      width: 17
      pattern: "Alternating color pattern of 0 and 2, with a different starting color per row."
    output_grid:
      height: 13
      width: 17
      pattern_repetition:
          height: "3 full repetitions and 1 partial repetition"
          width: 1
    transformation: "Replicate the input pattern vertically. The output height is such that the input pattern is repeated three full times, with the first row of the input pattern added at the end for the partial repetition."
