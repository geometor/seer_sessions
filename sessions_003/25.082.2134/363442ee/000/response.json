A consistent feature across all input examples is a vertical gray (5) line separating a left-hand side \"object\" from what appears to be a blue object or a series of blue pixels on the right, which is always very sparse. The output grids show a replication of the left-hand side object, potentially mirrored or repeated, and placed to the right of the vertical gray line, and below the original, but with what looks like specific rules of placement and handling of the separating sparse pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Paste this copy immediately to the right of the gray line, replacing all the right-hand pixels within the range of the original shape. This creates a horizontally expanded section that fills the columns up to the border of the input.\n\n4. **Replicate and Position below:** Copy the left-hand object. Paste this copy immediately below the gray line, replacing the right-hand pixels within the range of the gray line. This fills the bottom rows up to the range of the input.\n\n5. **Output:** The output is original object, plus replicated data to the right, and below.\n\nIn essence, the transformation replicates the object on the left side of the dividing gray line, both to its right, and below, respecting the gray line separator, and essentially 'filling' the areas previously occupied by only scattered blue pixels.\n"
