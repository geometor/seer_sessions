facts:
  - observation: "A vertical gray line (value 5) consistently divides each input grid."
    type: structural
    related_to: "grid division"
  - observation: "The area to the left of the gray line contains a colored 'object'."
    type: object_identification
    related_to: "left-hand object"
    properties:
      - "composed of contiguous pixels of various colors (excluding gray 5)"
      - "shape varies between examples"
  - observation: "Sparse blue pixels (value 1) appear to the right of the gray line in the input grids."
    type: object_identification
    related_to: "right-hand blue pixels"
  - observation: "The output grid contains a replication of the left-hand object."
    type: transformation
    related_to: "object replication"
  - observation: "The replicated object is placed to the right of the original gray line, and also below the gray line. The placement is NOT a simple mirroring, but more of a filling of the space previously occupied by the sparse single blue pixels."
    type: spatial_relationship
    related_to: "object placement"
  - observation: "The replicated object to the right occupies three columns of the output."
    type: spatial_relationship
  - observation: "The replicated object below occupies three rows of the output."
