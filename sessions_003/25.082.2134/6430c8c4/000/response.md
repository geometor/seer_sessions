Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input grids appear to have two distinct sections, separated by a horizontal line of '4's (yellow).
*   The top section contains '7's (orange) and '0's (white).
*    The bottom section contains '2's (red) and '0's (white).
*    The output grids consist only '3's (green) and '0's(white).
*    The output grid size is equal to number of rows of the '7' section.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grids are divided into two sections by a horizontal line of '4' (yellow)."
  - top_section:
      colors: ['7' (orange), '0' (white)]
      rows: variable
      columns: 4
  - bottom_section:
      colors: ['2' (red), '0' (white)]
      rows: variable
      columns: 4
  - output_section:
      colors: ['3' (green), '0' (white)]
      rows: "Equal to number of rows in top section of input."
      columns: 4
  - relationship: "The output seems to be derived from the orange ('7') pixels in the top part of the input."
  - transformation: "Replace all instances of a certain object/pattern"
  - objects:
      orange_shapes:
          definition: "contiguous blocks of orange ('7') pixels"
          instances: varies
  - operation: "count number of rows for the upper part"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Sections:** Divide the input grid into two sections based on the horizontal line of '4's (yellow).
2.  **Top Section Focus:** Disregard the lower section of the input grid.
3.  **Count Rows:** Count the number of rows on the top section.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid consisting of '0' (white), with the number of rows from step 3 and 4 columns.
5.  **Overlay Shape:** Create a shape by replacing orange '7' by green '3', for all '7' in top section, copy and paste the resulting shapes to same coordinates on the new output grid.
