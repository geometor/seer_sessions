facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid contains two distinct, rectangular, non-overlapping colored regions.
  - observation: |
      The output grid is identical to the input grid, with the exception of a newly inserted azure (color 8) rectangle.
  - observation: |
      The azure rectangle occupies a previously empty (color 0, white) space.
  - observation: |
      The azure rectangle's placement is linked to the position and size of the pre-existing colored regions.
  - observation: |
      In train_1, two red regions create an insertion of an azure region between.
  - observation: |
      In train_2, two non-horizontal or vertical regions create a fill between.
  - observation: |
      In train_3, two vertical/horizontal regions on different axis create a cross section to fill.
  - relationship: |
      The inserted azure rectangle's height or width seems to correspond to the dimensions (height or width) of the other colored shapes and aligns with one of the two.
  - action: |
     An azure region "fills" space that exists in whitespace regions between two colored regions.
