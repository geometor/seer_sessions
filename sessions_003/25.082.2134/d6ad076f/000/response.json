A new azure (color 8) rectangle appears to be inserted or overlaid based on the spatial relationship between other colored rectangles within the input grid. The size and position of this new rectangle seem to be determined by analyzing gaps or spaces between pre-existing, same-colored rectangles.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
