            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies rectangles of the same color but fails to accurately insert the azure (color 8) rectangle in the \"in-between\" space. The primary issue is that the `get_inbetween` function seems to only consider the closest edges, and not the overall empty space potentially bounded by multiple colored rectangles. It doesn't handle cases with partial overlap or fully enclosed spaces correctly, as showin by the results on examples 1,2,3. The strategy will involve refining how \"in-between\" space is calculated.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Improve `get_inbetween`:** Instead of simply finding the space between the closest edges of *two* rectangles, find connected regions of background pixels (0's) and determine if such regions are adjacent to different colored regions. If so, use a filling procedure.\n2.  **Consider All Rectangle Pairs (and possibly triplets, etc.):** Although the given examples only involve adding between pairs of colored rectangles, this might not be sufficient for a more general solution, so the \"in-betweeness\" property must be considered more generally.\n3. **Refine Rectangle Detection:** Make sure rectangle detection is strict. Only whole rectangles should matter, not L shapes or other irregular collections of same-colored pixels. Current code seems to ensure that.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll examine the examples to document exact properties. Let's start by manually examining.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Two rectangles: Red (2) and Orange (7).\n    *   The in-between space is a 3x2 rectangle of background (0) color.\n    *   The code fails to insert the azure rectangle.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Two rectangles: Yellow (4) and Magenta (6).\n    *  The in-between space is a 3x3 rectangle of background(0), but only partially.\n    *   The code fails to insert the azure rectangle.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Two rectangles: Green (3) and Maroon (9).\n    *  The in-between space is a 4x4 rectangle of background color.\n    *   The code fails to insert the azure rectangle.\n\nThe current implementation of `get_inbetween` calculates the space incorrectly, it only extends from the closest edge of one to the closest of the other. It must consider the largest axis-aligned bounding box of color 0 which is bounded by non-zero colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
