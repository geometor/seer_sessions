Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
Identify cells with the value 5 (gray pixels).
For each gray pixel found, replace a 3x3 area in the output grid, centered on the gray pixel's location, with the value 1 (blue pixels).
All other cells in the output grid that are not part of a 3x3 replacement area should retain the background color (0/white).
