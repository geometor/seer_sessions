The input grids contain isolated pixels of color 'gray' (value 5) on a background of 'white' (value 0). The output grids appear to be constructed around the locations of the gray pixels, replacing them with 3x3 blocks of 'blue' (value 1) pixels. The important operation appears to be the location and expansion.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

For each gray pixel found, **replace** a 3x3 area in the output grid, centered on the gray pixel's location, with the value 1 (blue pixels). If there isn't a complete 3x3 block because the gray pixel is at an edge, then only fill in as much as possible.\n4.  **Keep** All other cells in the output grid that are not part of a 3x3 replacement area should retain the background color (0/white).\n\n"
