Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of different numerical values. The input grids contain isolated pixels of color 'gray' (value 5) on a background of 'white' (value 0). The output grids appear to be constructed around the locations of the gray pixels, replacing them with 3x3 blocks of 'blue' (value 1) pixels. The important operation appears to be the location and expansion.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids contain isolated gray pixels (value 5) on a white background (value 0).
  - observation: Output grids contain blue blocks (value 1) of size 3x3.
  - relationship: The 3x3 blue blocks in the output are centered on the locations where the gray pixels were in the input.
  - property: The gray pixels are singular, meaning no directly adjacent gray pixels on sides or corners
  - property: The output grids are the same dimension as the input grids
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** cells with the value 5 (gray pixels).
3.  For each gray pixel found, **replace** a 3x3 area in the output grid, centered on the gray pixel's location, with the value 1 (blue pixels). If there isn't a complete 3x3 block because the gray pixel is at an edge, then only fill in as much as possible.
4.  **Keep** All other cells in the output grid that are not part of a 3x3 replacement area should retain the background color (0/white).
