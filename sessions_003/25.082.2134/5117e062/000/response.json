The criteria for selection isn't immediately obvious but appears related to size, color, or arrangement.\n*    **Output Size:** the output grids appear to be 3x3\n*   **Output Structure:** The output consistently presents a 3x3 grid, potentially a cropped or isolated region from the input, or a reconstructed representation based on a selected object.\n*     **object of interest:** the top-left pixel of the object of interest contains the value '0'\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
