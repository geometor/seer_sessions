This object has the color 0. The L shape consists of two lines of length 2, joined at a corner. It has 4 possible orientations - top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.\n    *   Find the *enclosed* object. This is the single object that is *completely surrounded* by the \"L\" shaped object. \"Completely surrounded\" means that all pixels adjacent to the enclosed object are either part of the \"L\" shape, or off the grid entirely.\n2.  **Output Construction:**\n    *   Create a 3x3 output grid.\n    *   Fill the entire grid with the color of the *enclosed* object.\n3.  **Overlay \"L\" Shape:**\n    *  Determine the orientation of the \"L\" object.\n    *   Based on the orientation, place the '0' pixels on the 3x3 grid:\n        *   **Top-left:** `0` at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0)\n        *   **Top-right:** `0` at (0,2), (0,1), (1,2)\n        *   **Bottom-left:** `0` at (2,0), (1,0), (2,1)\n        *   **Bottom-right:** `0` at (2,2), (2,1), (1,2)\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects in a grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r][c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, color, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r][c], current_object)\n                if current_object:\n                    objects.append((grid[r][c], current_object))  # Store color along with object\n    return objects\n\ndef find_l_object(objects):\n    \"\"\"Finds the object with color '0' that forms an L shape.\"\"\"\n    for color, obj in objects:\n        if color == 0:\n            # Check for L shape (2x2 area with 3 pixels filled)\n            rows, cols = zip(*obj)\n            min_r, max_r = min(rows), max(rows)\n            min_c, max_c = min(cols), max(cols)\n\n            if (max_r - min_r + 1) <= 2 and (max_c - min_c + 1) <= 2 and len(obj) == 3:\n                return obj\n    return None\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Gets the neighbors of a cell, including diagonals.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    neighbors = []\n    for i in range(-1, 2):\n        for j in range(-1, 2):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + i, c + j\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n  \ndef find_enclosed_object(grid, objects, l_object):\n    \"\"\"Finds the object enclosed by the L-shaped object.\"\"\"\n    if not l_object:\n        return None, None\n\n    for color, obj in objects:\n        if color == 0:  # Skip the L-object itself\n            continue\n\n        enclosed = True\n        for r, c in obj:\n            neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, r, c)\n            for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                if (nr, nc) not in l_object and (nr,nc) not in obj:\n                    enclosed = False\n                    break\n            if not enclosed:\n                break\n\n        if enclosed:\n            return color, obj\n\n    return None, None\n\ndef determine_orientation(l_object):\n    \"\"\"Determines the orientation of the L shape.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = zip(*l_object)\n    min_r, max_r = min(rows), max(rows)\n    min_c, max_c = min(cols), max(cols)\n\n    # Count pixels in each row and column of the bounding box\n    row_counts = [0] * (max_r - min_r + 1)\n    col_counts = [0] * (max_c - min_c + 1)\n\n    for r, c in l_object:\n      row_counts[r - min_r] += 1\n      col_counts[c - min_c] += 1\n\n    # Determine orientation based on counts:\n    if row_counts[0] > 0 and row_counts[-1] == 0 and col_counts[0] > 0 and col_counts[-1] == 0:\n        return \"top-left\" #standard L\n    elif row_counts[0] > 0 and row_counts[-1] == 0 and col_counts[0] == 0 and col_counts[-1] > 0:\n        return \"top-right\" # reverse L\n    elif row_counts[0] == 0 and row_counts[-1] > 0 and col_counts[0] > 0 and col_counts[-1] == 0:\n         return \"bottom-left\" # flipped\n    else:\n        return 'bottom-right'\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the rules.\"\"\"\n\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n\n    # 1.
