"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Identify the '0' Object:** Find the object composed of '0' (white) pixels that forms an "L" or reverse "L" shape.
3.  **Identify the Target Object:** Find the object that occupies the internal space formed by the '0' object's "L" shape.
4.  **Get Target Object Color:** Determine the color of the target object.
5.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
6.  **Fill Output Grid:** Fill all cells of the output grid with the target object's color.
7.  **Place '0' Border:** Overlay the '0' values onto the output grid, maintaining the "L" shape and its orientation relative to the target object in the input grid. The 0's should form a 2-length line along one dimension, and a 2-length line along another dimension, connected at a corner.
