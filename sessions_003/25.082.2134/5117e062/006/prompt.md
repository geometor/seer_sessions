"""
1.  **Object Identification:**
    *   Find all contiguous objects (groups of pixels of the same color).
    *   Identify the "L" shaped object. This object has the color 0. The L shape consists of two lines of length 2, joined at a corner. It has 4 possible orientations - top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.
    *   Find the *enclosed* object. This is the single object that is *completely surrounded* by the "L" shaped object. "Completely surrounded" means that all pixels adjacent to the enclosed object are either part of the "L" shape, or off the grid entirely.
2.  **Output Construction:**
    *   Create a 3x3 output grid.
    *   Fill the entire grid with the color of the *enclosed* object.
3.  **Overlay "L" Shape:**
    *  Determine the orientation of the "L" object.
    *   Based on the orientation, place the '0' pixels on the 3x3 grid:
        *   **Top-left:** `0` at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0)
        *   **Top-right:** `0` at (0,2), (0,1), (1,2)
        *   **Bottom-left:** `0` at (2,0), (1,0), (2,1)
        *   **Bottom-right:** `0` at (2,2), (2,1), (1,2)
