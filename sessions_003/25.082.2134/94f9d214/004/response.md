Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and it's clear that it doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The main issues seem to be:

1.  **Boundary Condition Handling:** The code assumes a solid blue line as a boundary. It either returns an empty array when no blue line exists or processes data only above the first blue line it finds. This is too restrictive. Example 2 & 4 show that there is no such solid blue boundary line.
2.  **Incorrect Region Processing:** The region that needs processing is not just *above* a blue boundary line. The transformed region is determined by adjacency to white, but the boundary itself is not well defined.
3. **Incorrect size:** Example 2 and 4, the size should not be empty.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Remove the strict blue line boundary:** We'll need to process the entire grid.
2.  **Refine the adjacency rule:** Re-affirm that adjacency to white pixels is the key factor for the green-to-red transformation.
3.  **Handle edge cases:** Ensure the code correctly handles cases where there might be no green pixels or no white pixels.
4. **Validate the output size:** check the output size.

**Metrics and Observations (per example)**

Here's a breakdown of each example, along with observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (8, 4)
    *   Output Shape: (4,4)
    *   Transformed output shape: (6,4)
    *   Observations: The output cuts off part of input grid above solid blue horizontal line. It correctly transforms some green pixels to red based on adjacency to white. The rows after blue solid horizontal line are removed.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (8, 4)
    *   Output Shape: (4,4)
    *    Transformed output Shape: (0,4)
    *   Observations: There is no solid blue horizontal line. The code return an empty array. However, we can see that the output keeps only the top rows and transforms green to red based on white adjacency.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (8, 4)
    *   Output Shape: (4,4)
    *    Transformed output Shape: (4,4)
    *   Observations: There's a solid blue horizontal line. The green pixels are converted based on their adjacency to white.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Shape: (8, 4)
    *   Output Shape: (4,4)
    *    Transformed output Shape: (0,4)
    *   Observations: There is no solid blue horizontal line, so code return an empty output. We can see there's a partial solid blue horizontal line in the input, but it doesn't affect the output.

**YAML Fact Sheet**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - pixels: integer values (0-9 representing colors)
      - rows: variable
      - columns: variable

actions:
  - name: transform_color
    input: green pixel
    condition: adjacent to white pixel (in any of the 8 neighboring positions, same row, previous row or next row)
    output: red pixel
    else: white pixel

  - name: output
    action: maintain the original shape of input, only transform pixels in top four rows.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   The input is a 2D grid of pixels, each with a color value (0-9).
    *  Create output grid that has the top four rows of input grid.

2.  **Transformation:**
    *   Iterate through each pixel of the output grid.
    *   If a pixel is green:
        *   Check its adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right, diagonals) in the *input grid*.
        *   If any adjacent pixel is white (0), change the corresponding pixel in the *output grid* to red (2).
        *   Otherwise, change the pixel in *output grid* to white (0).
    *   If not green, do nothing.
3. Return *output grid*.
