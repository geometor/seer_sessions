The transformation rule divides the input grid into two halves: Grid A (top) and Grid B (bottom).
Grid B always has a yellow (4) row at the top (row 0). The output is a 4x4 grid.
If a cell in Grid A is blue (1) at (r_a, c_a), then the output grid has a green (3)
pixel at (3 - r_a + r_b, c_a), where r_b is the index of the yellow row in Grid B (always 0).
The output grid's dimensions are always 4x4.
