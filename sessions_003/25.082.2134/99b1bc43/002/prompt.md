"""
The transformation rule is a conditional overlay operation. It identifies two input grids, Grid A and Grid B.
It locates a horizontal line of color 4 (yellow) in Grid B. Using this line as a reference, it overlays a pattern 
onto a 4x4 output grid initialized with color 0 (white). The overlay changes cells to color 3 (green) based on 
the presence of color 1 (blue) in Grid A at corresponding positions within the row region defined by the yellow line
in Grid B.
