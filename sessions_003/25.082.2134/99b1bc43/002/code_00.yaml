      Places green (3) pixels in the output grid based on the positions of
      blue (1) pixels in Grid A and the yellow (4) row in Grid B.
    rule: >
      If there is a blue pixel at (r_a, c_a) in Grid A, and the yellow row
      is at row r_b in Grid B, then place a green pixel at
      (3 - r_a + r_b , c_a) in the output grid, provided the
      resulting output coordinates are within the 4x4 output grid.
