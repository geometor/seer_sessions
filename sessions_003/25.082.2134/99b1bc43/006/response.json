            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on a limited understanding derived from the first training example. While the code correctly identifies the dividing line (the row of all yellow pixels) and attempts a mapping, it fails to accurately reproduce the expected outputs for all examples. The core issue lies in the pixel mapping logic, which doesn't correctly translate positions from the input subgrid to the output grid. The consistent `pixels_off` count and the pattern in the mismatched pixels suggest a systematic error in the row and/or column transformation, rather than random errors. It seems the reflection logic needs refinement.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, focusing on how the blue (1) pixels in the input subgrid *above the yellow line* map to the green (3) pixels in the output grid. This requires careful observation of coordinates. I'll collect metrics about positions, sizes, and other attributes to help.\n2.  **Refine Mapping Rule:** Based on the detailed analysis, we'll revise the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation. This may involve adjusting how row and column indices are calculated. It might not be a simple reflection.\n3.  **Code Update:** Update transformation program.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\n"
