facts:
  - task_id: 99b1bc43
  - object: subgrid_a
    description: Portion of the input grid above the first all-yellow row.
    properties:
      - shape: rows x cols (variable, determined by the input)
      - content: Contains pixels of various colors, including blue (1).
  - object: output_grid
    description: A 4x4 grid representing the transformed output.
    properties:
      - shape: 4x4
      - content: Initially all black (0), some pixels become green (3) based on the transformation.
  - object: blue_pixels
    description: Pixels in subgrid_a with a value of 1.
    properties:
      - color: blue
      - value: 1
      - location: (row, col) within subgrid_a
  - object: green_pixels
    description: Pixels in the output_grid with a value of 3.
    properties:
      - color: green
      - value: 3
      - location: (row, col) within output_grid
  - action: transform
    description: Maps blue pixels in subgrid_a to green pixels in the output_grid.
    rule: "The output grid is 4x4. Iterate through the subgrid_a. For any blue
      pixel (value=1), set the position in output grid at [subgrid_a.shape[0] - 1 -
      row_of_blue, subgrid_a.shape[1] -1 - col_of_blue] to green"
