"""
1. Divide Input: Split the input grid into two subgrids, A and B. Subgrid A
   consists of the rows above the first row that is all yellow (4). Subgrid B
   consists of the all-yellow row and all rows below it.

2. Output Grid: Create a 4x4 output grid initialized with all black (0) pixels.

3. Pixel Mapping: For each blue (1) pixel in Subgrid A, determine its
   corresponding position in the output grid and set that pixel to green (3).
   The mapping rule is as follows:
    *   Output Row: `3 - row_index_in_subgrid_A`
    *   Output Column: `3 - column_index_in_subgrid_A`

4. Return: Return the 4x4 output_grid.
