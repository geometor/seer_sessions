1. Divide Input: Split the input grid into two subgrids, A and B. Subgrid A
   consists of the rows above the first row that is all yellow (4). Subgrid B
   consists of the all-yellow row and all rows below it.

2. Output Grid: Create a 4x4 output grid initialized with all black (0) pixels.

3. Pixel Mapping: For each blue (1) pixel in Subgrid A, determine its
   corresponding position in the output grid and set that pixel to green (3).
   The mapping rule is as follows:
    *   Output Row: `3 - row_index_in_subgrid_A`
    *   Output Column: `3 - column_index_in_subgrid_A`

4. Return: Return the 4x4 output_grid.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on a limited understanding derived from the first training example. While the code correctly identifies the dividing line (the row of all yellow pixels) and attempts a mapping, it fails to accurately reproduce the expected outputs for all examples. The core issue lies in the pixel mapping logic, which doesn't correctly translate positions from the input subgrid to the output grid. The consistent `pixels_off` count and the pattern in the mismatched pixels suggest a systematic error in the row and/or column transformation, rather than random errors. It seems the reflection logic needs refinement.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, focusing on how the blue (1) pixels in the input subgrid *above the yellow line* map to the green (3) pixels in the output grid. This requires careful observation of coordinates. I'll collect metrics about positions, sizes, and other attributes to help.
2.  **Refine Mapping Rule:** Based on the detailed analysis, we'll revise the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation. This may involve adjusting how row and column indices are calculated. It might not be a simple reflection.
3.  **Code Update:** Update transformation program.

**Gather Metrics:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Subgrid A:** Determine the portion of the input grid *above* the first row that consists entirely of yellow (4) pixels. This is Subgrid A.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize a 4x4 output grid filled with black (0) pixels.
3. **Get Subgrid A dimenstions**: Get the height and width of Subgrid A.
4.  **Map Blue Pixels:** Iterate through Subgrid A. For each blue pixel (value 1) encountered at row `r` and column `c`:
    *   Calculate the corresponding output row as `height of Subgrid A - 1 - r`
    *   Calculate the corresponding output column as `width of Subgrid A - 1 - c`.
    *   Set the pixel at the calculated output row and column in the output grid to green (3).
5.  **Return Output:** Return the 4x4 output grid.
