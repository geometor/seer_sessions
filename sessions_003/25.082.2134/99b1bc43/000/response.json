The output is a single grid, seemingly derived from some interaction or combination of Grid A and Grid B. The colors present are 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow) in the inputs. The output grids contain only 0 (white) and 3 (green).  The dimensions of the output grid are always 4x4, whereas the input grids have varying dimensions but maintain the same number of rows. Grid B always contains a continuous block of 4 (yellow) in the middle row. The transformation appears to be a localized operation, potentially a form of overlay or masking, guided by Grid B, that results in a fixed size, and only two colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
