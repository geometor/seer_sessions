The core concept seems to be an expansion or \"inflation\" of the original grid. The output grid appears to be a 3x3 \"tiling\" of a modified version of the input grid.  Crucially, the input grid isn't simply copied; there's a blanking or zeroing-out operation applied to certain parts of the input before tiling. It appears that some type of masking pattern might be present. There is an interaction/dependency between the rows and columns of non-zero pixels.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

If a *row* contains all zeros, keep it all zeros. Similarly, if a *column* contains all zeros, keep the whole column as all zeros. Otherwise zero out all the cells in the copy.\n\n3. **Apply Mask:** For other rows and columns, keep only the non-zero values in the row and column, all other values in the row or column become 0.\n\n4. **Tile the Masked Input:** Create the output grid by tiling the modified input grid in a 3x3 pattern. This means the modified input grid will appear nine times in the output grid, arranged in three rows and three columns.\n"
