facts:
  - observation: Input grids are small (3x3).
  - observation: Output grids are larger (9x9).
  - observation: Output grids seem to be tiled versions of a modified input.
  - observation: Some pixels in the input are replaced with 0 (white) in the output.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - size: 9x9
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - action: expansion
    description: The input grid is expanded into a larger grid.
  - action: modification
    description: Some pixels in the input grid are changed to 0 before expansion.
  - relationship: tiling
    description: Output grid consists of 3x3 tiles based on the modified input grid.
  - relationship: dependency: input_grid determines output_grid
