"""
Expand a 3x3 input grid to a 9x9 output grid by creating a mask and tiling.
The mask is created by finding the intersection of rows and columns with any non-zero values.
The intersection is implemented using an outer product of boolean row and col vectors.
The original grid is then modified by setting elements to 0 if the corresponding mask cell is False.
The output is formed by tiling the modified grid in a 3x3 pattern.

Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code attempted to create a mask based on non-zero rows and columns and then tile the masked input grid. However, the results show consistent mismatches in pixel placement, indicating an issue with how the mask is applied and/or how the tiling is interpreted relative to the expected output. The core idea of identifying non-zero regions and replicating them has merit, but the specific logic needs adjustment. The expected outputs show a more complex interaction between rows and columns containing non-zero values. Instead of a simple intersection, it seems we are replicating 3x3 blocks *around* locations defined by the intersecting rows and columns.

**Strategy:**

1. **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully observe the relationship between the input and expected output grids, focusing on how the non-zero elements in the input influence the structure of the output. Pay close attention to relative positioning, not just the presence/absence of colors.
2. **Precise Metrics:** Instead of just overall mismatches, calculate the positions of incorrect pixels in a comparable coordinate system.
3. **Refine Masking Concept:** The "intersection" idea is probably too simplistic. We need to consider how each non-zero element potentially "expands" or "broadcasts" its influence. The original 3x3 input seems to *seed* the pattern in the output.
4. **Iterative Adjustment:** Based on analysis, propose an updated natural language program, translate it to code, and repeat the evaluation process.

**Gather Metrics and Factual Observations (YAML):**


```yaml
examples:
  - id: 1
    input_grid: [[0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7]]
    output_grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]]

      - The input is a 3x3 grid.
      - The output is a 9x9 grid (3x expansion).
      - Input rows 1 and 2, and columns 2 and 3 contain the color orange (7).
      - The output replicates the orange parts in a 3x3 grid, but with "gaps" where row and column intersections *would* produce all zeros.

    observations:
      - Input is 3x3, output is 9x9.
      - Input has yellow (4) in corners and center of bottom row.
      - Output shows 3x3 blocks of the original input centered on locations where input has yellow.

    observations:
      - Input and output sizes are 3x3 and 9x9, respectively.
      - Red (2) appears in the bottom row and last column.
      - Replicated red pixels are strategically placed in the bottom right 3x3 quadrant.

    observations:
      - Input and output sizes are as before.
      - Magenta (6) cells define the top-left and bottom-right regions.
      - Pattern expansion creates a 3 x 3 grid centered at original positions.

    observations:
        - Input and output grid sizes are 3x3 and 9x9, respectively.
        - The presence of red color appears to define where the replication starts.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Input:** A 3x3 grid of pixels (numbers 0-9, representing colors).
2. **Expansion:** Create a 9x9 output grid.
3. **Replication Rule:** For *each* cell in the 3x3 input grid, center a 3x3 copy of the *entire* input grid within the 9x9 output grid, at the corresponding position.  If a cell in the input grid is non-zero, place the 3x3 copy of the entire original input in the output grid, centered at the position corresponding to that input cell. If the input grid cell is zero, do *not* place a copy at that position.
4. **Output:** The resulting 9x9 grid.

This differs significantly from the previous "intersection" concept. It's a *replication* of the entire input pattern, positioned based on the locations of *any* non-zero input cells, not just their intersection.
