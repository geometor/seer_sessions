facts:
  - observation: "Two distinct non-black pixels exist in each input grid."
  - observation: "The non-black colors vary (azure '8', red '2')."
  - observation: "A rectangle of yellow '4' pixels is formed in the output."
  - observation: "One of the input non-black pixels is on a corner of the yellow structure."
  - observation: "The other input non-black pixel is extended to the beginning of the yellow structure in the output."
  - relationship: "The position of the yellow rectangle seems to depend on relative location of input pixels."
  - action: "A line of yellow pixels extends from the position of one non-black color until the row/column of the other non-black color."
  - action: "A yellow rectangle expands from the yellow line until the corner has the coordinates of second non-black pixel"
