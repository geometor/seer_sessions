These pixels seem to trigger the creation of a yellow (4) rectangular structure in the output grid. The position and relative locations of the original colored pixels are important. The size of output seems to relate to the relative positions.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Extend the yellow region from pixel A, either vertically or horizontally to the row or column that aligns with the start of the yellow region based on input pixel B position.\n3.  **Fill Rectangle**: Fill the space between the extended line, and up to input pixel B, making a rectangle of yellow color (value 4).\n4. **Keep second pixel**: Keep pixel B with the same input value in the output.\n5. **Everything else**: The rest of pixels are black.\n"
