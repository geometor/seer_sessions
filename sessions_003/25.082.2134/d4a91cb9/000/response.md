Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves identifying two distinct colored pixels (other than background color black '0') in the input grid. These pixels seem to trigger the creation of a yellow (4) rectangular structure in the output grid. The position and relative locations of the original colored pixels are important. The size of output seems to relate to the relative positions.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Two distinct non-black pixels exist in each input grid."
  - observation: "The non-black colors vary (azure '8', red '2')."
  - observation: "A rectangle of yellow '4' pixels is formed in the output."
  - observation: "One of the input non-black pixels is on a corner of the yellow structure."
  - observation: "The other input non-black pixel is extended to the beginning of the yellow structure in the output."
  - relationship: "The position of the yellow rectangle seems to depend on relative location of input pixels."
  - action: "A line of yellow pixels extends from the position of one non-black color until the row/column of the other non-black color."
  - action: "A yellow rectangle expands from the yellow line until the corner has the coordinates of second non-black pixel"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Locate the two non-black pixels in the input grid. Let's call the pixel whose color is changed to yellow in the next step as pixel A, and the other pixel at the corner as pixel B.
2.  **Extend**: Change pixel A to yellow. Extend the yellow region from pixel A, either vertically or horizontally to the row or column that aligns with the start of the yellow region based on input pixel B position.
3.  **Fill Rectangle**: Fill the space between the extended line, and up to input pixel B, making a rectangle of yellow color (value 4).
4. **Keep second pixel**: Keep pixel B with the same input value in the output.
5. **Everything else**: The rest of pixels are black.
