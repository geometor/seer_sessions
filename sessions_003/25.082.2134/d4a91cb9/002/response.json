            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the two non-black pixels and attempts to create a yellow rectangle. However, it fails to accurately determine *which* pixel should be the starting point for the extension and the direction of the extension. The current logic seems to always extend from `pixel_a_coords`, which is not always correct. The assumption that the filled region will always form a perfect rectangle bounded by these two points is the main flaw. The extending pixel should always become yellow, and it extends either vertically or horizontally, and fill the empty space between this two pixels to make a rectangle.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Improve Pixel Identification**: The code now assumes pixel A is the first non-black pixel found and starts the extension. We need to check the extending pixel and fix it to yellow.\n2.  **Refine Extension Logic:** The extension should make a rectangle, and fill the rectangle with yellow color (4).\n3.  **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider what should happen if input includes only one non-black pixel.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**\n\n"
