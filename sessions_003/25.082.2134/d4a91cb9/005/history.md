Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The current code fails to correctly transform all three examples. The primary issue seems to be with the logic that determines how the yellow rectangle is drawn. The code assumes a simple rectangle between the two non-black pixels. However, the examples show a more complex rule: a line is drawn from the "extending pixel" (the one that becomes yellow in the output, and which has a *different* color than the stationary pixel when the two non-black pixels have different colors), either horizontally or vertically, towards the other pixel. Then a filled yellow rectangle is constructed. The current implementation does not differentiate correctly between these cases for which pixel will "extend", and it always creates the smallest rectangle bounded by the row and column of the identified pixels.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Extending Pixel Logic:** The `get_extending_pixel` function needs to choose which non-black pixel extends correctly, and then change to yellow color. Currently this is based on finding the pixel whose values differ.

2.  **Correct Extension Logic**: Modify the extension logic. The line should extend *from* the pixel that changes to color yellow, *to* the row or column of the other non-black pixel, but not necessarily encompassing the other pixel's row *and* column, unless needed to.
3. **Correct Filling Logic**: after extending one of the non-black pixels position either horizontally or vertically, construct a filled rectangle.
4. **Maintain stationary pixel**: do not change the other pixel's color, which is stationary.

**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection and previous `tool_outputs`):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Two non-black pixels: 8 (at 2,1) and 2 (at 8,9).
    *   Expected Output: A yellow line extends vertically from (2,1) down to row 8. A yellow rectangle fills from the now yellow (2,1) up to the row and col of the stationary pixel (8,9) while maintaining pixel 2 color.
    *   Actual Output: A yellow rectangle fills the entire area between (2,1) and (8,9), and the yellow pixel is in the wrong position. Pixel 2 changed to yellow, which should not happen.
    *   Pixels off: 50
    * **Errors**: extension logic only created one of the two possible rectangles, starting pixel position, incorrect filling logic.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Two non-black pixels: 8 (at 1,8) and 2 (at 5,1).
    *   Expected Output: The 8 pixel should change to yellow, then a yellow line goes from this pixel to the row of the pixel 2. A yellow rectangle filling up to 2,1 while keeping the 2 value.
    *   Actual Output: A full rectangle between (1,1) and (5,8) which does not happen.
    *   Pixels Off: 30
    * **Errors**: extension logic only created one of the two possible rectangles, starting pixel position, incorrect filling logic.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Two non-black pixels: 2 (at 1,8) and 8 (at 10,2).
    *   Expected Output: A yellow line extends horizontally from (10,2) to column 8. Keep (1,8) = 2, then creates a rectangle to (1,8)
    *   Actual Output: A rectangle between (1,2) and (10, 8)
    *   Pixels off: 56
    * **Errors**: extension logic only created one of the two possible rectangles, starting pixel position, incorrect filling logic.

**YAML Facts:**

      cells: list of pixels

    output: output_grid with all non-object pixels set to black
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Non-Black Pixels**: Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not black (value 0).

2.  **Identify the Extending and Stationary Pixels**: If there are at least two non-black pixels, identify which one extends, and which one is stationary.
  *   **Extending pixel**: if non-black pixel colors are different, the extending pixel will change its color to yellow.
  *   **Stationary pixel**: This pixel will not change color.

3.  **Initial Output Grid**: Create an output grid initially filled with black pixels.

4. **Extend and Change color** Change the extending pixel to yellow (value = 4).
    *   **Horizontal/Vertical Extension**: From the new yellow pixel, extend the position either *horizontally* to the column of the *stationary* pixel, OR *vertically* to the row of the *stationary* pixel.

5.  **Fill Rectangle**: Fill the space between the extended yellow line, up to and including the stationary pixel, with yellow color.
    
6. **Keep Stationary Pixel**: keep the color of the stationary pixel.

7.  **Black Background**: Ensure all remaining pixels in the output grid are black (value 0).
