facts:
  - object: top_red_shape
    description: Contiguous red pixels in the top half of the grid.
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      location: top_half
      shape: variable, defined by connectivity
    actions:
      - propagates: Extends its outline downwards and to the sides by one pixel if adjacent to blue, changing those blue pixels to red.

  - object: bottom_red_shape
    description: Contiguous red pixels in the bottom half of the grid.
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      location: bottom_half
      shape: variable, defined by connectivity
    actions:
       - removed:  If and only if a bottom_red_shape pixel does *not* become part of the top_red_shape outline extension.

    description: Pixels with the color blue.
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      location: all
    actions:
      - change_color: Changes to red if adjacent to the extended outline of the top_red_shape.

  - grid:
    properties:
      rows: number of rows
