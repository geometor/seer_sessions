    objects:
      - name: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels.
        properties:
          - colors: [white, blue, red]
          - shape: rectangular
          - size: 10x10
      - name: red_pixel
        description: A pixel with the value 2 (red).
        properties:
          - color: red
          - location: (row, column)
      - name: blue_pixel
        description: A pixel with the value 1 (blue).
        properties:
          - color: blue
          - location: (row, column)
      - name: top_half
        description: top rows of the grid
        properties: {}
      - name: bottom_half
        description: bottom rows of the grid
        properties: {}

    actions:
      - name: transform
        description: >-
          The transformation rule involves the interaction between red and blue
          pixels, and their positions within the grid, the presence of red
          pixels in the upper half determines if the blue pixels adjacent to it
          will change color to red, the bottom red pixels are removed based on
          their horizontal alignment with red pixels in the upper half
