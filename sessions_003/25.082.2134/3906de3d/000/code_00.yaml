facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - height: 10
      - width: 10
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 2]
  - object: pixel
    description: Individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - color: Represented by an integer (0=white, 1=blue, 2=red)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid
  - observation: "Red (2) pixels in the input grid are either blanked or become the source of red(2) replacement."
  - observation: "Blue(1) pixels, if adjacent to red pixels (2), change color to red (2) in output."
  - observation: "Existing clusters/shapes of blue pixels are mostly kept. Red is introduced within or adjacent to the blue."
  - observation: "The red shapes in the lower part of the input are removed, or used to create red shapes in the top."
  - observation: "Red shapes on the top of the input are the template for change in colors from blue to red."
