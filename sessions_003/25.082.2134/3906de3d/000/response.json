            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\nThe task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The grids are of the same dimensions (10x10 in the examples). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing the color of some pixels from blue (1) to red (2) and some pixels from red (2) to white/blank (0) based on the location of other red (2) pixels in the input grid. The positions and shapes formed by the blue (1) pixels seem very important.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

Red is introduced within or adjacent to the blue.\"\n  - observation: \"The red shapes in the lower part of the input are removed, or used to create red shapes in the top.\"\n  - observation: \"Red shapes on the top of the input are the template for change in colors from blue to red.\"\n```"

They will be removed (set to 0/white).\n\n2. **Locate Top Half Red Pixels:** Find all red pixels(2) at the *top half* of the input grid.\n\n3. **Propagate Red to Adjacent Blues:** For each red pixel located in step 2, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the input grid.\n\n4. **Change Colors:** If a neighboring pixel in input is blue (1), change its corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2).\n\n5. **Copy the remaining:** All the other pixels in the input that were not changed, are copied to the output.\n\nIn summary, the program uses the red (2) pixels in the lower half of the input grid as markers for removal, and the red (2) pixels in the upper half as a template to \"paint\" adjacent blue pixels red in the output grid. Blue pixels not adjacent to these upper-half red pixels are kept.\n"
