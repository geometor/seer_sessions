    top_shape:
      color: red
      initial_location: None # Not a single location
      transformation: fill enclosed blue
    bottom_shape:

      transformation: removed and replaced by a shifted and filled top shape
    overall_transformation: |
      The red shape in the top half of the grid expands to fill any enclosed blue regions.
      The red shape in the bottom half is cleared.
      The expanded/filled red shape in the top half is copied to the location
      of the bottom half red shape, shifted down by the number of rows from the
      top shape.
  - example: 2
    top_shape:

      color: red
      initial_location: row 6-8, col 6; row 9, col 4 and 6
      transformation: removed and replaced by a shifted and filled top shape

      The red shape in the top half of the grid expands to fill any enclosed blue regions.
      The red shape in the bottom half is cleared.
      The expanded/filled red shape in the top half is copied to the location
      of the bottom half red shape.
