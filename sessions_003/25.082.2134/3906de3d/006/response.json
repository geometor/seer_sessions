            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was based on a simple \"expand the red outline in the top half and remove unmatched red in the bottom half\" rule. However, the results show this is incorrect. It's failing to correctly propagate the red color in the top half and also failing to correctly handle the bottom half based on a *copy* of the top extended outline, not the original top. The propagation needs to fill the gaps *and* use the correct color. There are multiple errors. The code is propagating the red only if the neighbor in the *input_grid* is blue.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Propagation:** Re-examine how the red color should spread in the top half. It seems to be filling in blue areas *enclosed* by the red shape, not just extending the outline.\n2.  **Bottom Half Logic:** Revisit how the bottom half is related to the transformed top half. It appears the lower red should be removed and replaced by the upper red, but *shifted*.\n3.  Metrics: Investigate what's going on in the pixels - gather a pixel by pixel analysis of the results for each of the examples.\n4.  Update YAML and Natural Language Description: Refine the steps with the improved understanding.\n\n**Metrics Gathering & Analysis**\n\nFirst I'll re-run the pixel by pixel checks to have code do all of the work.\n\n"
