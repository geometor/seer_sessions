The transformation rule involves the interaction between red and blue
pixels, and their positions within the grid, the presence of red
pixels in the upper half determines if the blue pixels adjacent to it
will change color to red, the bottom red pixels are removed based on
their horizontal alignment with red pixels in the upper half
