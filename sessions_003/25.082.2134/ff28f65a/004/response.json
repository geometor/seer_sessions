            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the subsequent code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to detect 2x2 blocks of red pixels and represent their presence with '1's in a compressed output grid. The compression was intended to work by considering pairs of rows and columns. While the code works correctly for the first example, it fails to accurately represent the presence and location of red blocks in subsequent examples. The main issue appears to be a misalignment in how the output grid corresponds to the positions of 2x2 red blocks in the input grid, particularly when red blocks are not neatly aligned to even row/column pairs or are present in overlapping regions. The maximum output grid size is fixed to 3x3 based on the rule, this limit is incorrect.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Misalignments:** Carefully examine the failing examples to understand precisely *why* the '1's are misplaced in the output. Focus on how the 2x2 block positions relate to the row/column pairing logic.\n2.  **Refine Mapping Logic:** Revisit the natural language program to describe a more precise mapping between the input grid's 2x2 red blocks and the output grid's cells. The current logic seems too simplistic.\n3. **Output grid size**: The rule must be modified to correctly determine the size of the output grid, and when the output grid size should be truncated.\n4.  **Consider Overlaps:**  The current code seems to assume non-overlapping 2x2 blocks.  We need to determine if overlapping blocks should *both* be represented, or if there's a prioritization rule. The examples suggest overlaps *are* important.\n5. **Output grid content**: Ensure that non-zero pixels are correctly represented, and the output grid uses the correct color.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Example Analysis:**\n\nI'll use code execution to confirm some observations, focusing on sizes and red block positions.\n\n"
