Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the transformation logic and express it in a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** Variable-sized grids containing mostly '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels. The red pixels often appear in contiguous 2x2 blocks.
*   **Output Grids:** Smaller, consistently 3x3 grids. They contain '0' (white) and '1' (blue) pixels. The blue pixels seem to correspond to the *presence* of red 2x2 blocks in the input, but not their exact location.
*  The output height is always 3. The output width is equal or less than 3.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 2]  # white, red
      - size: variable
  - name: red_block
    type: object
    properties:
      - shape: 2x2 square
      - color: 2 # red
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1]  # white, blue
      - size: 3x3 or less
  - name: output_row
    type: array
    properties:
     - max_length: 3

actions:
  - name: detect_red_blocks
    input: input_grid
    output: set_of_locations
  - name: create_output_row
    input: set_of_locations
    output: output_row
  - name: populate_output_grid
    input: output_row
    output: output_grid

relationships:
    - red_blocks are sub-objects within the input_grid.
    - The presence of red_blocks triggers the placement of '1' (blue) in the output_grid.
    - The output grid has a fixed height of 3.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an empty output grid with at most 3 rows.
2.  **Red Block Detection:** Scan the input grid to detect 2x2 blocks of red (2) pixels.
3. **Row Generation**: Divide all the input grid rows into groups of two.
4.  **Output Population:** For each *pair of rows* in the input grid:
    *   If *any* 2x2 red blocks are present in *either* of those two rows, add a '1' (blue) to the current output row.
    *   Otherwise, add a '0' (white) to the current output row.
5. Stop adding to output row after 3 elements, create a new row and repeat step 4.
6. Stop adding rows after 3 rows have been added.
7. Return any generated rows.

Essentially, the program checks for the presence of red 2x2 blocks within pairs of input rows, and then maps their presence to a '1' in the output grid, creating rows of up to 3 elements, up to 3 rows.
