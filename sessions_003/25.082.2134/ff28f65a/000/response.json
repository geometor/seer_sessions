The red pixels often appear in contiguous 2x2 blocks.\n*   **Output Grids:** Smaller, consistently 3x3 grids. They contain '0' (white) and '1' (blue) pixels. The blue pixels seem to correspond to the *presence* of red 2x2 blocks in the input, but not their exact location.\n*  The output height is always 3. The output width is equal or less than 3.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
