Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements**

*   **Input:** The input in each example is a large grid (matrix) of digits, mostly filled with zeros (white).  There's a distinct, smaller, non-zero rectangular region within each input grid. This region appears to be the focus. The position of this region varies.
*   **Output:** The output is a smaller grid compared to the input.  It seems to be a condensed and inverted representation of the non-zero region from the input. The colors are sometimes, but not always, swapped. The output grid is consistently smaller than the input, and its dimensions don't seem directly proportional to the input non-zero region's dimensions.
* **Transformation:** The transformation involves isolating the non-zero region, inverting the shape (rotating or transposing and maybe cropping), and potentially altering the colors based on their original and surrounding color.

**YAML Block - Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 13x12, 11x11, 13x12)
      - content: digits (0-9)
      - description: Contains a large area of 0s and a smaller rectangular region of non-zero digits.

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 4x4, 3x3, 5x5)
      - content: digits (0-9)
      - description: Smaller grid, derived from the input_grid's non-zero region.

  - object: non_zero_region
    type: rectangle
    properties:

    relation: contained_within(input_grid)

  - action: isolate
    description: Extract the non-zero region from the input grid.

  - action: invert
    description: >
      Invert colors, such as a swap, or potentially a more complex color transformation.

  - action: rotate_and_crop
    description: Rotate and potentially crop the rectangle to get the final shape.

  - relationship:
    type: derivation
    description: output_grid is derived from input_grid's non_zero_region through isolation, inversion and rotation/cropping.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Non-Zero Region:** Locate the rectangular region within the input grid that contains only non-zero digits. This region is bounded by zeros.

2.  **Isolate the Non-Zero Region:** Extract this rectangular region as a separate sub-grid.

3.  **Invert Colors:**
    *   Take the center pixel from the isolated region in the input.
    *   Swap all instances of this center color with the color that surrounds the isolated non-zero region in the input.
    *   All other colors remain as they are.

4.  **Rotate/transpose and crop:** Rotate/transpose the isolated region by 90 degrees clockwise and crop the minimum rectangle to represent the output.

5. **Return result:** the rotated/transposed and cropped sub-grid with inverted colors is the output.
