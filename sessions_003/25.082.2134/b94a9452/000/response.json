            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements**\n\n*   **Input:** The input in each example is a large grid (matrix) of digits, mostly filled with zeros (white).  There's a distinct, smaller, non-zero rectangular region within each input grid. This region appears to be the focus. The position of this region varies.\n*   **Output:** The output is a smaller grid compared to the input.  It seems to be a condensed and inverted representation of the non-zero region from the input. The colors are sometimes, but not always, swapped. The output grid is consistently smaller than the input, and its dimensions don't seem directly proportional to the input non-zero region's dimensions.\n* **Transformation:** The transformation involves isolating the non-zero region, inverting the shape (rotating or transposing and maybe cropping), and potentially altering the colors based on their original and surrounding color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"
