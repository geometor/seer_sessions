facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 13x12, 11x11, 13x12)
      - content: digits (0-9)
      - description: Contains a large area of 0s and a smaller rectangular region of non-zero digits.

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 4x4, 3x3, 5x5)
      - content: digits (0-9)
      - description: Smaller grid, derived from the input_grid's non-zero region.

  - object: non_zero_region
    type: rectangle
    properties:
      - location: variable within input_grid
      - content: digits (1-9)
      - description: The rectangular area of non-zero digits within the input_grid.
    relation: contained_within(input_grid)

  - action: isolate
    description: Extract the non-zero region from the input grid.

  - action: invert
    description: >
      Invert colors, such as a swap, or potentially a more complex color transformation.

  - action: rotate_and_crop
    description: Rotate and potentially crop the rectangle to get the final shape.

  - relationship:
    type: derivation
    description: output_grid is derived from input_grid's non_zero_region through isolation, inversion and rotation/cropping.
