The transformation appears to be a form of compression or summarization.  Crucially, the output grid seems to maintain the spatial relationship of distinct colored objects in the input, but reduces their size and consolidates connected components of the same color. Symmetrical structures (like the corner patterns) play a key role, as well as contiguous regions. The transformation seems to focus on the top-left quadrant of the original. The transformation rule is probably different if the structure is horizontal, vertical or both.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If there is more than one single object on each corner, preserve all of them.\n\n2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid. The dimensions of this subgrid are approximately half the size of the full input in each dimension, although exact size will be determined by the position of isolated colors.\n\n3.  **Compress Connected Components:** Within the extracted subgrid, identify connected components (contiguous regions) of the same color. \"Compress\" each of these connected components down to a smaller representation. Single pixel regions are retained. Connected components with two pixels or more will be reduced to one pixel.\n\n4. **Reconstruct:**  Place the compressed components within the output. If a color is at a corner it will be placed at the opposing corners of the output.\n\n5. **Handle symmetric objects:** If an element is symmetric, duplicate this element and its symmetry, and place it in the output.\n\n6. **Output Dimensions**: Output grid has approximately the 1/2 of dimensions of input grid.\n"
