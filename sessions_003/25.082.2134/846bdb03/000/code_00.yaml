facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids are roughly 1/2 the size of input.
  - observation: Colors in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
  - observation: Connected components of the same color in the input grid are often, but not always, represented as single or smaller connected pixels of the same color in the output grid.
  - observation: some isolated single pixels with unique color are placed in the corners in all examples.
  - observation: The upper-left quadrant of the input appears to be the primary source of information for the output.
  - relationship:  Objects near the borders of the input may influence border of output.
  - object_property: corner objects and their colors
  - action: extract_subgrid: subgrids will be extracted from input, from top left corner.
  - action: compress_objects: Connected objects of same color will be combined/compressed to one single instance of the color.
  - action: create_symetry: colors will be placed in output symetricaly.
  - action: reconstruct: The compressed and extracted subgrids are used to construct output grid.
