"""
The input grid is transformed into a smaller output grid by:
1. Identifying colors in the corners of the input grid.
2. Extracting a subgrid from the top-left quadrant of the input grid (approximately half the size).
3. Compressing connected components of the same color within the subgrid to a single pixel or smaller representation.
4. Reconstructing the output grid using the compressed components, preserving spatial relationships.
5. Placing identified corner colors at the corresponding corners of the output.
6. Handling symmetry: If elements and their symmetries are present, place them in the output.
