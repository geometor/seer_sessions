The dimensions and content of the output vary.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered distinct objects.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve selecting a specific object (or part of an object) from the input and potentially modifying its size or shape. The selection criteria are not immediately obvious but seem related to a combination of color, position, and possibly object size.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"
