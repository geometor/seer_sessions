facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 2D grid of integers (colors).
  - observation: |
      The output is a 1D array of integers (colors).
  - observation: |
      The output colors correspond to colors present in the input grid.
  - observation: |
      Not all colors from the input grid appear in the output.
  - observation: |
      Specific 2x2 blocks of the same color are relevant.
  - observation: |
      A single column of zeros (white) separating two identical 2x2 blocks is a condition for inclusion in the output.
  - observation: "The output colors are sorted in ascending order."
  - action: |
      Identify all 2x2 blocks of the same color.
  - action: |
      Check for a separating column of zeros between identical 2x2 blocks.
  - action: |
      Collect the colors of the separated 2x2 blocks.
  - action: |
      Sort the collected colors in ascending numerical order.
  - action: |
      Output the sorted colors as a 1D array.
