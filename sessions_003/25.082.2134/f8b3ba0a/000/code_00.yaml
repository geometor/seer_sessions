facts:
  - observation: Input is a 2D grid of integers (colors).
  - observation: Output is a 1D array of integers (colors).
  - object: color_pair: Two adjacent pixels of the same color, separated by a single zero-filled column from another identical pair.
  - property: color_pair.color: The integer value representing the color of the pair.
  - action: extract_colors: Identify all unique color pairs in the input grid.
  - action: order: Sort/arrange based on first appearance in terms of rows and columns, considering the 2x2 blocks
  - relationship: The output array contains the colors of the identified color pairs, ordered as per the 'order' action.
  - constraint: Only 2x2 color pairs separated by a column of zeros are considered.
  - constraint: color pairs are all the same color
