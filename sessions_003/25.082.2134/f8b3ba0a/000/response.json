The output array's length is less than or equal to the total number of non-zero colors that exist on the input grid.\n*   The output integers appear to correspond to colors found within specific regions of the input grid.\n*   There's a recurring pattern: pairs of colored squares separated by a single column of zeros. These pairs, and not other single blocks, are likely the core objects being detected.\n*   The output length seems consistent with the number of unique colors forming pairs.\n*   The order of colors in the output matters.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

There must be an identical 2x2 immediately to the right.\n5.  **Record Unique Colors:** If a valid and separated color pair is found, record the integer/color value of that pair, only if it's the *first* time seeing a pair with this color. We are looking for unique color pairs.\n6.  **Order of Appearance:** The order in which unique color pairs are first encountered determines their order in the output. Reading the grid by row, then by column, and considering the entire 2x2 blocks at once.\n7. **Build Output Array:** As each unique color from a valid color pair is discovered in order, add it to the result sequence.\n8. **Output Result:** The output is the sequence of unique colors, in their order of first appearance in the valid separated color blocks.\n\n"
