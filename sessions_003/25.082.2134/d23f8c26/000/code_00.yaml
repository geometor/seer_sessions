facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The output grid mostly contains 0 (white).
  - observation: Certain non-zero values from the input are preserved in the output.
  - observation: The preserved values maintain their original vertical order.
  - observation: The preserved values all appear in the same column (column index 2) of output.
  - inference: The third column (index 2) of the input grid is extracted.
  - inference: All other cells that are not on the 3rd column are set to 0.
