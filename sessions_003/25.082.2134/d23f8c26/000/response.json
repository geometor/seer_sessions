The transformation seems to focus on specific columns and values within the input grid, selectively retaining and repositioning them in the output grid. Other elements are replaced with 0 (white). The key action appears to be a kind of filtering or extraction based on column position.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
