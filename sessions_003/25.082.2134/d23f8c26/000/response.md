Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to focus on specific columns and values within the input grid, selectively retaining and repositioning them in the output grid. Other elements are replaced with 0 (white). The key action appears to be a kind of filtering or extraction based on column position.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The output grid mostly contains 0 (white).
  - observation: Certain non-zero values from the input are preserved in the output.
  - observation: The preserved values maintain their original vertical order.
  - observation: The preserved values all appear in the same column (column index 2) of output.
  - inference: The third column (index 2) of the input grid is extracted.
  - inference: All other cells that are not on the 3rd column are set to 0.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the third column (index 2) of the input grid.**
2.  **Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with 0 (white).**
3. **Copy the values from the identified column of the input grid to the third column (index 2) of the output grid, maintaining their original row order**
4. **The output should be all 0 except for column index 2, which is copied from the input.**
