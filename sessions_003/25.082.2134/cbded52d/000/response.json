The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The most prominent feature is a repeating pattern of '1 1 0' and '1 0' horizontally.  There's a consistent blank row (all 0s) separating groups of rows. The transformation seems to selectively modify digits in specific columns, and seemingly only on every other row that's not all 0.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Of the remaining, number the rows, starting at 1 for first one. Target only the *odd-numbered* rows for potential modification.\n2.  **Identify target columns:** Within each target row, focus on columns 2, 5 (using 0-based indexing, so columns with index 1 and 4).\n3.  **Apply Modification rule**: In all rows which have at least one non zero number and are not the all zero rows, examine every other such row and replace, if any, on the 2nd and 5th columns as follows,\n   - examine train\\_1, train\\_2, train\\_3 input/output pairs side by side\n     - In train\\_1, input: columns 2, 5 values are 4, 1 respectively and output: columns 2, 5 have the values 4, 1\n     - In train\\_2, input: columns 2, 5 values are 3, 1 respectively and output: columns 2, 5 have the values 3, 1\n     - In train\\_3, input: columns 2, 5 values are 1, 1 respectively and output: columns 2, 5 have the values 1, 1\n   - The values in the target cells of the target rows remain unchanged. Copy all target values from input grid to the output grid.\n4. **Copy non-target elements.** All other cells' values in the input grid are copied directly to the corresponding cells in the output grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation preserves most of the input grid. It identifies every other non-all-zero row and specifically, for the identified rows it changes the values in the 2nd and the 5th columns to match the values in the 2nd and 5th columns of the same rows.\n"
