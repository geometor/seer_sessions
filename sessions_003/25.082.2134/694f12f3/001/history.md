Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of digits (0-9), representing colors. The primary color in both input and output grids is yellow (4), with a background of white (0). Within the yellow regions, there appear to be sub-regions of blue(1) and red(2). The transformation seems to involve identifying sub-regions within the larger yellow areas, which then have the innermost pixels changed to a different color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 4]  # white, blue, red, yellow

  - name: yellow_region_1
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: 4 # Yellow

  - name: identify_inner_region

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Yellow Regions:** Locate all contiguous blocks of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Define Inner Regions:** For each identified yellow region, determine an "inner region".
    *   The inner region starts one pixel inset on each side, from top-left to bottom-right, forming an inner rectangle
3. **Change inner colors:**
    *    If the Yellow block is located in the top-left, change this inner region to blue (1).
    *    If the yellow block is in the bottom-right, change this inner block to red (2)
4.  **Reconstruct Output:** Create the output grid by copying the input grid, then replacing the pixels of each inner region with the newly assigned color (either blue or red), depending on original yellow block location. The locations of the inner regions do not change.
