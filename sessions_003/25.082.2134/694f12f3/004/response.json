            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies and processes yellow regions, determines inner regions, and attempts to apply coloring based on relative positioning. However, the logic for assigning colors to multiple yellow blocks when they appear in the same example is producing errors. Specifically in the second example the color assignments are swapped - leftmost should be red, and rightmost should be blue. The code has logic to handle the case where multiple yellow blocks, but it seems the leftmost and rightmost assignment order.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Assumptions:** Double-check the assumptions about how color is assigned when multiple blocks exist, using print statements for debugging.\n2.  **Review Color Assignment:** Investigate the `determine_inner_region_color` function and correct the order in which the colors are assigned to the bounding boxes.\n3.  **Test and Refine:** After making adjustments, rerun the code on all training examples to ensure the fix works and doesn't introduce regressions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\nI'll use `tool_code` to derive grid shapes, yellow block bounding boxes and expected colors for the first two examples.\n\n"

The bounding box is defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the yellow pixels.\n\n3.  **Inner Regions:** Define an \"inner region\" for each yellow region. This inner region is a rectangle that is inset by one pixel on each side (top, bottom, left, right) from the bounding box. If the inset results in an invalid region (e.g., negative dimensions), the inner region is considered non-existent, and that yellow block is not processed further.\n\n4.  **Determine Inner Region Color:**\n    *   **Single Yellow Block:** If there's only one yellow block, determine its color based on its horizontal position relative to the grid's center:\n        *   If any part of the yellow block falls within the left half of the grid, the inner region's color is blue (1).\n        *   If any part of the yellow block falls within the right half of the grid, the inner region's color is red (2).\n\n    *   **Multiple Yellow Blocks:** If there are multiple yellow blocks, the coloring of inner regions depends on their relative horizontal positions:\n        *   The inner region of the *leftmost* yellow block is colored red (2).\n        *   The inner region of the *rightmost* yellow block is colored blue (1).\n        *   The inner region of any other block gets colored to match the background (0)\n\n5.  **Reconstruct Output:** Create a copy of the input grid. For each yellow block with a valid inner region, replace the pixels within that inner region in the output grid with the determined color (blue or red).\n\nThe key update is reversing the color assignment for multiple yellow regions in step 4.\n"
