Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize improvements.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While the core idea of doubling the width is correct, the implementation incorrectly duplicates each element within a row, rather than correctly interleaving or repeating the pattern as intended by the examples. The code correctly handles rows of all zeros, doubling their width, but fails with rows that contain objects.

**Strategy:**
The errors indicate a need for a more refined approach to handling the row expansion when they have content. It is not simply repeating the pixels twice, its repeating the whole pattern.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, with metrics calculated where applicable:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 6)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 12)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (5, 12)
    *   Pixels Off: 12
    *   Notes: The colored object here is `2 8 2 8 2 8`. It is repeated in its entirety.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 14)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (5, 14)
    *   Pixels Off: 5
    *Notes: The colored object is `2 3 3 2 3 3 2`, it has been correctly repeated.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 8)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 16)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (5, 16)
    *   Pixels Off: 17
    *   Notes: The object in row 3 `1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2` and row 4 `2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1`
        are correctly repeated.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the current row contains only zeros.
3.  **If True**: Create a new row with double the length, filled entirely with zeros.
4.  **If False**: Create a new row by repeating the entire pattern of the original row once. The output row is formed by concatenating the original row with itself.
5. **Output**: The new grid consisting of transformed rows.
