            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly handles the first example but fails on the second and third. The core issue seems to be in how the row repetition is handled. The code repeats the *entire* row pattern, rather than considering sub-patterns or individual elements within the row. Example 2 and 3 demonstrate that adjacent identical elements should be treated as a unit and not repeated. For example, instead of repeating \"2 3 3 2 3 3 2\" which has identical elements, it repeats the sub patterns \"2 3 3 2\".\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Sub-Patterns:** Modify the logic to identify contiguous sequences of identical numbers within each row.\n2.  **Repeat Sub-Patterns:** Instead of repeating the entire row, repeat these identified sub-patterns.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis for now, since direct image comparison via code isn't feasible in this environment):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 12)\n    *   Result: Correct. The code doubles the width, correctly handling all-zero rows and rows with non-zero elements.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 14)\n    *   Result: Incorrect. The third row is \"2 3 3 2 3 3 2\". The code outputs \"2 3 3 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 3 3 2\", while it should output \"2 3 3 2 3 3 2 3 3 2 3 3 2 3\". The repeating adjacent '3's are the cause.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 8)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 16)\n    *   Result: Incorrect. The third row is \"1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2\". The code outputs \"1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2\", while it should be \"1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1\". Similar to example 2, the repeating adjacent '2' values should not result in 4 adjacent 2's. Row four also shows the error.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
