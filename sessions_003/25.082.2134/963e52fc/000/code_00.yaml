facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: derived from input_grid
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - action: row_expansion
    description: Doubles the width of each non-zero row.
    properties:
      - input: row (list of integers)
      - output: expanded row (list of integers)
  - relationship: output_dimensions
    description: The output grid's width is double+padding the width of non zero rows.
    details:  "padding is added to keep the width consistent across all rows, rows that are all zero have double width"
  - relationship: row_mapping
    description: Each non-zero row in the input_grid maps to an expanded row in the output_grid. All zero value rows remain the same, but double width.
