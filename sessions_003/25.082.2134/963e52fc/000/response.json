Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation appears to operate on rows of the input grid. The primary operation seems to be an expansion or duplication of the non-zero rows, specifically, the rows are doubled, and padding is applied.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
