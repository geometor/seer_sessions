The input grids seem to consist primarily of the value `0` (white) with a scattering of other colors (represented by non-zero digits). The output grids are consistently 3x3, containing mostly `5` (gray) and `0` (white). The critical element appears to be identifying a specific pattern or object in the input and translating/reducing it down into the smaller output grid, effectively summarizing a key feature of the larger grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

A \"cross\" is defined as a set of contiguous non-zero pixels where all pixels touch each other at minimum diagonally, forming the visual shape of cross.\n2.  **Determine Cross Color:** Note the color (numerical value) of the pixels forming the identified cross.\n3. **Create cross center:** cross center is constructed on input, get the row and col indices for non-zero values, average them, respectively.\n4.  **Project cross center onto output:** using the averaged cross center location, project the location onto output and make it color gray.\n5. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid. All cells will have a default color of 0. Fill the center row and center column with gray (value 5). the center row number is determine using cross center row / input height \\* 3. The center column number is cross center col / input width \\* 3.\n\nIn essence, the transformation detects a \"cross\" shape of a specific color in the input, and represents a 3x3 version of it in the output grid using gray and white.\n"
