facts:
  - observation: Input grids are square and larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids are consistently 3x3 rectangles.
  - observation: Output grids contain only values 5 (gray) and 0 (white).
  - observation: Input grids contain a variety of colors, but the transformation focuses on a single color in each example.
  - object: "Cross" - A shape formed by non-zero pixels, where all non-zero pixels touch each other at least diagonally.
  - property: cross_color - The non-zero color value of the detected "cross" shape.
  - action: Identify the largest "cross" shape within the input grid.
  - action: Create 3x3 output, fill it with '5' where the cross intersect in input
  - action: default the cross size as 3x3 and use the input's cross location to project
