Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of varying dimensions, with single-digit integer values representing different colors.\n*   There are distinct objects within the grids, identifiable as contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color.\n*   The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), red (2), and yellow(4).\n*   There's a spatial relationship between objects of different colors. Some are isolated, while others are adjacent (specifically I am looking at the adjacency between color 2 and 8 in both examples.)\n*   The transformation appears to involve a duplication and potential color change of some objects.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
