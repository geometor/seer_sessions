objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (6x6 in the examples)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: single integer value
      - shape: variable
      - location: row and column indices

actions:
  - type: duplication
    properties:
      - object: contiguous_block of color 2
      - direction: towards closest adjacent object of color 8, if present.
  - type: color_change
    properties:
      - object: new cells created by duplication
      - from: red (2)
      - to: yellow (4)

relationships:
  - adjacency:
      - object1: contiguous_block of color 2
      - object2: contiguous_block of color 8
      - type: spatial proximity determining the duplication path.
