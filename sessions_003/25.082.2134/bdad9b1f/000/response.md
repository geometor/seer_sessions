Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of varying dimensions, with single-digit integer values representing different colors.
*   There are distinct objects within the grids, identifiable as contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color.
*   The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), red (2), and yellow(4).
*   There's a spatial relationship between objects of different colors. Some are isolated, while others are adjacent (specifically I am looking at the adjacency between color 2 and 8 in both examples.)
*   The transformation appears to involve a duplication and potential color change of some objects.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (6x6 in the examples)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: single integer value
      - shape: variable
      - location: row and column indices

actions:
  - type: duplication
    properties:
      - object: contiguous_block of color 2
      - direction: towards closest adjacent object of color 8, if present.
  - type: color_change
    properties:
      - object: new cells created by duplication
      - from: red (2)
      - to: yellow (4)

relationships:
  - adjacency:
      - object1: contiguous_block of color 2
      - object2: contiguous_block of color 8
      - type: spatial proximity determining the duplication path.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels with the color red (2) and azure (8).
2.  **Find Adjacency:** For each red block, determine if there's an adjacent azure block. Adjacency includes directly above, below, left, or right, not diagonal.
3.  **Duplicate and Transform:**
    *    Iterate through cells in the input grid.
    *   If the current cell is Red(2):
        *   Extend/duplicate the Red colored object towards any immediately adjacent azure object by filling the path between them with red pixels.
        *   Change one of the duplicated red pixel nearest to color 8 to yellow (4)
4. **Output:** Return the modified grid.

In example one, the red object is at the top left, azure at the top right. Duplicate red horizontally, changing the duplicated red nearest to the azure block to yellow.

In example two, the red object is at the bottom right, azure is at top-left. Duplicate red vertically, inserting the yellow pixel nearest to the azure block.
