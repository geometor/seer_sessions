The core issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Movement Logic:** The red object's expansion is not correctly implemented. It appears to be expanding *before* yellow placement and the logic for \"vertical first, then horizontal\" is not consistently applied, as the expansion in incorrect directions. Also it seems that vertical and horizontal steps must match to be correct.\n2.  **Premature and incomplete Azure Mirroring:** The azure mirroring is happening too early (before the red object is fully expanded to connect with a closest azure object), and not applied in all cases, also uses and incorrect algorithm by adding and entire vector instead of single step movements.\n3.  Incorrect yellow placement. It seems that only one movement at a time is correct, so placement of yellow should occur *after* each step.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Movement:** Re-evaluate the \"expand and connect\" logic. Focus on a step-by-step expansion, not a full vector move. Consider that only one step at a time is made. Prioritize vertical movement, then horizontal.\n2.  **Delay Mirroring:** Ensure azure mirroring happens *only after* the red expansion and yellow placement are complete for a *single* step.\n3.  **Iterative Approach:** Implement changes incrementally. Test after each significant modification to isolate the source of errors.\n4. Focus on single step movements of red, then yellow, then azure.\n5. Correct errors in mirroring.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis)**\n"

Record the original positions of the azure objects.\n2.  **Iterative Red Expansion:** For each red object, find the nearest *original* azure object.\n3.  **Single Step Expansion:** The red object expands *one step* towards the azure object. Prioritize vertical movement. If vertical movement is not possible or complete, take one step horizontally.\n4.  **Yellow Placement:** After *each* step of the red object's expansion, place a yellow (4) pixel. The yellow pixel is the one in the red object's current path (including its starting point) that is closest to the *original* position of the targeted azure object.\n5.  **Azure Mirroring:** After the red object has taken one step, *and* the yellow pixel is placed, the closest azure object mirrors this single step expansion. The expansion uses relative coordinates - e.g. if red moves up, azure moves up - if red moves right, azure moves right. If after a red move, there are multiple azure pixels that are the same distance, all of the tied azure pixels are moved.\n6. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 3-5 until the red object reaches the *original* position of the azure object (connects with original bounds). Note that there is only *one* red object expansion per iteration, and only one azure expansion per iteration, but multiple azure expansions in total are possible if multiple objects tie.\n\n"
