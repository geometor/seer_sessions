            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a limited understanding of the transformation, derived from only the first example. The subsequent tests against the second example reveal inconsistencies. The core issue is the positioning and application of the color sequence. The original logic places the sequence relative to *every* blue pixel, but doesn't consistently account for overlaps or the intended spatial arrangement.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Careful Re-examination:** Meticulously compare the input, expected output, and transformed output for both examples. Note precisely where the colors are placed and how they relate to the blue pixel(s).\n2.  **Identify the Pattern:** Determine the *exact* spatial relationship of the colored pixels (2, 6, 7, 8) to the blue pixel (1). It's not just \"around,\" but a specific pattern.\n3.  **Refine the Program:** Re-write the natural language program to precisely and unambiguously describe this pattern.\n4.  **Overlapping consideration**: check to see if the placement of colors should be considered when a pixel is already not 0.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example 1):**\n\n"

If a placement would fall outside the grid, skip that specific placement.\n4.  **Overwrite**: If a target position for a color is not 0, it is overwritten by the new color.\n5. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels values from the original input that do not have the value `1` are maintained.\n\nThe key improvement is the precise definition of the spatial relationship (up-left, left, right, down-right) and handling of grid boundaries and overwriting existing pixels. The previous version made implicit assumptions that led to incorrect placements, especially noticeable in the second example. This revised program provides a complete and unambiguous procedure.\n"
