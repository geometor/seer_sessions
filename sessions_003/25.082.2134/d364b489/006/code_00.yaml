    description: The pixel around which the transformation occurs.

    role: target
    description: Pixels added or modified around the blue pixel.
    properties:
      - color: orange
        value: 7
        relative_position: "one cell diagonally up and to the left of the blue pixel if there is no blue pixel already present; otherwise, shifted left"
      - color: red
        value: 2
        relative_position: "one cell to the left of the blue pixel, unless occupied by a 7, then shifted up"
      - color: blue
        value: 1
        relative_position: "Remains in the original position."
      - color: magenta
        value: 6
        relative_position: "one cell to the right of the blue pixel"
      - color: azure
        value: 8
        relative_position: "one cell diagonally down and to the right of the blue pixel, unless occupied by a 7; otherwise, shifted down."

actions:
  - name: place_colors
    agent: transformation_rule
    description: Places colored pixels around each blue pixel according to a specific pattern and set of rules.
    rules:
      - "If a target cell is outside the grid boundaries, skip that placement."
      - "Prioritize 7 placement on diagonal up/left; if this position is occupied by a non-0 pixel shift 2 left, 7 up"
      - "Prioritize 8 placement on diagonal down/right; if this position is occupied by a non-0 pixel shift the 8 down"
      - 'if a non-blue target cell has a value, overwrite it'
