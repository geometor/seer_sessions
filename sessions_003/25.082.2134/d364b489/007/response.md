"""
The transformation identifies each blue (1) pixel in the input grid. For each blue pixel, it attempts to place a specific sequence of colored pixels around it in the output grid.  The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The placements and their priority are as follows:

1.  **Orange (7):** Place an orange pixel one cell diagonally up and to the left of the blue pixel. If this position is occupied by another non-0 color, place a red pixel to the left of the blue pixel instead, and place an orange pixel up from the blue pixel.
2.  **Red (2):** Place a red pixel one cell to the left of the blue pixel. If already place due to rule 1, skip this placement
3.  **Blue (1):** The original blue pixel remains unchanged.
4.  **Magenta (6):** Place a magenta pixel one cell to the right of the blue pixel.
5.  **Azure (8):** Place an azure pixel one cell diagonally down and to the right of the blue pixel.  If that position contains a non-0 pixel, then place it directly below.

If any of these placements would fall outside the grid boundaries, that specific placement is skipped.  If a target cell already has a non-zero, non-blue, value, it is overwritten by the new color.
