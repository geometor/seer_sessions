For each blue pixel, it attempts to place a specific sequence of colored pixels around it in the output grid.  The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The placements and their priority are as follows:\n\n1.  **Orange (7):** Place an orange pixel one cell diagonally up and to the left of the blue pixel. If this position is occupied by another non-0 color, place a red pixel to the left of the blue pixel instead, and place an orange pixel up from the blue pixel.\n2.  **Red (2):** Place a red pixel one cell to the left of the blue pixel. If already place due to rule 1, skip this placement\n3.  **Blue (1):** The original blue pixel remains unchanged.\n4.  **Magenta (6):** Place a magenta pixel one cell to the right of the blue pixel.\n5.  **Azure (8):** Place an azure pixel one cell diagonally down and to the right of the blue pixel.  If that position contains a non-0 pixel, then place it directly below.\n\nIf any of these placements would fall outside the grid boundaries, that specific placement is skipped.  If a target cell already has a non-zero, non-blue, value, it is overwritten by the new color.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Initialize output as a copy\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    def place_pixel(r, c, color):\n      \"\"\"Helper function to place with bounds check\"\"\"\n      if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:\n            output_grid[r,c] = color\n\n    # Iterate through the input grid to find blue pixels\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 1:\n                # Apply the transformation rule for each blue pixel\n\n                # Orange (7) with adjusted placement\n                if r - 1 >= 0 and c - 1 >= 0 and output_grid[r-1, c-1] == 0:\n                    output_grid[r - 1, c - 1] = 7\n                elif c-1 >= 0 and r -1 >= 0:\n                    output_grid[r, c - 1] = 2\n                    output_grid[r-1, c] = 7\n\n                # Red (2)\n                if c - 1 >= 0 and output_grid[r, c-1] == 0:\n                  output_grid[r, c-1] = 2\n\n                # Blue (1) - remains\n                output_grid[r, c] = 1\n\n                # Magenta (6)\n                place_pixel(r, c + 1, 6)\n\n                # Azure (8)\n                if r + 1 < rows and c + 1 < cols and output_grid[r+1, c+1] == 0:\n                  output_grid[r + 1, c + 1] = 8\n                elif r+1 < rows:\n                  output_grid[r+1, c] = 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
