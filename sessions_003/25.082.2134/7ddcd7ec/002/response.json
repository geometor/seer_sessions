            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code focuses on finding the largest contiguous block of non-zero pixels and extending a diagonal line from its bottom-right corner. This works for the first example but fails for the second and third. The core issue is that the diagonal extension logic isn't universally applicable. The second example requires a diagonal in different position of the largest object, and example 3 has additional complexity. We need to shift our focus from simply extending a diagonal from the *bottom-right* to a more general rule that considers the *relative position* of the largest object and applies a transformation based on that.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples 2 & 3 Carefully:** Pinpoint *why* the current logic fails. Determine the correct diagonal starting position for each object, not just the bottom-right.\n2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for relationships between the input and output grids in *all* examples. Is it always the largest object? Is the diagonal extension direction and/or starting point consistent?\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Develop a more general and accurate description of the transformation. The current description is too specific to the first example.\n4.  **Fact Gathering:** I don't have the ability to execute code here, but the YAML block and Natural Language Program will contain the factual information of the objects, properties, and transformations.\n\n**Gather Metrics (Hypothetical - Can't run code):**\n\nI will assume access to numpy to analyze the input and expected output grids of examples 2 and 3, documenting properties and relations.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Largest Object Color: 4 (yellow)\n    *   Largest Object Size: 4\n    *   Largest Object Top-Left: (2, 4)\n    *   Largest Object Bottom-Right: (3, 5)\n    *   Diagonal Start: (2,7)\n    *   Diagonal End: (7,7)\n    *   Diagonal Color: 4 (yellow)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Largest Object Color: 7 (orange)\n    *   Largest Object Size: 4\n    *   Largest Object Top-Left: (3, 4)\n    *   Largest Object Bottom-Right: (4, 5)\n    *   Diagonal Tail Start position: (5,3)\n    *   Diagonal Tail End position: (8,0)\n    *   Diagonal Color: 7 (orange)\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The examples provide x, y, and xy diagonals, suggesting 3 distinct cases.\n\n"
