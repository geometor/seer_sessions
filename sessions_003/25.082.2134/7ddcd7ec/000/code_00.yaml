facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids are 10x10.
  - observation: The background color is always 0 (white).
  - observation: Non-zero pixels form contiguous blocks (objects).
  - object_identification:
      - train_1: A 2x2 green (3) block and a single green pixel.
      - train_2: A 2x2 yellow (4) block and two single yellow pixels.
      - train_3: A 2x2 orange (7) block and a single orange pixel.
  - action: The largest connected component (object) is identified.
  - action: A diagonal "tail" is extended from the bottom-right corner of the object.
  - action: The diagonal tail extends until the bottom/right of the frame
  - relation: The shape of initial object is preserved.
  - relation: The tail consists of single pixels of the same color as the main object.
