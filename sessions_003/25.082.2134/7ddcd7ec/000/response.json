The primary \"objects\" appear to be contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. The transformation seems to involve a combination of identifying the largest such block, potentially mirroring it, and shifting it diagonally. The background is consistently color 0 (white).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
