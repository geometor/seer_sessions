The diagonal line logic is example-specific and hardcoded, leading to failures in Examples 2 and 3. The core issue is the inconsistent starting point and direction of the diagonal extension. We need a more generalizable rule for the diagonal. The strategy will be to:\n\n1.  Verify the \"largest object\" identification is working correctly.\n2.  Abstract the diagonal extension rule. Instead of separate `if` conditions, we should derive a pattern based on relative positions of object boundaries.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using code execution where needed):**\n\nLet's gather some specific properties of the objects and their transformations. I hypothesize it copies the largest object, so I will check the size of the object, and then I'll check the dimensions of the bounding rectangle.\n\n"

A contiguous block is defined as pixels of the same color connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2.  **Copy the Object:** Copy the identified largest object to the output grid, maintaining its original shape and position.\n3.  **Extend Diagonally:** Extend a diagonal line from the object, using the object's color. The starting point and direction of the diagonal depend on the shape and position of the object:\n    *   **Case 1: Square or nearly square object:** If the object is approximately square (width and height differ by no more than 1), start the diagonal at the bottom-right corner of the object's bounding box and extend it down and to the right.\n    *  **Case 2: Wider Object:** If the object is wider than it is tall, start the diagonal one column to the right of the bounding box's top-right corner and extend down and to the right.\n    *   **Case 3: Taller Object:** If the object is taller than it is wide, start the diagonal one row below the bottom-left and one column to the left of the top-left corner of the bounding box. Extend the diagonal line down and to the left.\n4.  **Boundary Conditions:** Ensure the diagonal extension stays within the bounds of the output grid.\n\nThis program provides a more generalized approach to drawing the diagonal line. It handles different cases depending on the object's dimensions.\n"
