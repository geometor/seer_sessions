Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits (0-9), representing colors.
*   '0' (white) seems to act as a background or separator.
*   Non-zero digits appear to form the "objects" of interest.
*   The output grids are smaller than the input grids. It appears that columns are being removed.
*   The pattern of non-zero digits appears to be symmetric along a vertical and possibly horizontal axis in the input.
* The output maintains the left most, right most and central column.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: variable
      - symmetry: vertical
      -background: 0

transformations:
  - type: column_removal
    description: Removes columns from input grid.
    constraints: keep left most, right most and middle.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Columns:** Examine the input grid and take the left most, right most and central column.
2.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid using those columns.
