  - action: column_selection
    description: Selects the leftmost, rightmost, and center columns from the input grid.
    affects: output_grid width

  - action: row_selection
    description:  Selects rows based on the positions of non-zero elements in specific input columns.
    affects: output_grid height

  - transformation_rule: |
     The output grid always has 3 columns: the leftmost, center, and
     rightmost columns of the input grid.  
     The rows included in the output grid are determined by the rows where 
     there is a non-zero pixel in the leftmost, center, or rightmost 
     columns of the input grid. Only these selected rows are kept, 
     in their original order, to produce the output grid.
