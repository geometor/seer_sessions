Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a single example and, as expected, doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issue is that the `intermediate_grid` is constructed incorrectly and the row selection logic isn't extracting rows based on the overall structure of the problem. It seems to select *all* key columns and *all* rows that have uniform non-zero colors in *any* of the key columns.

The problem description dictates the output grids always include the leftmost, center and right most columns and a row is included in the output if and only if, *for each* of the selected columns, *all* non zero pixels *within that row in the corresponding column* of the input grid have the same value.

The current code incorrectly implements selecting the rows.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct `_check_row`:** The logic in `_check_row` needs to ensure we're only considering the non-zero pixels *within the specified column* and not across the *entire row*.
2. **Correct Row Extraction in `transform`**: Row extraction needs to only include the rows that satisfy the condition in all the selected columns, not any.
3. **Verify Intermediate Grid**: ensure the intermediate grid construction is correct.

**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**

Let's get some metrics on the input and output sizes to confirm our understanding of the expected transformations.

    input: input_grid
    output: intermediate_grid

  - name: select_rows
    description: >
      Selects rows where, for each key column, all non-zero pixels within that row in the corresponding column of the input grid have the same value.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Columns:** Determine the indices of the key columns: the leftmost (index 0), the rightmost (index `width - 1`), and the center column (index `width // 2`). If the grid has only one column, the key column is [0]. If the grid has two columns, the key columns are [0, 1].

2.  **Create Intermediate Grid:** Create a subgrid (intermediate grid) consisting of only the key columns from the input grid.

3.  **Select Rows Based on Column Consistency:** Iterate through each row of the *input* grid. For each row, check if it meets the following criteria:
    *   For *each* key column:
        *   Examine only the cells *within the current key column* and the *current row*.
        *   Gather all *non-zero* values.
        *   If all collected non-zero values are identical, the row satisfies the condition for this column.
    *   If a row satisfies the column condition for *all* key columns, add its index to the `selected_rows` list.

4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Build the final output grid. The output grid will have the same number of columns as the `intermediate_grid`. Include only the rows from the `intermediate_grid` whose indices are present in `selected_rows`. Maintain original row order.
