The background is consistently white (0).  There are sparse, single-pixel objects of various colors scattered within the grid. The key observation is that in some cases, rows containing two non-zero pixels, which are not white, get replicated across the entire row, while others remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
