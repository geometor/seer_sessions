The transformation identifies all adjacent pairs of identical, non-zero value pixels in the input grid. These pairs are considered to potentially belong to "L" shapes. 
The algorithm selects "L" shapes of only *one* color, and arranges them in the output grid, potentially with transformations like rotations and empty space insertion.
