Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid of digits (representing colors) into a smaller grid. The output grids seem to be composed of specific color patterns extracted and rearranged from the input grids. There's a strong emphasis on the spatial arrangement and repetition of colors. It appears that non-zero colored pixels in the input are selected based on a specific spatial logic to construct output grids. The input grids have larger dimensions and more zero-valued pixels, while output grids are dense.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns), smaller than input_grid

  - relation: transformation
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: spatial_pattern_extraction_and_rearrangement
      - details:  Selects and rearranges non-zero pixels from the input grid to form the output grid.

  - action: selection_rule
    agent: transformation_logic
    description: Identify a pattern or criterion to determine which pixels in the input grid will construct the output grid. It observes to extract two non-zero horizontally adjacent elements in input grid and uses them to form an L shape in the output grid.

  - action: build_output
    agent: transformation_logic
    description: The selected pixels in the selection rule are arranged at the beginning of the output grid to form the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pairs:** Scan the input grid to locate pairs of horizontally adjacent, non-zero pixels that have the same value.
2.  **Extract and Rotate:** For each identified pair, extract these two pixels. Imagine these two pixels as the horizontal bar of an "L" shape.
3. **Create L shape**: Build the rest of "L". First add identical value below first element of the horizontal bar.
4. **Build output:** Build the output grid using detected shapes, stacking them on top of each other, towards the upper-left. All other cells are zero.

In summary, the transformation identifies pairs of adjacent identical numbers, creates L shape from each identified pair and uses those L shaped elements to fill the output grid.
