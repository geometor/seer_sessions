The output grids seem to be composed of specific color patterns extracted and rearranged from the input grids. There's a strong emphasis on the spatial arrangement and repetition of colors. It appears that non-zero colored pixels in the input are selected based on a specific spatial logic to construct output grids. The input grids have larger dimensions and more zero-valued pixels, while output grids are dense.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Imagine these two pixels as the horizontal bar of an \"L\" shape.\n3. **Create L shape**: Build the rest of \"L\". First add identical value below first element of the horizontal bar.\n4. **Build output:** Build the output grid using detected shapes, stacking them on top of each other, towards the upper-left. All other cells are zero.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies pairs of adjacent identical numbers, creates L shape from each identified pair and uses those L shaped elements to fill the output grid.\n"
