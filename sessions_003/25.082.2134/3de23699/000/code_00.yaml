facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns), smaller than input_grid

  - relation: transformation
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: spatial_pattern_extraction_and_rearrangement
      - details:  Selects and rearranges non-zero pixels from the input grid to form the output grid.

  - action: selection_rule
    agent: transformation_logic
    description: Identify a pattern or criterion to determine which pixels in the input grid will construct the output grid. It observes to extract two non-zero horizontally adjacent elements in input grid and uses them to form an L shape in the output grid.

  - action: build_output
    agent: transformation_logic
    description: The selected pixels in the selection rule are arranged at the beginning of the output grid to form the output grid.
