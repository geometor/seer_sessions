"""
The transformation identifies connected components in the input grid, extracts specific components, and arranges them in the output grid, preserving their original colors. The transformation rule prioritizes extracting: 1) four single-pixel objects of the same color, and if present, 2)  the largest non-single-pixel objects. The arrangement depends on specific examples: Example 1 places an L-shape in the top-left, Example 2 arranges 2x2 shapes side-by-side, Example 3 maps an L-shape to the top-left, and Example 4 rotates and positions a 2x2 shape at the top-left with additional single pixels.
