Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the results of the current code, along with a strategy for improvement:

**General Assessment:**

The current code attempts to identify connected components, extract them, and arrange them in a new grid. It handles color mapping and even attempts rotation in some cases. However, the results show significant discrepancies with the expected outputs across all examples. The main issues appear to be:

1.  **Incorrect Component Extraction and Arrangement:** The logic for positioning the extracted components in the output grid is flawed. It seems to assume a top-to-bottom arrangement in most cases, with a special case for side-by-side arrangement, but this is not consistent with all examples.
2.  **Incomplete Color Mapping:** While some color mappings are handled, there's likely a more systematic relationship between input and output colors. The color mapping, which previously appeared ad-hoc, now shows color preservation.
3.  **Rotation Logic Issues:** The rotation logic is applied based on specific color and bounding box dimensions, which is too restrictive and not generalizable. Example 4 requires a more complex analysis. The rotation also appears to be applied in the context of the global grid rather than a shape's local coordinate system, causing a translation.
4.  **Inconsistent Shape Extraction**: Example 2's expected output should have two 3s, but there are 4. Example 3 also produces the wrong shape and size.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Component Extraction:** Ensure that the `get_connected_component` and `find_all_connected_components` functions are correctly identifying all distinct objects. Verify this with visual inspection of the components found in each example.
2.  **Generalized Arrangement Logic:** Abandon the current row-offset and column-offset approach. Instead, analyze the *relative* positions of components in the input and output. Determine a consistent rule for how these relative positions are transformed (e.g., top-left corner becomes the new origin, relative distances and orientations are preserved or changed according to a rule).
3.  **Revisit Rotation:** Example 4 is the only example showing clear rotation. Investigate how to make rotation more general - try different rotation angles (90, 180, 270) within the shape's local coordinate system to see how well we can match the expected output. The current logic of rotating the 8s needs revisiting.
4. **Revisit the Color Mapping**: We assumed earlier that the transformation was 2->4, 8->8. After inspecting example 2 where color 2 maps to 4 and example 4 where color 8 is preserved, we know that this is not accurate and is more complex than previously assumed. It seems like the color is being preserved unless the input contains a 2.
5. **Output Grid Size**: Determine if the size is based on the sum, multiple, or another function of the input component bounding boxes.

**Gather Metrics and Validate Assumptions:**

I will use code execution to analyze each example and extract the following:

*   List of connected components (with their color/value and pixel coordinates).
*   Bounding box of each component.
*   Relative positions of components within the input grid.
*   Verify expected relative positions of components in the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Components:** Find all connected components (objects) in the input grid. Each object is a group of adjacent pixels with the same color. Note single pixels.
2.  **Object Extraction:** Extract each identified object from the input grid.
3.  **Color Preservation**: Preserve the original colors.
4. **Arrangement:** Arrange extracted objects to form the output:
    *   If the input contains single-pixel objects of a certain color and there are four of them (like color 4 in Example 1, color 3 in Example 2, and color 8 in Example 4), extract all the connected components.
    * In Example 1, extract the L shape and map to color 4.
    *   In Example 2, extract the 2x2 shape and place it at the top left and shift it to the right; each of them is mapped to color 3.
    *  In Example 3, extract the L-shape and map it to color 6.
    *   In Example 4, extract the 2x2 and 1x1 objects and rotate and arrange as 8. The large object in the output corresponds to the 2x2. The two single pixels are at the lower right.
5.  **Output Grid:** Create an output grid large enough to hold the arranged objects.

**Revised Strategy (more specific):**

Based on the analysis and YAML facts, the core transformation rule appears to involve these steps:

1. **Find all objects.**
2. **Determine Transformation based on object type**
    - Single pixels are extracted.
    - The largest objects are extracted.
3. **Preserve Color.**
4. **Rearrange**
    * If the objects include 4 single pixels of same color, arrange non-single pixel objects based on examples.
    * Example 1: the L shape is mapped to top-left.
    * Example 2: The 2x2s are placed side by side.
    * Example 3: The L shape is mapped to the top-left.
    * Example 4: The 2x2 is rotated and placed at top-left. The single pixels are placed based on example.

The next step is to implement this refined program in Python code.
