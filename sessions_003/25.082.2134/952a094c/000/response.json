Original columns position from the right edge, becomes the mirrored column position from the left edge.\n    *   If original pixel row < horizontal\\_line row, then the pixel moves to `horizontal_line row - 1`.\n    *   If original pixel row > horizontal\\_line row, then the pixel moves to `horizontal\\_line row + 1`.\n    * The color of the moved pixel, remains unchanged.\n\n4.  **Construct the output grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input. Copy the identified horizontal line to its original position. Place the moved pixels in their new positions. All other cells in the output grid are black (0).\n"
