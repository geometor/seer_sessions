Note the row index and the color of this line.\n\n2.  **Find Single Pixels:** Identify all \"single pixels\" in the input grid. A single pixel is defined as a non-black pixel that has no adjacent non-black pixels (no neighbors horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n\n3.  **Reflect Single Pixels:** For each identified single pixel:\n    *   Calculate its `mirrored_col`: The column index mirrored across the center of the grid.  This is calculated as `grid_width - 1 - original_column`.\n    *   Determine its `new_row` based on its original row and the horizontal line's row:\n        *   If the single pixel's original row is *above* the horizontal line, its `new_row` is the same distance *below* the horizontal line.\n        *   If the single pixel's original row is *below* the horizontal line, its `new_row` is the same distance *above* the horizontal line.\n        * If the pixel's original row is *on* the horizontal line it is not moved, and ignored.\n    *   Retain the single pixel's original color.\n\n4.  **Create Output:** Construct a new grid (initially all black) with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n    *   Place the horizontal line in its original position, color and length.\n    *   Copy each reflected single pixel to its `new_row` and `mirrored_col` in the output grid, keeping the pixel color.\n\n5. **Ignore out of bounds:** If a single pixel reflection would place the pixel outside the bounds of the grid, then ignore that pixel, and do not move/copy it to the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_horizontal_line(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the longest horizontal line of contiguous pixels of the same color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    longest_line = []\n    longest_line_row = -1\n    longest_line_color = 0\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        current_line = []\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0:\n                current_line.append((r, c, grid[r,c]))\n            else:\n                if len(current_line) > len(longest_line):\n                    longest_line = current_line\n                    longest_line_row = r\n                    if(len(current_line) > 0):\n                        longest_line_color = current_line[0][2] #color\n                current_line = []\n        if len(current_line) > len(longest_line):\n            longest_line = current_line\n            longest_line_row = r\n            if(len(current_line) > 0):\n                longest_line_color = current_line[0][2]\n    return longest_line, longest_line_row, longest_line_color\n\ndef is_single_pixel(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a pixel is a single, isolated pixel (not part of a larger object).\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    if grid[r, c] == 0:\n        return False\n\n    for i in range(-1, 2):\n        for j in range(-1, 2):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + i, c + j\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] != 0:\n                return False  # Connected to another non-black pixel\n    return True\n\ndef find_single_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"get a list of single pixels\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    single_pixels = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if is_single_pixel(grid, r, c):\n                single_pixels.append( (r,c, grid[r,c]) )\n    return single_pixels\n\ndef mirrored_column(c, cols):\n    \"\"\"calculate the mirrored column\"\"\"\n    return cols - 1 - c\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the rules described above.\"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n\n    # 1.
