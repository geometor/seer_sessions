"""
1.  **Find Horizontal Line:** Identify the longest horizontal line of contiguous pixels of the same color in the input grid. Note the row index and the color of this line.

2.  **Find Single Pixels:** Identify all "single pixels" in the input grid. A single pixel is defined as a non-black pixel that has no adjacent non-black pixels (no neighbors horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

3.  **Reflect Single Pixels:** For each identified single pixel:
    *   Calculate its `mirrored_col`: The column index mirrored across the center of the grid.  This is calculated as `grid_width - 1 - original_column`.
    *   Determine its `new_row` based on its original row and the horizontal line's row:
        *   If the single pixel's original row is *above* the horizontal line, its `new_row` is the same distance *below* the horizontal line.
        *   If the single pixel's original row is *below* the horizontal line, its `new_row` is the same distance *above* the horizontal line.
        * If the pixel's original row is *on* the horizontal line it is not moved, and ignored.
    *   Retain the single pixel's original color.

4.  **Create Output:** Construct a new grid (initially all black) with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    *   Place the horizontal line in its original position, color and length.
    *   Copy each reflected single pixel to its `new_row` and `mirrored_col` in the output grid, keeping the pixel color.

5. **Ignore out of bounds:** If a single pixel reflection would place the pixel outside the bounds of the grid, then ignore that pixel, and do not move/copy it to the output.
