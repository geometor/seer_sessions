"""
1.  **Identify the longest horizontal line:** Find the longest horizontal line of contiguous pixels of the same color in the input grid. Note the row index, color, and length of this line.

2.  **Identify all non-black pixels *not* part of the longest horizontal line:** Find all pixels in the input grid that meet these conditions:
    *   Their color is not black (0).
    *   They are not part of the longest horizontal line identified in step 1.

3. **Reflect non-line Pixels**: For each non-line pixel identified in step 2, reflect them:
   *   Mirror Column: Calculate the mirrored column index (`mirrored_col`): The column index mirrored across the center of the grid.  This is calculated as `grid_width - 1 - original_column`.
    *    Calculate `new_row` based on the original row and the horizontal line's row:
        *    If the single pixel's original row is *above* the horizontal line, its `new_row` is the same distance *below* the horizontal line.
        *   If the single pixel's original row is *below* the horizontal line, its `new_row` is the same distance *above* the horizontal line.
        * If the pixel's original row is *on* the horizontal line it is not moved, and ignored.
   *  Retain the non-line pixel's original color.

4.  **Create Output:** Construct a new grid (initially all black) with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    *   Place the horizontal line in its original position, color and length.
    *   Copy each reflected non-line pixel to its `new_row` and `mirrored_col` in the output grid, keeping the pixel color.

5. **Ignore out of bounds:** If a non-line pixel reflection results in the pixel exceeding the bounds of the output grid, then ignore it.
