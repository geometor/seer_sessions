Specifically, the new colors appear to be based on the concept of finding distinct gray objects, where the azure are on the border of the orignal grey object and replace them, while the red split the grey object down the middle with a vertical line.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Replace these gray pixels with azure (8) pixels.\n\n3.  **Replace Vertical Middle with Red:** For each gray object, identify a vertical line of pixels splitting the grey object as close to the middle as possible. Replace those grey pixels with red (2) pixels.
