"""
1.  **Identify Gray Objects:** Locate all distinct contiguous regions (objects) of gray (5) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Replace Border with Azure:** For each identified gray object, determine its complete border.  The border consists of all gray pixels that have at least one adjacent (up, down, left, or right) pixel that is *not* gray. Replace all identified border pixels with azure (8).

3.  **Replace Vertical Midline with Red:** For each identified gray object:
    *   Find the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by the object's gray pixels.
    *   Calculate the middle column index: `mid_col = (min_col + max_col) // 2`.
    *   Replace all gray pixels within the object that fall on the `mid_col` with red (2).

4. **Create Output:** The output grid is a copy of the input grid with the described replacements. All non-gray pixels in the input remain unchanged.
