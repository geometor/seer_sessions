Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The code partially works, implementing the border replacement with azure and the midline replacement with red. However, there are errors in the exact placement and handling of these replacements, especially regarding the midline. The code also has some redundant calculations and could be simplified. It appears the algorithm has minor bugs, and the errors show an issue with correctly identifying the midline and applying the operations consistently.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** We need to pinpoint the *exact* pixels that differ between the expected and transformed outputs. This is crucial for debugging. I expect the errors are related to fencepost issues, off-by-one, and misinterpretations of the midline.
2.  **Object Property Analysis:** Use a tool to go through each example and gather: the coordinates of grey regions, border and midline coordinates calculated by functions in `code_00.py`, coordinates of the differences between expected and transformed outputs, and any other relevant geometric properties.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the error analysis, we will adjust the natural language description to be more precise, especially about which pixels constitute the "midline" and under what conditions replacements occur.

**Gather Metrics (using tool_code):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Objects:** Locate all distinct, contiguous regions (objects) of gray (color 5) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Border Replacement:** For each identified gray object:
    *   Find the border pixels. A border pixel is any gray pixel that has at least one immediate neighbor (up, down, left, or right) that is *not* a gray pixel.
    *   Replace all border pixels of the gray object with azure (color 8).
3. **Midline Replacement:** For each identified gray object:
    * find the vertical center:
      * Find the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by gray pixels within the object.
      * Calculate the midline column index: `mid_col = (min_col + max_col) // 2`.
      * replace pixels on the vertical center with red (color 2)
        * If there are gray pixels in the object at that `mid_col` index, and if there are an *odd* number of columns in the object:
          * Replace all gray pixels within the object that fall on the midline column (`mid_col`) with red (color 2).
        * If there are an even number of columns:
           * replace *all* gray pixels in columns `mid_col` AND `mid_col + 1`
4.  **Output:** Create a new output grid, initially a copy of the input grid. Apply the border and midline replacements to this new grid. Pixels that were not gray in the input grid remain unchanged.
