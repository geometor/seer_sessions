A border pixel is any gray pixel that has at least one immediate neighbor (up, down, left, or right) that is *not* a gray pixel.\n    *   Replace all border pixels of the gray object with azure (color 8).\n3. **Midline Replacement:** For each identified gray object:\n    * find the vertical center:\n      * Find the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by gray pixels within the object.\n      * Calculate the midline column index: `mid_col = (min_col + max_col) // 2`.\n      * replace pixels on the vertical center with red (color 2)\n        * If there are gray pixels in the object at that `mid_col` index, and if there are an *odd* number of columns in the object:\n          * Replace all gray pixels within the object that fall on the midline column (`mid_col`) with red (color 2).\n        * If there are an even number of columns:\n           * replace *all* gray pixels in columns `mid_col` AND `mid_col + 1`\n4.  **Output:** Create a new output grid, initially a copy of the input grid. Apply the border and midline replacements to this new grid. Pixels that were not gray in the input grid remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Find contiguous objects of a given color.\"\"\"\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_object):\n        \"\"\"Depth-first search to find contiguous pixels.\"\"\"\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= grid.shape[0]\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= grid.shape[1]\n            or visited[row, col]\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_object.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, current_object)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and not visited[row, col]:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef get_object_border(object_pixels, grid_shape):\n    \"\"\"Get the border pixels of an object.\"\"\"\n    border_pixels = []\n    for r, c in object_pixels:\n        neighbors = [(r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1)]\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if (nr < 0 or nr >= grid_shape[0] or nc < 0 or nc >= grid_shape[1] or (nr, nc) not in object_pixels):\n                border_pixels.append((r,c))\n                break #pixel is a border if one neighbor isn't the right color\n    return list(set(border_pixels))  # Remove duplicates\n\n\ndef get_vertical_midline_pixels(object_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Get all pixels on the vertical midline of an object.\"\"\"\n    cols = [c for r, c in object_pixels]\n    min_col = min(cols)\n    max_col = max(cols)\n    mid_col = (min_col + max_col) // 2\n    width = max_col - min_col + 1\n    if width % 2 == 1:\n      return [(r, c) for r, c in object_pixels if c == mid_col]\n    else:\n      return [(r,c) for r, c in object_pixels if c == mid_col or c == mid_col + 1]\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    grid_shape = input_grid.shape\n\n    # find grey objects\n    gray_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 5)\n\n    # replace gray pixels at object borders with azure\n    for obj in gray_objects:\n        border = get_object_border(obj, grid_shape)\n        for r, c in border:\n            output_grid[r, c] = 8\n    \n    # replace gray pixels at vertical middle with red\n    for obj in gray_objects:\n        middle_pixels = get_vertical_midline_pixels(obj)\n        for r, c in middle_pixels:\n            output_grid[r, c] = 2\n    \n    return output_grid\n```"
