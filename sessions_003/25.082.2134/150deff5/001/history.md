Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes, with cells containing numerical values representing colors.
*   The primary color in the input grids is gray (5).
*   The output grids introduce two new colors: azure (8) and red (2).
*   The transformation seems to involve replacing some of the gray pixels with azure and red pixels.
*   The placement of the new colors appears to be related to the arrangement of the original gray pixels. Specifically, the new colors appear to be based on the concept of finding distinct gray objects, where the azure are on the border of the orignal grey object and replace them, while the red split the grey object down the middle with a vertical line.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: gray_object
    type: contiguous_block
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - shape: irregular
      - size: variable

  - name: azure_object
    type: contiguous_block
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - shape: follows gray_object border
      - size: variable

  - name: red_object
    type: contiguous_block
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - shape: vertical line
      - size: variable
      - location: middle of grey objects

actions:
  - name: replace
    agent: system
    target: gray_object pixels
    replacement: azure_object or red_object pixels
    rules:
      - condition: gray_object border
        replacement: azure_object
      - condition: grey_object middle vertical
        replacement: red_object

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    object1: azure_object
    object2: gray_object
    description: azure pixels replace border of gray object.

  - type: spatial
    object1: red_object
    object2: gray_object
    description: red pixels replace vertical middle of gray object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Replace Borders with Azure:** For each identified gray object, locate the border/edge of the grey object. Replace these gray pixels with azure (8) pixels.

3.  **Replace Vertical Middle with Red:** For each gray object, identify a vertical line of pixels splitting the grey object as close to the middle as possible. Replace those grey pixels with red (2) pixels. If a grey object is one pixel wide, it's considered its own middle.

4.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the replaced azure and red pixels, keeping all other pixels (white (0) in this case) the same as the input.
