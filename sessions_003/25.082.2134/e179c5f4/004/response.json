            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for moving forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a pattern observed in the first training example, and it correctly reproduced that example. However, it failed to generalize to the second and third examples. The core issue is that the initial logic was too simplistic, focusing on a strict alternating pattern of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels. It seems the placement of the azure pixels is more complex and depends on the width of the grid. The provided code assumes simple checkerboard alternation, which does NOT hold true for all examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine the differences between the \"Expected Output\" and \"Transformed Output\" for examples 2 and 3. We want to find exactly *where* the errors occur and, if possible, deduce a rule for the *correct* placement of azure and blue.\n2.  **Refine Pattern Recognition:** The revised natural language program must account for the width-dependent pattern. The description needs to be adjusted to accommodate the \"staggered\" pattern seen, particularly in example 2 and 3.\n3.  **Hypothesis and Test:** Formulate a refined hypothesis for the pattern and express that as an updated natural language program.\n4.  Consider creating auxiliary functions to handle recurring sub-tasks, for example, a function to help determine color based on position and neighbors.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nBecause I am in the \"dreamer\" role, I will outline the data gathering that's important, and what I expect to determine. I am expecting the \"coder\" role to perform the calculations and provide results.\n\n1. Input/output grid dimensions for all examples.\n    *   Expect: The dimensions should match between input and corresponding output.\n2. Number and proportion of 1s (blue) and 8s (azure) in expected output.\n     *   Expect: See if the proportion of blue to azure changes or has a formula based in width or height.\n3. Location of incorrect pixels in each non-matching example.\n    *   Expect: This will be the key. By providing row and column indices, it will allow for determination of the pattern for more complex examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
