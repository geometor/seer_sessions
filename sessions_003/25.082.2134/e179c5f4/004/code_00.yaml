      errors:
        - "some azure (8) pixels are placed incorrectly in even numbered rows (counting up from the bottom, zero-indexed), starting in the 3rd column"

      errors:
        - "azure (8) pixels are placed incorrectly throughout, the pattern is a repeating offset checkerboard"
  - general:
      - "The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid."
      - "The bottom-left pixel of the output grid is always blue (1)."
      - "The rest of the output grid is filled with an alternating pattern of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels which seems to 'shift' based on the width of the grid and the position of colors in the prior row."
