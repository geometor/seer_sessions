1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled initially with zeros.
2.  **Bottom-Left Start:** Set the bottom-left pixel of the output grid to blue (1).
3.  **Iterative Pattern Filling:** Iterate through the output grid row by row, from bottom to top (rows) and left to right (columns):
    *   If it is the bottom-left pixel, skip (already set).

    *   If in the first row from the bottom: place alternating 8 and 1.

    *  Otherwise:
        * Examine a 2x2 sub-grid that ends with the pixel being filled.
        * If all other pixels are the same, place the opposite color.
        * If mixed, then place 8.

4. **Return:** Return the filled output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was based on a single example, and as expected, it doesn't perfectly generalize to the other examples. The core idea of alternating colors and using a 2x2 subgrid for context is partially correct, but the specific rules for applying the colors need adjustment. The provided code handles edge cases related to going out of bound. We need to adjust the conditions to better model when to place 8 vs 1 and how edge cases should be handled.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine the differences between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` for each example. Identify the specific pixels that are incorrect and try to understand *why* the current logic failed in those cases.

2.  **Refine Rules:** Based on the error analysis, modify the conditions within the natural language program. It is crucial to focus on these points:
    *   The bottom row alternation is 1,8,1,8,...
    *   Check how exactly the 2x2 subgrid method works.
    * Check how the single value at the bottom left of the input propagates
      through the rest of the grid.
    * See what happens to the pattern when the width is changed.

3.  **Iterative Improvement:** The strategy should be implemented, tested on the training examples.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary):**

Let's build a summary table, focusing on each example, manually observing properties.

| Example | Grid Size    | Pixels Off | Bottom Row Correct? | 2x2 Logic Consistent? | Notes                                                        |
| :------ | :----------- | :--------- | :----------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 10x2         | 4          | Yes                | No                     | Almost correct columns. |
| 2       | 10x3         | 10         | No                 | No                     | Errors in the first row from bottom.  |
| 3       | 10x4         | 13         | No                 | No                     | Errors in the first row from bottom.   |

```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled initially with zeros.

2.  **Bottom-Left Start:** Set the bottom-left pixel of the output grid to blue (1).

3.  **Iterative Pattern Filling:** Iterate through the output grid row by row, from bottom to top (rows) and left to right (columns):

    *   If it is the bottom-left pixel, skip (already set).

    *   If in the first row from the bottom: place alternating 1 and 8. Starting with 1 in the first position, then place an 8 in the next position, continuing to alternate.

    *   Otherwise (for rows above the bottom row):

        *   Consider the pixel directly below the current position, call this y.
        *   If y is 1 then place 8.
        *   If y is 8 then:
            * Consider the pixel to the left and one row down, call this x.
            * If x is 1: place 1.
            * if x is 8: place 8.
            * if x is not available (out of bounds): place 1.

4.  **Return:** Return the filled output grid.
