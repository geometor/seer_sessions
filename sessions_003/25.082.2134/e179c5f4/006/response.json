            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was based on a single example, and as expected, it doesn't perfectly generalize to the other examples. The core idea of alternating colors and using a 2x2 subgrid for context is partially correct, but the specific rules for applying the colors need adjustment. The provided code handles edge cases related to going out of bound. We need to adjust the conditions to better model when to place 8 vs 1 and how edge cases should be handled.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine the differences between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` for each example. Identify the specific pixels that are incorrect and try to understand *why* the current logic failed in those cases.\n\n2.  **Refine Rules:** Based on the error analysis, modify the conditions within the natural language program. It is crucial to focus on these points:\n    *   The bottom row alternation is 1,8,1,8,...\n    *   Check how exactly the 2x2 subgrid method works.\n    * Check how the single value at the bottom left of the input propagates\n      through the rest of the grid.\n    * See what happens to the pattern when the width is changed.\n\n3.  **Iterative Improvement:** The strategy should be implemented, tested on the training examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary):**\n\nLet's build a summary table, focusing on each example, manually observing properties.\n\n| Example | Grid Size    | Pixels Off | Bottom Row Correct? | 2x2 Logic Consistent? | Notes                                                        |\n| :------ | :----------- | :--------- | :----------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 10x2         | 4          | Yes                | No                     | Almost correct columns. |\n| 2       | 10x3         | 10         | No                 | No                     | Errors in the first row from bottom.  |\n| 3       | 10x4         | 13         | No                 | No                     | Errors in the first row from bottom.   |\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
