facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is predominantly white (0) with a single blue (1) pixel at the bottom-left corner.
  - object_identification: |
      The blue (1) pixel is the primary object of interest.
  - transformation_type: |
      The transformation expands the grid and creates an alternating pattern.
  - pattern_description: |
      The output grid contains alternating blue (1) and azure (8) pixels.
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The bottom-left pixel of the input becomes a part of the alternating pattern in the output.  The blue pixel of the input is the anchor for the pattern.
  - size_relationship: |
       The output grid's height is always 10, same as input. The output's width is input's width times 2.
  - color_mapping: |
      Input color 0 (white) is not present in the output.
      Input color 1 (blue) is present in output.
      Output color 8 (azure) is introduced.
