The output grid alternates blue (1) and azure (8) pixels, creating a checkerboard-like pattern. The size of the output grid appears directly related to the width of the input. The location of the initial blue pixel seems to anchor the pattern, dictating the starting point of the alternation.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The blue pixel of the input is the anchor for the pattern.\n  - size_relationship: |\n       The output grid's height is always 10, same as input. The output's width is input's width times 2.\n  - color_mapping: |\n      Input color 0 (white) is not present in the output.\n      Input color 1 (blue) is present in output.\n      Output color 8 (azure) is introduced.\n\n```"

The output grid has twice the width of the input grid.\n\n3.  **Generate Alternating Pattern:** Starting from the bottom-left corner, propagate the blue (1) and azure (8) values using the row index of the grid. The first value in each row is determined by the parity (even=8/odd=1), and all other elements of each row alternates between 8 and 1.\n\n4. **Construct output:** Populate the output grid with the generated alternating colors, ensuring the blue pixel from the input is incorporated into the pattern.\n\nIn summary:  The blue pixel becomes part of the alternating pattern starting from the bottom left corner of the output. White is replaced by the alternating sequence. The height stays the same. The width increases by a factor of two.\n"
