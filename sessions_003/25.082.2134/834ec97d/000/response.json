The primary element seems to be a single, non-zero pixel within each input grid. This non-zero pixel appears to trigger the generation of a specific pattern in the output grid. The background (0 or white pixels) seems to remain largely unchanged, except where the new pattern is introduced.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The length depends on the starting row (row index).\n4.  **Preserve the background:** All other pixels in the output grid retain the same value as their corresponding pixels in the input grid (which will be 0).\n\nEssentially, the non-zero pixel acts as a \"seed\" for generating, what looks like, a column of 4s above it in the output grid, based on the seed position.
