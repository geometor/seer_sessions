facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains: single non-zero pixel
      - background: 0 (white)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains: pattern of 4 (yellow) pixels
      - pattern_origin:  row above the non-zero pixel in input_grid
      - background: same as input_grid (0/white, except where the pattern is)
      - pattern: vertical line, size= non-zero number row index

  - relation: pattern_generation
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    properties:
      - trigger: non-zero pixel in input_grid
      - rule: "A vertical line of 4 (yellow) pixels is created above the non zero pixel, repeating for that many rows."
