            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the errors in the generated code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding of the transformation, primarily derived from the first training example. The subsequent tests reveal discrepancies. The core issue is that the vertical yellow lines should extend to the row *before* the shifted non-zero pixel, not just based on the original row index of the non zero pixel.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will examine each input/output/transformed output triplet, focusing on:\n    *   The position of the initial non-zero pixel.\n    *   The position of the shifted non-zero pixel in the output.\n    *   The height and placement of the yellow lines.\n\n2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the comprehensive analysis, I will reconstruct the natural language program to accurately capture the transformation logic, including the relationship between the non-zero pixel's position and the yellow lines.\n3.  **Fact Documentation in YAML** Create a YAML that correctly describes the facts.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nI'll use a more narrative approach to analyze, to create a solid record for the next step.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input non-zero pixel: (0, 1), value: 2\n    *   Output non-zero pixel: (1, 1), value: 2\n    *   Yellow lines: Column 0, height 1 (stopping *before* row 1). The original program did not draw yellow in column 2.\n    * The yellow is at (0,0).\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input non-zero pixel: (2, 2), value: 6\n    *   Output non-zero pixel: (3, 2), value: 6\n    *   Yellow lines: Columns 0, 2, and 4; height 3 (stopping *before* row 3).\n    * The yellow is at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input non-zero pixel: (4, 2), value: 9\n    *   Output non-zero pixel: (5, 2), value: 9\n    *   Yellow lines: Columns 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8; height 5 (stopping *before* row 5).\n    * The yellow is at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

The height (number of pixels) in each yellow line should be equal to the row number of the shifted pixel.\n\n4.  **Empty Grid:** If the input grid contains no non-zero pixels, return an all-zero grid of the same dimensions.\n"
