objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - shape: rectangular (rows x cols)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - shape: rectangular (10 x 10)

    type: object
    properties:
      - color: integer (not 0)
      - shape: rectangular
      - position: top-left corner of input_grid
      - border: single line of different color, to the right and below

    description: The input grid pattern is repeated twice horizontally in the top-left corner of the output grid.
  - name: extend_rectangle
    description: The rectangular region of color (excluding the border) in the input is extended in output, while maintaining the color pattern.
  - name: fill_remaining
    description: The rest of the output_grid is filled based on the rectangle's border color.

relationships:
  - input_grid is transformed into output_grid.
  - rectangle is a subregion of input_grid.
  - border_color is adjacent to rectangle.
  - output_grid contains repetitions of input_grid patterns and extended regions.
