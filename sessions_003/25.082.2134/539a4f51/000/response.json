There's a noticeable pattern of a rectangular block of a single color in the top-left, bordered by a single line of another color, and the rest of the input filled with 0 (white).\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are larger (10x10) and appear to be constructed by repeating the input pattern, followed by extending the bordered rectangle pattern in the input. The 0s in the input are changed, seemingly replaced with the color pattern of the rectangle's bordering color.\n*  The height of the input rectangle is always one less than its width.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
