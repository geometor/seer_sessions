objects:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of integer values representing colors.
    properties:
      - rows: variable
      - columns: variable
      - values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # Possible pixel values (colors)

  - name: red_pixel
    description: A pixel with the value 2 (red).
    properties:
      - row: integer
      - column: integer

  - name: gray_pixel
    description: A pixel with the value 5 (gray).
    properties:
      - row: integer
      - column: integer

actions:
  - name: identify_pattern
    description: Find the columns containing red pixels in the bottom row of the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: list of column indices

  - name: replicate_pattern
    description: Create red pixels in the output grid, replicating the pattern from the bottom row vertically.
    input: output_grid, red_column_indices
    output: modified output_grid

  - name: place_gray_pixels
    description:  Gray pixels from the input grid are placed in the output grid based on their original position and the replicated red pattern. The gray pixels maintain their row. Gray pixels that are to the right of a red pixel move one unit to the left.
    input: input_grid, output_grid
    output: modified output_grid
