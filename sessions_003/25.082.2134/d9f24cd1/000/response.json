Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of the Elements**\n\n*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (10x10 in both examples).\n*   The grids primarily contain the value 0 (white).\n*   There are occurrences of the values 2 (red) and 5 (gray).\n*   The red pixels appear in a consistent pattern in the bottom row of the input.\n*   The gray pixels seem to maintain their relative positions, but are possibly \"shifted\" or \"duplicated\" in the transformation between the input and output.\n*   The red pixels in the bottom row of the input seem to define a pattern that affects the entire output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"

This pattern defines which columns will contain red pixels.\n\n2.  **Replicate the Pattern:** Extend this red pixel pattern vertically throughout the entire output grid. Every row in the output grid will have red pixels in the same columns as the bottom row of the input grid.\n\n3. **Place Gray Pixels** For each gray (5) pixel identify their relation to the\n    red pixels. Duplicate those pixels in all locations of the grid that match\n    those relations.\n\nIn essence, the bottom row of the input grid, specifically the arrangement of red pixels, acts as a template for the red pixels in all rows of the output grid. The grey pixels are moved to locations defined by the red pixels.\n"
