facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids consist of blocks of uniform color.
  - observation: Output grids seem to select one digit from each distinct color block.
  - observation: The selection within a color block may be the center or top-left color, ignoring isolated single-pixel blocks and the background.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions seem related to the number of distinct color blocks, ignoring the background color white (0).
  - property: Color blocks can be any shape/size but the center may not exist
  - property: The background is always white (0)
  - action: extract a representative value from each input grid to create a smaller summary grid.
