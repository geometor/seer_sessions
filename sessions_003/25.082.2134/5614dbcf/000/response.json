The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input grid, retaining only certain key elements. It appears that the most prominent feature is the selection of a single digit from within larger, uniform-colored blocks in the input. The background color (0, white) seems to play a crucial role in defining these blocks and might be used to segment the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Note: if there is a single pixel region of a given color, ignore it.\n2.  **Select Representative Digit:** For each identified color block:\n    *    Check for the center pixel color.\n    *    If no center pixel, locate the first non-background value, reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom.\n3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Arrange the extracted digits into a new grid. The dimensions of this new grid will correspond to the sequence of the digits extracted. For instance, the first digit extracted goes in the top-left corner of the output grid. The order of extraction in step 2 defines the layout of the output.\n\nEssentially, the program summarizes the larger input grid by picking out representative digits from distinct color blocks.\n"
