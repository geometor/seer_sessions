Consider blocks of any color, including color 0 (white), and include them in the object set.\n2.  **Filter Small Objects:** Remove objects with an area of 1 (single-pixel objects) from the object set.\n3.  **Select Representative Colors:**  For each remaining object, find a \"representative color\". This is the color value of the object.\n4.  **Filter by Color:** Keep only objects where the representative color is not 0.\n5. **Select Top and Bottom:** If one object exists, top is that object. If two or more objects exist, the top is the object with the top-left pixel having the smallest row number; if rows are equal use the smallest column. The second (bottom) object, is the object with the top-left pixel having the largest row number; if rows are equal use the smallest column.\n6.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled with 0s.\n7.  **Place Colors:**\n    *   Place the representative color of the selected \"top\" object in the cell at row 0, column 1 (top-middle) of the output grid.\n    *   Place the representative color of the selected \"bottom\" object, if different than the \"top\" object, in the cell at row 2, column 1 (bottom-middle) of the output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_color_blocks(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous color blocks and returns a list of blocks.\"\"\"\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    blocks = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, current_block):\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= grid.shape[0]\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= grid.shape[1]\n            or visited[row, col]\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_block.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, current_block)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, current_block)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, current_block)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, current_block)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not visited[row, col]:\n                current_block = []\n                dfs(row, col, grid[row, col], current_block)\n                blocks.append(current_block)\n    return blocks\n\ndef get_representative_color(block, grid):\n    \"\"\"Gets the representative color for a block (simply the color of the first pixel).\"\"\"\n    row, col = block[0]\n    return grid[row, col]\n\ndef get_top_left(block):\n    \"\"\"Returns the top-left coordinates of a block.\"\"\"\n    return min(block)  # min() on a list of tuples will sort by row, then col\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Create Output Grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n\n    # Identify Objects\n    blocks = find_color_blocks(input_grid)\n\n    # Filter Small Objects\n    large_blocks = [block for block in blocks if len(block) > 1]\n\n    # Select Representative Colors and Filter by Color\n    remaining_blocks = []\n    for block in large_blocks:\n        color = get_representative_color(block, input_grid)\n        if color != 0:\n            remaining_blocks.append((color, block))\n\n    # Select Top and Bottom\n    if remaining_blocks:\n        # Sort by top-left corner (row, then col)\n        remaining_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: get_top_left(x[1]))\n        top_object = remaining_blocks[0]\n\n        # Find bottom object (largest row, then smallest col)\n        bottom_blocks = sorted(remaining_blocks, key=lambda x: (-get_top_left(x[1])[0], get_top_left(x[1])[1]))\n        bottom_object = bottom_blocks[0]\n\n\n        # Place Colors\n        output_grid[0, 1] = top_object[0]\n        if bottom_object != top_object:\n            output_grid[2, 1] = bottom_object[0]\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
