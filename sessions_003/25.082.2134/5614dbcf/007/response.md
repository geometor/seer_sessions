"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color in the input grid.  Consider blocks of any color, including color 0 (white), and include them in the object set.
2.  **Filter Small Objects:** Remove objects with an area of 1 (single-pixel objects) from the object set.
3.  **Select Representative Colors:**  For each remaining object, find a "representative color". This is the color value of the object.
4.  **Filter by Color:** Keep only objects where the representative color is not 0.
5. **Select Top and Bottom:** If one object exists, top is that object. If two or more objects exist, the top is the object with the top-left pixel having the smallest row number; if rows are equal use the smallest column. The second (bottom) object, is the object with the top-left pixel having the largest row number; if rows are equal use the smallest column.
6.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled with 0s.
7.  **Place Colors:**
    *   Place the representative color of the selected "top" object in the cell at row 0, column 1 (top-middle) of the output grid.
    *   Place the representative color of the selected "bottom" object, if different than the "top" object, in the cell at row 2, column 1 (bottom-middle) of the output grid.
