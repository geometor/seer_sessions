1. Identify Color Blocks: Divide the input grid into contiguous blocks of the *same* color. Include blocks of color '0' (white) that are adjacent to non-zero color blocks. *Do not* ignore single-pixel blocks.
2. Representative Digit: For each non-zero color block, find the "representative digit" using the existing method (center pixel, or top-left if the center isn't in the block).
3. Determine Output Grid Size and Layout: The output is a 3x3 grid.
4. Populate Output Grid: Place the representative digits into the output grid. The digits are ordered from top to bottom and left to right based on where they appeared in the input grid, with '0' (white) pixels as separators.
