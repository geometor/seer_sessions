"""
1.  **Identify Color Blocks:** Divide the input grid into contiguous blocks of the *same* color. Include blocks of color '0' (white) that are directly adjacent to non-zero color blocks.

2.  **Filter small objects**: remove objects with area equal to one.

3.  **Representative Digit:** Find the representative digit of the *remaining* non-zero color blocks.

4.  **Determine Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.

5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Place the representative digits of the objects detected
into the output grid as follows:
    *   The representative color of the object whose top-left corner is closest to the top-left of input grid will be placed in [0,1]
    *   The representative color of the object whose top-left corner is closest to the bottom-left of the input grid will be placed in [2,1]
    *   All other cells are zeros.
