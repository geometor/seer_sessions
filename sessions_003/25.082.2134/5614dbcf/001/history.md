Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid of digits (representing colors) into a smaller grid. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input grid, retaining only certain key elements. It appears that the most prominent feature is the selection of a single digit from within larger, uniform-colored blocks in the input. The background color (0, white) seems to play a crucial role in defining these blocks and might be used to segment the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids consist of blocks of uniform color.
  - observation: Output grids seem to select one digit from each distinct color block.
  - observation: The selection within a color block may be the center or top-left color, ignoring isolated single-pixel blocks and the background.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions seem related to the number of distinct color blocks, ignoring the background color white (0).
  - property: Color blocks can be any shape/size but the center may not exist
  - property: The background is always white (0)
  - action: extract a representative value from each input grid to create a smaller summary grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Color Blocks:** Divide the input grid into distinct, contiguous regions of the same color, excluding regions of color 0 (white) which serve as the background. Note: if there is a single pixel region of a given color, ignore it.
2.  **Select Representative Digit:** For each identified color block:
    *    Check for the center pixel color.
    *    If no center pixel, locate the first non-background value, reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Arrange the extracted digits into a new grid. The dimensions of this new grid will correspond to the sequence of the digits extracted. For instance, the first digit extracted goes in the top-left corner of the output grid. The order of extraction in step 2 defines the layout of the output.

Essentially, the program summarizes the larger input grid by picking out representative digits from distinct color blocks.
