The input grids seem to contain a small \"object\" defined by a connected region of non-zero pixels.  The position and shape of this object, as well as the specific colors involved, change between examples. The output grids seem to be derived from a combination of mirroring and/or rotating the object within the Input. The specific type of mirroring/rotation appears related to the position of a single pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
