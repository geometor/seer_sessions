facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 9x9.
  - observation: Output grids are 9x9.
  - observation: Most cells are black (0).
  - observation: Input contains a small, connected object of non-zero pixels.
  - observation: The non-zero pixels in the input form a 2x2 or 1x2, or 2x1 area in the input grid.
  - observation: There are two different non black color in the connected object in the input.
  - observation: The object contain one unique colored pixel, other color is mirrored around it.
  - observation: The position of the unique pixel seems to determine the output.
  - observation: The output object is one of the colors from input.
  - observation: The input unique color forms the core 3x3 area in the top right 3x3 corner of the output grid.
  - observation: The location of the unique pixel in input controls the overall rotation/mirroring of the 3x3 core.
  - observation: The non-unique color creates the 3x3 core.
  - observation: The 3x3 core formed by the other color fills a corner area in the output.
