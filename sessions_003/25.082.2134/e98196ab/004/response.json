The core issue in example 2 is related to how the overlaying/insertion of non-zero pixels from the lower region is handled, specifically when rows need to be inserted and potentially resized. The current implementation seems to be inserting and/or extending rows incorrectly.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Example 2 in Detail:** Pinpoint the exact rows and pixel values that are incorrect in the transformed output of example 2.\n2.  **Refine Overlay Logic:** Modify the natural language program and subsequently the code to accurately describe how non-zero pixels from below the separator are merged into the upper region, paying close attention to row insertion and the case of non-all-zero-rows at the end of the upper region.\n3. Test and iterate\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and confirmed conceptually - no code execution needed for this specific task):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Match: True\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Issue: None\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Size Correct: False\n    *   Issue: The overlaying of elements from the lower grid onto the upper grid is incorrect. There appears to be a misalignment and truncation. The expected output shows an inserted '7' in the top row and the bottom row maintains alignment.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Match: True\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Issue: None\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
