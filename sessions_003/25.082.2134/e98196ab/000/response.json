The most striking feature is the presence of a horizontal line of grey (5) pixels in all input examples. This line seems to act as a separator or a point of reflection. The output grids are smaller in height, suggesting some form of cropping or selection based on this grey line. The colors above the line get placed in the output and certain colors below the grey line might or might not get placed on the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
