Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and try to discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is a 9x9 grid. It seems to contain several distinct objects composed of single-color contiguous blocks. The prominent colors are azure (8), blue (1), and white (0). The white (0) pixels seem to function as background.
*   **Output:** The output is a 3x3 grid. It appears to be a compressed or abstracted version of the input, retaining only the azure (8) and blue (1) pixels. There might be some selection or filtering criteria at play.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific 3x3 sub-grid within the 9x9 input grid. This 3x3 subgrid does not include and white pixels (value 0).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [9, 9]
    role: input
    contains: [object_1, object_2, background]

  - type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    role: output
    contains: [ object_1, object_2]

  - type: object
    name: object_1
    color: azure (8)
    shape: irregular

  - type: object
    name: object_2
    color: blue (1)
    shape: irregular

  - type: object
    name: background
    color: white (0)
    shape: fills_remaining

actions:
 - name: select_subgrid
   description: a 3 x 3 subgrid within the input grid
   criteria: includes all non white(0) pixels from the original grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Subgrid:** Examine the input 9x9 grid. Look for a contiguous 3x3 subgrid that does not contain any white cells.
2.  **Extract Subgrid**: Once found, copy all the non-white pixels from this subgrid into the 3x3 output, maintaining original relative positions.

In summary, the rule extracts a 3x3 subgrid within the 9x9 input grid, where it contains all the non-white color pixels.
