Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input is a 9x9 grid. It seems to contain several distinct objects composed of single-color contiguous blocks. The prominent colors are azure (8), blue (1), and white (0). The white (0) pixels seem to function as background.\n*   **Output:** The output is a 3x3 grid. It appears to be a compressed or abstracted version of the input, retaining only the azure (8) and blue (1) pixels. There might be some selection or filtering criteria at play.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific 3x3 sub-grid within the 9x9 input grid. This 3x3 subgrid does not include and white pixels (value 0).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Look for a contiguous 3x3 subgrid that does not contain any white cells.\n2.  **Extract Subgrid**: Once found, copy all the non-white pixels from this subgrid into the 3x3 output, maintaining original relative positions.\n\nIn summary, the rule extracts a 3x3 subgrid within the 9x9 input grid, where it contains all the non-white color pixels.\n"
