Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and outlining a natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The core task involves identifying and extracting a contiguous non-zero object from the input grid and reconstructing it in the output grid, but with a changed bounding box. The surrounding zero-value pixels (white) seem to act as padding or background and are discarded. The shape of the object defined by non-zero pixels changes between input and output. The bounding box size and location changes in a non-obvious way.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_type: "Contiguous non-zero region"
  - input_background: "Pixels with value 0 (white)"
  - output_background: "None (only the extracted object remains)"
  - object_property: "Color (represented by non-zero digits)"
  - object_property: shape
  - transformation_type: "Extraction and Reshape"
  - transformation_detail: "The contiguous non-zero region is identified."
  - transformation_detail: "A new bounding box is calculated for the object."
  - transformation_detail: "The original object is reshaped."
  - transformation_detail: "The pixels are placed inside new bounding box."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Object:** Find the largest contiguous region of non-zero pixels within the input grid.  "Contiguous" means pixels are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

2. **Determine New Bounding Box:** Analyze the shape of identified object, then construct output by tiling non-zero pixels into rows and columns. The tiling pattern appears to be rotating pixels clockwise by 90 degrees within the object and repeating colors horizontally and/or vertically to construct the final shape.

3. **Construct the Output:** Create a new grid containing only the reshaped object, without any surrounding zero-value pixels.
