The surrounding zero-value pixels (white) seem to act as padding or background and are discarded. The shape of the object defined by non-zero pixels changes between input and output. The bounding box size and location changes in a non-obvious way.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

The tiling pattern appears to be rotating pixels clockwise by 90 degrees within the object and repeating colors horizontally and/or vertically to construct the final shape.\n\n3. **Construct the Output:** Create a new grid containing only the reshaped object, without any surrounding zero-value pixels.\n"
