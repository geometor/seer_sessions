            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on transposing the dimensions of a detected object and then incorrectly interpreting this as a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The results show mismatches in both dimensions and pixel arrangement for all three examples. It seems the core misunderstanding lies in how the \"rotation\" is handled. It's not simply transposing indices `(c, r)` instead of `(r, c)`; it requires adjusting for the fact that a simple transpose does not perform a counter-clockwise rotation as intended, rather a reflection across a diagonal. The provided code has a correct transposition of the matrix sizes, but the inner loop logic incorrectly places values when copying data from the original object to the output.\n\nThe strategy to correct this will be to:\n\n1.  **Correct the Rotation Logic:** Implement a proper 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. This involves mapping the original coordinates (r, c) to the new coordinates (new_r, new_c) according to the transformation: `new_r = c` and `new_c = rows - 1 - r`.\n2. **Verify Assumptions**: Use the corrected code on the examples and confirm that the output size and the content are corrected.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples with a focus on understanding the precise transformations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Object: An 8x4 region of mostly '8' (azure) with some '2' (red).\n    *   Expected Output: A 4x8 region. Visual inspection confirms it's a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input object.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Object: A 5x5 region of '4'(yellow) and '1'(blue)\n    *   Expected Output: Another 5x5 region, the counterclockwise rotation of the object.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Object: 4x6 region with '6' (magenta) and '3'(green)\n    *    Expected Output: A 6x4 region - again, consistent with a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
