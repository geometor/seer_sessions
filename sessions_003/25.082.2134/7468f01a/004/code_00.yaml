      input_object:
        shape: [4, 8] # [height, width]
        colors: [8, 2] # azure, red
      output_object:
        shape: [8, 4] # [height, width]
        transformation: "90-degree counter-clockwise rotation"
  - example_2:
      input_object:
        shape: [5, 5]
        colors: [4, 1] # yellow, blue
      output_object:
        shape: [5, 5]
        transformation: "90-degree counter-clockwise rotation"
  - example_3:
      input_object:
        shape: [4, 6]
        colors: [6, 3] # magenta, green
      output_object:
        shape: [6, 4]
        transformation: "90-degree counter-clockwise rotation"
  - general_rule: "The input object (contiguous non-zero region) is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output."
