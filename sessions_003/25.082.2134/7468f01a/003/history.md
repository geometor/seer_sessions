Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a diagonal fill pattern. It correctly identifies the bounding box of the object, but the reshaping logic is incorrect. It tries to map source rows to output columns and vice versa, which only works for certain input shapes. The results show mismatches in pixel placement and, in some cases, incorrect colors, indicating a flaw in the core transformation logic. The strategy for resolving the errors is to revise the reshaping logic to correctly reflect the apparent rotation and replication within the object's bounding box.

**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**

I'll use manual analysis of the provided data. The images associated with the
results offer extra context for the analysis.

**Example 1 Analysis:**

*   **Input Shape:** 15x15, Object: 4x8 (with some internal color changes)
*   **Expected Output Shape:** 4x8
*   **Actual Output Shape:** 4x8, some colors and positions wrong.
*   **Observations:** The output shape is correct but many pixels and their locations are incorrect. It appears to be rotating the image, but also the filling in incorrectly. The presence of '0's is notable in the actual output.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

*   **Input Shape:** 16x12, Object: 6x5 (with internal color changes)
*   **Expected Output Shape:** 5x6
*   **Actual Output Shape:** 5x6, with some pixel positions wrong, but all colors are correct.
*   **Observations:** The dimensions have been swapped correctly, but the pixels do not match the expectation.

**Example 3 Analysis:**

*   **Input Shape:** 17x17, Object: 4x6
*   **Expected Output Shape:** 4x6
*   **Actual Output Shape:** 4x6, some colors and positions wrong.
*   **Observations:** The actual output dimension and the expected output dimension are the same, but pixels are in the wrong positions. The presence of '0's is notable in the actual output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Find the smallest rectangular region (bounding box) within the input grid that contains all non-zero pixels. This defines the "object".
2.  **Extract Object:** Create a sub-grid consisting of the object, and the position of where it was in the original image.
3.  **Transpose Dimensions:** Create a new empty output grid where rows and the columns from the object switch, for example if the original object had dimensions rows=6, cols=5, the output grid has dimensions rows=5, cols=6.
4.  **Rotate and Replicate:** Fill the output grid by copying pixels from the input object grid using a mapping that is consistent with a 90 degrees counter clockwise rotation.
