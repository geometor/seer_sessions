Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of rotating a single identified object 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  However, the results across the three examples reveal inconsistencies. The sizes and shapes of the transformed outputs don't always match the expected outputs. It's clear that the "object" identification and the 90-degree rotation assumption isn't universally applicable. It seems instead of a strict rotation the operation transposes parts of the input and re-arranges. The colors are all correct.

**Strategy:**

1. **Re-examine Object Identification:** The current `find_object` function looks for a *contiguous* non-zero region.  We need to verify if this is always true or if we need a more flexible way to define the "object" being transformed. The examples may include multiple objects or non-contiguous regions.
2. **Analyze Transformations:** Instead of assuming a 90-degree rotation, we'll meticulously compare input and output grids, focusing on how rows and columns are mapped or rearranged.
3. **Consider Transpose:** The relation between sizes of inputs and outputs suggests that a transpose like operation might be involved, but we will check and gather evidence.
4. **Iterative Refinement:** We'll update the natural language program and corresponding code based on each example, testing and refining until we achieve consistency.

**Gather Metrics & Example Analysis:**

Let's start by getting grid dimensions and pixel counts for each example's input and expected output. This will inform if pixel counts are conserved.


``` python
import numpy as np

def grid_info(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    pixel_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
    return rows, cols, pixel_counts

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input Sub-grid:** Find the smallest rectangular region within the input grid that contains all non-zero pixels. This defines the input sub-grid.
2.  **Transpose and Rearrange:** Extract the subgrid defined by the non-zero pixels. The output grid's dimensions are determined by transposing the dimensions of this sub-grid (number of rows becomes the number of columns, and vice-versa). The content of the subgrid is then re-arranged. The exact pixel mapping during the rearangment is not a simple rotation. It appears to involve selecting non-zero rows and columns, transposing and fitting to the output.

The key improvement here is recognizing that we're not dealing with a simple rotation of a *contiguous* object. Instead, we're identifying a sub-grid (which *may* contain multiple objects or disconnected parts) and performing a transpose-like re-arrangement of the subgrid.
