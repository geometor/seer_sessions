1. Identify the Input Sub-grid: Find the smallest rectangular region within the input grid that contains all non-zero pixels. This defines the input sub-grid.
2. Transpose and Rearrange: Extract the subgrid defined by the non-zero pixels. The output grid's dimensions are determined by transposing the dimensions of this sub-grid (number of rows becomes the number of columns, and vice-versa). The content of the subgrid is then re-arranged. The exact pixel mapping during the rearangment is not a simple rotation. It appears to involve selecting non-zero rows and columns, transposing and fitting to the output.
