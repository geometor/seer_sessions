  - type: non_zero_digit
    properties:
      value: int  # The digit itself (1-9)
      input_position: int  # Index in the original 1x5 input array
      output_positions: list  # List of (row, col) tuples in the output grid

  - type: zero
    properties:
      input_position: int
    actions:
      separate: # Acts as a separator and influences placement of non-zero digits
      shift: # causes shift in replication

input_grid:
  type: 1D_array
  shape: (1, 5)
  elements: integers (0-9)

output_grid:
  type: 2D_array
  shape: (variable, variable) # Determined by the input
  elements: integers (0-9)

transformation:
  rule: mirrored_diagonal_replication
  details: >
     Non-zero digits from the input are replicated in the output grid
     along both the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, creating
     a mirrored effect. The number of zeros preceding a non-zero digit
     in the input determines the starting row for the diagonal replication
     of that digit. The output size is determined by max(number of
     non-zero digits * 2 - 1, number of elements in input)
