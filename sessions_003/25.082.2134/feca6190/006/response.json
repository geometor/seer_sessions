            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a flawed understanding of the transformation rule, particularly regarding output grid size and diagonal/anti-diagonal replication. It seems the core idea of placing non-zero input elements into an output grid based on preceding zeros is partially correct, but the size calculation and replication logic are incorrect. The output grid is much larger than calculated and has a regular pattern not related to a simple diagonal expansion. It appears that the non-zero numbers from input form a \"spine\" and padding 0s are added to make a square.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine each input/output/transformed output triplet to identify specific errors.\n2.  **Size Calculation:** Determine the correct formula for calculating the output grid size. It's clear that the previous formula (`3 * input_size - 2 * non_zero_count`) is wrong.\n3.  **Placement Logic:** Re-evaluate how the non-zero elements are placed in the output grid and how many 0s are added.\n4.  **Replication Logic:** If replication occurs, identify the correct pattern (it's not a simple diagonal/anti-diagonal as initially assumed).\n5.  **Refine Program:** Based on the analysis, rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (using manual analysis, no tool_code needed for this observational step):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 5\n    *   Non-zero Count: 2\n    *   Expected Output Size: 10x10\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 11x11\n    *   Observation: The non-zero digits (1 and 7) appear to form a diagonal \"spine\" of the output. Zeroes pad.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 5\n    *   Non-zero Count: 1\n    *   Expected Output Size: 5x5\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 13x13\n    *   Observation: The non-zero digit (2) is at the center and forms the corner of the output \"L\".\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 5\n    *   Non-zero Count: 3\n    *   Expected Output Size: 15x15\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 9x9\n    * Observation: The non-zero digits (4, 6 and 8) appear to form a diagonal.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Size: 5\n    *   Non-zero Count: 3\n    *   Expected Output Size: 15x15\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 9x9\n        * Observation: The non-zero digits (9, 8 and 4) appear to form a diagonal.\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input Size: 5\n    *   Non-zero Count: 1\n    *   Expected Output Size: 5x5\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 13x13\n    *   Observation: Similar to Example 2.\n\nThe sizes are all wrong and the current implementation does not account for the number of non-zero elements except in the incorrect size calculation.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

The non-zero elements of the input grid are placed sequentially in the output grid.\n4.  The row index of the first non-zero element in the output grid is determined by the number of preceding zeros in the input grid.\n5.
