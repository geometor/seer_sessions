The non-zero digits in the input grid appear to be replicated and shifted diagonally in the output grid. The size of the output grid seems related to the number of non-zero elements and possibly the total number of input elements. The zero values in the input are important for generating empty (all-zero) rows at the beginning and/or end of the output. The output is always square.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Its dimensions are determined by taking max between total shifts calculated above and length of input.\n5. **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid of the calculated size, filled with zeros.\n6. **Iterate Input:** For each element in the input grid:\n   - If the element is non-zero:\n      -  Copy the non zero digit from the input to the output. The row index is based on how many zeros came before the current digit + current column. The column index will start from the current input column number.\n      - For each zero after the current non-zero in the input array, shift diagonally down and to the left (row index + 1 and column index +1) and place the non zero digit.\n   - If the element is zero do nothing.\n7. **Return:** Return the completed output grid.\n\nEssentially, each non-zero element in the input \"seeds\" a diagonal line of that same element in the output.  The output grid size is determined by the need to accommodate all diagonals and is padded by blank rows and columns(all zeros) to make it square.\n"
