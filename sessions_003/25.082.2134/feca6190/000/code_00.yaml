facts:
  - observation: "Input is a 1x5 grid (row vector)."
  - observation: "Output is a square grid."
  - observation: "Output grid dimensions vary."
  - property: "Non-zero input elements are present in the output."
  - property: "Zero input elements correspond to all-zero rows in the output."
  - action: "Non-zero elements are replicated diagonally downwards."
  - action: "Zeros pad the output grid to make it square."
  - relationship: "Output size depends on the input size and arrangement of non-zero elements."
  - constraint: "input grid width is constant (5)"
