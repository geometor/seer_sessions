            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors in the generated code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code attempted to capture a diagonal and anti-diagonal replication pattern. However, the results show a consistent mismatch between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs across all examples. The primary issue seems to be an incorrect understanding of how the input elements map to the output grid's structure, size, and placement. The code doesn't correctly interpret the relationship between zero and non-zero elements in determining output size and diagonal/anti-diagonal expansion. The code also has issue replicating the elements in both directions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair to visually identify the transformation rule. Pay close attention to the placement of zeros and non-zero elements.\n2.  **Size Determination:** Investigate how the number of non-zero elements and the total number of elements in input array contributes to the output size.\n3.  **Placement Logic:** Determine the exact rule governing where each non-zero element from the input is initially placed in the output grid. Consider the role of preceding zeros.\n4.  **Replication Rule:** Define the precise logic for diagonal and anti-diagonal replication. Consider that a single non-zero element can spread both diagonally and anti-diagonally.\n5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Based on the revised understanding, modify the natural language program and, subsequently, the code. Test iteratively against all examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo understand the output grid size rule, let's analyze the relationship between input size, non-zero element count, and output dimensions.\n\n"

The side length appears to be `max(2 * non_zero_count - 1, input_size) * (input_size - non_zero +1)-input_size` if `non_zero_count` >1. When the non zero count = 1, the output size is equal to the input size. More precisely, the side of output size seems to be determined with `input_size` + (`input_size`-`non_zero_count`) * 2, where non_zero represents the count of non-zero numbers.\n\n*   **Placement and Replication:**\n    *   Non-zero elements from the input are placed diagonally and anti-diagonally in the output.\n    *   The number of preceding zeros in the input determines the starting row for placing the element.\n    *  Each number has a diagonal going down and to the right, and another diagonal going down and to the left.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
