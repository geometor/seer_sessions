Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the underlying transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The transformation seems to involve a combination of object identification, shifting/copying, and potentially mirroring, with an emphasis on the spatial relationship or adjacency of colored pixels. We see small colored objects moving locations and some evidence of large blocks of empty background (color=0) cells.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: "grid"
    description: "Input and output are 2D grids of integers."
  - type: "color_codes"
    description: "Integers 0-9 represent different colors."
  - type: "objects"
    description: "contiguous blocks of one or more same color pixels"
  - type: "object_interaction"
    description: "Objects move to new locations"
  - type: "action"
    actions:
      - "mirror_object_position"
        description: "object mirrored across x and y axis within a bounding box"
  - type: "object_type_source"
    description: "colored non-zero pixels"
  - type: "object_type_background"
    description: "background made up of zeros"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of non-zero pixels.
2. **Define Bounding Box:** For all objects, determine the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that completely encloses the objects. This box should exclude as many background (color 0) pixels as possible.
3. **Mirror Objects:** For each object within the bounding box, mirror its position within the bounding box. The mirroring operation should reflect the object's position across both the horizontal and vertical centerlines of the bounding box.
4.  **Construct Output:** All cells outside the bounding box of the original input are copied directly. The new object positions create the output.
5. **Background Preservation:** Maintain all '0' (background) pixels in their original locations outside the objects bounding box.

Essentially, it's mirroring the *position* of objects within a dynamically determined bounding box, not mirroring the shapes of the objects themselves. And the objects bounding box is placed within a larger context.
