            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of mirroring objects *around their own bounding box centers*. However, the results from all three examples show that this is incorrect. It appears there's some interaction, perhaps re-centering or a global mirroring, instead of a localized one. The consistent errors across multiple, varied examples indicate a fundamental flaw in the core mirroring logic. My strategy will be to first gather more specific details about the misplacement by looking at the objects, locations, and the error pixels. From there, I can attempt to discern an updated rule which will be documented in an updated natural language program.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use code execution to get more insights to determine the global transformation:\n\n1.  **Object Properties:** Determine the bounding box of objects before and after the transformation (or what the correct output should have been). This should indicate if the objects are moved relative to the entire grid, not just their internal centers.\n2.  **Error Analysis:** By comparing the expected output and the actual output pixel by pixel, I can identify what pixels have the wrong color and how to correct it.\n\n"
