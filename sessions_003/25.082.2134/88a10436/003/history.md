1. **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of non-zero pixels.
2. **Define Bounding Box:** For all objects, determine the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that completely encloses the objects. This box should exclude as many background (color 0) pixels as possible.
3. **Mirror Objects:** For each object within the bounding box, mirror its position within the bounding box. The mirroring operation should reflect the object's position across both the horizontal and vertical centerlines of the bounding box.
4.  **Construct Output:** All cells outside the bounding box of the original input are copied directly. The new object positions create the output.
5. **Background Preservation:** Maintain all '0' (background) pixels in their original locations outside the objects bounding box.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code attempted to find objects, define a bounding box around *all* objects, and mirror the objects *within that single bounding box*. The results show this approach is incorrect. The mirroring seems to be happening, but not consistently, and the placement of the mirrored objects and preservation of the original object locations is flawed. The bounding box concept is not working as expected across all examples. The code also has issues where pixels from outside of the combined bounding box are being moved to the mirrored location inside the bounding box.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Individual Object Bounding Boxes:** Instead of one large bounding box, we need to consider bounding boxes *for each individual object*. This is crucial because the examples show mirroring happening relative to individual objects, not the entire scene.
2.  **Precise Mirroring:** Re-examine the mirroring logic. It should be a perfect reflection across the center of each *individual* object's bounding box.
3. **Object Preservation:** Consider how the original input object is maintained or altered after its mirrored version is placed in the scene.
4.  **Background:** Ensure the logic strictly adheres to only changing the mirrored object and nothing else.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification where necessary):**

Let's verify that the bounding box calculation is currently performed for all objects at once and the mirroring is being applied relative to the overall bounding box.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - description: Distinct contiguous regions of non-zero pixels.
  - properties:
    - color: The non-zero pixel value (1-9).
    - shape: The arrangement of pixels within the object.
    - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing the object.
      - min_row: Topmost row index.
      - max_row: Bottommost row index.
      - min_col: Leftmost column index.
      - max_col: Rightmost column index.

actions:
  - name: mirror_object
    description: Reflects an object across the center of its bounding box.
    input: object
    steps:
      - calculate_center: Find the center (row, col) of the object's bounding box.
      - mirror_pixels: For each pixel in the object, calculate its mirrored position relative to the center.
      - place_mirrored_pixels: Create a new object with pixels in mirrored locations.
      - remove_original: remove the object being mirrored from the output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of non-zero pixels.
2.  **Individual Bounding Boxes:** For *each* object, determine its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing that object).
3.  **Mirror Each Object:** For *each* object:
    *   Calculate the center point (midpoint of rows and columns) of its bounding box.
    *   Mirror each pixel of the object across both the horizontal and vertical centerlines of *its* bounding box.
    * Create a new object at the mirrored position with the original color.
    * remove the original object
4.  **Construct Output:** The output grid initially starts as a copy of the input grid. Then for each object, remove the original object and replace with mirrored pixels. The background (pixels with value 0) remains unchanged.
