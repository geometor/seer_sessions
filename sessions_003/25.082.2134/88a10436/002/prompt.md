"""
1. **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of non-zero pixels.
2. **Define Bounding Box:** For all objects, determine the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that completely encloses the objects. This box should exclude as many background (color 0) pixels as possible.
3. **Mirror Objects:** For each object within the bounding box, mirror its position within the bounding box. The mirroring operation should reflect the object's position across both the horizontal and vertical centerlines of the bounding box.
4.  **Construct Output:** All cells outside the bounding box of the original input are copied directly. The new object positions create the output.
5. **Background Preservation:** Maintain all '0' (background) pixels in their original locations outside the objects bounding box.
