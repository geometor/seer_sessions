objects:
  - description: Distinct contiguous regions of non-zero pixels.
  - properties:
    - color: The non-zero pixel value (1-9).
    - shape: The arrangement of pixels within the object.
    - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing the object.
      - min_row: Topmost row index.
      - max_row: Bottommost row index.
      - min_col: Leftmost column index.
      - max_col: Rightmost column index.

actions:
  - name: mirror_object
    description: Reflects an object across the center of its bounding box.
    input: object
    steps:
      - calculate_center: Find the center (row, col) of the object's bounding box.
      - mirror_pixels: For each pixel in the object, calculate its mirrored position relative to the center.
      - place_mirrored_pixels: Create a new object with pixels in mirrored locations.
      - remove_original: remove the object being mirrored from the output grid
