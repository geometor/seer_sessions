The primary change observed is the insertion of the number '2' (red) between horizontally adjacent '1's (blue).  The '0' (white) pixels seem to act as a background and aren't directly involved in the core transformation, other than potentially being replaced. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The transformation focuses on local horizontal relationships, not vertical or diagonal.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n6.  Pixels that are not directly involved in the '1' to '2' insertion (i.e. they do not have the value 1, or do not have a horizontally adjacent 1 next to them) retain their original values.\n\nIn essence, the transformation scans the grid for horizontal pairs of blue pixels and inserts a red pixel between them, shifting other pixels to the right.\n"
