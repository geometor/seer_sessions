facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - width: constant between input and output
      - height: constant between input and output
      - cell_values: integers from 0 to 9

  - object: pixel
    description: An individual cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates

  - relationship: horizontal_adjacency
    description: Two pixels are horizontally adjacent if they share the same row and their column indices differ by 1.

  - action: insertion
    description:  A '2' (red pixel) is inserted between two horizontally adjacent '1' (blue pixels).
    precondition: Two pixels at (r, c) and (r, c+1) have the value '1'.
    postcondition: Pixel at (r, c+1) becomes '2', and the pixel that was at (r,c+1) is shifted one space to the right to (r, c+2)
