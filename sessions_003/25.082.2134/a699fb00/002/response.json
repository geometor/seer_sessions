            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to insert a '2' (red) pixel between horizontally adjacent '1' (blue) pixels. However, it failed to do so in all test cases. The core issue is that the shifting logic inside the transform function only worked on the first example and not on the others, as the code shifts elements and inserts '2's, but does not account for subsequent changes when performing the transformation. It seems like the `insertions` variable did not work as expected.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Metrics:** Double-check the reported `pixels_off` and other metrics using manual inspection and potentially `numpy` calculations for confirmation.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Clearly define what constitutes an \"object\" in this context (contiguous blue pixels).\n3.  **Action Analysis:** Precisely describe the insertion action and the conditions under which it occurs, as well as how subsequent changes are made to the array.\n4.  **Refine Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed transformation rule, focusing on the adjacency and insertion logic, correcting the shifting issue.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Evidence:**\nI've visually inspected the provided images and results. The `pixels_off` count seems accurate. Here's a summary for each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code only adds a '2' in between the first two '1's and fails to perform this insertion in between the second set of '1's on the forth row.\n*   **Example 2:** The code fails to perform any insertion.\n*   **Example 3:** The code fails to perform any insertion.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
