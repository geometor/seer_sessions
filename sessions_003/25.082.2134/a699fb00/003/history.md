Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to insert a '2' (red) pixel between horizontally adjacent '1' (blue) pixels. However, it failed to do so in all test cases. The core issue is that the shifting logic inside the transform function only worked on the first example and not on the others, as the code shifts elements and inserts '2's, but does not account for subsequent changes when performing the transformation. It seems like the `insertions` variable did not work as expected.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Metrics:** Double-check the reported `pixels_off` and other metrics using manual inspection and potentially `numpy` calculations for confirmation.
2.  **Object Identification:** Clearly define what constitutes an "object" in this context (contiguous blue pixels).
3.  **Action Analysis:** Precisely describe the insertion action and the conditions under which it occurs, as well as how subsequent changes are made to the array.
4.  **Refine Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed transformation rule, focusing on the adjacency and insertion logic, correcting the shifting issue.

**Gather Metrics & Evidence:**
I've visually inspected the provided images and results. The `pixels_off` count seems accurate. Here's a summary for each example:

*   **Example 1:** The code only adds a '2' in between the first two '1's and fails to perform this insertion in between the second set of '1's on the forth row.
*   **Example 2:** The code fails to perform any insertion.
*   **Example 3:** The code fails to perform any insertion.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_pixel
    value: 1
    description: A pixel with the value 1 (blue).
  - name: red_pixel
    value: 2
    description: A pixel with the value 2 (red).
  - name: blue_pair
    description: Two horizontally adjacent blue pixels.

actions:
  - name: insert_red
    condition: A blue_pair is detected.
    operation: A red_pixel is inserted between the blue_pixel pair, with appropriate array shifting to the right.
  - name: horizontal_adjacency_check
    description: Checks for two horizontally adjacent blue pixels.

transformation_rule: |
    For each row in the grid, iterate through the pixels. If two consecutive
    pixels are blue (1), insert a red pixel (2) between them. The
    pixels to the right of the inserted red pixel are shifted one position to
    the right.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Row Iteration:** Iterate through each row of the grid.
3.  **Column Iteration:** Within each row, iterate through the columns, stopping before the last element to avoid out-of-bounds errors when checking for adjacency.
4.  **Adjacency Check:** For each pixel, check if the current pixel and the pixel to its immediate right are both blue (1).
5.  **Insertion and Shifting:** If two adjacent pixels are blue (1), then insert a '2' in the position after the first '1', and shift all subsequent values to the right.
6. **Return Updated Grid:** After iterating through all rows and columns, return the modified grid.
