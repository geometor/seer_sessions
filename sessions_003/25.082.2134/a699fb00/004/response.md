Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very limited understanding of the transformation, focusing solely on adjacent '1's (blue pixels) in the horizontal direction. The results clearly show this is insufficient. The code fails to insert the '2' (red pixel) between the blue pixels. The core issue is that the code is not correctly accounting for the insertion of new pixels, leading to an Index Error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Indexing:** The primary issue is the index shift during insertion. We need to adjust for this. We already have some of the code needed to do this, we were just missing a check to determine if the new length would exceed the existing length.
2.  **Verify Assumptions:** Double-check if the transformation is *only* about inserting '2's between horizontally adjacent '1's. The additional examples might reveal more complex rules.
3. **Iterative Refinement** Test early and test often with the existing set.

**Metrics and Observations (using code for verification where needed):**

Let's analyze each example individually to be absolutely sure of our observations.

**Example 1:**

import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])
expected_output = np.array([
    [1, 2, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 2, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_pixel
    value: 1
    description: Represents the color blue.
  - name: red_pixel
    value: 2
    description: Represents the color red.
  - name: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels.

actions:
  - name: insert_red
    description: Inserts a red pixel between two horizontally adjacent blue pixels.
    precondition: Two blue pixels are adjacent horizontally.
    postcondition: A red pixel is placed between the blue pixels, shifting subsequent pixels to the right, but within the same row and original grid size.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Within each row,** iterate through the pixels, from left to right, up to the second-to-last pixel.
3.  **Identify adjacent blue pixels:** Check if the current pixel and the pixel immediately to its right are both blue (value 1).
4.  **Insert red pixel:** If two adjacent blue pixels are found, insert a red pixel (value 2) between them.
5. **Maintain Grid Size:** Ensure any insertions do not increase the number of columns in the output, by truncating from the right if needed to retain the original width of the row.
6. **No changes to other rows:** If a row does not contain two horizontally adjacent blue pixels, it is copied to the output grid without modification.
