Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and formulating a natural language program to describe the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The primary change observed is the insertion of the number '2' (red) between horizontally adjacent '1's (blue).  The '0' (white) pixels seem to act as a background and aren't directly involved in the core transformation, other than potentially being replaced. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The transformation focuses on local horizontal relationships, not vertical or diagonal.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - width: constant between input and output
      - height: constant between input and output
      - cell_values: integers from 0 to 9

  - object: pixel
    description: An individual cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates

  - relationship: horizontal_adjacency
    description: Two pixels are horizontally adjacent if they share the same row and their column indices differ by 1.

  - action: insertion
    description:  A '2' (red pixel) is inserted between two horizontally adjacent '1' (blue pixels).
    precondition: Two pixels at (r, c) and (r, c+1) have the value '1'.
    postcondition: Pixel at (r, c+1) becomes '2', and the pixel that was at (r,c+1) is shifted one space to the right to (r, c+2)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid, row by row.
2.  **Identify** all instances where two horizontally adjacent pixels are both '1' (blue).
3.  **Insert** a '2' (red pixel) directly to the *right* of each identified '1', before the second '1' of a blue pair.
4.  **Shift** pixels to accommodate the insertion - if a '2' has been put on position (r, c), then shift to the right all pixels from this position on the row: move the value at position (r,c+1) to (r, c+2).
5.  The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  Pixels that are not directly involved in the '1' to '2' insertion (i.e. they do not have the value 1, or do not have a horizontally adjacent 1 next to them) retain their original values.

In essence, the transformation scans the grid for horizontal pairs of blue pixels and inserts a red pixel between them, shifting other pixels to the right.
