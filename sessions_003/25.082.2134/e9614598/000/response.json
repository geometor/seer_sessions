The primary focus seems to be on the manipulation of blue (1) pixels and the introduction/placement of green (3) pixels. The input grids contain blue pixels, while the output grids feature blue and green pixels. The transformation appears to involve a spatial relationship between existing blue pixels and newly introduced green pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
