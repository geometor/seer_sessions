            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and it seems to have made some assumptions that don't hold true for the second example. The core idea of identifying blue pixels and creating green pixels around them is correct, but the specific placement logic is flawed. The current code focuses on the leftmost and rightmost blue pixels and attempts to create a horizontal pattern between them. The second example reveals a different pattern: a vertical expansion of green pixels centered on the row where the blue pixel exists, but maintaining the column of the original blue.\n\nThe main strategy for resolving the errors involves:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluating the Placement Logic:** Instead of a strictly horizontal pattern centered *between* blue pixels, we need a vertical pattern centered *on* each blue pixel.\n2.  **Addressing Multiple Blue Pixels in Different Rows:** The code might not generalize correctly for cases where multiple blue pixels exist in different rows (not seen in the first two examples, but it's a possibility we should prepare for).\n3.  **Refining the centering logic:** The center should be the blue pixel. Three green pixels total.\n\n**Gathering Metrics:**\n\nLet's compute a few metrics manually and then formulate a report.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Blue pixels at (4,1) and (4,7).\n    *   Expected Output: Green pixels at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)\n    *   Actual Output: Green pixels at (4,1), (4,2), (4, 3) ,(4, 6) ,(4,7)\n*    **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Blue pixels at (0,3) and (8,3).\n    *   Expected Output: Green pixels at (3,3), (4,3), (5,3).\n    *   Actual Output: Green pixels at (0,2),(0,3), (0,4), (8, 3)\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
