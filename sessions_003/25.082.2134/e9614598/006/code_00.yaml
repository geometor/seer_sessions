observations:
  - objects:
      - name: blue_pixels
        color: blue
        description: Pixels with value 1 in the input grid.
      - name: green_pixels
        color: green
        description: Pixels with value 3 in the output grid. They form vertical lines.
  - relationships:
      - subject: blue_pixels
        predicate: determine_column
        object: green_pixels
        description: Columns containing blue pixels in the input will also contain green pixels in the output.
      - subject: green_pixels
        predicate: form_vertical_line
        object: null
        description: Green pixels form a vertical line of length 3.
  - actions:
      - name: create_green_line
        input: column index of blue pixel
        output: vertical line of 3 green pixels
        description:  For each column that contains blue pixels, create a vertical line of 3 green pixels.
        constraints:
           - The center of the green line should be at row 4, unless there are blue pixels present in the column at row 3, 4, or 5.
           - If there are blue pixels at row 3, 4, or 5, then center the 3-length green vertical line to avoid overwriting the blue pixels.
           - If the length 3 green vertical line includes the same coordinate as input blue pixels, output should contain green.
