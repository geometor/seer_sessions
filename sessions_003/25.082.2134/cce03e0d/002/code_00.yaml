      The input grid is conceptually divided into its individual rows and these rows are placed along the diagonals of 3x3 subgrids within the output grid. The first row of the input becomes the top-left to bottom-right diagonal of the top-left 3x3 subgrid. The second row becomes the diagonal of the center 3x3 subgrid, and the last row becomes the diagonal of the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid. The position in the output grid appears to be a function of the position within the input grid and the row number in the input grid.
