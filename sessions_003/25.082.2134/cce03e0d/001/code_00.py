"""
The input 3x3 grid is replicated and translated within a 9x9 output grid. The input grid is copied to the output grid at positions determined by multiples of its dimensions (3x3). The input appears at offsets (i*3, j*3) where i and j range from 0 to 2.  Any part of a translated copy that falls outside the 9x9 boundary is clipped.
