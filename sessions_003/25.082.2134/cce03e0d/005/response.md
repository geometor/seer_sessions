"""
The transformation rule involves taking each row of the 3x3 input grid and placing it in a specific location/s within the 9x9 output grid.

*   Example 1: The rows of input grid are placed adjacent to each other horizontally starting from row 3, column 0 of the output grid.
*   Example 2: Each row of the input grid is placed in the last three columns of the output grid. Input row 1 is at output row 0, input row 2 is at output row 1, and input row 3 at output row 2, respectively.
*   Example 3: Each input row is copied twice. The rows are copied one by one from left to right and then again appended to the last three columns from left to right.

The general rule derived from combining the three observations above is: The input grid rows can have varying placement strategies including repetition, within the output grid.
