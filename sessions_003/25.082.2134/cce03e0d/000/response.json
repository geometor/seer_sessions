It appears the original 3x3 input grid is somehow replicated or tiled, and there's a significant amount of padding with zeros (white). The placement of the replicated input within the larger output grid seems to vary between the examples. There's no obvious rotation or reflection. It is not simple tiling. There are shifts/translations in the placement.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It appears that the input grid might be copied to fill a 9x9 grid according to a rule, and some of those copies can exceed the bounds of the 9x9 grid.\n\nThere is some kind of relation between replication and translation.\nIt could be, for example, expressed as copying the `input` into `output` at `[i * 3, j * 3]` for `i` and `j` in `[0, 1, 2]` - in example 3, `j=2,i=2` leads to a translation to cell `[6,6]` which *is* represented in the result grid.\n"
