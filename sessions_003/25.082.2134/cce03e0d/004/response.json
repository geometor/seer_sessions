            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was based on a diagonal placement of input rows into 3x3 subgrids. However, the test results reveal that this assumption is incorrect for all three examples. The placement strategy and the overall structure of the output grid differ significantly from what the initial program predicted. The program needs substantial revision to handle these cases.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair, focusing on the relationship between input elements and their positions in the output.\n2.  **Identify the Correct Pattern:** Look beyond the diagonal placement and identify the correct rule governing the transformation. Consider row/column shifting, mirroring, or concatenation.\n3.  **Revise the Natural Language Program:** Based on the identified pattern, formulate a new, accurate description of the transformation.\n4.  **Refactor Code:** Based on the updated NL program, update the code appropriately, using tools as needed\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using tool_code):**\n\nSince I can't directly execute code here. I will outline the plan to gather information.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The output seems to have the first row of the input `1 0 0` placed at indices `(3,0), (3,1), (3,2)`. The second row `2 1 0` is placed at indices `(4,0), (4,1), (4,2)`.The third row `0,0,1` is placed at `(5,0),(5,1),(5,2)`.\n\n*   **Example 2:** The expected output is `9x9`. The input's first row `0 1 2` is placed at `(0,6), (0,7), (0,8)`. The second row appears at indices `(1,6), (1,7), (1,8)` and the last input row at `(2,6), (2,7), (2,8)`.\n\n*    **Example 3:** The expected output is `9x9`. The first row of input `2 1 2` are present twice in the output. Once at indices `(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)` and then at `(0,6), (0,7), (0,8)`. Similar repetition for row 2 and 3.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Input row 1 is at output row 0, input row 2 is at output row 1, and input row 3 at output row 2, respectively.\n*   **Example 3:** Each input row is copied twice. The rows are copied one by one from left to right and then again appended to the last three columns from left to right.\n\nThe general rule derived from combining the three observations above is: The input grid rows can have varying placement strategies including repetition, within the output grid.\n"
