"""
1.  **Identify Connected Components:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is defined as a group of one or more pixels of the same color that are connected either cardinally (up, down, left, right) or diagonally.

2.  **Determine Leftmost Object:** The "leftmost object" is defined as the object whose *constituent pixels*, considered together, contain the minimum x-coordinate (column index). If pixels from more than one object have the same x position, all pixels in each of those objects must be included in the definition of the leftmost object, meaning the leftmost object is the *union* of all such objects.

3.  **Remove Leftmost Object:** Set all pixels belonging to the "leftmost object" (as defined in step 2) to black (0).

4.  **Output:** The output grid is the modified input grid, with the leftmost object's pixels set to black.
