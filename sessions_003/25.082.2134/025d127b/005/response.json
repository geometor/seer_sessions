An object is defined as a group of one or more pixels of the same color that are connected either cardinally (up, down, left, right) or diagonally.\n\n2.  **Determine Leftmost Object:** The \"leftmost object\" is defined as the object whose *constituent pixels*, considered together, contain the minimum x-coordinate (column index). If pixels from more than one object have the same x position, all pixels in each of those objects must be included in the definition of the leftmost object, meaning the leftmost object is the *union* of all such objects.\n\n3.  **Remove Leftmost Object:** Set all pixels belonging to the \"leftmost object\" (as defined in step 2) to black (0).\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is the modified input grid, with the leftmost object's pixels set to black.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_connected_components(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds connected components in a grid, considering both cardinal and diagonal connectivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n    components = []\n\n    def _dfs(row, col, color, component):\n        if (row, col) in visited or row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        component.append((row, col))\n\n        # Check all 8 neighbors (cardinal and diagonal)\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                _dfs(row + dr, col + dc, color, component)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r, c] != 0:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                component = []\n                _dfs(r, c, color, component)\n                components.append((color, component))\n    return components\n\ndef find_leftmost_object(components):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the leftmost object among a list of connected components.
