            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was based on the idea of removing the \"leftmost\" object. While this worked partially for the first example, it completely failed on the second example, setting *all* non-black to black. This suggests a misunderstanding on how \"leftmost\" is defined and what constitutes a single object. The problem specifies that we use *cardinal and diagonal connectivity*, which is implemented in `find_connected_components`. It looks like the error comes from selecting what is the leftmost object and what should be removed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Connected Components:** Double-check that `find_connected_components` correctly identifies all distinct objects, even those that might be considered a single object because they are connected diagonally.\n2.  **Re-evaluate \"Leftmost\":** The current definition of \"leftmost\" (minimum x-coordinate) is insufficient. We need to consider cases where multiple objects might share the same leftmost x-coordinate, forming a single, large, composite object.\n3.  **Refine Removal Logic:** Ensure that *only* the pixels belonging to the correctly identified \"leftmost object\" are removed, and not others. The problem is that the leftmost point is determined before finding the object, and it's finding *any* pixel with the lowest x-coordinate, not the lowest coordinate *of an object*.\n4. **Consider all examples:** We were provided multiple training examples so we have to examine all of them.\n\n**Gather Metrics (Example 1):**\n\n"
