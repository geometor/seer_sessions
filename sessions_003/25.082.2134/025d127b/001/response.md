1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-black (non-zero) pixels within the input grid. Each block is defined by pixels of the same color.

2.  **Find the leftmost block:** Of those blocks, locate the leftmost one, defined as having a starting x coordinate less than another blocks.

3. **Delete Leftmost:** Remove the identified leftmost block pixels from the input, setting the new value to black (zero).

4.  **Output:** The final output grid is the modified input grid with the leftmost color block removed.
