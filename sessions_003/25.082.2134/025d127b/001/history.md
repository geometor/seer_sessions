Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing digits representing different colors. The primary objects appear to be contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve shifting or adjusting the positions of these colored blocks, specifically, a specific type of deletion, specifically, the leftmost of the colored blocks.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: colored_blocks
    description: Contiguous regions of pixels with the same color (excluding black/0).
    properties:
      - color: The digit/color of the block (e.g., 6 for magenta, 2 for red, 8 for azure).
      - shape: The overall shape of the contiguous block (which may be irregular).
      - position: location of the block on the x,y axis of the grid
      - leftmost: a property defining if a block is leftmost.
    actions:
      - identify: the first action is to recognize the object
      - delete: removing of the leftmost colored block.
    relationships:
      - "adjacent to": Blocks can be next to other blocks or empty (black/0) space.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-black (non-zero) pixels within the input grid. Each block is defined by pixels of the same color.

2.  **Find the leftmost block:** Of those blocks, locate the leftmost one, defined as having a starting x coordinate less than another blocks.

3. **Delete Leftmost:** Remove the identified leftmost block pixels from the input, setting the new value to black (zero).

4.  **Output:** The final output grid is the modified input grid with the leftmost color block removed.
