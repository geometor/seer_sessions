A connected component is a group of pixels of the same color that are connected either cardinally (up, down, left, right) *or* diagonally.\n\n2.  **Determine Leftmost Object:** Among all identified objects, find the object that is considered \"leftmost\". The leftmost object is the one that contains the pixel with the smallest x-coordinate. If multiple objects share the same minimum x-coordinate among their constituent pixels, consider the full set.\n\n3.  **Remove Leftmost Object:**  Set all pixels belonging to the leftmost object to black (0).\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is the modified input grid with the leftmost object removed.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_connected_components(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds connected components in a grid, considering both cardinal and diagonal connectivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n    components = []\n\n    def _dfs(row, col, color, component):\n        if (row, col) in visited or row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        component.append((row, col))\n\n        # Check all 8 neighbors (cardinal and diagonal)\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                _dfs(row + dr, col + dc, color, component)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r, c] != 0:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                component = []\n                _dfs(r, c, color, component)\n                components.append((color, component))\n    return components\n\ndef find_leftmost_object(components):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the leftmost object among a list of connected components.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not components:\n        return None\n\n    min_x = float('inf')\n    leftmost_object = None\n\n    for color, component in components:\n        for r, c in component:\n            if c < min_x:\n                min_x = c\n                leftmost_object = (color, component)\n    return leftmost_object\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find all connected components\n    components = find_connected_components(output_grid)\n\n    # Find the leftmost object\n    leftmost_object = find_leftmost_object(components)\n\n    # Remove the leftmost object\n    if leftmost_object:\n        color, coordinates = leftmost_object\n        for r, c in coordinates:\n            output_grid[r, c] = 0\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
