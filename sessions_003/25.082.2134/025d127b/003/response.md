1.  **Identify Connected Components:** Find all connected components (objects) within the input grid.  A connected component is a group of pixels of the same color that are connected either cardinally (up, down, left, right) *or* diagonally.

2.  **Determine Leftmost Object:** Among all identified objects, find the object that is considered "leftmost". The leftmost object is the one that contains the pixel with the smallest x-coordinate. If multiple objects share the same minimum x-coordinate among their constituent pixels, consider the full set.

3.  **Remove Leftmost Object:**  Set all pixels belonging to the leftmost object to black (0).

4.  **Output:** The output grid is the modified input grid with the leftmost object removed.
