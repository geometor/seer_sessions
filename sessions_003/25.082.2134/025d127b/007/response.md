1.  **Identify Connected Components:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is defined as a group of one or more pixels of the same color that are connected either cardinally (up, down, left, right) or diagonally.

2.  **Determine Leftmost Object:** Find the object with the minimum x-coordinate (column index). This is the leftmost object.

3.  **Remove Leftmost Object:** Set all pixels belonging to the "leftmost object" (as defined in step 2) to black (0).

4.  **Output:** The output grid is the modified input grid, with the leftmost object's pixels set to black.
