            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies connected components and attempts to remove the \"leftmost\" one. However, there's a flaw in how it defines and removes the leftmost object. It seems to be removing *all* objects that *start* at the leftmost x-coordinate, and then the test reveals that it should only eliminate pixels in the leftmost object *up to the column where that object ceases to exist.* The examples make it clear that we're not simply removing all objects sharing the minimum x-coordinate; we are removing one single, connected, object based at that minimum x. The previous code will remove any object at that x-coordinate.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Leftmost Object Definition:** Instead of removing all objects that *contain* the minimum x-coordinate, we need to identify and remove only the single, connected object that *begins* at the leftmost edge.  We need to redefine the leftmost object as the single contiguous object.\n\n2. **Improve Object Removal:** The existing code almost correctly removes an object.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nLet's analyze the provided examples to gather some more information about each input, output, expected, and actual transformed grids.\n\n"
