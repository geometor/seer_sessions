description: Replicate colored sequences within each row based on the presence of zeros to their right.
objects:
  - name: row
    description: A 1D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - length: The number of pixels in the row.
      - sequences:  A list of colored sequences.
  - name: colored_sequence
    description:  A contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color within a row.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first pixel of the sequence within the row.
      - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      - color_sequence: A tuple containing the color values.
      - has_zeros_right:  A boolean indicating if there are any '0' pixels to the right of the sequence in the same row.
