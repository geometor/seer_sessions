Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of varying dimensions, with single-digit integer values representing different colors.\n*   The transformation seems to affect only specific rows, leaving others unchanged.\n* The zero values (white) are background, other colored numbers are grouped, and might change based on columns.\n*   There's a pattern of repetition or mirroring within the affected rows. The transformation seems to be replicating some elements of single colored objects, specifically where there is background '0' to its right.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

If there are colored objects, iterate the colors and replicate the object based on the following rule, by inserting a duplicate object immediately to the right of the object.\n5.  **Else** (the row contains non-zero values):\n    * Iterate through each cell of the non zero values.\n    * Check if the current element has the same value of the element next to it.\n    *   If that is true, then leave as it is.\n        *   If that is not true and the value next to it is 0, then copy the current element and insert the copy immediately to the right of the current object.\n    * If there is nothing to the right, do not copy.\n6.  **Return** the modified grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies colored object in a row, then copies and inserts it, where that cell has '0' (white/background color) to the right.\n"
