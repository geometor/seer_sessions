Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of varying dimensions, with single-digit integer values representing different colors.
*   The transformation seems to affect only specific rows, leaving others unchanged.
* The zero values (white) are background, other colored numbers are grouped, and might change based on columns.
*   There's a pattern of repetition or mirroring within the affected rows. The transformation seems to be replicating some elements of single colored objects, specifically where there is background '0' to its right.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Only rows with non-zero values are potentially transformed."
  - observation: "Zero values (white) seem to act as a background or unchanged elements."
  - object: "Colored Row"
    properties:
      - "Contains non-zero values"
      - "May be transformed"
    actions:
      - "Replicate single colored object where '0' is to the right"
  - relationship: "Output rows are either identical to input rows or a modified version of an input row based on object replication."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the current row contains any non-zero values.
3.  **If** the row contains only zeros, copy it directly to the output grid.
4. If there are colored objects, iterate the colors and replicate the object based on the following rule, by inserting a duplicate object immediately to the right of the object.
5.  **Else** (the row contains non-zero values):
    * Iterate through each cell of the non zero values.
    * Check if the current element has the same value of the element next to it.
    *   If that is true, then leave as it is.
        *   If that is not true and the value next to it is 0, then copy the current element and insert the copy immediately to the right of the current object.
    * If there is nothing to the right, do not copy.
6.  **Return** the modified grid.

In summary, the transformation identifies colored object in a row, then copies and inserts it, where that cell has '0' (white/background color) to the right.
