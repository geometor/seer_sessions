objects:
  - type: colored_sequence
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color in a row.
    properties:
      color: The color of the pixels in the sequence (integer 0-9).
      length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      start_position: Column index of the first pixel in the sequence.

actions:
  - name: replicate_sequence
    description: >-
      Replicates a colored sequence based on the presence of '0' pixels to its
      right. The replication factor depends on number of '0' pixels.
    trigger: Presence of one or more '0' pixels anywhere to the right of the sequence in the input row.
    parameters:
      sequence: The colored_sequence object to replicate.
    result:
      - The original colored_sequence object.
      - The colored sequence copied to fill '0' until non-zero value
transformation_rule: >-
  For each row, identify colored sequences. If a sequence has one or more '0'
  pixels anywhere to its right within the same row, then copy the sequence
  replacing '0' pixels until a non-zero pixel.
