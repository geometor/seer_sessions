Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a single example and made a significant, but incomplete, observation: it recognized the duplication of colored objects when a '0' (white/background) pixel was present to their right. However, it failed to generalize correctly, as evidenced by the errors in subsequent examples. The core issue is that the duplication logic is too simplistic. It only duplicates once, and only if single objects in the input have zero beside them, missing the broader pattern of repeating *entire colored object sequences*.

The strategy will involve:

1.  **Refined Object Identification:** Instead of looking at single pixels, focus on identifying contiguous horizontal sequences of the same color as single objects.
2.  **Sequence Replication:** Instead of single-pixel duplication, replicate the entire sequence of these colored objects.
3.  **Conditional Replication Trigger:** The replication is triggered by the presence of a '0' (white/background) pixel *anywhere* to the right of that object sequence in the input.
    The replication should extend that object sequence to fill all '0' pixels until a non-zero pixel.
4.  **Row-wise Operation:** The transformation operates independently on each row.

**Metrics Gathering**

To confirm the assessment above and verify assumptions about sequence replication, I will perform additional analysis with `tool_code`.

objects:
  - type: colored_sequence
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color in a row.
    properties:
      color: The color of the pixels in the sequence (integer 0-9).
      length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      start_position: Column index of the first pixel in the sequence.

actions:
  - name: replicate_sequence
    description: >-
      Replicates a colored sequence based on the presence of '0' pixels to its
      right. The replication factor depends on number of '0' pixels.
    trigger: Presence of one or more '0' pixels anywhere to the right of the sequence in the input row.
    parameters:
      sequence: The colored_sequence object to replicate.
    result:
      - The original colored_sequence object.
      - The colored sequence copied to fill '0' until non-zero value
transformation_rule: >-
  For each row, identify colored sequences. If a sequence has one or more '0'
  pixels anywhere to its right within the same row, then copy the sequence
  replacing '0' pixels until a non-zero pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate through each row:** The transformation is applied independently to each row of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Colored Sequences:** Within each row, identify contiguous sequences of non-zero pixels that share the same color. Consider each of these sequences as a single object.
3.  **Check for Replication Trigger:** For each identified colored sequence, check if there are any '0' (white) pixels present anywhere to the right of that sequence within the *same* row.
4.  **Replicate and Fill:** If '0' pixels are found to the right, replicate the entire colored sequence. Copy and insert the sequence immediately following the original sequence, and then fill remaining '0' pixels.

**Elaboration on Replication**

Based on the example, if the sequence is "2 3" and the row is "2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0", the sequence becomes "2 3 2 3 3 2 3 2".

The output is filled with the pattern, and stops when non-zero is encountered.
