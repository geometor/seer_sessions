facts:
  - observation: Grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.
  - object_identification: Contiguous regions of a single, non-zero color can be considered objects.
  - object_property:  Color of the region (represented by the digit).
  - object_property:  Shape of the region (implicit, not explicitly defined but relevant).
  - object_property: Location in the input
  - action: "Filling" or replacement of certain pixels within an object with magenta (6).
  - trigger_condition:  The filling occurs on the right side of the objects.
  - relationship:   Filled regions seem connected to specific color, shape and location in the input object
  - spatial_relation: Filling only affects a region within the object to the edge
  - object_property: the rightmost side of the original object is maintained
