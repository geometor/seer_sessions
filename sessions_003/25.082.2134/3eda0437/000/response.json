The most noticeable change is the occasional introduction of the color magenta (6) in the output grid, seemingly replacing or \"filling in\" areas within the input grid. The overall structure and dimensions of the grid remain constant. The placement of the magenta color seems related to contiguous regions of a single, non-zero color, specifically where those regions touch other background(0) or other regions.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts**\n\n"
