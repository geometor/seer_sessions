facts:
  - object: region
    properties:
      color: 0 # white
      contiguous: true # pixels of the same color are adjacent
      bounded: false # initially assume unbounded
      left_bound: -1  # index of the left boundary pixel, -1 means unbounded on the left.
      right_bound: -1 # index of the right boundary pixel, -1 means unbounded on the right.

  - action: fill_region
    properties:
      color: 6  # magenta
      condition: "region.bounded == true"
      start: "region.left_bound + 1"  # Start filling *after* the left boundary.
      end: "region.right_bound"  # Fill up to (but not including) the right boundary
    description: Fill a bounded region of 0s with color 6 (magenta).

  - object_interaction: none
    description: The regions of 0 are passive and static.

  - overall_transformation:
      iterate_rows: yes
      scan_direction: right to left not required.
      detect_boundries_left_and_right: true
