            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were on the right track, identifying objects and attempting to fill from the rightmost edge. However, the filling logic is incorrect. It's not simply filling to the left of *every* object's rightmost edge until a 0 is hit. It seems to fill only based on certain conditions related to the object that is currently rightmost.\n\nThe code needs adjustments to ensure:\n\n1.  **Correct Horizontal Fill:** Only the correct regions are filled in magenta on each row.\n2.  **Conditional object selection**: Select only objects on which to perform the fill action.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe error is that the program should not use the right-most point of every\nobject to determine which pixels to fill in the output, only some.\n\nThe program should locate any horizontal line and fill it with magenta, but only\nif that line has an object to the right.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using observations):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening in each example, and how it deviates from the expected output. I will not be using `tool_code` yet, focusing on observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The code incorrectly fills the top row to the left of the leftmost '5'.\n    *    It also does not correctly fill row 2 to the right of '1'.\n    *   The transformation fills in magenta on the first row, starting from a 5 and moving left.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Similar errors as example 1, with incorrect filling based on object selection.\n    *   Missing some expected magenta fills and some areas are incorrectly filled.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   The code fails to correctly fill in the magenta.\n    *   Fills some regions with magenta.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Several fill areas are incorrect.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"
