Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were on the right track, identifying objects and attempting to fill from the rightmost edge. However, the filling logic is incorrect. It's not simply filling to the left of *every* object's rightmost edge until a 0 is hit. It seems to fill only based on certain conditions related to the object that is currently rightmost.

The code needs adjustments to ensure:

1.  **Correct Horizontal Fill:** Only the correct regions are filled in magenta on each row.
2.  **Conditional object selection**: Select only objects on which to perform the fill action.

**Strategy:**
The error is that the program should not use the right-most point of every
object to determine which pixels to fill in the output, only some.

The program should locate any horizontal line and fill it with magenta, but only
if that line has an object to the right.

**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using observations):**

Here's a breakdown of what's happening in each example, and how it deviates from the expected output. I will not be using `tool_code` yet, focusing on observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   The code incorrectly fills the top row to the left of the leftmost '5'.
    *    It also does not correctly fill row 2 to the right of '1'.
    *   The transformation fills in magenta on the first row, starting from a 5 and moving left.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Similar errors as example 1, with incorrect filling based on object selection.
    *   Missing some expected magenta fills and some areas are incorrectly filled.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   The code fails to correctly fill in the magenta.
    *   Fills some regions with magenta.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Several fill areas are incorrect.

**YAML Fact Identification:**


```yaml
observations:
  - example: 1
    objects:
      - color: 5
        shape: contiguous block
        action: fill_left_if_contiguous_with_non_zero
      - color: 1
        shape: contiguous blocks
        action: fill_left_if_contiguous_with_non_zero
    transformation: "Fill with magenta (6) to the left of non-zero contiguous objects horizontally."
    notes: "The filling occurs based on horizontal contiguity, not just rightmost position."

  - example: 2
    objects:
      - color: 1
        shape: contiguous blocks
        action: fill_left_if_contiguous_with_non_zero

    transformation: "Fill with magenta (6) to the left of non-zero contiguous objects horizontally."

  - example: 3
      - color: 1
        shape: contiguous blocks
        action: fill_left_if_contiguous_with_non_zero

    transformation: "Fill with magenta (6) to the left of non-zero contiguous objects horizontally."

  - example: 4
    objects:
       - color: 1
         shape: contiguous blocks
         action: fill_left_if_contiguous_with_non_zero

    transformation: "Fill with magenta (6) to the left of non-zero contiguous objects horizontally."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate through each row** of the input grid.
2.  **For each row**:
    *   Scan from right to left.
    *   If there are contiguous non-zero pixels before hitting the edge of the grid or a zero, then fill the pixels up to the last non-zero pixel with magenta(6).
