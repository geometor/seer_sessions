1. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2. For each row, scan from right to left.
3. Identify contiguous regions of 0-colored pixels.
4. If a region of 0s is found, check for bounding non-zero pixels to its right.
5. Fill the region with magenta (color 6) up to the detected non-zero on its right, or to the beginning of the row, whichever comes first. Do *not* overwrite any pre-existing non-zero colored pixels.
