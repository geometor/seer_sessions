For each 0-colored pixel encountered:\n    - Check if it's part of an already identified region.\n    - If not, start a new \"region\" and mark its starting index.\n    - Continue scanning to the right, extending the region as long as 0s are encountered.\n    - Search for non-zero boundary pixels to the left and right of the region.\n        - If a non-zero pixel is found on the left, set region.left_bound to its index.\n        - If a non-zero pixel is found on the right, set region.right_bound to its index.\n        - If we reach the left edge without a boundary, keep region.left_bound = -1.\n        - If we reach the right edge without a boundary, keep region.right_bound = -1.\n4. After scanning a region, check if it's bounded (left_bound != -1 and right_bound != -1).\n5. If the region is bounded, fill it with magenta (color 6) from region.left_bound + 1 to region.right_bound (exclusive).\n6. If a region touches the edge, and there is no bounding pixel on that edge, it is not filled.\n7. Proceed until the end of the row.\n8.
