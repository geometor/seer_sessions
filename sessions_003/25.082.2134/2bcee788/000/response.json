Within this background, there are distinct colored shapes. The core task seems to involve modifying these non-background colored pixels, specifically changing or expanding it, and replacing the background with a constant color and changing the colored shapes to new colors based on their input color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
