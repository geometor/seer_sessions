    description: The initial background color of the grid.
  - name: first_shape
    description: >-
      The first contiguous shape encountered when scanning the input grid
      from top to bottom, left to right. A shape is a group of orthogonally
      connected pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      color: Varies (determined by the input grid).
      expandable: true
  - name: other_shapes
    description: >-
      Shapes other than the first_shape, identified after the first_shape has
      been found.
    properties:
      color: Varies (determined by input)
      expandable: false

actions:
  - name: replace_background
    target: background
    result: All background pixels (color 0) become color 3 (green).
  - name: expand_first_shape
    target: first_shape
    result: >-
      The first_shape expands by one pixel in all orthogonal directions
      (up, down, left, right). Expansion occurs only if the target pixel is
      the original background color (0).
    constraints:
       - orthogonal_neighbors_only: true
       - expands_onto_background_only: true
  - name: change_color
    target: other shapes
    result: >-
        If the color is 2, change to 6. If not, leave the color unchanged.
