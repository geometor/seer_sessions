The first contiguous, non-background shape (orthogonally connected pixels of the same color) encountered is designated as the \"first shape\".\n\n3.  **First Shape Expansion:** Expand the \"first shape\" by one pixel in all four orthogonal directions (up, down, left, and right). Expansion only occurs if the target pixel for expansion was originally the background color (0) in the input grid.\n\n4. **Change Color of Other Shapes:**\n    *   Identify all other shapes after finding the \"first shape\".\n    *   Change the pixels with color 2 to color 6. Do not modify any other colors\n\n5.
