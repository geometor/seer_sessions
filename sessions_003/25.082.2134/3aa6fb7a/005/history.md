1.  **Find Azure Sequences:** Examine the input grid to identify contiguous sequences of azure (8) pixels. A sequence is defined as one or more azure pixels that are adjacent either horizontally or vertically.

2.  **Insert Blue Pixel Based on First Azure:** For each identified azure sequence, insert a single blue (1) pixel in the output grid.
    *   If the sequence is horizontal, place the blue pixel in the same row, immediately to the right of the *first* azure pixel in the sequence.
    *   If the sequence is vertical, place the blue pixel in the same column, immediately below the *first* azure pixel in the sequence.

3. **Copy background pixels**: Pixels that are not azure (8), which make up the background, are copied to the output grid. The azure pixels remain in the input grid.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concept of finding azure sequences and placing a blue pixel. However, it's failing to accurately handle all cases, particularly regarding the placement of the blue pixel relative to *all* azure pixels in some sequences, and its logic isn't robust enough for differently shaped connected components. The issue appears to be an oversimplification in how the position of the added blue pixel is being determined from the azure "runs". The code currently only considers the *first* azure pixel.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze the Errors:** Carefully examine *both* examples, focusing on where the transformed output deviates from the expected output.  Specifically, observe the positioning of azure and the expected/actual blue pixels.
2.  **Refine the Rule:**  The core idea of inserting a blue pixel is correct, but the *placement rule* needs refinement. It's not *just* about the first azure pixel in a sequence. We need to adjust how horizontal and vertical sequences are handled. The blue pixel should consistently relate to the edge of the entire azure component.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:**  Re-write the natural language program with greater precision, incorporating the corrected placement rule.
4.  **Metrics:** Create code to look at pixel counts for the input, and compare the output and expected output, and a code block for the final report.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Components:** Find all contiguous components (groups of adjacent pixels) of azure (8) color in the input grid.  Adjacency includes both horizontal and vertical neighbors.

2.  **Determine Component Orientation:** For each azure component, determine if it's primarily horizontal, vertical, or a single pixel.
    *   A component is **horizontal** if it extends more in the horizontal direction than the vertical.
    *   A component is **vertical** if it extends more in the vertical direction than the horizontal.
    *   A component is **single** if it consists of only one pixel.

3.  **Add Blue Pixel:**  For each azure component, add a single blue (1) pixel to the output grid based on its orientation:
    *   **Horizontal:** Place the blue pixel immediately to the *right* of the right-most azure pixel in the component.
    *   **Vertical:** Place the blue pixel immediately *below* the bottom-most azure pixel in the component.
    * **Single:** Place the blue pixel immediately to the *right* of the single azure pixel.

4. **Copy Background:** Copy all non-azure pixels directly from the input grid to the output grid in the same position. Azure pixels in the original components remain.
