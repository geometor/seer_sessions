            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies azure components and attempts to place a blue pixel based on their orientation. However, it makes mistakes in determining the *precise* location of the added blue pixel, particularly when azure components are adjacent or close to each other. The code also makes some errors when there is wrapping on the edge. The core issue seems to be a slightly off logic in placing the blue pixel relative to the *entire* azure component, rather than just considering edge pixels, specifically in vertical arrangements.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Placement Logic:** The current code places the blue pixel based on overall component orientation (horizontal or vertical), and places it *next* to either right-most or bottom-most pixel. Instead of this, the logic should identify more of the properties of the azure region:\n    * find the azure components\n    * classify them based on orientation (horizontal, vertical, or single)\n    * add the new blue pixel based on which pixels are on the edge:\n       + if horizontal, add a blue pixel to the right of *each* azure pixel that does not have an azure neighbor to its right, *and* is within the bounds of the grid.\n       + if vertical, add a blue pixel below *each* azure pixel that doesn't have an azure neighbor below it, *and* is within the bounds of the grid.\n       + if single, place a blue pixel to the immediate right, *and* is within bounds.\n2.  **Handle Edge Cases:** Explicitly check for boundary conditions to prevent \"out-of-bounds\" errors when placing blue pixels near the edges of the grid. The provided solution already includes the bounds check.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where applicable):**\n\n"
