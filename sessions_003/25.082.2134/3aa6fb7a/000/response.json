Here's my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves two 7x7 grids. The primary color observed is azure (8), with the background being white (0). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels. The placement of the blue pixels appears to be related to the position of the azure pixels. It seems like the blue pixels are inserted between adjacent azure pixels in either the horizontal or vertical direction.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Adjacency can be either horizontal (same row, adjacent columns) or vertical (same column, adjacent rows).\n\n2.  **Insert Blue Pixel:** For each identified pair of adjacent azure pixels, insert a blue (1) pixel in the output grid.\n    *   If the azure pixels are horizontally adjacent, place the blue pixel in the same row, in the column directly to the right of the *leftmost* azure pixel of that pair.\n    *    If the azure pixels are vertically adjacent, place the blue pixel in the same column, in the row directly below the *topmost* azure pixel of that pair.\n\n3. **Copy Unmodified Pixels:** All other pixels from the input grid, which are any pixel that are not azure, should be copied to the output grid, in this case the white background. Specifically the azure colored pixels do not change.\n\nIn summary the logic places a blue pixel in the location between a horizontally or vertically adjacent pair of azure pixels.\n"
