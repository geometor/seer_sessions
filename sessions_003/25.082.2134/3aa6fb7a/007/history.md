"""
1.  **Identify Azure Components:** Find all contiguous components (groups of adjacent pixels) of azure (8) color in the input grid.  Adjacency includes both horizontal and vertical neighbors.

2.  **Determine Component Orientation:** For each azure component, determine if it's primarily horizontal, vertical, or a single pixel.
    *   A component is **horizontal** if it extends more in the horizontal direction than the vertical.
    *   A component is **vertical** if it extends more in the vertical direction than the horizontal.
    *   A component is **single** if it consists of only one pixel.

3.  **Add Blue Pixel:**  For each azure component, add a single blue (1) pixel to the output grid based on its orientation:
    *   **Horizontal:** Place the blue pixel immediately to the *right* of the right-most azure pixel in the component.
    *   **Vertical:** Place the blue pixel immediately *below* the bottom-most azure pixel in the component.
    * **Single:** Place the blue pixel immediately to the *right* of the single azure pixel.

4. **Copy Background:** Copy all non-azure pixels directly from the input grid to the output grid in the same position. Azure pixels in the original components remain.

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies azure components and attempts to place a blue pixel based on their orientation. However, it makes mistakes in determining the *precise* location of the added blue pixel, particularly when azure components are adjacent or close to each other. The code also makes some errors when there is wrapping on the edge. The core issue seems to be a slightly off logic in placing the blue pixel relative to the *entire* azure component, rather than just considering edge pixels, specifically in vertical arrangements.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Placement Logic:** The current code places the blue pixel based on overall component orientation (horizontal or vertical), and places it *next* to either right-most or bottom-most pixel. Instead of this, the logic should identify more of the properties of the azure region:
    * find the azure components
    * classify them based on orientation (horizontal, vertical, or single)
    * add the new blue pixel based on which pixels are on the edge:
       + if horizontal, add a blue pixel to the right of *each* azure pixel that does not have an azure neighbor to its right, *and* is within the bounds of the grid.
       + if vertical, add a blue pixel below *each* azure pixel that doesn't have an azure neighbor below it, *and* is within the bounds of the grid.
       + if single, place a blue pixel to the immediate right, *and* is within bounds.
2.  **Handle Edge Cases:** Explicitly check for boundary conditions to prevent "out-of-bounds" errors when placing blue pixels near the edges of the grid. The provided solution already includes the bounds check.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Azure Components:** Identify all contiguous groups (components) of azure (8) colored pixels in the input grid.  Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally).

2.  **Classify Component Shape:** For each identified azure component, determine its shape classification:
    *   **Horizontal:** If the component extends more in the horizontal direction than the vertical.
    *   **Vertical:** If the component extends more in the vertical direction than the horizontal.
    *   **Single:** If the component consists of only one pixel.

3.  **Add Blue Pixels based on shape:** For each azure pixel in each component, add a blue pixel as follows:
    *   **Horizontal Component:** Add a blue (1) pixel to the immediate right of each azure pixel *unless* there is another azure pixel to its immediate right, *or* the pixel is on the right edge of the grid.
    *   **Vertical Component:** Add a blue (1) pixel immediately below each azure pixel *unless* there is another azure pixel immediately below it, *or* the pixel is on the bottom edge of the grid.
    *   **Single Pixel Component:** Add a blue (1) pixel to the immediate right of the azure pixel *unless* the pixel is on the right edge of the grid.

4.  **Copy Background:** Copy all pixels that are *not* azure (8) from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their original positions. The azure components are preserved.
