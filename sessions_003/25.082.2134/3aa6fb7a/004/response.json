            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concept of finding azure sequences and placing a blue pixel. However, it's failing to accurately handle all cases, particularly regarding the placement of the blue pixel relative to *all* azure pixels in some sequences, and its logic isn't robust enough for differently shaped connected components. The issue appears to be an oversimplification in how the position of the added blue pixel is being determined from the azure \"runs\". The code currently only considers the *first* azure pixel.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Errors:** Carefully examine *both* examples, focusing on where the transformed output deviates from the expected output.  Specifically, observe the positioning of azure and the expected/actual blue pixels.\n2.  **Refine the Rule:**  The core idea of inserting a blue pixel is correct, but the *placement rule* needs refinement. It's not *just* about the first azure pixel in a sequence. We need to adjust how horizontal and vertical sequences are handled. The blue pixel should consistently relate to the edge of the entire azure component.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:**  Re-write the natural language program with greater precision, incorporating the corrected placement rule.\n4.  **Metrics:** Create code to look at pixel counts for the input, and compare the output and expected output, and a code block for the final report.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Code Execution):**\n\n"
