"""
1.  **Identify '0' (White) Pixels:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.

2.  **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Enclosure:** For each '0' pixel, initiate a Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine if it's part of an enclosed region.
    *   A region is considered enclosed if *all* paths from the starting '0' pixel to the edge of the grid encounter a '2' (red) pixel.
    *   During the DFS, keep track of visited cells to avoid infinite loops.
    *   DFS should explore all 8 neighboring cells (including diagonals).
    *   If the DFS reaches the edge of the grid without encountering only '2' pixels, the starting '0' pixel is *not* enclosed, so cease that DFS path.
3.  **Identify all Enclosed regions:** Do not reset the visited list when checking different white regions as interconnected white cells are part of the same region, but not necessarily connected
4.  **Fill Enclosed Regions:** If the DFS confirms that a '0' pixel is part of an enclosed region, change its color, and the color of all '0' pixels connected to it, to '9' (maroon) in the output grid.
5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not '0' (i.e., '2' pixels) in the input grid should remain unchanged in the output grid.
