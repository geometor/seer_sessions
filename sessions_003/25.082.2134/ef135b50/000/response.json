These '0' regions are then filled with '9' (maroon) pixels in the output grid. The '2' pixels remain unchanged. The crucial element is the concept of a fully enclosed region. It seems diagonal adjacency does *not* prevent enclosure.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A region is considered \"enclosed\" if it is completely surrounded by '2' (red) pixels.  \"Completely surrounded\" means that every path from a white pixel in the region to the edge of the grid must pass through at least one red pixel.  Diagonal adjacency of red pixels counts towards enclosure.\n\n2.  **Fill Enclosed Regions:** For each enclosed region of '0' pixels identified in step 1, change the color of all pixels within that region to '9' (maroon).\n\n3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not part of an enclosed region of '0' pixels (i.e., the '2' pixels) remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\nThe core concept here is identifying and filling *enclosed* regions, where enclosure is defined by complete surrounding by a different color, with diagonal adjacency contributing to the enclosure.\n"
