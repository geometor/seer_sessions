A region is considered \"enclosed\" if it is completely surrounded by '2' (red) pixels.  \"Completely surrounded\" means that every path from a white pixel in the region to the edge of the grid must pass through at least one red pixel.  Diagonal adjacency of red pixels counts towards enclosure.\n\n2.  **Fill Enclosed Regions:** For each enclosed region of '0' pixels identified in step 1, change the color of all pixels within that region to '9' (maroon).\n\n3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not part of an enclosed region of '0' pixels (i.e., the '2' pixels) remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets the coordinates of all 8 neighbors (cardinal and diagonal) of a cell.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(rows, row + 2)):\n        for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(cols, col + 2)):\n            if (i, j) != (row, col):\n                neighbors.append((i, j))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef is_enclosed(grid, row, col, visited):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a '0' pixel is part of an enclosed region using Depth-First Search.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # Base cases:\n    if grid[row, col] == 2:  # Reached a boundary '2'\n        return True\n    if (row, col) in visited: # avoid visit cycles\n        return True\n    if row == 0 or row == rows - 1 or col == 0 or col == cols - 1: #edge\n        if grid[row,col] == 0:\n            return False\n\n    visited.add((row, col))\n    neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, row, col)\n    all_neighbors_enclosed = True\n    \n    for r, c in neighbors:\n        if grid[r,c] == 0:\n            if not is_enclosed(grid, r, c, visited):\n                all_neighbors_enclosed = False\n                break # short circuit as soon as a path to the edge is found\n                \n    return all_neighbors_enclosed\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the enclosure rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # build a list of the enclosed zero pixels\n    enclosed_zeros = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the grid to find '0' pixels and check for enclosure\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[i, j] == 0:\n                visited = set()\n                if is_enclosed(input_grid, i, j, visited):\n                    enclosed_zeros.append( (i,j) )\n\n    # fill in the enclosed pixels\n    for r, c in enclosed_zeros:\n        output_grid[r,c] = 9\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
