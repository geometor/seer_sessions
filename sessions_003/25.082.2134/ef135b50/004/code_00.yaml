facts:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
      - cells: Individual elements (pixels) within the grid, each with a color value.

  - object: pixel
    description: A single cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: An integer representing the pixel's color (0-9).
      - row: The row index of the pixel.
      - col: The column index of the pixel.
      - neighbors: Adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
      - enclosed: A boolean indicating whether the pixel is part of an enclosed region (initially unknown).

  - object: region
    description: A contiguous group of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
        - color: the color of the region
        - enclosed: A boolean indicating whether ALL '0' pixels are completely surrounded by '2' pixels, including diagonally.
  - action: identify_enclosed_regions
    description: Find all regions of '0' pixels that are completely enclosed by '2' pixels.
    input: input_grid
    output: A list of sets, each set containing the (row, col) coordinates of '0' pixels in an enclosed region.

  - action: fill_enclosed_regions
    description: Change the color of all '0' pixels within enclosed regions to '9'.
    input: output_grid, enclosed_regions
    output: modified output_grid

  - transformation:
    description: The overall process of identifying and filling enclosed regions.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
