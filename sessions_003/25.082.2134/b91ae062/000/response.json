            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** A small, rectangular grid of single-digit integers (colors).\n*   **Output:** A larger, rectangular grid, also of single-digit integers. The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve replicating each element of the input grid both horizontally and vertically. The degree of replication (scaling factor) appears consistent within each example, but varies *between* examples. The output grid's dimensions are always multiples of the input grid dimensions. The background (0, or white) is also replicated.\n* The output height and width seems to be input height time input width.\n*   **Objects:** Individual pixels/cells in the grids can be considered objects, each having a color property (represented by the digit).  The entire input and output grids can also be thought of as composite objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The blocks will tile seamlessly to form the complete output grid.\n\nIn essence, each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a rectangle of pixels in the output grid. The dimensions of each rectangle are equal to input width and height, resulting in a scaled replication of the original pattern.\n"
