The output grid is a single column. The order appears to be related to the order in which the colors *first appear* when scanning the input grid from top-left, reading row by row (like reading English text). It seems only colors forming the largest connected area for each color is selected. It also seem that the colors on edges are prioritized.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
