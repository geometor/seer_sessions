I see blues (1), whites (0), reds (2), greens (3), yellows (4), azures (8), oranges (7) and maroons (9).\n*   **Shapes/Objects:** The grids seem to contain horizontal lines (rows) of uniform color at the top and bottom. There are also isolated pixels of different colors within the grid.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve replacing certain single pixels within the grid with the color of the top row, and sometimes duplicating the top row color to an adjacent space.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
