1.  **Identify Top and Bottom Row Pixels Per Column:** For each column in the input grid, get the color value of the pixel in the top row and the color value of the pixel in the bottom row.
2.  **Determine the Dividing Line:**
    *   If the grid has an odd number of rows, the "middle row" is the row exactly in the center.
    *   If the grid has an even number of rows, the dividing line is conceptually between the two central rows.
3.  **Iterate Through Columns:** For each column:
4.  **Propagate Top Color Downwards:**
    *   Starting from the row immediately below the top row, and going down to the row *above* the middle row (or dividing line):
        *   If the current pixel's color is not 0, replace it with the color of the top row pixel *in the same column*.
5.  **Propagate Bottom Color Upwards:**
    *   Starting from the row immediately above the bottom row, and going up to the middle row (or the row *below* the dividing line if even number of rows):
        *   If the current pixel's color is not 0, replace it with the color of the bottom row pixel *in the same column*.
6.  **Middle Row (Odd Rows):** If the grid has an odd number of rows, do not modify the middle row.
