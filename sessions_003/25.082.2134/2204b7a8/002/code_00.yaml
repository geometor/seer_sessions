facts:
  - description: "The top and bottom rows of the input grid maintain their colors in the output grid."
    details:
      - observation: "In all examples, the colors of the top and bottom rows in the input grid are identical to the colors of the corresponding rows in the output grid."
        evidence:
            - example_1: "Input top/bottom color: 1/1, Output top/bottom color: 1/1"
            - example_2: "Input top/bottom color: 4/7, Output top/bottom color: 4/7"
            - example_3: "Input top/bottom color: 8/9, Output top/bottom color: 8/9"

  - description: "Pixels of colors different from both top and bottom row colors are replaced based on proximity"
    details:
        - observation: "Inner pixels (not in the top or bottom rows) that have a color different from *both* the top and bottom row colors are candidates for replacement."
        - observation: "The color they get seems to depend on the proximity to the top or bottom"

  - description: "Replacement with top row's color"
    details:
        - observation: "If the replaced pixel is within the top half it is replaced by the color of the top row."

  - description: "Replacement with bottom row's color"
    details:
      - observation: "If the replaced pixel is within the bottom half it is replaced by the color of the bottom row."

  - description: "Middle line"
    details:
        - observation: "If the number of rows is odd, the middle row is not changed"
        - observation: "If the number of rows is even, the line between top and bottom halves is considered to be top_row + 1"
