objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - role: source
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: variable (dependent on input)
      - role: target
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: mapped from value (see COLOR_MAP)
      - role: element

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: non-zero pixels
    target: output_grid
    description: Each non-zero pixel in input_grid becomes a 5x5 block of the same color in output_grid.

  - name: separate
    agent: zero pixels
    target: output_grid
    description: Zero pixels create rectangular zero-filled regions acting as padding, their dimensions determine the shape and position of the expanded color blocks.

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains pixels
  - output_grid: contains expanded blocks of pixels
  - non-zero pixel: expands to block of same color
  - zero pixel: expands to block of zeros
  - expansion factor: height = 5, width = 5. derived by output_grid.height / input_grid.height, output_grid.width/ input_grid.width.
