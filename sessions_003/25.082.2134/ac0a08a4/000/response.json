The core transformation appears to be an expansion of each non-zero pixel in the input grid into a square block of the same color in the output grid. The size of this square block seems to be related to the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, the input is 3x3. The output is constructed by repeating color block 5 times for height, and repeating color block 5 times for width. Zero-value pixels in the input grid correspond to larger rectangular blocks of zeros in the output grid, acting as separators.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
