        properties:
          - dimensions: "Determined based on the input and the expansion logic."
  - actions:
      - name: "Expand"
        description: "Each non-zero pixel in the input grid is expanded into a rectangular block of the same color in the output grid."
        parameters:
            - vertical_expansion: "Number of rows the pixel expands to."
            - horizontal_expansion: "Number of columns the pixel expands to."
        constraints:
          - "Expansion is seemingly consistent across different values within each example, but varies across examples based on the ratio of output grid dimensions and input grid dimensions"
