facts:
  - task: "Expand non-zero pixels to fill space bounded by zeros and grid edges."
  - objects:
      - name: "Non-zero pixels"
        properties:
          - "color": "Represents a color from the COLOR_MAP."
          - "expansion": "Expands to fill available space."
      - name: "Zero pixels"
        properties:
          - "color": "Represents white (background)."
          - "behavior": "Acts as a boundary for non-zero pixel expansion."
      - name: "Grid"
        properties:
          - "dimensions": "Variable height and width."
          - "boundary": "Outer edges of the grid limit expansion."
  - actions:
      - name: "Expansion"
        description: "Non-zero pixels expand horizontally and vertically until they encounter a zero pixel or the grid boundary."
        rules:
          - "Each non-zero pixel's color fills the expanded area."
          - "Expansion does not cross zero pixels."
          - "Expansion stops at the grid edges."
          - "Expansion ratios are not fixed and depend on input grid layout."
  - observations:
    - example_1: "Pixel 2 expands to 2x2. Pixel 7 expands to 2x2."
    - example_2: "Pixel 4 expands to 3x3. Pixel 8 expands to 3x3. Pixel 6 expands to 3x3"
    - example_3: "Each non-zero pixel expands by 5x5"
