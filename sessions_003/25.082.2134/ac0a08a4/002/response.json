            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of expanding each non-zero pixel in the input grid into a 5x5 block of the same color in the output grid. The results show that this approach works perfectly for Example 3, but fails for Examples 1 and 2. The primary issue is the incorrect sizing and placement of the expanded blocks, and the handling of zero-valued pixels. The code assumes a fixed 5x expansion, which is not always correct, and uses a fixed expansion with zeros to fill.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors involves:\n1.  **Dynamically Determine Block Size**: Instead of a fixed 5x5 expansion, derive expansion factor dynamically from sizes of input and output.\n2.  **Correct Placement**: Ensure that the expanded blocks are positioned correctly, accounting for the variable sizes of zero-valued separators.\n3. **Refine the expansion logic** so we don't assume that a zero value will\n   always represent a border.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary)**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Expected Transformation: The input has a non-zero pixel at (0,0) with value 2 and (1,2) with value 7. It appears 2 expands to 2x2 and 7 expands to 2x2 and the 0's expand to fill in spaces.\n    *   Code Result: Incorrect. The output shape is (15, 15), indicating a 5x5 expansion for all cells.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (9, 9)\n    *   Transformation appears that non-zero values expands to fill 3x3 and zeros fill in.\n    *   Code Result: Incorrect. The output shape is (15, 15), indicating a 5x5 expansion for all cells.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (15, 15)\n    *   Expected transformation appears that non-zero values expands to fill 5x5 and zeros fill in.\n    *   Code Result: Correct. The output shape and pixel values match the expected output.\n\n"

Each non-zero pixel represents a distinct object with a specific color. Zero pixels represent background or separators.\n2.  **Determine Expansion Factor:** Calculate the expansion factor by dividing the output grid dimensions by the input grid dimensions. The expansion factors can be different for height and width.\n3. **Expansion based on factors**: Non-zero pixels will be expanded by the height and width factors to form blocks of that color. Zeros will be expanded dynamically to fill the remaining space, effectively acting as separators between the colored blocks.\n\nThe transformation rule is to expand each non-zero pixel in the input grid into a block in the output grid. The size of each block is determined dynamically by the overall size of the input and output, using a calculated expansion factor. Pixels with a value of 0 in the input grid act as dynamic separators, filling the space between the expanded blocks.\n"
