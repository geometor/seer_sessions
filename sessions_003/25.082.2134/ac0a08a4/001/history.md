Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller input grid into a larger output grid. The core transformation appears to be an expansion of each non-zero pixel in the input grid into a square block of the same color in the output grid. The size of this square block seems to be related to the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, the input is 3x3. The output is constructed by repeating color block 5 times for height, and repeating color block 5 times for width. Zero-value pixels in the input grid correspond to larger rectangular blocks of zeros in the output grid, acting as separators.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - role: source
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: variable (dependent on input)
      - role: target
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: mapped from value (see COLOR_MAP)
      - role: element

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: non-zero pixels
    target: output_grid
    description: Each non-zero pixel in input_grid becomes a 5x5 block of the same color in output_grid.

  - name: separate
    agent: zero pixels
    target: output_grid
    description: Zero pixels create rectangular zero-filled regions acting as padding, their dimensions determine the shape and position of the expanded color blocks.

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains pixels
  - output_grid: contains expanded blocks of pixels
  - non-zero pixel: expands to block of same color
  - zero pixel: expands to block of zeros
  - expansion factor: height = 5, width = 5. derived by output_grid.height / input_grid.height, output_grid.width/ input_grid.width.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Obtain the input grid (3x3).
    *   Determine the output grid's dimensions. The height and width are each 5 times the input grid.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.

3.  **Expansion:**

    *   If the pixel's value is non-zero:
        *   Create a 5x5 block in the output grid.
        *   Fill this block with the pixel's color.
        *   The starting position is set by row and col index.
    *   If the pixel's value is zero:
        * Create padding with zeros
        * The size and position are inferred and depend on non-zero block position.

4. **Output:**
   * Return the filled output_grid.
