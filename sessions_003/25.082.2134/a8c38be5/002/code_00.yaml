        The input grid has multiple objects of different colors.
        The output grid is always 9x9.
        Each object is made up of 3 x 3 blocks where blocks are either entirely inside the object or entirely outside
        For each 3x3 block in the input, there is a corresponding 3 x 3 in the output
        The corresponding 3x3 in the output grid uses the color of the input object.
