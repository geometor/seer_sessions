facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output are grids of different sizes. Output is smaller.
  - objects: |
      Objects are contiguous regions of the same color.
  - dominant_color: |
      Gray (5) appears very frequently.
  - background_color: |
        White(0) is frequently background but the lower-right of the Input
        grid is almost always a solid color other than white.
  - transformation_type: |
      Spatial rearrangement and reduction of colored regions.
  - object_interaction: |
        Objects seem to be more replaced/resized than having explicit
        interactions such as "pushing".
  - output_grid_shape: "9x9"
