There's a notable prevalence of gray (5) objects.\n*   **Background:** White (0) seems to often act as the background, but other colors can as well.\n*   **Spatial Changes:** There's a definite re-arrangement and reduction of colored regions between the input and output. It's not a simple color substitution.\n*   **Object Interactions:** It is difficult to make definite statements about how objects might interact. It seems objects are replaced or resized more than they interact.\n* **Output Size:** The output grid is consistently smaller (fewer rows and columns) than the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Consider this object\n    as the shape template.\n\n3. **Scan the input grid:** Starting at the top-left corner of the input,\n    search for 3x3 patches that have the same color structure as the shape\n    template.\n\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an empty 9x9 output grid.\n\n5.  **Populate output grid:** When a 3x3 patch that matches shape template\n    structure is found:\n    - Find the equivalent color in the patch.\n    - Place the color into the output grid in the corresponding location.\n\n6. **Return:** Return the filled 9 x 9 output grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation takes shapes from the lower-right corner of the\ninput image, and \"stamps\" them to their equivalent locations on a new 9x9 grid,\nbased on locations found in the input grid of a matching color-pattern.\n"
