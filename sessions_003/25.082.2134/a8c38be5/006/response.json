However, it fails to accurately place these blocks in the output grid according to the expected output. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Placement:** The code places the 3x3 blocks sequentially in the output grid (using `i // 3` and `i % 3`), which doesn't correspond to the spatial arrangement observed in the expected outputs. The expected outputs maintain some relative positioning of objects *between* input and output.\n2.  **Missing 3x3 blocks**: In many instances, the input object does not contain any full 3x3 blocks of the same color.\n3. **Object identification**. Multiple objects are incorrectly identified.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Object Relationships:** Examine the input and expected output pairs to understand how the positions of the 3x3 blocks in the output relate to the positions of their original objects in the input. There seems to be an attempt to maintain relative positions.\n2.  **Improve Placement Logic:** Modify the code to place the 3x3 blocks in the output grid based on a more accurate understanding of the spatial relationships.\n3.  **Handle Missing Blocks:** Consider what to do when a 3x3 block isn't found within an object.\n4.  **Revisit Object identification:** Examine closely how to determine what is considered an object.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and reasoning - code execution not necessary for this high-level analysis):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has multiple objects of various colors.\n    *   Expected output has a 9x9 grid.\n    *   Transformed output is all zeros except for a single 3x3 block of color 5. The algorithm finds one 3x3 sub-block, but not multiple.\n    *   The layout in the expected output follows the object layout in the input, but is constructed of 3x3 blocks of the same color.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Similar to Example 1, the input has multiple objects.\n    *   Expected output is 9x9.\n    *   Transformed output shows only one 3x3 block of color 5.\n    *   The layout in the expected output follows the object layout in the input, but is constructed of 3x3 blocks of the same color.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"

Connectivity is defined by the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Diagonal connections are not considered for object formation.\n2.  **Find 3x3 Blocks:** For each identified object, attempt to locate the first 3x3 block of uniform color within the object. The \"first\" is determined by scanning the object from top-left to bottom-right.\n3. **Preserve and represent spatial positions** The relative postions of objects in the input are represented in the output, with the relative positions of the identified 3x3 sub-blocks.\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 9x9 output grid.\n5.  **Arrange Blocks:** For each object where the 3x3 block was found: Represent the object in the input grid.\n6.  **Fill Output:** Fill the 3x3 block in the output grid with the color of the original object.\n\nThe current description still has weaknesses but it tries to capture the core idea of spatial representation. The notion of \"representing\" an input object as a single 3x3 block in the correct spatial position relative to other objects is at the core of the transformation.\n"
