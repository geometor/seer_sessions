1. **Identify Objects:** Divide the input grid into distinct objects, where each object is a group of connected pixels of the same color. Connectivity is defined by the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Diagonal connections are not considered for object formation.
2.  **Find 3x3 Blocks:** For each identified object, attempt to locate the first 3x3 block of uniform color within the object. The "first" is determined by scanning the object from top-left to bottom-right.
3. **Preserve and represent spatial positions** The relative postions of objects in the input are represented in the output, with the relative positions of the identified 3x3 sub-blocks.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 9x9 output grid.
5.  **Arrange Blocks:** For each object where the 3x3 block was found: Represent the object in the input grid.
6.  **Fill Output:** Fill the 3x3 block in the output grid with the color of the original object.
