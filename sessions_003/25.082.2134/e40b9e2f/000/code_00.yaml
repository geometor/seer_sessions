facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are of the same dimensions (10x10).
  - observation: |
      The background color is consistently white (0).
  - observation: |
    In train_1, a "cross" shaped group of yellow and orange pixels, with central orange, creates a mirrored version of the orange along the row and the column, with the main change in the row.
  - observation: |
    In train_2, a "square" of magenta is beside a green pixel, changes with a mirrored "L" shape of green added next to magenta, on both sides, with the center in the same column.
  - observation: |
      In train_3, a horizontal line of azure pixels are near to a single maroon pixel, creates a mirrored "L" shape centered in the same column
  - objects:
    - type: pixel_group
      properties:
        colors: [orange, yellow, green, magenta, azure, maroon]
        shapes: [cross, square, line]
        actions: [mirror, insert]
      relations:
        - type: adjacency
          description: Adjacent pixels of the same color form a group.
        - type: symmetry
          description: Output reflects a mirrored transformation of parts of the input, creating new colored pixels based on the central pixels of input shapes.
