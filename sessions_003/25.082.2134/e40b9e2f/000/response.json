The primary colors involved are orange (7), yellow (4), green (3), magenta (6), maroon (9), and azure (8), all against a background of white (0). The transformation appears to involve a combination of mirroring, insertion and, potentially, conditional placement of pixels based on their neighbors. The shape formed by non-white pixels seem to play a crucial role. There seems to be a \"center\" to groups of pixels of the same color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
