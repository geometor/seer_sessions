"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous groups of non-white pixels. Each group is an object, characterized by its color and shape (single pixel, compact shape like a square or L, etc.).

2.  **Grid Centerlines:** Determine the horizontal and vertical centerlines of the entire input grid.

3.  **Object Transformations:**

    *   **Compact Shapes:** For compact shapes (more than 2 pixels and generally square/rectangular/L-shaped), reflect the entire object across *both* the horizontal and vertical centerlines of the grid.

    *    **Single Pixels:** If there is a single pixel and a compact object in the input grid, it is placed in relation to the compact shape.
        - Determine the center point of compact colored block (average its min and max row, and min and max column).
        - reflect single pixels across compact object centers.

    *   **Output:** Combine the reflected objects to produce the output grid. Ensure pixels from different reflected shapes can occupy the same output location (producing new objects).

4. **Color counts** in the output will be the sum of the original color
   counts plus the colors of reflected objects.
