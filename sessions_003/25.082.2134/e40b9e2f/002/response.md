Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies pixel groups and their centers. However, the mirroring logic is flawed and incomplete. It only considers orange, green, and maroon pixels and doesn't correctly implement the "L" shape mirroring around the center. The examples reveal that the mirroring should create a symmetrical "plus" shape (+) centered on the original object's center, and this mirroring affects *all* non-white colors, not just orange, green and maroon. Colors of mirrored pixels should also match original pixels.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct the Mirroring Logic:** The core issue is how the mirroring is implemented. Instead of trying to extend the group, we should calculate the reflection of *each* pixel in the group across the center point, both horizontally and vertically.
2.  **Apply to All Colors:** Remove the color restriction ( `if color in [7, 3, 9]:`) so the transformation applies to all non-white pixels.
3. ** Account for yellow, azure and magenta: ** Extend same mirroring effect to yellow, azure and magenta.

**Gather Metrics and Reports:**
There is no need to perform code execution, information provided includes pixel counts.

**Example Analysis:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has two objects: orange (7) and yellow (4).
    *   Expected Output: Both objects are mirrored to form a '+' shape.
    *   Actual Output: Only the orange object is considered, and it is not mirrored; original input returned.
    *   Pixels off: 6 (3 extra orange on each mirrored side).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has two objects: green (3) and magenta (6).
    *   Expected Output: Both are mirrored to create plus shapes.
    *   Actual Output: Only the green object considered, original input is returned.
    *    Pixels off: 6
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has two objects: maroon (9) and azure (8).
    *    Expected Output: Plus shape for both objects.
    *   Actual Output: Only maroon considered, but not mirrored, original input is returned.
    *    Pixels off: 3

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - description: Contiguous groups of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color value of the pixels in the group (1-9).
      - center: The calculated center point (row, col) of the group.
      - pixels: A list of (row, col) coordinates for each pixel in the group.
actions:
  - name: Mirror Pixel Group
    description: For each pixel in a group, reflect it across the group's center both horizontally and vertically.
    inputs:
      - object: A pixel group.
    outputs:
      - modified_grid: The grid with the mirrored pixels added.
    constraints:
      - All non-white pixels groups are mirrored.
      - Mirrored pixels have same color as the object.
      - Mirroring creates a symmetrical '+' shape.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous groups of non-white pixels in the input grid. Each group is an object.
2.  **Find Center:** Calculate the center (row, column) of each object by averaging the row and column coordinates of all pixels within the object.
3.  **Mirror Pixels:** For *each* pixel in *every* object:
    *   Calculate its reflected position across the object's center row.
    *   Calculate its reflected position across the object's center column.
    *    Set the pixel at this reflected position in output grid to the color of pixel group
    *   Draw the original object in the output grid.
