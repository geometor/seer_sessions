            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies pixel groups and their centers. However, the mirroring logic is flawed and incomplete. It only considers orange, green, and maroon pixels and doesn't correctly implement the \"L\" shape mirroring around the center. The examples reveal that the mirroring should create a symmetrical \"plus\" shape (+) centered on the original object's center, and this mirroring affects *all* non-white colors, not just orange, green and maroon. Colors of mirrored pixels should also match original pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct the Mirroring Logic:** The core issue is how the mirroring is implemented. Instead of trying to extend the group, we should calculate the reflection of *each* pixel in the group across the center point, both horizontally and vertically.\n2.  **Apply to All Colors:** Remove the color restriction ( `if color in [7, 3, 9]:`) so the transformation applies to all non-white pixels.\n3. ** Account for yellow, azure and magenta: ** Extend same mirroring effect to yellow, azure and magenta.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Reports:**\nThere is no need to perform code execution, information provided includes pixel counts.\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has two objects: orange (7) and yellow (4).\n    *   Expected Output: Both objects are mirrored to form a '+' shape.\n    *   Actual Output: Only the orange object is considered, and it is not mirrored; original input returned.\n    *   Pixels off: 6 (3 extra orange on each mirrored side).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has two objects: green (3) and magenta (6).\n    *   Expected Output: Both are mirrored to create plus shapes.\n    *   Actual Output: Only the green object considered, original input is returned.\n    *    Pixels off: 6\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has two objects: maroon (9) and azure (8).\n    *    Expected Output: Plus shape for both objects.\n    *   Actual Output: Only maroon considered, but not mirrored, original input is returned.\n    *    Pixels off: 3\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
