```python
"""
1.  **Identify Connected Components:** Find all connected components of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.  A connected component is a group of gray pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to at least one other pixel in the group.

2.  **Initialize Color Sequence:** Create a color sequence `[1, 3, 2]` (Blue, Green, Red).

3.  **Iterate Through Components:** For each connected component of gray pixels:
    *   Initialize a color sequence index to 0.
    *   Iterate through the pixels in the connected component (order doesn't matter within a component).
    *   For each pixel:
        *   Replace the pixel's value in the output grid with the color from the color sequence at the current `color_index`.
        *   Increment the `color_index` by 1, cycling back to 0 if it reaches the end of the sequence (`color_index = (color_index + 1) % 3`).

4.  **Keep other colors:** All non-gray pixels remain the same in the output.

5. **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.
