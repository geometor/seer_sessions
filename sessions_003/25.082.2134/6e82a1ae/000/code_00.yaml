facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Gray (5) pixels in the input are transformed.
  - observation: Other color are not transformed, they are all white(0).
  - observation: The transformation assigns colors blue(1), red(2), and green(3).
  - observation: The new colors are assigned in a specific sequence (blue, then green, then red).
  - observation: the colors cycle, and the selection depends on position.
  - rule: |-
     The color sequence starts by changing the gray value to blue(1), then the next gray will be green(3), then the next gray will be red(2), and this repeats.
