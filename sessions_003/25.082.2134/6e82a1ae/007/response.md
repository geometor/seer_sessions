1.  **Find Gray Components:** Identify all connected components of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.  A connected component consists of gray pixels that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

2.  **Sort Pixels within Each Component:** For each gray component, sort its pixels. Sort primarily by row number (ascending, top-to-bottom) and secondarily by column number (ascending, left-to-right).

3.  **Apply Cycling Color Transformation:**  Define a color sequence: Blue (1), Green (3), Red (2). For each gray component, iterate through its *sorted* pixels.  Assign the first pixel the first color (Blue). For each subsequent pixel, assign the next color in the sequence. If you reach the end of the sequence, cycle back to the beginning (Blue).

4. **Preserve Other Colors:** Pixels that are *not* gray in the input grid retain their original color in the output grid.

5.  **Output:** The modified grid is the result.
