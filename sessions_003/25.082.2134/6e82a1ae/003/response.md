"""
1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid as the output grid. Initialize a color sequence `[1, 3, 2]` (representing Blue, Green, and Red) and a color sequence index to 0.

2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, row by row, and column by column.

3.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each pixel:
    *   If the pixel's color is gray (5):
        *   Replace the pixel's value in the *output grid* with the color from the color sequence at the current `color_index`.
        *   Increment the `color_index` by 1, cycling back to 0 if it reaches the end of the sequence (i.e., `color_index = (color_index + 1) % 3`).
    *   Otherwise (if the pixel is not gray):
        *   Keep original pixel value from input grid.

4.  **Output:** The modified copy of the grid (output grid) is the result.
