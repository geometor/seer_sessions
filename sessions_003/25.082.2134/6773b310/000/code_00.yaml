facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: [0, 6, 8] # white, magenta, azure
      - common_structure: horizontal_line_of_8s
      - separator_columns: columns_with_8s

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    size: 3x3
    properties:
      - values: [0, 1]    # white, blue

  - observation: output_size_constant
    description: The output grid is always 3x3, regardless of the input grid's size.

  - observation: color_mapping
    description: Input uses [0,6,8], output uses [0,1].

  - observation: input_subdivision_by_8s
    description: The input grid seems to have three sections separated by 8s (azure). There is also a horizontal line in the middle composed of all 8's

  - relationship: potential_correspondence
    description: There might be a correspondence between the three sections created by the 8's in the input grid, and the three rows in the output grid. The appearance of magenta in input sections and blue in the rows must relate.
