The input grids share a common structure:\n\n*   A horizontal line of '8' (azure) pixels dividing the grid roughly in the middle.\n*   '8' (azure) pixels are present in the columns of the upper and lower parts, acting seemingly as separators or delimiters.\n*    '6' (magenta) pixels appear sporadically, and their positions might be key.\n*   The output grid is always 3x3 and consists only of '0' (white) and '1' (blue) pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Consider sections as top, center, and bottom, corresponding to rows in the input above, between and below the line of 8's.\n\n2.  **Check for Magenta:** For each section (top, center, and bottom):\n    *   Examine the grid section to determine if a '6' (magenta) pixel exists in the section *before* the first '8' of each line in this section.\n\n3.  **Generate Output Row:** Create a corresponding row in the 3x3 output grid:\n    *   If a '6' (magenta) pixel is present *before* the 8 in *any* line of that section, place a '1' (blue) in the corresponding output row/column position. The column position is determined by the horizontal position of the magenta 6 *before* the azure 8.\n    *   If there is no '6' (magenta) pixel *before* an 8 in a section line, place a '0' (white) in the corresponding output row. Since the output is 3x3, if 6s are present on the first, third, and fifth row of a section, the ouput is 1,0,1.\n\n4.  **Combine Rows:** Combine the three generated rows to form the final 3x3 output grid.\n"
