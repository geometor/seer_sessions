Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small input grid into a larger output grid. The output grid appears to be a structured, expanded version of the input grid. There's a clear replication of certain color blocks (objects) from the input within the output, specifically involving colors 2 (red) and 3 (green) with zero (white) as background. The core pattern seems to involve creating a 4x4 block in the output from a subset of 2x2 in the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_name: "Grid Expansion and Replication"
input_grid_size: 3x3
output_grid_size: 9x9
objects:
  - name: green_block
    color: 3
    initial_position: varies
    shape: variable
  - name: red_block
    color: 2
    initial_position: varies
    shape: variable # in first example, it is part of the larger green object
  - name: white_background
    color: 0
    shape: "fills remaining space"
actions:
  - name: expand_and_replicate
    description: "A 2x2 block within the upper left 4x4 area of output is created for each non-white 2x1 or 1x2 block of the input"
relationships:
  - description: "Output grid is 3 times the size (both width and height) of the input grid."
  - description: "Colored blocks from the input are expanded and replicated in a specific quadrant of the output."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Target Subgrid:** Examine the input grid to find connected non-white pixels.
2. **Expansion Factor:** The output grid is 3 times the size of the input grid in each dimension (9x9 output for a 3x3 input).
3. **Replication Rule:**
    * For each contiguous block of one or more non-white pixels:
      * Find the x and y location of the left most and or top most pixel of the group
      * Multiply the x and y coordinate by 3. This will act as offset for the next step.
      * Create 4x4 blocks in the top-left region of the output by replicating a 2x2 square section starting from the offset, using the color for the original selection.
      * IF input pixel colors differ, use the pixel value from the top/left most,
        e.g. in example 1 the 2x1 block of green, red on input will be replicated
        as all green in output.
4. **Background:** Fill the rest of the output grid with white (0).

Essentially the input acts as instructions of where to create a 2x2 block and fill it with the colors of the original input.
