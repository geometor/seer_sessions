The output grid appears to be a structured, expanded version of the input grid. There's a clear replication of certain color blocks (objects) from the input within the output, specifically involving colors 2 (red) and 3 (green) with zero (white) as background. The core pattern seems to involve creating a 4x4 block in the output from a subset of 2x2 in the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This will act as offset for the next step.\n      * Create 4x4 blocks in the top-left region of the output by replicating a 2x2 square section starting from the offset, using the color for the original selection.\n      * IF input pixel colors differ, use the pixel value from the top/left most,\n        e.g. in example 1 the 2x1 block of green, red on input will be replicated\n        as all green in output.\n4. **Background:** Fill the rest of the output grid with white (0).\n\nEssentially the input acts as instructions of where to create a 2x2 block and fill it with the colors of the original input.\n"
