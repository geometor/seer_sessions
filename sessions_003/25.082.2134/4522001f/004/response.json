            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial approach of expanding non-white pixels into 4x4 blocks was partially correct but has several flaws revealed by the test results:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Block Size:** The code creates blocks based on adjacent colors from the *input* grid, leading to inconsistencies. The output blocks should have the dimensions determined solely by the current non-white pixel of the input grid. It should be a 3x3 block of the color of the input grid pixel.\n2.  **Incorrect Block Placement/Overlapping Logic:** The rule for handling overlapping blocks (prioritizing top and left neighbors in the input) doesn't consistently produce the correct output. The actual overlap seems handled by placing a complete square where it should. The adjacent color logic is wrong.\n3.  **Incorrect Output Size:** The output grid seems to consistently be 9x9, derived as 3x the input dimensions.\n4. **Incorrect color:** The color replacement in example 2 is incorrect.\n\nThe core strategy should be to revise the natural language program to clarify the following:\n\n*   **Fixed 3x3 Block Expansion:** Emphasize that *each* non-white pixel in the input grid generates a *3x3* block of the *same* color in the output grid.\n*   **No Adjacent Pixel Logic**: Remove the incorrect \"top and left neighbor\" precedence rule. A cell in the input grid should map to a 3x3 block, with no influence of neighbouring cells in the input grid.\n*   **Output size** - confirm that the output should be input size \\* 3\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, confirmed with code below)**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3\n    *   Output: 9x9\n    *   Pixels Off: 31 (Many pixels in the top-left 3x3 block extend to 4x4. The right 3x3 block should be a 2 and is a 3)\n    *   Size Correct: True (9x9)\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True (Only colors 0, 2, and 3 are present)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3\n    *   Output: 9x9\n    *   Pixels Off: 39 (The top-right 3x3 block is all 2. It should be 3 and has some cells from the center block. The bottom and center blocks merge.)\n    *   Size Correct: True (9x9)\n    *   Color Palette Correct: False. (2 should not be a color. It is present in the output when it shouldn't be.)\n\n"
