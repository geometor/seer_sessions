Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial approach of expanding non-white pixels into 4x4 blocks was partially correct but has several flaws revealed by the test results:

1.  **Incorrect Block Size:** The code creates blocks based on adjacent colors from the *input* grid, leading to inconsistencies. The output blocks should have the dimensions determined solely by the current non-white pixel of the input grid. It should be a 3x3 block of the color of the input grid pixel.
2.  **Incorrect Block Placement/Overlapping Logic:** The rule for handling overlapping blocks (prioritizing top and left neighbors in the input) doesn't consistently produce the correct output. The actual overlap seems handled by placing a complete square where it should. The adjacent color logic is wrong.
3.  **Incorrect Output Size:** The output grid seems to consistently be 9x9, derived as 3x the input dimensions.
4. **Incorrect color:** The color replacement in example 2 is incorrect.

The core strategy should be to revise the natural language program to clarify the following:

*   **Fixed 3x3 Block Expansion:** Emphasize that *each* non-white pixel in the input grid generates a *3x3* block of the *same* color in the output grid.
*   **No Adjacent Pixel Logic**: Remove the incorrect "top and left neighbor" precedence rule. A cell in the input grid should map to a 3x3 block, with no influence of neighbouring cells in the input grid.
*   **Output size** - confirm that the output should be input size \* 3

**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, confirmed with code below)**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3
    *   Output: 9x9
    *   Pixels Off: 31 (Many pixels in the top-left 3x3 block extend to 4x4. The right 3x3 block should be a 2 and is a 3)
    *   Size Correct: True (9x9)
    *   Color Palette Correct: True (Only colors 0, 2, and 3 are present)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x3
    *   Output: 9x9
    *   Pixels Off: 39 (The top-right 3x3 block is all 2. It should be 3 and has some cells from the center block. The bottom and center blocks merge.)
    *   Size Correct: True (9x9)
    *   Color Palette Correct: False. (2 should not be a color. It is present in the output when it shouldn't be.)

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
transformation_rule:
  type: grid_expansion
  input:
    grid_size: 3x3
    cell_values: integers [0-9]
  output:
    grid_size: 9x9
    cell_values: integers [0-9]
  expansion:
    type: per_cell
    condition: non-white_cell # If a cell is not white (value 0)
    size: 3x3 # Each non-white cell expands into a 3x3 block.
    color: same_as_input # The 3x3 block has the same color as the input cell.
  overlap:
      resolution: none # 3x3 blocks created at correct index, no need to consider overlaps
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input and Output:** The input is a 3x3 grid of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The output is a 9x9 grid.

2.  **Expansion:** For each cell in the input grid:
    *   If the cell is *not* white (color 0):
        *   Create a 3x3 block in the output grid.
        *   The top-left corner of this 3x3 block corresponds to the position of the input cell, scaled by 3.  (e.g., input cell (0,0) maps to output block starting at (0,0), input cell (1,2) maps to output block starting at (3,6)).
        *   All cells within this 3x3 block have the *same* color as the original input cell.
    *   If the cell *is* white (color 0):
        * output grid at corresponding location is also white.

3. **Overlaps are not considered:** Each non-white input cell generates a 3x3 block. The positioning is absolute based on the input cell coordinates and no special handling for overlaps.

In essence, the transformation scales the input grid by a factor of 3. Each non-zero pixel in the input becomes a 3x3 block of the same color in the output. Zero-valued pixels are effectively ignored (remain white in the output).
