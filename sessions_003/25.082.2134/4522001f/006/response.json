            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on expanding each non-white pixel in the input grid to a 3x3 block in the output grid. However, the positioning of these 3x3 blocks is incorrect. The code seems to treat all pixels as being in the top-left, it should consider their input position. The initial approach *almost* worked for Example 1 because some of the non-white pixels are in the top-left (0,0) and (0,1) locations. Example 2 clearly highlights the error, where blocks aren't positioned based on the row and column of the originating input pixel. The 'else' condition also seems redundant, re-setting white pixels that are already initialized, also the white pixels should also remain in the correct positions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue is how offsets are calculated. It must respect the original indices. The `offset_r` and `offset_c` calculations are correct, but the placement is the issue. The code needs to calculate these offsets, and then use this as the upper-left origin of each block.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using prior results):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (9, 9)\n    *   Pixels Off: 33\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: False (due to count issues)\n    *    Analysis: The first two blocks happen to align, but the overall pattern is wrong.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (9, 9)\n    *   Pixels Off: 33\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: False (due to count issues)\n    *    Analysis: The error is clearer here, the blocks created don't match at all.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"
