Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a single example and clearly doesn't generalize well to the second example. The core idea of expanding 3x3 input to 9x9 output and using non-white pixels to trigger 4x4 blocks is partially correct. However, there are several issues:

1.  **Incorrect Block Placement:** The code places the 4x4 blocks based on the row and column of *every* non-white pixel, leading to overlaps and incorrect patterns.
2.  **Incorrect Block Color:** The color logic is flawed. It attempts to use adjacent pixels for color determination, which isn't the correct rule. It appears that if blocks have different colors that touch, the touching portion on the output grid should be the same color as whatever block is on top and to the left.
3.  **Incorrect expansion:** The blocks in the output are always of size 4x4.

The strategy will involve:

1.  **Correct Block Identification:**  Instead of triggering on *every* non-white pixel, it should be using 2x2 blocks from the center.
2.  **Refine Color Logic:**  Determine the rule for the color of overlapping and adjacent blocks.

**Metrics and Analysis (using code execution)**

First, let's get some basic information about example, input shape and output shape.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 1
input1 = np.array([[3, 3, 0], [3, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]])
output1 = np.array([[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

# Example 2
input2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 3], [0, 3, 3]])
output2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]])

print(f"Example 1: Input Shape: {input1.shape}, Output Shape: {output1.shape}")
print(f"Example 2: Input Shape: {input2.shape}, Output Shape: {output2.shape}")


```
```
Example 1: Input Shape: (3, 3), Output Shape: (9, 9)
Example 2: Input Shape: (3, 3), Output Shape: (9, 9)

```
```yaml

      description: If the blocks of different colors touch, the touching portions on the output grid should be the color that matches the block to the top or to the left.
  - constraints:
    - The input grid is always 3x3.
    - The output grid is always 9x9.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled with white (0).
2.  **Input Scan:** Iterate through the 3x3 input grid.
3.  **Block Expansion:** For each non-white pixel encountered in the input grid:
    *   Determine the row (r) and column (c) of the pixel in the input grid.
    *    Calculate an offset: `offset_r = r * 3` and `offset_c = c * 3`.
    *   Create a 4x4 block in the output grid, starting at position (`offset_r`, `offset_c`), and fill that 4x4 block.
4. **Block color:** The color will be determined by these precedence rules:
      * Check for a non-white pixel above the current pixel. If one exists, use the color of the adjacent top pixel
      * If there isn't one above, check for a non-white pixel to the left. Use the color of the adjacent pixel on the left.
      * if neither exist, use the color of the original non-white pixel
5.  **Output:** The final 9x9 output grid represents the transformed image.
