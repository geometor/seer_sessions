The core idea of expanding 3x3 input to 9x9 output and using non-white pixels to trigger 4x4 blocks is partially correct. However, there are several issues:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Block Placement:** The code places the 4x4 blocks based on the row and column of *every* non-white pixel, leading to overlaps and incorrect patterns.\n2.  **Incorrect Block Color:** The color logic is flawed. It attempts to use adjacent pixels for color determination, which isn't the correct rule. It appears that if blocks have different colors that touch, the touching portion on the output grid should be the same color as whatever block is on top and to the left.\n3.  **Incorrect expansion:** The blocks in the output are always of size 4x4.\n\nThe strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Correct Block Identification:**  Instead of triggering on *every* non-white pixel, it should be using 2x2 blocks from the center.\n2.  **Refine Color Logic:**  Determine the rule for the color of overlapping and adjacent blocks.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (using code execution)**\n\nFirst, let's get some basic information about example, input shape and output shape.\n\n"
