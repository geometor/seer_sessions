facts:
  - task: "Expand a 3x3 grid to a 9x9 grid"
  - objects:
    - name: input_grid
      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: "integers representing colors (0-9)"
    - name: output_grid
      type: grid
      dimensions: 9x9
      elements: "integers representing colors (0-9)"
    - name: "non_white_pixel"
      property: has_color
  - relationships:
     - "each non-white pixel in the input_grid corresponds to 4X4 block in output_grid"
  - actions:
    - action: map
      source: non-white input pixel
      target: 4x4 block in output_grid
      description: "Non-white pixels in the input grid determine the presence and color of 4x4 blocks in the output grid."
    - action: expand_grid
      input: input_grid(3x3)
      output: output_grid(9x9)
    - action: adjacent_blocks
      input: two blocks of pixels
      description: If the blocks of different colors touch, the touching portions on the output grid should be the color that matches the block to the top or to the left.
  - constraints:
    - The input grid is always 3x3.
    - The output grid is always 9x9.
