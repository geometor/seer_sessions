Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   '0' (white) seems to act like a background or empty space.\n*   Non-zero digits form objects of various shapes.\n*   The output grids are larger than the input grids, suggesting some form of expansion or duplication.\n*   The non-zero digits from the input appear to be replicated in a specific pattern in the output. The pattern seems related to a mirroring and/or duplication, the location, the layout/shape.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Consider contiguous blocks of the same color as single objects.\n2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid is double the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.\n3.  **Mirror and Duplicate:** For each object in the input grid:\n    *   Copy the object to the top-left quadrant of the output grid.\n    *   Mirror the object horizontally and place it in the top-right quadrant of the output grid.\n    *   Mirror the original object vertically and place it in the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid.\n    *   Mirror the original object both horizontally and vertically and place in bottom-right quadrant.\n4. fill any empty spaces with '0' (the background).\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule is a combination of mirroring and duplication of objects to produce an output grid that is twice the size of the input in each dimension.\n\n"
