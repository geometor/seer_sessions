Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits (0-9), representing different colors.
*   '0' (white) seems to act like a background or empty space.
*   Non-zero digits form objects of various shapes.
*   The output grids are larger than the input grids, suggesting some form of expansion or duplication.
*   The non-zero digits from the input appear to be replicated in a specific pattern in the output. The pattern seems related to a mirroring and/or duplication, the location, the layout/shape.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are smaller than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids contain the same digits as the input grids, but duplicated.
  - observation: '0' represents the background.
  - observation: Non-zero digits form objects.
  - relationship: objects in input are mirrored both horizontally and vertically in output.
  - train_1:
      input_shape: 3x4
      output_shape: 6x8
      object: '8' (azure) positioned at specific locations
  - train_2:
      input_shape: 3x4
      output_shape: 6x8
      object: '3' (green) forming multiple shapes
  - train_3:
      input_shape: 3x4
      output_shape: 6x8
      object: '3' (green) forming a combination of straight and L-shaped figures
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-zero colored objects within the input grid. Consider contiguous blocks of the same color as single objects.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid is double the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.
3.  **Mirror and Duplicate:** For each object in the input grid:
    *   Copy the object to the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
    *   Mirror the object horizontally and place it in the top-right quadrant of the output grid.
    *   Mirror the original object vertically and place it in the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid.
    *   Mirror the original object both horizontally and vertically and place in bottom-right quadrant.
4. fill any empty spaces with '0' (the background).

In essence, the transformation rule is a combination of mirroring and duplication of objects to produce an output grid that is twice the size of the input in each dimension.
