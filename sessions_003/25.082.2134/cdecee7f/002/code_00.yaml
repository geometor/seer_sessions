objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    shape: (10, 10)
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: The initial grid containing digits.
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    shape: (3, 3)
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: The transformed grid.
  - name: nonzero_digits
    type: list
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description:  Non-zero digits extracted from the input_grid, sorted
      by their position in input_grid, reading top to bottom, left to right.

actions:
  - name: extract_nonzero
    input: input_grid
    output: nonzero_digits
    description: Extracts and orders non-zero digits based on their position.
      The position is determined by reading the grid top to bottom and
      left to right. Digits appearing at position i, should appear in the
      output before digits that are found at position greater than i.
  - name: populate_output
    input: nonzero_digits, output_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Fills the output_grid with the ordered non-zero digits,
      filling empty remaining cells with 0.
