The transformation identifies groups of three adjacent blue (1) pixels forming either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The central blue pixel in each such group is changed to red (2).  Blue pixels that are adjacent to any red pixel that remains part of a line of three red pixels *after* the first transformation are changed to white (0).

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the core concept of converting the center pixel of 3-adjacent blue pixels to red. However, it struggles with the second part of the rule, which involves changing blue pixels adjacent to *lines* of red pixels to white. The current implementation seems to over-apply this rule or interpret "adjacency" and "line" too broadly and converts some of the correct red pixels to white incorrectly. The errors show a mix of incorrect conversions (blue to white, or red to blue where they shouldn't be), indicating a need to refine both the identification of red lines and the adjacency check.

**Strategy:**

1. **Refine Adjacency:** Ensure the `is_adjacent` function is used correctly and there are no ambiguities or off by one errors in comparing pixel locations.

2. **Refine Red Line Identification:** The `is_part_of_red_line` function is correctly implemented. The problem arises in the adjacency check that happens. I need to check for red pixels *after* initial blue to red changes, that are a) next to blue pixels, and b) part of red line.

3. **Iterative Application of Rules:** I think the temp grid is causing issues. I should stick with one pass. The problem arises because the adjacency is checked at the same time the initial colors are being flipped.

4. **Debug with Simpler Cases:** It might be useful to create smaller, more focused test cases (e.g., a single 3-blue-pixel line, a 3-blue-pixel line next to a single blue pixel) to pinpoint exactly where the logic breaks down. I will, however, try to just improve the logic first.

**Metrics Gathering (using provided results, no code execution needed for this specific task):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Pixels off: 13
    *   Size correct: True
    *   Color palette correct: True
    *   Notes: Several blue pixels incorrectly changed to white, and red incorrectly changed to blue or other colors

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Pixels off: 12
    *   Size correct: True
    *   Color palette correct: True
    *    Notes: Similar issues to Example 1. Over-application of the white conversion, especially in areas adjacent to correct red lines.

**YAML Fact Representation:**

    object: "blue pixel group"

      - length: 3

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Lines:** Find all groups of exactly three adjacent blue (1) pixels that form a straight line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

2.  **Convert Center to Red:** For each identified group, change the color of the *center* pixel from blue (1) to red (2).

3.  **Identify Adjacent Blues:** After performing steps 1 and 2, iterate through the grid, examine each cell that *remains* blue (value is still 1).

4. **Check Red Adjacency:** For all such blue pixels from Step 3, determine if they neighbor a pixel which has the value red(2) *and* if that red neighbor belongs to group of three continguous red pixels (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

5.  **Convert to White:** If a blue pixel is adjacent to a red pixel which is part of a red line of length three (as defined above), change the blue pixel's color to white (0).

6.  **Preserve other Reds**: Any red pixels that are part of a three red pixel sequence after the previous rules have been applied should remain red.

7. **All other pixels**: Remain unchanged.
