            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the core concept of converting the center pixel of 3-adjacent blue pixels to red. However, it struggles with the second part of the rule, which involves changing blue pixels adjacent to *lines* of red pixels to white. The current implementation seems to over-apply this rule or interpret \"adjacency\" and \"line\" too broadly and converts some of the correct red pixels to white incorrectly. The errors show a mix of incorrect conversions (blue to white, or red to blue where they shouldn't be), indicating a need to refine both the identification of red lines and the adjacency check.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Refine Adjacency:** Ensure the `is_adjacent` function is used correctly and there are no ambiguities or off by one errors in comparing pixel locations.\n\n2. **Refine Red Line Identification:** The `is_part_of_red_line` function is correctly implemented. The problem arises in the adjacency check that happens. I need to check for red pixels *after* initial blue to red changes, that are a) next to blue pixels, and b) part of red line.\n\n3. **Iterative Application of Rules:** I think the temp grid is causing issues. I should stick with one pass. The problem arises because the adjacency is checked at the same time the initial colors are being flipped.\n\n4. **Debug with Simpler Cases:** It might be useful to create smaller, more focused test cases (e.g., a single 3-blue-pixel line, a 3-blue-pixel line next to a single blue pixel) to pinpoint exactly where the logic breaks down. I will, however, try to just improve the logic first.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using provided results, no code execution needed for this specific task):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels off: 13\n    *   Size correct: True\n    *   Color palette correct: True\n    *   Notes: Several blue pixels incorrectly changed to white, and red incorrectly changed to blue or other colors\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels off: 12\n    *   Size correct: True\n    *   Color palette correct: True\n    *    Notes: Similar issues to Example 1. Over-application of the white conversion, especially in areas adjacent to correct red lines.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
