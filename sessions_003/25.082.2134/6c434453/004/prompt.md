"""
The transformation identifies groups of three adjacent blue (1) pixels forming either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The central blue pixel in each such group is changed to red (2). Any blue pixel which is not part of such a line, but is adjacent to such a line has the following rule.  If a contiguous line of three blue pixels are all changed to red, and a blue pixel is adjacent to the new red line, the blue pixel *adjacent* to the line changes to white (0).  Any *isolated* blue lines remain unchanged.
