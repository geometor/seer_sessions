"""
The transformation identifies groups of three adjacent blue (1) pixels forming either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The central blue pixel in each such group is changed to red (2). Any blue pixel which is not part of such a line, but is adjacent to such a line has the following rule.  If a contiguous line of three blue pixels are all changed to red, and a blue pixel is adjacent to the new red line, the blue pixel *adjacent* to the line changes to white (0).  Any *isolated* blue lines remain unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code have a fundamental flaw: they over-apply the transformation. The core idea of changing the center of a 3-blue-pixel line to red is correct. However, the second part, changing adjacent blues to white, is too aggressive and incorrectly implemented. It's changing blues to white based on *any* adjacent red, not just those reds that were *created* by the first rule *and* are still part of a line of 3. The code doesn't adequately track the original state versus the modified state, leading to cascading changes. The second example shows this clearly – it's transforming more pixels than it should.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine the adjacency check:** We need to be absolutely sure we are only considering red pixels created in the first step (turning the central blue to red) and that form a line of 3.
2.  **Better Tracking:**  Instead of two separate passes, consider doing it in a single pass but with more precise logic.
3.  **Isolate the transformation:** Ensure that turning center to red and then a neighboring blue to white are two completely separate steps. Don't let the white transformation bleed into any arbitrary blue pixel.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution):**

I'll create a helper function to count pixel colors and get the differences.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Lines:** Iterate through all pixels in the input grid. For each blue pixel (value 1), check if it is the *center* pixel of a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of exactly three adjacent blue pixels.

2.  **Center Pixel Transformation:** If a blue pixel is identified as the center of such a line, change its color to red (value 2).

3.  **Adjacent Pixel Transformation (Conditional):** Iterate through all pixels again. For each *remaining* blue pixel (still blue after step 2), check for adjacency to any red pixels that *resulted* from the previous step, and that still form part of a contiguous line of 3. If a blue pixel is adjacent to such a red line of 3, change the blue pixel to white (value 0).  A red pixel is considered part of the original group of 3 if it remains part of a line of 3 red.

4. **Leave other pixels unchanged:** All other pixels that do not meet the above criteria maintain their original color. This specifically includes isolated blue pixels, and blue lines shorter or longer than length 3.

The key improvement here is the more precise definition of adjacency and ensuring the second transformation only happens based on reds that form part of a line of three *after* they have been created in Step 2.
