The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and azure (8).  The shapes formed by the colored pixels seem to be the key elements. There's a sense of shifting or repositioning of these shapes. The transformation doesn't involve a change of color, and seems to keep the original pixel configurations.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider each of these as a separate object.\n2.  **Preserve Empty Rows Above:** Check the top rows of the input grid. If they consist of white pixels (empty) then they need to persist on the output grid.\n3. **Reposition:** Starting from the top, fill the output with the objects, by maintaining original row order of non-white pixels. If a set of rows in the input grid contain white pixels then do not copy them to the output, except if they are on top of the grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation removes empty (white) rows *between* objects of red and azure pixels, preserving the vertical order of the objects and any empty rows above them.\n"
