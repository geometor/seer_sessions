            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies and extracts non-white rows. It also correctly calculates the vertical center and stacks the extracted rows. However, the centering logic is flawed. It *shifts* the non-white rows towards the center but does *not* guarantee that the entire block of non-white rows is centered within the output grid. It appears the original center calculation is off by one row in some cases, and in other cases it fails to preserve relative row position while centering.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Centering Logic:** Double-check the formula used to calculate `start_row`. The current formula seems to only consider the number of non-white rows but does not account for the position and spacing around the non-white region.\n\n2.  **Test Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases such as:\n    *   Only one non-white row.\n    *   All rows are non-white.\n    *   Almost all rows are non-white.\n    *  Odd and Even grid sizes.\n\n3. **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the description to more accurately reflect the centering process. It should emphasize that the *entire block* of non-white rows is centered, maintaining the original order.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using visual inspection of outputs and code execution):**\n\nI will use visual inspection to get the number of rows that contain non-white\npixels and the height/width.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input Dimensions: 14x9\n*   Non-white Rows: 4\n*   Starting row should be (14-4)/2=5\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input Dimensions: 9x10\n*   Non-white Rows: 5\n*   Starting row should be (9-5)/2 = 2\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   Input Dimensions: 11x10\n*   Non-white Rows: 5\n*   Starting row should be (11-5)/2=3\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

This is done by subtracting the number of non-white rows from the total number of rows in the grid and dividing the result by two. Use integer division (floor). `start_row = (rows - num_non_white_rows) // 2`\n4.  **Stack Rows:** Copy the identified non-white rows from the input grid to the output grid, starting at the calculated `start_row` index. Maintain the original relative order of the non-white rows.\n5. **Preserve Empty Rows:** All other rows in the output grid should be all white (all pixels set to 0).\n6. **Preserve Shape:** the contents of the non-white input rows are exactly the same as the output rows.\n"
