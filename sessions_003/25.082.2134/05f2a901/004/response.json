            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of removing empty rows *between* objects, while preserving leading/trailing empty rows. This works for Example 3, but fails for Examples 1 and 2. The core issue is that the transformation isn't just about removing \"empty rows between objects.\" It seems to involve a more complex rearrangement of rows, possibly involving shifting and/or mirroring/flipping. The \"pixels_off\" count in the failure cases are relatively low (20 and 18), it does appear the current logic may be partially correct. The main strategy will be to re-examine the relationship between input and output, focusing not just on *removing* rows, but on how the *existing* rows are *repositioned*.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Object Identification:** Precisely identify \"objects\" (contiguous non-white regions) in both input and output grids.\n2. **Row Mapping:** Track the original row index of each object in the input and its corresponding row index in the output. This will reveal the row-level transformation.\n3. **Pattern Detection:** Look for patterns in the row mapping. Is it a simple shift? A reversal? A combination of operations?\n4. **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect the observed row mapping and any detected patterns.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection for now, code execution can be added if needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Two objects (red, azure) separated by many white rows.\n    *   Output: The objects are moved together, with many white lines above and below.\n    *   Observation: It appears the colored rows are \"centered\".\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *    The relative positions and shapes of object are preserved.\n    *    Some of the \"white\" space is preserved, and some is removed.\n    *   Observation: It appears the colored rows are \"centered\".\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Two objects (azure, red) separated by white rows.\n    *   Output: Objects are moved together, with many white lines above and below.\n    *   Observation: It appears the colored rows are \"centered\".\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Maintain the original vertical order of the identified rows. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n3. **Preserve shape:** The output rows have exactly the same contents as the input rows.\n\nThis revised program accounts for the \"centering\" behavior observed in all three examples.
