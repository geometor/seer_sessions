        shape: 'rectangle'
        bounding_box: [[7, 7], [9, 9]]
    output_grid_size: [3, 3]
    transformation: "Objects are placed in output grid, maintaining relative position."
    output_observations: "Relative order of objects in the output is not determined solely by rightmost/bottom-most sorting."

        shape: 'rectangle'
        bounding_box: [[2, 3], [4, 5]]
    output_grid_size: [3, 3]
    transformation: "Objects are placed in the output grid based on their relative input position."
    output_observations: "The output grid reflects a wrapping behavior where objects maintain relative positions."
