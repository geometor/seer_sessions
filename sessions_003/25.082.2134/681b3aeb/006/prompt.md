1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all distinct objects within the input grid. An object is defined as a contiguous group of pixels sharing the same non-zero color. Determine the bounding box (the smallest rectangle encompassing the object) for each identified object.

2.  **Object Sorting:** Sort the identified objects based on their position. The primary sorting criterion is the rightmost column of their bounding box, in descending order (objects further to the right are processed first). If objects share the same rightmost column, the secondary sorting criterion is the bottom-most row of their bounding box, also in descending order (lower objects are processed first).

3.  **Output Grid Initialization:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled entirely with zeros.

4.  **Sequential Output Filling:** Iterate through the sorted list of objects. For each object, retrieve its color. Fill the cells of the output grid sequentially with this color. Start at the top-left cell (0, 0) and proceed from left to right. Once a row is complete, move to the next row, starting from the leftmost cell.  Continue this process, overwriting any previously filled cells, until all cells in the output grid are filled, or you complete filling with all object colors.
