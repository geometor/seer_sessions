There are large areas of '0' (white/background). There are distinct, non-overlapping regions of other colors.\n*   **Output:** Each output is a 3x3 grid.  The output seems to be a condensed representation of *some* of the colored regions in the input, but not all. The order of the colors seems significant.\n*    The output grid always contain 3 x 3 pixels\n*    It seems we only care for colors other than 0\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
