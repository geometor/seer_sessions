            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information and a plan to adjust the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code correctly identify the need to scan the input grid and extract non-zero pixels. However, the order in which these pixels are placed into the output grid is incorrect. The current program fills the output grid row by row with the colors it finds, which doesn't match all the examples. The examples show a more complex relationship between locations of colored objects in input and output. It is not a simple raster scan order.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Object Placement:** We need to carefully examine *where* the non-zero pixels are in the input grid relative to their positions in the output grid. The existing code only considers the order in which colors are found, not their original spatial relationships.\n2.  **Refine the Algorithm:** Based on the observed placement patterns, we'll need to adjust the natural language program to describe how the input's spatial information dictates the output grid's arrangement. It appears that we need to consider object position, not just the order of individual pixels.\n3.  **Consider Object Properties:** We'll incorporate object properties like bounding boxes to help determine how objects are placed.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**\n\nI'll start by gathering some general information and structure this in the `facts` section. Then I will use the facts to create the natural language program.\n\n"
