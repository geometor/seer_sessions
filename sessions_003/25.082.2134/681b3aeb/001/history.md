Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to understand the transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** Each input is a 10x10 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. There are large areas of '0' (white/background). There are distinct, non-overlapping regions of other colors.
*   **Output:** Each output is a 3x3 grid.  The output seems to be a condensed representation of *some* of the colored regions in the input, but not all. The order of the colors seems significant.
*    The output grid always contain 3 x 3 pixels
*    It seems we only care for colors other than 0

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Inputs are 10x10 grids; outputs are 3x3 grids.
  - observation: |
      Inputs contain multiple colored regions, separated by background (0).
  - observation: |
      Outputs only contain a subset of the colors from the input.
  - observation: |
     The top-right non-zero color appear to mark the start of the extraction pattern
  - observation: |
      The colors in output are not in same relative position, nor in the exact shape as input.
  - observation: |
      The input is scanned from top right to bottom left.
  - observation: |
    The order of the colors found during the scan matters, they are added
    to the result grid in the order that they are found.
  - observation: |
     The output grid will contain all non-zero colors until the 3 x 3 grid is full
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start scanning the input grid, beginning at the top right corner (row 0,
    column 9). The search direction is first by column (right to left), then by
    row (top to bottom)
2.  Find the first non-zero pixel.
3.  Record this color.
4.  Continue searching the grid in the same order (from top right to bottom left). Record the color of each non-zero pixel encountered.
5.  Construct 3x3 output grid by filling the cells in order found colors.
6.  Stop when the output grid is full.
