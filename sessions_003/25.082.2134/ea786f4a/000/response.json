The transformation seems to affect the outer \"border\" of the grid, changing its color to white (0) while potentially preserving or modifying the existing colors of pixels on the original grid. The central pixel appears to define a \"do not change\" instruction - that is, it retains its value.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
