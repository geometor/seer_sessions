The most obvious change is the introduction or modification of a color (yellow, represented by '4') within the input grid. This new color seems to fill areas that were previously '0' (white) in the input, but the filling has a specific pattern related to existing colored regions. It appears like an \"inside\" versus \"outside\" distinction is being made.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

A region is \"inside\" if it's completely enclosed on all four sides, the region is \"outside\" if it touches the boundaries of the grid, or if it is enclosed in a color other than 0.\n3. **Fill Inside Regions:** Change the pixel values from '0' to '4' (yellow) for the region.\n4. If 0 is inside a region of one color, then change them to 4.\n5.  If the region of '0' pixels is *not* enclosed (\"outside\"), it remains unchanged (keeps the value '0').\n6. Copy the original non-zero grids to the output.\n\nIn more concise terms, the transformation rule is: **\"Fill enclosed regions of '0' (white) pixels with '4' (yellow), leaving other regions unchanged.\"**\n"
