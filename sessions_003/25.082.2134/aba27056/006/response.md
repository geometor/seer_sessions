Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program and supporting information.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to fill enclosed regions of '0' (white) pixels with '4' (yellow). However, the test results clearly show that the code is *not* correctly identifying and filling the enclosed regions. It seems to be failing to recognize any enclosed regions. A likely issue is related to the flood fill logic or the boundary detection that is not being applied to each of the enclosed zero-valued regions, but to the whole board, and also the boundary condition being checked might not be perfect. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze the `is_enclosed` function:** Carefully examine the logic for identifying enclosed regions, paying close attention to how it handles boundaries and connectivity. Review the use of visited set and to_visit set for the breadth-first search
2.  **Debug with Metrics:** Use `tool_code` to calculate specific metrics on the failed examples. This will help pinpoint exactly *where* the algorithm is deviating from the expected behavior. Examples include counting the expected number of filled pixels vs the actual, identifying coordinates of incorrect pixels, and checking neighbor relationships.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the debugging and metric analysis, rewrite the natural language program to be more precise and address the identified shortcomings.
4.  **Iterate:** The updated program must improve the performance across all three training examples.

**Gather Metrics**

I need to confirm exactly how many pixel differences there are in each result, this will help focus the error detection.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Enclosed Regions:** An enclosed region is defined as a contiguous area of '0' (white) pixels that is completely surrounded by either non-'0' pixels or the edge of the grid. "Contiguous" means connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
2.  **Flood Fill:** For each identified enclosed region, change all '0' pixels within that region to '4' (yellow).
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Pixels that are not part of an enclosed region of '0's remain unchanged.

The core issue is correctly identifying the enclosed regions. The previous version failed because it was incorrectly determining what constitutes 'enclosed'. The crucial addition is that the *edge of the grid* acts as a bounding element, just like a non-zero pixel.
