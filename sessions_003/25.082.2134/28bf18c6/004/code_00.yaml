  - task_id: 28bf18c6
  - example_1:
      input_object: "Contiguous block of blue (8) pixels forming a shape."
      output_pattern: "Alternating color,color,0 sequence per row, last row all colors"
      object_shape_relation: "Each input row contributes to the output row"
      last_row_rule: "The distinct colors of the shape, repeated to width 6."
      errors: "Incorrect application of the color,0 pattern. Last row is incorrect."
  - example_2:
      input_object: "Contiguous block of red (2) pixels."
      output_pattern: "Alternating color,color,0 sequence per row, last row all colors"
      object_shape_relation: "Each input row contributes to the output"
      last_row_rule: "The distinct colors of the shape, repeated to width 6."
      errors: "Incorrect application of the color,0 pattern. Last row is incorrect."
  - example_3:
      input_object: "Contiguous block of blue (1) pixels."
      output_pattern: "Alternating color,color,0 sequence per row, last row all colors"
      object_shape_relation: "Each input row contributes to the output."
      last_row_rule: "The distinct colors of the shape, repeated to width 6."
      errors: "Incorrect application of the color,0 pattern. Last row is incorrect."
  - general_observations:
      output_width: "Always 6"
      output_height: "Input object bounding box height."
      color_alternation: "Colors from each row in object are extracted and used in a repeating pattern in each output row"
      last_row: The last row is always repeating all distinct colors.
