  - object_identification:
    - description: "The object is the largest contiguous region of non-zero pixels within the input grid."
      properties:
        - color: "Determined by the value of the pixels within the object."
        - bounding_box: "The smallest rectangle enclosing the object."
  - transformation_rules:
    - height: "The height of the output grid matches the height of the object's bounding box."
    - width: "The output grid's width will always be 6"
    - row_construction: "Each row in the output grid corresponds to a row in the object's bounding box, the color pattern alternates across the row, with a blank (0) inserted after each color."
    - last_row: "The last row of the output is built by the same rule, picking the next color from the input"
