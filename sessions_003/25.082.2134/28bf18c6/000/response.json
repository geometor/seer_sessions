The input grids contain a single \"object\" composed of a connected region of a single non-zero color (azure '8' in the first example, red '2' in the second, and blue '1' in the third).  The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of this object, centered, and with some alternating pattern applied. It seems like it finds and centers the object, then \"overlays\" a checkerboard on it.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
