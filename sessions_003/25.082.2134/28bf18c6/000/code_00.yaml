facts:
  - object_type: single_color_region
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the region (8, 2, or 1 in the examples).
      - shape: Irregular, defined by the arrangement of pixels.
      - location:  Defined by pixel coordinates within the input grid.
  - input_grid:
    description: An 8x8 grid.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 8x8
      - background_color: 0 (white)
  - output_grid:
    description: A 3x6 grid.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x6
      - background_color:  Implicitly 0 (white), but not explicitly present in all areas.
  - transformation_type: condensation_and_pattern_overlay
    description:  The input object is condensed and centered in the output grid, and a checkerboard-like pattern is applied.
  - actions:
    - Find object of non-zero color
    - Determine the bounding box of the object.
    - Center a representation in a smaller grid.
    - Apply checkerboard like transformation.
