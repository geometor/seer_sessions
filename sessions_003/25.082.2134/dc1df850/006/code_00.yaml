facts:
  - observation: |
      Non-zero pixels in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      A blue (1) halo is created around non-zero pixels.
  - observation: |
      The halo expands only orthogonally (up, down, left, right).
  - observation: |
      The halo expands only one pixel from the original non-zero pixels' positions.
  - observation: |
     The halo only appears in output locations that are zero in the input
  - constraint: |
      Expansion does not occur beyond a single layer.
  - constraint: |
    Expansion only occurs into a location if that location was zero (white) in the original input.
