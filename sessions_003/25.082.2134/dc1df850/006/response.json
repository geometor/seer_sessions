            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided results and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe current code implements an iterative orthogonal expansion (halo) of blue (1) pixels around any non-zero pixel. While the core idea is correct, the implementation has issues with the extent and conditions of the expansion. Specifically, the expansion continues beyond what's intended in the examples, and it incorrectly expands onto cells in the *output* that are not zero in the original *input*, but become non-zero from a previous expansion in the *output*. The strategy will be to refine the expansion logic to consider the original input grid more strictly, ensuring expansion happens in empty output locations adjacent to colors in input, preventing expansion in output locations that were colored in the input.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code_execution when necessary)**\n\nI won't use code execution here, as I can derive everything from the information given. The results section already contains the important metrics: `match`, `pixels_off`, `size_correct`, `color_palette_correct`.\n\n*   **Example 1:** `match: False`, `pixels_off: 8`. The expansion is too aggressive, extending beyond the intended single-pixel halo.\n*   **Example 2:** `match: False`, `pixels_off: 28`. Again, over-expansion is the primary issue.  The multi-step expansion is clear here - it has wrapped around the objects.\n*   **Example 3:** `match: False`, `pixels_off: 2`.  Overexpansion, though less severe.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"

Do not repeat - this is not iterative.\n\nThis refined program clarifies that the expansion is a single-step process and strictly dependent on the *input* grid's configuration, not the intermediate states of the *output* grid. It explicitly prevents over-expansion by checking the input grid's values.\n"
