Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements an orthogonal expansion, creating a "halo" of blue (1) pixels around non-zero pixels. However, the results show discrepancies in all three examples. The primary issue seems to be the extent and shape of the expansion. It is expanding in places it shouldn't and not expanding enough in others. The shape of filled in pixels suggests an iterative filling is needed.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine where the transformed output differs from the expected output in each example. Visually compare the images, the expected output, and the transformed output, to better describe the rule needed.

2.  **Refine Expansion Logic:** Revisit the `expand_halo_orthogonally` function. It may need to control more carefully the order of pixels added.

3.  **Iterative Approach:** Given the way the halos expand, explore the possibility that expansion happens iteratively, i.e. apply filling on all original pixels, then fill again based on the pixels just filled in.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I'll use code execution to gather some additional data:


``` python
import numpy as np

def calculate_metrics(expected_output, transformed_output):
    """Calculates difference metrics between expected and transformed outputs."""
    
    diff = expected_output != transformed_output
    num_diff_pixels = np.sum(diff)
    
    expected_non_zero = np.sum(expected_output != 0)
    transformed_non_zero = np.sum(transformed_output != 0)
    
    
    return {
        'num_diff_pixels': num_diff_pixels,
        'expected_non_zero': expected_non_zero,
        'transformed_non_zero': transformed_non_zero,

    }

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: Original Pixels
    description: Non-zero pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Varies (represented by values 1-9).
      shape: Single pixel.
      action: Remain unchanged in their original position in output

  - name: Halo Pixels
    description: Pixels added around the original pixels.
    properties:
      color: Blue (represented by value 1).
      shape: Single pixel.
      action: added orthoganally adjacent to original and previously added halo
        pixels
  - name: background
    description: empty pixels
    properties:
      color: White/empty (value 0)
      action: can be replaced by halo pixels

actions:
  - name: Expand
    description: Add blue pixels around existing non-zero pixels.
    agent: Halo Pixels
    constraints:
      - Orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right).
      - Iterative application - newly added halo pixels can themselves
        be expanded from in later steps
      - Do not replace existing pixels - only fill empty cells.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Original Pixels:** Locate all non-zero pixels (original colored pixels) in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Original Pixels:** Copy all original pixels to the same positions in the output grid.
3.  **Iterative Halo Expansion:**
    *   Start with the original non-zero pixels.
    *   For each non-zero pixel (initially the originals, later including added halo pixels), add a blue (value 1) pixel to all orthogonally adjacent empty cells (value 0) in the output grid.
    *   Repeat this expansion, now considering the newly added blue pixels as sources for further expansion.
    *   Continue the expansion until no more blue pixels can be added (no adjacent empty cells remain). This suggests potentially two iterations are enough.
    *   NOTE: example 2 has a pixel '8' with only one iteration.
