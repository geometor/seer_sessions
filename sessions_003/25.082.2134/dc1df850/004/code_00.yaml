objects:
  - name: Original Pixels
    description: Non-zero pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Varies (represented by values 1-9).
      shape: Single pixel.
      action: Remain unchanged in their original position in output

  - name: Halo Pixels
    description: Pixels added around the original pixels.
    properties:
      color: Blue (represented by value 1).
      shape: Single pixel.
      action: added orthoganally adjacent to original and previously added halo
        pixels
  - name: background
    description: empty pixels
    properties:
      color: White/empty (value 0)
      action: can be replaced by halo pixels

actions:
  - name: Expand
    description: Add blue pixels around existing non-zero pixels.
    agent: Halo Pixels
    constraints:
      - Orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right).
      - Iterative application - newly added halo pixels can themselves
        be expanded from in later steps
      - Do not replace existing pixels - only fill empty cells.
