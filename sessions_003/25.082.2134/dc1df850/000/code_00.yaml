facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Non-zero pixels in the input grid are preserved in the output grid."
  - observation: "Pixels with value '1' (blue) appear in the output grid adjacent to the preserved non-zero pixels."
  - observation: "The '1' pixels form a sort of 'halo' or filled rectangle around the original non-zero pixels."
  - observation: "In train_2, expansion appears limited to the top and left parts of the grid, potentially."
  - observation: "The expansion size can vary"
  - object: "colored_pixel"
    properties: "Non-zero value in the input grid"
  - object: "halo_pixel"
    properties: "Value '1' (blue) in output grid, adjacent to colored_pixel"
  - action: "expand_halo"
    description: "Create halo_pixels around colored_pixels, potentially with directional constraints."
  - relationship: "colored_pixel causes halo_pixel"
