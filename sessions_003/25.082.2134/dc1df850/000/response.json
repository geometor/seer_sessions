The transformation seems to involve identifying specific \"colored\" pixels (non-zero values) in the input and creating \"halos\" or \"expansions\" of a specific color (represented by '1', which is blue) around them in the output grid. The original colored pixels seem to be preserved. There might be rules related to expansion direction, how far it extends and whether it fills completely or not.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
