observations:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9) representing a specific color.
      - location: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.
    interactions:
      - "Non-zero pixels act as seeds."
      - "Blue (1) pixels form a halo around seed pixels."
      - "Halos expand orthogonally (up, down, left, right)."
      - "Original seed pixel color is preserved."

  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns) defining the size of the grid.

actions:
  - name: halo_expansion
    description: "Creates a blue (1) pixel border around non-zero pixels."
    constraints:
      - "Expansion occurs only in orthogonal directions."
      - "Expansion does not occur beyond grid boundaries"
      - "Expansion does not occur when the seed pixel is zero."
