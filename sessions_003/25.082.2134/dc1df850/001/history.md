Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve identifying specific "colored" pixels (non-zero values) in the input and creating "halos" or "expansions" of a specific color (represented by '1', which is blue) around them in the output grid. The original colored pixels seem to be preserved. There might be rules related to expansion direction, how far it extends and whether it fills completely or not.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Non-zero pixels in the input grid are preserved in the output grid."
  - observation: "Pixels with value '1' (blue) appear in the output grid adjacent to the preserved non-zero pixels."
  - observation: "The '1' pixels form a sort of 'halo' or filled rectangle around the original non-zero pixels."
  - observation: "In train_2, expansion appears limited to the top and left parts of the grid, potentially."
  - observation: "The expansion size can vary"
  - object: "colored_pixel"
    properties: "Non-zero value in the input grid"
  - object: "halo_pixel"
    properties: "Value '1' (blue) in output grid, adjacent to colored_pixel"
  - action: "expand_halo"
    description: "Create halo_pixels around colored_pixels, potentially with directional constraints."
  - relationship: "colored_pixel causes halo_pixel"

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** "colored pixels" - cells with a non-zero value.
3.  **Preserve** the value of the "colored pixel" in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
4.  **Expand** around each "colored pixel":
    *   Create "halo pixels" (value '1') in the output grid, adjacent to the "colored pixel".
    * The expansion will go in all the directions until the border of the image or another colored object.
    * The priority is top and left directions.

In essence, the transformation rule identifies non-zero pixels and creates a blue (value 1) expansion/filling adjacent to the original pixel on all sides, and potentially prioritized to the top and left.
