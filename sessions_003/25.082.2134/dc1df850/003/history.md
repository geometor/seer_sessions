Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code's core logic is correct: it identifies non-zero pixels and expands a halo of blue (1) pixels around them. However, the halo expansion is not constrained enough, leading to excessive blue pixels in some cases. The code expands in *all* directions, including diagonals, whereas the examples show a more restricted, orthogonal expansion (up, down, left, right, but not diagonally). There is an edge case in the second example that is causing an unexpected halo where the result output should have been 0. The error seems to be based on the fact that pixels that are on the edge of the grid do not 'wrap around' with their halo.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Halo Expansion:** Modify the `expand_halo` function (or the neighbor selection) to only consider orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right). This will prevent the diagonal expansion seen in the errors.
2. **Edge case:** Investigate why the blue halo pixel expands when it shouldn't.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**

I'll start by confirming the orthogonal neighbours are correctly identified.

    constraints:
      - "Expansion occurs only in orthogonal directions."
      - "Expansion does not occur beyond grid boundaries"
      - "Expansion does not occur when the seed pixel is zero."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
3.  **Seed Identification:** If a pixel has a non-zero value, it's a "seed" pixel.
4.  **Preservation:** Copy the value of the seed pixel to the corresponding location in the output grid.
5.  **Halo Expansion:** For each seed pixel:
    *   Check its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    *   If a neighbor is within the grid boundaries *and* the location in the output grid is currently zero, set the corresponding location in the output grid to blue (1).
6.  **Output:** The output grid now represents the transformed image.
