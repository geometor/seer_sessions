The color gray (5) is the most prevalent object.\n*   **Background:** The background is consistently color black (0).\n*   **Transformations:** The gray (5) pixels are changing to either blue (1), yellow (4), or red (2). The specific color change appears to depend on the configuration of the gray pixels.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The position of the gray (5) pixels within the grid is very important, along with how many are adjacent to each other.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
