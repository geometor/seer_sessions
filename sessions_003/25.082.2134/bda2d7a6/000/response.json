The transformation appears to involve an inward spiral or \"onion-peeling\" effect, replacing the outermost layer of one color with the central color of the original object. The central color seems to be determined by the innermost \"core\" of the object, and its color is not always '0'. It swaps the core color, with the outermost.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
