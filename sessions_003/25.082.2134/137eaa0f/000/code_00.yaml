facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain large areas of background (0/white pixels).
  - observation: Non-zero pixels in input represent colored objects.
  - observation: Objects can be single pixels or contiguous groups of the same color.
  - observation: Output grids contain a subset of the input's non-zero pixels.
  - observation: Output grid rows appear to correspond to rows in the input grid where non-zero colors appear, ignoring blank rows.
  - observation: within an output row, the order of non-0 pixels in the output from left to right is the same as the order of the non-0 pixels in the input.
  - observation: The order of rows from top to bottom in output matches the order of the rows that contain objects in input.
