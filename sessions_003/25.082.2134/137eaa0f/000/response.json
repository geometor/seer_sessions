There are large areas of '0' (white) which seems to be background.  Non-zero values appear sparsely, sometimes in contiguous groups.\n*   **Output:** The output is a much smaller 2D grid. It seems to contain a selection of the non-zero values from the input, arranged in a specific order. The output grid's height seems to be tied to the number of distinct horizontal \"lines\" or \"rows\" of colored objects in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Specifically, ignore any zeros that separate objects within a row.\n4.  **Create Output Row:** Create a new row in the output grid using the extracted non-zero pixels.\n5. **Repeat for all input rows**: Continue scanning the input for more rows that contain objects, and generate an output row for each of them.\n6.  **Output Grid:** The result is the output grid, consisting of rows of non-zero pixels extracted from the input.\n\nIn simpler terms: The program extracts all rows from the input that contain any colored objects and then removes the background (zero) pixels, keeping only colored pixels on each row, to construct the output grid. The output grid's rows are ordered to match the order that the rows appear in the input grid.\n"
