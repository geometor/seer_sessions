Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is a 2D grid (matrix) of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. There are large areas of '0' (white) which seems to be background.  Non-zero values appear sparsely, sometimes in contiguous groups.
*   **Output:** The output is a much smaller 2D grid. It seems to contain a selection of the non-zero values from the input, arranged in a specific order. The output grid's height seems to be tied to the number of distinct horizontal "lines" or "rows" of colored objects in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain large areas of background (0/white pixels).
  - observation: Non-zero pixels in input represent colored objects.
  - observation: Objects can be single pixels or contiguous groups of the same color.
  - observation: Output grids contain a subset of the input's non-zero pixels.
  - observation: Output grid rows appear to correspond to rows in the input grid where non-zero colors appear, ignoring blank rows.
  - observation: within an output row, the order of non-0 pixels in the output from left to right is the same as the order of the non-0 pixels in the input.
  - observation: The order of rows from top to bottom in output matches the order of the rows that contain objects in input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scan Input Rows:** Iterate through each row of the input grid from top to bottom.
2.  **Identify Non-Empty Rows:** For each row, check if it contains any non-zero (non-white) pixels.
3.  **Extract Non-Zero Pixels:** If a row contains non-zero pixels, extract these pixels, preserving their original order from left to right. Specifically, ignore any zeros that separate objects within a row.
4.  **Create Output Row:** Create a new row in the output grid using the extracted non-zero pixels.
5. **Repeat for all input rows**: Continue scanning the input for more rows that contain objects, and generate an output row for each of them.
6.  **Output Grid:** The result is the output grid, consisting of rows of non-zero pixels extracted from the input.

In simpler terms: The program extracts all rows from the input that contain any colored objects and then removes the background (zero) pixels, keeping only colored pixels on each row, to construct the output grid. The output grid's rows are ordered to match the order that the rows appear in the input grid.
