"""
1.  **Identify Trigger and Target:** Find all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. For each yellow pixel, check if there is a green (3) pixel directly above it.
2.  **Move Green Pixel:** If a green pixel is found directly above a yellow pixel, move the green pixel to the cell immediately to the left of the yellow pixel, in the same row as the yellow pixel.
3.  **Clear Previous Position:** The original position of the moved green pixel becomes white (0).
4.  **Unaltered Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.
