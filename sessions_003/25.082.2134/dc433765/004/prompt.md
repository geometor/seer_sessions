1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all yellow (4) pixels and their immediate, vertically adjacent (above and below) green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Green Movement:**
    *   If a green pixel is *directly above* a yellow pixel, move the green pixel one position to the *left* of the yellow pixel. The new value replaces any 0, but does not replace any other color.
    *   If a green pixel is *directly below* a yellow pixel, it remains in its original position.
    *   All green pixels are turned to 0 if moved.
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (including empty/white pixels and non-adjacent green pixels) remain unchanged.
