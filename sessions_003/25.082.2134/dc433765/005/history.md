1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all yellow (4) pixels and their immediate, vertically adjacent (above and below) green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Green Movement:**
    *   If a green pixel is *directly above* a yellow pixel, move the green pixel one position to the *left* of the yellow pixel. The new value replaces any 0, but does not replace any other color.
    *   If a green pixel is *directly below* a yellow pixel, it remains in its original position.
    *   All green pixels are turned to 0 if moved.
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (including empty/white pixels and non-adjacent green pixels) remain unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The current code focuses on moving a green pixel *above* a yellow pixel one position to the *left* of the yellow pixel, and blanking out the green pixel's original position. However, the provided examples reveal a more consistent pattern: a green pixel directly *above* a yellow pixel always moves to the immediate left of the yellow, and a green pixel directly *below* is unchanged. The current implementation does not handle all test cases correctly; specifically in every test, the 'pixels\_off' is equal to two and the green is not being correctly moved to the left of the yellow. It also incorrectly moves green when not above, as shown in example 7.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Observation:** Double-check the input/output pairs to confirm that the "green above yellow moves left" rule is consistently applied and that we are not misinterpreting the relationship.
2.  **Refine Logic:** Modify the natural language program to reflect only moving the green pixel from above the yellow pixel one unit to the left of the yellow pixel.
3. **Update the Condition** Ensure all edge cases are correctly handled, with x and y > 0 before checking pixels above and to the left.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** Re-run the updated code against all provided examples to ensure all cases are handled correctly.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I will use a simple loop to examine colors surrounding a specified coordinate.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: green_pixel
    color: 3
    relationship:
      - condition: "above yellow pixel"
        action: "move left of yellow pixel"
        original_position: "becomes white/empty/0"
      - condition: "below yellow pixel"
        action: "remains in its original position"
  - object: yellow_pixel
    color: 4
    relationship: [] # Yellow pixel is the reference point
  - object: other_pixels
    relationship:
        action: no_change
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Find all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Check Above:** For each yellow pixel, check if there's a green (3) pixel directly above it.
3.  **Conditional Move:** If a green pixel is found directly above a yellow pixel, move the green pixel to the cell immediately to the left of the yellow pixel. The cell that was previously occupied by the green pixel becomes white (0).
4.  **No Other Changes**: Green pixels that are not above the yellow pixels are not affected. If the cell to the left of the yellow pixel is outside of the bounds of the array or is not 0, it is not replaced. All other pixels remain unchanged.
