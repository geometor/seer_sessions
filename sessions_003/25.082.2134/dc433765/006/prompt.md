"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Find all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Check Above:** For each yellow pixel, check if there's a green (3) pixel directly above it.
3.  **Conditional Move:** If a green pixel is found directly above a yellow pixel, move the green pixel to the cell immediately to the left of the yellow pixel. The cell that was previously occupied by the green pixel becomes white (0).
4.  **No Other Changes**: Green pixels that are not above the yellow pixels are not affected. If the cell to the left of the yellow pixel is outside of the bounds of the array or is not 0, it is not replaced. All other pixels remain unchanged.
