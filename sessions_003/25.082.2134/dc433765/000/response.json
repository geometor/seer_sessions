The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The most prominent colors are white (0), green (3), and yellow (4).  It appears the transformation involves a specific interaction or movement related to the positions of the green and yellow pixels.  Blank (white) space seems to be important.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If value is 0 in that space, change it to 3. If there is a value there, do not change it.\n\n3. **Shift all green above:** If there is a value 3, copy it to the row above, in the same column. If there is a value there, do not change it.\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels, including those with the value 0 (white), remain unchanged in their original positions.\n\n5. **The output grid will shift by 1 unit**: Green moves from under to to yellow, from above to beside.\n"
