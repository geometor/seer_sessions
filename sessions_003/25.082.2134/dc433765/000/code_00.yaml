facts:
  - objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
        - cells: contain integers (0-9) representing colors
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color: integer (0-9)
        - position: (row, column) within the grid
        - significant_colors: [3, 4] # Green and Yellow
  - actions:
    - type: movement
      description: Green and yellow pixels seem to interact, potentially shifting positions.
  - relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description:  The relative positions of green and yellow pixels within the grid are crucial to the transformation.  Empty space (0) around these colored pixels seems to influence the outcome.
