1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 3 (green) and 4 (yellow) within the input grid.

2.  **Shift Green Left one:** If there is a value 3, shift it one space left. If value is 0 in that space, change it to 3. If there is a value there, do not change it.

3. **Shift all green above:** If there is a value 3, copy it to the row above, in the same column. If there is a value there, do not change it.

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels, including those with the value 0 (white), remain unchanged in their original positions.

5. **The output grid will shift by 1 unit**: Green moves from under to to yellow, from above to beside.
