            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding of the transformation, primarily focusing on moving green (3) pixels. However, the test results reveal a more specific and conditional movement. The core issue is that the code moves *all* green pixels it finds, and it does so regardless of their position relative to the yellow (4) pixels. The expected outputs suggest a relationship between green and yellow pixels where green moves *towards* yellow, but only if it's directly below or above the yellow in the input.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is:\n\n1.  **Focus on Relative Positioning:** Instead of moving all green pixels, the code needs to identify green pixels specifically positioned *below* or *above* a yellow pixel.\n2.  **Conditional Movement:** Implement the left/up shift only for those identified green pixels.\n3. **Prioritize Yellow Proximity**: The green pixel must be directly above of below the yellow.\n4. **Zero out previous green**: Remove original green pixel after the copy is made\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll use manual analysis, looking at inputs, expected outputs, and the actual transformed outputs. There is no need for code execution, just direct comparison of each result.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The green pixel should have moved left one unit (from directly above yellow). The code moved the green correctly to the left, but failed to remove the previous green, leaving two green.\n*   **Example 2:** The green pixel should have moved left one unit (from directly above yellow). The code moved the green up and left, leaving a line, and failing to remove the original green.\n*   **Example 3:** The green pixel should have moved left one unit (from directly above yellow). The code moved the green up and left, leaving a line, and failing to remove the original green.\n*   **Example 4:** The green should have moved left and adjacent to yellow. Code adds to adjacent left and one above, leaving a line. Code also fails to remove the original green.\n*   **Example 5:** Green is below the yellow. Green should not move, the code incorrectly moves the green up and leaves and makes a copy of the original.\n*   **Example 6:** The green pixel should have moved up one unit to be directly below the yellow pixel in column 4.\n*   **Example 7:** The green should have moved down and to the left. Code incorrectly moves the green to the left.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"

The new value replaces any 0, but does not replace any other color.\n    *   If a green pixel is *directly below* a yellow pixel, it remains in its original position.\n    *   All green pixels are turned to 0 if moved.\n3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (including empty/white pixels and non-adjacent green pixels) remain unchanged.\n\nThis refined program focuses on the crucial relationship between the green and yellow pixels and clarifies the conditional nature of the movement.\n"
