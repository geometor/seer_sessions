facts:
  - observation: "The first two rows of the output grid are always identical to the first two rows of the input grid."
  - observation: "Subsequent rows in the output grid are generated based on the values in the first two rows of the input grid."
  - observation: "The generation of subsequent rows involves cycling through the first two rows."
  - observation: "Each new generated row uses elements of corresponding column index from the input matrix."
  - rule: |
      For rows beyond the first two, the row index in the source grid cycles through 0 and 1 (representing the first and second rows of the input grid).
      Each value in the source row is used to form entire rows in the output grid.
  - action: The code correctly copies first two rows.
  - error: "The indexing in creating the subsequent rows is incorrect."
  - error_type: "The code is mixing values from various columns instead of using values from a specific column."
