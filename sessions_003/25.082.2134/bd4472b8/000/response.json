The output grids seem to be a patterned repetition of the first two rows of the input grid.\n*   **Color/Number Correspondence:** Each number corresponds to a specific color, as defined in the color map. The transformation preserves the colors, but rearranges and duplicates them.\n*    **Rows:** It appears that first two rows of the input is the significant for this transformation, because we could see the repeated pattern of it.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
