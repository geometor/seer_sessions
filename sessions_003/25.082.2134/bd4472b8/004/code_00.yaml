        description: The first two rows of the input grid.  Crucially, the *columns* of these rows define the repeating pattern.

          - description: The second column of the first two rows, etc.

    type: grid
    properties:
      height: same as input_grid
      width: same as input_grid
      rows:
        - description: First two rows are copied from input_grid.
        - description: Subsequent rows are constructed from the columns of the first two rows of the input_grid, cycling through the columns.

  description: >
    The output grid's first two rows are copies of the input grid's first two rows.
    Following rows are generated by sequentially using columns of the input grid's first two rows. The column values are repeated down the entire output row.
