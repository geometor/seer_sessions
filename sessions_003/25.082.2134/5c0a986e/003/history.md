Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to improve the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which led to an incomplete understanding of the transformation rule. While the code correctly identifies 2x2 blocks of blue (1) and red (2) and attempts to draw diagonal lines, it doesn't fully capture the intended behavior, as evidenced by the errors in all three examples. The primary issue seems to be how the diagonals extend. It is also overwriting the input grid, which it should not do.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine the differences between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` for each example. This will pinpoint the exact discrepancies in the diagonal extension logic.
2.  **Refine Diagonal Extension:** The current implementation extends diagonals *only* from the top-left (blue) or bottom-right (red) corners of the 2x2 blocks. We need to extend it from *both* corners and have the lines drawn correctly,
3.  **Preserve Original:** the output array needs to be an empty grid rather than a copy of the input.

**Gather Metrics and Observations:**

Let's create a more precise report using the existing `find_blocks` function to verify that behavior, focusing on:

*   Location of identified 2x2 blocks.
*   Direction and extent of the expected diagonal lines.
