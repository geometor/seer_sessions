Transforms an input grid by expanding 2x2 colored blocks (blue=1, red=2) into diagonal lines. Blue lines expand up-left from the top-left corner of the blue block and down-right from the bottom-right corner. Red lines expand down-right from the bottom-right corner of the red block and up-left from the top-left. Blue takes precedence.
