            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the discrepancies between the transformed outputs and expected outputs, along with a revised natural language program and a YAML fact sheet.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which led to an incomplete understanding of the transformation rule. The core issue is that red diagonals produced from 2x2 red blocks do *not* overwrite blue cells, and blue diagonals produced by 2x2 blue blocks *do* overwrite any existing red cells. This interaction between the blue and red blocks was not correctly implemented in the first attempt. The generated output grids also extend the diagonals one cell further than the expected output in the given examples.\n\nThe strategy to fix this is as follows:\n\n1.  **Correct Diagonal Extension:** Modify the `draw_diagonal` function (or corresponding logic) to stop the diagonal extension one step earlier. This requires adjusting the while loop condition.\n2.  **Prioritize Blue:** Ensure that blue diagonals overwrite red, and red diagonals stop at pre-existing non-black cells.\n3. Zero the output: Make sure the initial output starts as all zeros\n\n**Metrics and Observations (from provided test run)**\n*   **Example 1:** 14 pixels are off. The blue diagonals are correct, but the red diagonals overwrite blue ones and start one step early.\n*   **Example 2:** 5 pixels are off. Blue and Red Diagonals are one pixel too long. The overwrite behavior is partially correct but needs refinement regarding starting positions.\n*   **Example 3:** 9 pixels are off. Similar problems to Example 2, plus intermixing between red and blue.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet**\n\n"
