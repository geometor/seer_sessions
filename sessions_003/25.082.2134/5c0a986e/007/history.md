Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the discrepancies between the transformed outputs and expected outputs, along with a revised natural language program and a YAML fact sheet.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which led to an incomplete understanding of the transformation rule. The core issue is that red diagonals produced from 2x2 red blocks do *not* overwrite blue cells, and blue diagonals produced by 2x2 blue blocks *do* overwrite any existing red cells. This interaction between the blue and red blocks was not correctly implemented in the first attempt. The generated output grids also extend the diagonals one cell further than the expected output in the given examples.

The strategy to fix this is as follows:

1.  **Correct Diagonal Extension:** Modify the `draw_diagonal` function (or corresponding logic) to stop the diagonal extension one step earlier. This requires adjusting the while loop condition.
2.  **Prioritize Blue:** Ensure that blue diagonals overwrite red, and red diagonals stop at pre-existing non-black cells.
3. Zero the output: Make sure the initial output starts as all zeros

**Metrics and Observations (from provided test run)**
*   **Example 1:** 14 pixels are off. The blue diagonals are correct, but the red diagonals overwrite blue ones and start one step early.
*   **Example 2:** 5 pixels are off. Blue and Red Diagonals are one pixel too long. The overwrite behavior is partially correct but needs refinement regarding starting positions.
*   **Example 3:** 9 pixels are off. Similar problems to Example 2, plus intermixing between red and blue.

**YAML Fact Sheet**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: 2x2 block
    properties:
      - color: blue (1) or red (2)
      - location: top-left coordinate (row, col)
    actions:
      - generates: two diagonal lines
        details:
          - blue:
            - line1: starts at (row, col), direction up-left
            - line2: starts at (row+1, col+1), direction down-right
          - red:
            - line1: starts at (row, col), direction up-left
            - line2: starts at (row+1, col+1), direction down-right
        overwrite:
          - blue lines overwrite red lines
          - red lines do not overwrite blue lines
  - object: diagonal line
    properties:
      - color: blue (1) or red (2)
      - start_position: derived from 2x2 block location
      - direction: up-left or down-right
    actions:
      - extends: from start_position until grid boundary or a non-black cell (for red)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with black (0).

2.  **Find 2x2 Blocks:** Scan the input grid to identify all 2x2 contiguous blocks of the same color, where the color is either blue (1) or red (2).

3.  **Draw Blue Diagonals:** For each blue 2x2 block:
    *   Draw a blue diagonal line extending up-left from the top-left corner of the block. Stop when reaching the grid boundary. This line *can* overwrite any existing cell.
    *   Draw another blue diagonal line extending down-right from the bottom-right corner of the block. Stop when reaching the grid boundary.  This line *can* overwrite any existing cell.

4.  **Draw Red Diagonals:** For each red 2x2 block:
    *   Draw a red diagonal line extending up-left from the top-left corner of the block. Stop when reaching the grid boundary *or* when encountering a non-black cell.
    *   Draw another red diagonal line extending down-right from the bottom-right corner of the block. Stop when reaching the grid boundary *or* when encountering a non-black cell.
5. Return the result grid.
