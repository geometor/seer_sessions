    description: >
      Extends lines diagonally from the corners of a 2x2 block.
      Blue blocks extend up-left from the top-left corner and down-right from
      the bottom-right corner.
      Red blocks extend down-right from the bottom-right corner and
      up-left from the top-left corner.
    constraints:
      - Lines stop at grid boundaries.
      - Blue lines overwrite red lines.
      - Lines stop if they intersect with another exisiting line or block.
