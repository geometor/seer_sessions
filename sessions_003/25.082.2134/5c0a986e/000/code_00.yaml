objects:
  - type: block
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      shape: rectangle
      contiguous: true # Pixels of the same color form a single object
    behavior:
      movement: diagonal expansion/displacement
      interaction: color-dependent replacement/overlay

observations:
  - input_grids_contain_colored_blocks:  "Each input grid has two rectangular blocks of color 1 (blue) and color 2 (red)."
  - output_grids_have_diagonal_lines: "The output grids show diagonal lines extending from the corners of the original blocks in the input."
  - color_priority: "Color 1 (blue) appears to take precedence, initiating its expansion from the top-left corner, and ending adjacent to color 2 (red)."
  - constant_block_size: "Input blocks are always 2x2."
