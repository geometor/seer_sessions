Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The core of the task seems to involve identifying and manipulating colored \"objects\" (contiguous blocks of the same color).  Crucially, the output grids are not simple rotations or reflections of the input grids. There's a more complex object interaction and creation/modification going on. The consistent sizes and colors of the solid blocks in the input, suggest the change is based on position, and also the order of the inputs, which can also signify stacking order, where blue comes before, or is 'on top of' red.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Note the color and top-left corner position of each block.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Objects:** Determine the drawing order. Color 1 (blue) blocks are processed *before* color 2 (red) blocks.\n\n3.  **Blue Block Expansion:** Starting from the top-left corner of the blue block, draw a diagonal line of blue (1) pixels extending upwards and to the left. Each step of the diagonal moves one pixel up and one pixel left. Continue until the edge of the grid is reached, or the edge of the red object is reached.\n\n4.  **Red Block Expansion:** Starting from the *bottom-right* corner of the red block, draw a diagonal line of red (2) pixels extending downwards and to the right. Each step of the diagonal moves one pixel down and one pixel right. Continue until the edge of the grid is reached.\n\n5. Do not overwrite existing pixels with color 0, if present (to preserve structure).\n\nIn essence, the transformation creates diagonal lines \"emanating\" from specific corners of the original colored blocks, with blue lines taking precedence over red lines when they intersect.\n"
