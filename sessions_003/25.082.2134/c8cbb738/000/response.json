This suggests a process of extracting, summarizing, or focusing on specific parts of the input.\n*   The output grids seem to retain some spatial relationship with the input, like the relative position from train\\_1 of `1` `4` `2`, and `8`.\n*   There is the appearance of a cross or plus shaped selection pattern, although some examples only have parts of it.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A color is considered \"unique\" if it appears a small number of times compared to the dominant background color (the most frequent color).\n2.  **Center Selection:** For each unique color found, consider its pixel as the center of a plus-shaped (+) selection pattern.\n3.  **Plus-Shaped Selection:** Select pixels from the input grid that form a \"plus\" shape.\n    -   Select any pixel with the unique color.\n    -   Select the input pixels at the furthest cardinal directions.\n    -   The size/reach of the \"plus\" is determined by the boundaries of the input grid.\n4.  **Construct Output:** Arrange the selected pixels to form the output grid. Maintain the relative spatial positions. The selected center is the center of the output, north pixels above, etc.\n5.  **Border Handling:** The selection may extend to all borders of the input.\n\nEssentially, the rule identifies unique colors within the larger grid, and uses a plus-shaped selection pattern to capture the regions around these colors, constructing a smaller output grid.\n"
