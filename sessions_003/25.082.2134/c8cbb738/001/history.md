Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. This suggests a process of extracting, summarizing, or focusing on specific parts of the input.
*   The output grids seem to retain some spatial relationship with the input, like the relative position from train\_1 of `1` `4` `2`, and `8`.
*   There is the appearance of a cross or plus shaped selection pattern, although some examples only have parts of it.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 12x11, 10x8, 14x12)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, smaller than input_grid (e.g., 5x5, 3x3, 5x5)
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: A specific pattern of pixels is selected from the input_grid.
  - type: extraction
    description: The selected pixels form the output_grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid *contains* many pixels
  - output_grid *is_formed_by* selected pixels from input_grid
  - spatial_correspondence: The relative positions of selected pixels in the input_grid are mostly maintained in the output_grid.
  - selection_pattern: The plus shape centered on unique color values.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Unique Colors:** Scan the input grid to identify all "unique" colors. A color is considered "unique" if it appears a small number of times compared to the dominant background color (the most frequent color).
2.  **Center Selection:** For each unique color found, consider its pixel as the center of a plus-shaped (+) selection pattern.
3.  **Plus-Shaped Selection:** Select pixels from the input grid that form a "plus" shape.
    -   Select any pixel with the unique color.
    -   Select the input pixels at the furthest cardinal directions.
    -   The size/reach of the "plus" is determined by the boundaries of the input grid.
4.  **Construct Output:** Arrange the selected pixels to form the output grid. Maintain the relative spatial positions. The selected center is the center of the output, north pixels above, etc.
5.  **Border Handling:** The selection may extend to all borders of the input.

Essentially, the rule identifies unique colors within the larger grid, and uses a plus-shaped selection pattern to capture the regions around these colors, constructing a smaller output grid.
