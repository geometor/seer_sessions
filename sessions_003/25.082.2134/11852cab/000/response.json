The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a selective duplication of certain colored pixels based on their horizontal neighbors. Specifically, if a non-zero pixel has the *same* color neighbor to its *right*, and a *different* color or blank (0) to the *left*, a copy of that pixel is placed on the *other* side of the *same* color neighbor. If a pixel has non-zero same color neighbor to the *left*, the pixel will *not* be duplicated.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
