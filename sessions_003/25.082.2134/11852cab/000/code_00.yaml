objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: integer
      - height: integer
      - cells: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
      - neighbors:
          left: pixel or null
          right: pixel or null
          up:  pixel or null
          down: pixel or null

actions:
  - name: duplicate_pixel
    description: Duplicates a pixel based on neighbor conditions.
    conditions:
      - current_pixel.color != 0
      - current_pixel.neighbors.right.color == current_pixel.color
      - current_pixel.neighbors.left.color != current_pixel.color OR current_pixel.neighbors.left == null
    steps:
      - Find the right neighbor.
      - Place a copy of current pixel to the other side of the right neighbor.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Defines how pixels are considered neighbors (horizontally, vertically, diagonally).  In this case, primarily horizontal adjacency matters.
