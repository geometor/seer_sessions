      horizontal_shift:
        - description: Objects with two instances separated horizontally by a single 0, have that 0 filled with that object.
        - description: In cases where a single instance of an object is horizontally isolated, it is copied two columns to the right if another object of the same color exists in that row.

      vertical_shift:
       - description: Objects shift down to rows where a gap existed below.
