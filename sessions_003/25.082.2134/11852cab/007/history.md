Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempted three main operations: horizontal merging, horizontal copying two positions to the right, and vertical duplication. The results show that none of the examples were matched correctly, and a significant number of pixels were off in each case. The generated outputs have introduced new colors and significantly altered the original structure, it looks like the horizontal copy is shifting everything to the right and filling in, and the vertical duplication is filling in all empty spaces. The merging logic seems partially correct, but is merging incorrectly. The core issue is likely that all of these operations are happening at once and interfering with each other. The vertical copy is especially destructive.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Isolate and Correct Operations:** We need to address each operation (merging, copying, and vertical duplication) separately, identify what conditions activate them, and ensure their execution logic is sound, before then combining only the correct operations.
2. **Prioritize merging:** Horizontal merging appears to be a fundamental aspect, start by fixing the merging logic and ensure it applies only under specific conditions, using only adjacency.
3. **Re-evaluate Horizontal Copy:** re-evaluate the horizontal copy rule. It's clearly not a simple "copy two to the right", and that behavior is extremely destructive.
4. **Re-evaluate Vertical Duplication:** Re-evaluate the need and logic of vertical duplication. Based on the examples, it seems the current implementation is overly aggressive and incorrect. Focus on conditional duplication based on patterns.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

I'll use manual observation first, combined with the previous code's output images, to form initial hypotheses. I will then use code execution if needed to get specific counts, or validate specific spatial relationships.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Two '3's separated by a zero, two '2's separated by a zero, two '8's and a '3' separated by zeros, and then two '2' separated by a zero
*   **Expected Output:** The '3's merge, the '2's merge. And a 3 is added in the first row.
*   **Transformed Output (Incorrect):** A mess. Everything is shifted right. Many incorrect colors.
*   **Observations:**
    *   Horizontal merging *should* have happened between the adjacent pairs.
    *   The additional '3' in the first row needs to be accounted for. It's a copy, but it's position is hard to predict based on the existing rules.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** '2' and '3' separated by a zero, two '4's separated by a zero, '3', '4' and '3'
*   **Expected Output:** the '2' and '3' in row 3 get a copy of the '2' at index 6. The two '4's merge. The second '3' and '4', have a copy to match the pattern.
*   **Transformed Output (Incorrect):** Mess.
*   **Observations:**
    *   Horizontal merging *should* have happened for the 4s.
    *   Again, there's a copy that isn't explained by existing rules.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** '8's, a '4', '8', '1', '8'.
*   **Expected Output:** The '8's stay the same. The '4' in row 3 has an '4' added in col 6.
*   **Transformed Output (Incorrect):** Mess.
*   **Observations:**
    *   There's a specific copy of the 4 that isn't explained by the rules.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Horizontal Merging:** If two distinct objects of the same color in the same row are separated by *exactly one* cell of color zero (white), the zero cell takes on the same color as the objects, merging them.
2.  **Specific Copying:**
     - If we find a color in the form a,0,b,0 where a and b are different, we copy a into the second zero.
     - If we have the a pattern with a different starting zero, so 0,a,0,b. We copy b into the first zero.

This program focuses on the horizontal merging observed consistently and introduces a more precise "specific copying" rule to address the new elements appearing in the output, while avoiding the broad, incorrect copying of the previous iteration. The vertical duplication rule is removed.
