Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of the Elements of the Task**

The task involves 2D grids as input and output. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a selective duplication of certain colored pixels based on their horizontal neighbors. Specifically, if a non-zero pixel has the *same* color neighbor to its *right*, and a *different* color or blank (0) to the *left*, a copy of that pixel is placed on the *other* side of the *same* color neighbor. If a pixel has non-zero same color neighbor to the *left*, the pixel will *not* be duplicated.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: integer
      - height: integer
      - cells: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
      - neighbors:
          left: pixel or null
          right: pixel or null
          up:  pixel or null
          down: pixel or null

actions:
  - name: duplicate_pixel
    description: Duplicates a pixel based on neighbor conditions.
    conditions:
      - current_pixel.color != 0
      - current_pixel.neighbors.right.color == current_pixel.color
      - current_pixel.neighbors.left.color != current_pixel.color OR current_pixel.neighbors.left == null
    steps:
      - Find the right neighbor.
      - Place a copy of current pixel to the other side of the right neighbor.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Defines how pixels are considered neighbors (horizontally, vertically, diagonally).  In this case, primarily horizontal adjacency matters.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid, row by row, and column by column.
2.  For each pixel, check if the value is *not* background (not 0).
3.  Check the **right neighbor**. If there is not a right neighbor, or the value of the right neighbor is not the same value, this pixel is skipped.
4.  Check the **left neighbor**. If the right neighbor value *is* the same, and a left neighbor exists and the value of the left neighbor is *not* the same, duplicate the original pixel.
5.  To "Duplicate", place a copy of the original pixel to the right of the right neighbor, effectively inserting it.
6.  Continue the iteration until all pixels are processed.
7.  The output grid is built during the iteration with the duplication actions.
