            "text": "Okay, here's an assessment of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and the subsequent code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and code were on the right track, identifying the core concept of moving red (2) pixel blocks to the right. However, the code's logic for determining *how far* to move the blocks is flawed. It appears to simply shift the blocks to the extreme right, overwriting existing red blocks, rather than stopping *before* encountering another red or green block. The code also shifts individual blocks, even when red pixels are only separated by a blank, which doesn't keep a group of adjacent red pixels together.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Block Movement Logic:** The code needs to correctly calculate the destination index for each red block. It should stop *just before* any obstructing green (3) or red (2) pixel, or the edge of the grid, preserving any white space that was between groups in the input.\n2.  **Correct Block Handling:** Correct the logic in finding blocks such that _find_red_blocks() only adds complete contiguous blocks. The error is likely a misinterpretation of adjacency.\n3. **Review examples for shifting groups:** The current program shifts groups, which is incorrect. Blocks should be treated as the smallest unit of adjacent red pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection for this dreamer phase):**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The red blocks are being shifted too far to the right and combining. For instance, in row 3 `2 2 2 2 2` should become `0 0 2 2 2 2 2`.\n*   **Example 2:** Same problem as Example 1.  Red blocks extend beyond their allowed space.\n*   **Example 3:** Red block at the end of the row, shifts too far right.\n*   **Example 4:** Red blocks are moving to the end of available space.\n\n**YAML Fact Base:**\n\n"

A block is defined as one or more adjacent red pixels.\n2.  **Determine Target Position:** For each identified red block, find the rightmost valid position within its row. A position is valid if:\n    *   It is within the grid boundaries.\n    *   All cells between the block's *original* starting position and its new ending position are either currently occupied by the block itself, or are empty (0).\n    *   The cell immediately to the right of the new position is either outside the grid, a green (3) pixel, or a red(2) pixel that *wasn't* part of the original continuous red block being moved.\n3.  **Move Red Blocks:** If the target position is different from the current position, move the entire red block to the new position, replacing the block's original cells with empty (0) pixels. *Do not overwrite existing red or green pixels.* Preserve empty cells.\n4.  **Iterate:** Repeat steps 1-3 for all rows in the grid.\n\nThis refined program emphasizes stopping *before* other blocks and preserving empty space, addressing the core issues observed in the test results.\n"
