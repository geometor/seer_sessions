            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a reasonable but incomplete understanding of the transformation. It correctly identifies the key colors (red and green) and the general idea of moving red pixels. However, it fails to accurately capture the specific rules governing *how* the red pixels are repositioned relative to each other and the green \"barrier\" pixels. The consistent failure across multiple examples indicates a flaw in the core logic, not just an edge case. The code is shifting the red pixels to the *leftmost* available position, but the desired behavior is to shift the red blocks to the *right*, bounded by either another red, green, or grid edge.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Reverse the Shift Direction:** The most critical change is to reverse the direction of the red pixel movement. Instead of moving them left, we need to move them right.\n2.  **Refine Boundary Conditions:** Re-examine the conditions that stop the movement of red pixels. The current logic has flaws in detecting adjacent reds and nearby greens. The correct condition should stop movement when encountering *any* of the following:\n    *   Another red pixel to the immediate right.\n    *   A green pixel to the immediate right (directly adjacent, not just \"nearby\").\n    *   The right edge of the grid.\n3.  **Consider Red \"Blocks\":** the code is currently written as if individual red\n    pixels can be moved independently. The expected behavior is to move entire\n    \"blocks\" of adjacent red pixels, treating them as a unit.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection, no code execution needed for this level of observation):**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The red pixels are incorrectly moved to the far left, stopping only at the grid edge or green pixels. The expected behavior clusters red pixels towards the right, forming contiguous blocks.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, red pixels are incorrectly moved left. The expected behavior should \"compress\" the existing red blocks to the right.\n*   **Example 3:** This example demonstrates a failure in the boundary condition checking. Some red pixels jump across blank space in unexpected ways. The expected output forms connected horizontal stretches of red to the right.\n*   **Example 4:** This example also has similar flaws with the shift direction, clustering on left rather than the right.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
