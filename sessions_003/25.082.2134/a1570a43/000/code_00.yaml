facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Green (3) pixels are present in the input and output grids in the exact same positions.
  - observation: |
      White (0) pixels are present in almost same positon in input and the output grids. Except few locations that may be replaced by the reds
  - observation: |
      Red (2) pixels are the primary elements that seem to be modified.
  - observation: |
    Red pixels are moved, in the output grid, to be enclosed by boundary and/or green pixels.

  - action: |
      Identify all 'red' (2) pixels, and move them to enclose the boundary or green pixels.
  - constraint: |
      The overall dimensions of the grid do not change.
  - constraint: |
      The position of 'green' (3) pixels remains constant.
