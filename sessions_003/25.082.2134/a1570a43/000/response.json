Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of varying sizes. The grids contain numerical values that represent colors. The primary colors involved seem to be:\n\n*   0: white\n*   2: red\n*   3: green\n\nThe core of the transformation appears to involve the red (2) pixels, while the green (3) and white (0) pixels act as some form of boundary or unchanged elements. The transformation seems to re-arrange red pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Except few locations that may be replaced by the reds\n  - observation: |\n      Red (2) pixels are the primary elements that seem to be modified.\n  - observation: |\n    Red pixels are moved, in the output grid, to be enclosed by boundary and/or green pixels.\n\n  - action: |\n      Identify all 'red' (2) pixels, and move them to enclose the boundary or green pixels.\n  - constraint: |\n      The overall dimensions of the grid do not change.\n  - constraint: |\n      The position of 'green' (3) pixels remains constant.\n```"

The moved red pixels should be placed in output matrix on the place of zeros, and the orignal position of the pixels should be replaced with zero.\n\nIn essence, the red pixels are repositioned by moving it to the left adjacent to other red pixels and keeping it within the boundary or the green pixels. The overall structure is maintained, and only the red elements are repositioned.\n"
