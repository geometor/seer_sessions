1.  **Identify Horizontal Pairs:** Scan the input grid to find all pairs of horizontally adjacent pixels that have different colors and where neither of the pixels are black (color 0).

2.  **Create Green Bars:** For each identified "horizontal pair", create a 2x1 block of green (color 3) pixels. The top row of this green block should be *exactly* one row below the row of the horizontal pair. The columns of the 2x1 block align with the columns of the horizontal pair.

3.  **Fill Single Row Gaps:** Examine all created green bars. If two green bars created in step two have top rows with a difference of 2 (meaning there's one empty row between the horizontal color changes), and the columns are the same, fill the gap row between them with green pixels, making it continuous.
