objects:
  - name: horizontal_pair
    description: Two horizontally adjacent pixels with different colors, excluding black.
    properties:
      - row: Row index of the pair.
      - col1: Column index of the first pixel.
      - col2: Column index of the second pixel.
      - color1: Color of the first pixel.
      - color2: Color of the second pixel.
  - name: green_bar
    description: A 2x1 block of green pixels.
    properties:
      - top_row: Row index of the top-left pixel.
      - left_col: Column index of the top-left pixel.
      - color: Green (3)

actions:
  - name: create_green_bar
    description: Creates a green bar below a horizontal pair.
    input: horizontal_pair
    output: green_bar
    constraints:
      - The green bar's top_row should be one row below the horizontal_pair's row.
      - The bar is only placed if a horizontal pair is detected.

  - name: fill_gap
    description: Fills the gap between two stacked green bars with another green bar, if and only if there's exactly one row separating them.
    input:
      - green_bar_1: A green bar.
      - green_bar_2: Another green bar.
    output: green_bar (in the gap)
    constraints:
      -  green_bar_2.top_row must be exactly two greater than green_bar_1.top_row
