"""
1.  **Identify Horizontal Pairs:** Scan the input grid to find all pairs of horizontally adjacent pixels that have different colors and where neither of the pixels are black (color 0).

2.  **Create Green Bars:** For each identified "horizontal pair", create a 2x1 block of green (color 3) pixels. The top row of this green block should be *exactly* one row below the row of the horizontal pair. The columns of the 2x1 block align with the columns of the horizontal pair.

3.  **Fill Single Row Gaps:** Examine all created green bars. If two green bars created in step two have top rows with a difference of 2 (meaning there's one empty row between the horizontal color changes), and the columns are the same, fill the gap row between them with green pixels, making it continuous.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize how to improve the natural language program and the corresponding code.

**General Assessment:**

The code's initial strategy was to identify horizontally adjacent, non-black, different-colored pixels and place a 2x1 green block beneath them. It also attempted to fill single-row gaps between these green blocks.  The results show this strategy is partially correct but misses crucial aspects of the transformation, specifically related to vertical placement of the green blocks.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**
1.  **Incorrect Vertical Placement**: The green blocks are consistently placed one row *below* the different-colored pixels. Need to adjust placement based upon a combined review of example inputs and expected outputs.
2. **Missing Vertical Gap Filling**: The provided examples don't show a gap filling logic being consistently applied. Need to revise gap filling based on review.

**Gather Metrics and Observations:**

I'll use a more descriptive analysis here, rather than code execution, focusing on the patterns apparent in the provided inputs, expected outputs, and the actual outputs of the previous code.

**Example 1 Analysis:**

*   **Input:** Two horizontal pairs: (9,9)-(6,6) and (8,4)-(7,7)
*   **Expected Output:** Green bars *between* the differing color pairs, and below (8,4)-(7,7) and extending downward.
*   **Actual Output:** Green bar only below (8,4)-(7,7) and not extending.
*   **Observation:** The vertical positioning logic and fill are incorrect

**Example 2 Analysis:**

*   **Input:** Horizontal pairs (4,8)-(9,4) and (2,1)-(1,2)
*   **Expected Output:** Green blocks between the horizontal transitions and stacked below each other.
*   **Actual Output:** Inconsistent gap fill. Missing extending green bars.
*   **Observation:** Again placement is wrong.

**Example 3 Analysis:**

*   **Input:** Horizontal pairs (2,4)-(6,7), (9,8)-(8,9) and (7,6)-(6,6).
*   **Expected Output:** Green blocks between (2,4) and (6,7) and filling the gap completely; between (9,8)-(8,9); Green blocks starting below row of (7,6) and extending to fill.
*    **Actual Output:** Does not handle combined fill correctly.
*   **Observation:** The vertical placement rule must combine the gaps between sets of color changes.

**YAML Fact Identification:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: horizontal_color_change
    properties:
      type: pixel_pair
      adjacency: horizontal
      colors: different
      non_black: true
  - name: green_bar
    properties:
      color: green
      shape: vertical_rectangle
      height: variable
      placement_rule: starts_between_color_changes
      fill_rule: extends_downward
      stacking: true

actions:
  - name: find_horizontal_changes
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_horizontal_color_changes
  - name: create_green_bars
    input: list_of_horizontal_color_changes
    output: modified_grid, green_bar_positions
  - name: vertical_fill
    input: modified_grid, green_bar_positions, input_grid
    output: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Horizontal Color Changes:** Scan the input grid to find all pairs of horizontally adjacent pixels that have different colors, and where neither pixel is black (color 0).

2.  **Create and Position Green Bars:** For each group of *vertically stacked* horizontal color changes, create green (color 3) bars.
    *   The green bar starts *between* each horizontally adjacent, non-black, different-colored pixel pairs.
    *   The bar's top row is located *between* the rows of vertically stacked horizontal color changes.
    *   The bar's width is 2 pixels, aligned with the columns of the color-changing pixels.

3.  **Vertical Fill:** Extend the green bars downwards. If a horizontal color change does not have another directly below it, then fill the area below the horizontal color change with green, extending downwards to either another horizontal color change or the bottom of the grid.

4. No other changes occur. Copy any non-modified pixel from input to output grid.
