The transformation seems to involve a combination of identifying specific colored objects and introducing new objects of color '3' (green). There's a spatial aspect, where the green objects seem to fill empty areas or connect existing objects. The input grids consist of two horizontal objects, some are made of single-color pixels and others of a combination of two colors side by side. The relative position of objects before and after the transformation is significant.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Consider each of these as a single object.\n\n2.  **Create Green Regions:**\n    *   If an object consists of two horizontally adjacent pixels, insert a 2x1 green (color 3) object directly beneath each pixel.\n    *   If there are two two-pixel objects in adjacent rows separated by one all-black row, fill the blank row with a 2x1 green object under each original color.\n\n3.  **Combine and Output:** Construct the output grid by combining the original objects and the newly created green regions, maintaining their relative positions. Ensure correct object placement and all rows/columns are preserved.\n\nIn short: Create green (3) vertical bars of height 2 under two horizontally adjacent pixels of different colors. If there are two-colored object, the space between them that is only one row, it gets filled with two green vertical bars with height 2.\n"
