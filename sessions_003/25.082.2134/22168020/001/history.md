Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The primary operation seems to be related to expanding or "filling in" pixels of a specific color horizontally and, in some cases, vertically, based on their initial positions. The background color (0, or white) remains unchanged. It appears that only some colors are subject to this expansion, while others remain unchanged. The shapes formed by the initial colored pixels seem to dictate the boundaries of the expansion.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - object: background
    color: 0 (white)
    property: remains unchanged
  - object: colored_pixels
    colors: 3 (green), 1 (blue), 6 (magenta), 8 (azure), 4 (yellow)
    property: |
       Expand horizontally to fill the area to the next colored pixel or to itself to close object, expands until the area is enclosed.
  - observation: Expansion is not blocked when two or more expansion color blocks are side by side.
  - observation: Expansion only happens within the row it first appears.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Identify pixels with colors other than 0 (white).
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each identified pixel, expand its color horizontally to the left and right.
    *   Continue expansion until another non-white pixel is encountered on each side.
3. Leave background color (0) as White.

Essentially, each colored pixel acts as a seed and "grows" horizontally, overwriting only white pixels until it encounters a boundary (another colored pixel).
