Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to expand contiguous blocks of non-white pixels to the left, stopping at a different colored non-white pixel or the grid edge. This logic works partially, but the results show consistent errors across all three examples. The primary issue seems to be an over-aggressive expansion, particularly in cases where single-pixel wide "columns" of a color exist. The expansion incorrectly extends these single-pixel columns to the left, filling in areas that should remain white. The code also doesn't account for the expansion direction appropriately. Example 2 includes color 1 and 4 and they seem to expand differently.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Block Identification:** The current code identifies the end of a block correctly, going right. However the expansion is applied to single pixels. We should verify this for single pixels.
2.  **Conditional Expansion:** Implement a check that prevents expansion in cases where the block width is only a single pixel.
3. Review the assumption that the pixels only expand to the left.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, code execution not needed for this level of observation):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has vertical stripes of color 3.
    *   Output incorrectly expands these single-pixel columns to the left.
    *   Error: 14 pixels off.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has vertical stripes of color 1 and color 4.
    *   Output incorrectly expands these single-pixel columns of color 1 to the left.
    *   Color 4 is handled differently - the rightmost 4's are not touched, but the ones to their left are expanded.
    *   Error: 26 pixels off.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has vertical stripes of color 6 and 8.
    *   Output incorrectly expands these single-pixel columns to the left.
    *   Error: 19 pixels off.

facts:
  - task_id: 22168020
  - objects:
    - description: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
      properties:
        - color: Varies (1, 3, 4, 6, 8 in examples).
        - width: Can be one or more pixels.
        - height: Extends the full height of the block (in the examples).
  - actions:
    - type: Expansion
      description: Blocks expand horizontally.
      details:
       - direction:  predominantly to the left, conditionally.
       - condition:  "If a block is wider than one pixel or if the expansion will not merge with a block of another color, it expands to the left until blocked by another color or the grid edge. Single pixel blocks do *not* expand when isolated."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** contiguous blocks of non-white pixels within each row. A block is defined as one or more adjacent pixels of the same color.
3.  **Check Block Width**: If a block's width is greater than 1 pixel, expand that block to the left, replacing white (0) pixels with the block's color, until the expansion encounters a pixel of a different, non-white color, or the edge of the grid.
4. Check for single pixel extension: If the pixel to the right is the same color, expand to the left.

5.  **Leave Single-Pixel Blocks:** If a block has a width of 1 pixel, and it is *not* adjacent (horizontally) to a block of the same color on its right, do *not* expand it.
6.  Repeat steps 2-5 for all blocks on the line, then all lines.
