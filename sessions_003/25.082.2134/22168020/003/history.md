Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize an update to the natural language program and subsequently the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a horizontal expansion of non-white pixels. However, it expands them *too much*. The expansion should stop when it encounters *any* non-white pixel, but the current logic expands until the *same color* non-white pixel or the edge of the grid. The code also expands in both directions which is unnecessary, it appears we only need to expand to the left. Based on visual inspection of the expected output, the filling should stop before any non-white colors.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine the Stopping Condition:** Modify the natural language program (and subsequently the code) to specify that expansion stops when *any* non-white pixel is encountered, not just a pixel of the same color.
2. **Directional Expansion:** Limit the expansion only to the left.
3. **Consider starting pixels:** Reiterate that only the original non-white pixels initiate the filling.

**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**

Since I am in "dreamer" mode I don't have code execution. I will instead provide clear instructions about what metrics are important.

We need to know the following for each example:

1. The location (row, col) and color of each original non-white pixel.
2. The extent of the expansion to the left for each starting non-white pixel.
3. Verify expansion stops at any non-white color.

This information can all be extracted by manual analysis, but would be very well suited to automation.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Starting Pixels:** Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the "starting pixels".
2.  **Expand Left:** For each "starting pixel", expand its color to the left, one cell at a time.
3.  **Stopping Condition:** Stop the leftward expansion of a starting pixel when either:
    *   The edge of the grid is reached.
    *   A non-white pixel (of *any* color) is encountered.
4.  **Overwrite:** If a cell to be filled by expansion is currently white, it should be changed to color of the expanding "starting" pixel. If the cell is already non-white, do *not* modify it.
