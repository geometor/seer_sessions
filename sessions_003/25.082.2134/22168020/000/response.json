The primary operation seems to be related to expanding or \"filling in\" pixels of a specific color horizontally and, in some cases, vertically, based on their initial positions. The background color (0, or white) remains unchanged. It appears that only some colors are subject to this expansion, while others remain unchanged. The shapes formed by the initial colored pixels seem to dictate the boundaries of the expansion.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Leave background color (0) as White.\n\nEssentially, each colored pixel acts as a seed and \"grows\" horizontally, overwriting only white pixels until it encounters a boundary (another colored pixel).\n"
