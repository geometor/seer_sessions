            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to expand contiguous blocks of non-white pixels to the left, stopping at a different colored non-white pixel or the grid edge. This logic works partially, but the results show consistent errors across all three examples. The primary issue seems to be an over-aggressive expansion, particularly in cases where single-pixel wide \"columns\" of a color exist. The expansion incorrectly extends these single-pixel columns to the left, filling in areas that should remain white. The code also doesn't account for the expansion direction appropriately. Example 2 includes color 1 and 4 and they seem to expand differently.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Block Identification:** The current code identifies the end of a block correctly, going right. However the expansion is applied to single pixels. We should verify this for single pixels.\n2.  **Conditional Expansion:** Implement a check that prevents expansion in cases where the block width is only a single pixel.\n3. Review the assumption that the pixels only expand to the left.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, code execution not needed for this level of observation):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has vertical stripes of color 3.\n    *   Output incorrectly expands these single-pixel columns to the left.\n    *   Error: 14 pixels off.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has vertical stripes of color 1 and color 4.\n    *   Output incorrectly expands these single-pixel columns of color 1 to the left.\n    *   Color 4 is handled differently - the rightmost 4's are not touched, but the ones to their left are expanded.\n    *   Error: 26 pixels off.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has vertical stripes of color 6 and 8.\n    *   Output incorrectly expands these single-pixel columns to the left.\n    *   Error: 19 pixels off.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

A block is defined as one or more adjacent pixels of the same color.\n3.  **Check Block Width**: If a block's width is greater than 1 pixel, expand that block to the left, replacing white (0) pixels with the block's color, until the expansion encounters a pixel of a different, non-white color, or the edge of the grid.\n4. Check for single pixel extension: If the pixel to the right is the same color, expand to the left.\n\n5.  **Leave Single-Pixel Blocks:** If a block has a width of 1 pixel, and it is *not* adjacent (horizontally) to a block of the same color on its right, do *not* expand it.\n6.
