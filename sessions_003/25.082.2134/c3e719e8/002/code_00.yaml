        object: single_block
      output:
        shape: (9, 9)
        pattern: "complex replication - input appears at (0,0), (0,6) and (6,0) and (6,6) with additional padding around these instances"

      input:
        shape: (3, 3)
        object: single_block
      output:
        shape: (9, 9)
        pattern: "replication with padding, two copies right of the input start at (0,3), one copy down start at (6,0), with zeros added around those instances "
