facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, larger than input_grid
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors, predominantly 0

  - action: replicate_input
    description: The input grid is replicated multiple times within the output grid.
    parameters:
      - replication_pattern:  Seems to follow a specific, potentially diagonal or block-wise, layout, interspersed with zeros.

  - action: pad_with_zeros
    description:  The output grid is filled with zeros (0) except for the locations where the input grid is replicated.

  - relationship: output_dimensions
    description: The output grid's dimensions are likely a multiple of the input grid's dimensions. The multiplier is probably different in different examples.
