The core element seems to be a repetition and arrangement of the original input grid within a larger, mostly empty (filled with 0s) grid. The output grid's dimensions appear to be related to the input grid's dimensions by a multiple. There's a pattern of empty rows and columns, combined with repetitions of the original input. There doesn't seem to be a rotation or reflection, just translation and repetition.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
