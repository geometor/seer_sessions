            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of creating a 3x3 larger output grid and replicating the input grid within it was a reasonable starting point. However, the replication logic was incorrectly assumed to be consistent across all examples. The test results clearly show that each example has a unique replication pattern. The strategy must shift from finding a single, universal replication rule to identifying the specific rule for *each* example and then generalizing. The provided code already attempts to implement specific replication rules for each example, but these rules were incorrect.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Analysis of Each Example:** For each example, we must accurately determine where the input grid is replicated in the output grid. This includes the starting row and column indices for each replication.\n2.  **Precise Replication Logic:** Based on the detailed analysis, we'll define the replication logic for each example. This will involve specifying the offsets (in terms of input grid height and width) for each replication of the input grid within the output grid.\n3.  **Generalized Rule (If Possible):** After understanding each specific case, we'll attempt to find a general rule, parameter, or pattern that can predict the replication behavior based on the input, it is not a general rule based on the index.\n4.  Refine Natural Language Program, and code.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nTo help accurately describe the transformations, I'll write python code to analyze each example. The code will compute the locations of the original subgrid, the size of the subgrids and the overall grid, and locations of any replicated portions.\n\n"
