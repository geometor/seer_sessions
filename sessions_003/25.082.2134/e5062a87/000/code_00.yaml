facts:

        behavior: "replaces target under certain conditions"
  - transformation_type: "conditional pixel replacement"
  - conditions_observed:
    - proximity: "Red pixels often appear near existing red pixels in the input"
  - spatial_relationship: "Replacement happens, in many cases, where grey pixels neighbor red"
