The primary colors observed are gray (5), black (0), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of gray (5) pixels with red (2) pixels, primarily in proximity to existing red pixels. The overall structure and dimensions of the grid remain constant. The positioning of red pixels appears to follow some kind of logic based around proximity and perhaps other, more subtle, geometric constraints or object recognition.\n\n**YAML Block Documentation**\n\n"

The output grid will have the same dimensions.\n2.  **Copy Unchanged Pixels:** All black (0) pixels in the input grid remain black (0) in the output grid.\n3.  **Conditional Replacement:** Iterate through each gray (5) pixel in the input grid.\n4.  **Check original red:** If there are any existing red(2) in the input grid, check for the neighbors of the current grey(5) in the input grid.\n5.  **Neighbor Proximity Rule (Adjacency based):** If a gray (5) pixel is *horizontally* or *vertically* adjacent to a red (2) pixel in the *input* grid, replace the gray (5) pixel with a red (2) pixel in the output grid. Diagonal proximity is not considered.\n6. **Preserve all other gray pixels** if a gray pixel is not changed, keep it as gray in output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation \"grows\" red areas by converting adjacent gray pixels to red, while preserving the black background and un-converted gray pixels.\n"
