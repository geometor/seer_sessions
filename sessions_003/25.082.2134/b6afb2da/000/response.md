Okay, let's analyze this ARC task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are the same size (10x10).
*   The input grids consist of regions of gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
*   The output grids have the same overall shape as the input, but the gray regions are replaced with a pattern of blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4) pixels. White (0) regions remain unchanged.
*   The pattern within the transformed gray regions appears to be symmetrical, both horizontally and vertically.
*    It looks like we are replacing, coloring the grey areas with a new, colored object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: gray_region_1
    type: contiguous_region
    color: gray (5)
    shape: irregular, but bounded by white regions
    position: varies in the two examples, but maintains overall grid structure.
  - name: white_region
    type: contiguous_region
    color: white (0)
    shape: background, defines boundary of gray region
    position: static, surrounding gray region
  - name: colored_region
    type: replacement_region
    color: blue(1), red(2), yellow(4)
    shape: same overall shape as gray_region, internally patterned
    position: occupies same space as gray_region

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    agent: unknown
    target: gray_region
    replacement: colored_region pattern

relationships:
  - gray_region_1 is_surrounded_by white_region
  - colored_region replaces gray_region_1
  - colored_region exhibits internal symmetry (horizontal and vertical)
  - colored_region colors might be related to distance or position

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each** gray region:
    a. **Replace** the gray pixels with a new pattern of colors.
    b. The pattern uses a small set of pixels. For a gray object of width and height `n`, the transformation goes as follows:
    c. The outermost layer of cells become yellow.
    d. The next inner layer is red.
    e. The next is red again.
    f. The next is yellow.
    g. The next is blue.
    h. repeat
3. **Preserve** all white (0) pixels in their original positions.

Essentially the transformation involves a symmetric color replacement within each gray area, maintaining shape, while the white areas acts as delimiters and do not change.
