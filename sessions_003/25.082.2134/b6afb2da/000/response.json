White (0) regions remain unchanged.\n*   The pattern within the transformed gray regions appears to be symmetrical, both horizontally and vertically.\n*    It looks like we are replacing, coloring the grey areas with a new, colored object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The pattern uses a small set of pixels. For a gray object of width and height `n`, the transformation goes as follows:\n    c. The outermost layer of cells become yellow.\n    d. The next inner layer is red.\n    e. The next is red again.\n    f. The next is yellow.\n    g.
