Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and creating a natural language program to describe the transformation.

**Perception of Elements**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids are of varying sizes. They contain digits representing colors.
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are larger than the input grids, appearing to be expansions or repetitions of the input patterns.
*   **Color Changes:**Â A new color (8, or azure) appears in the output that is not present in the input. This suggests a rule-based color insertion.
*    **Pattern:** The input appears to get replicated, and the new color (8) is strategically placed, possibly as a border or fill.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3, 6x6, 2x2)
      - content: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    actions:
      - expanded: Creates larger grid.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: Larger than input_grid, derived from input dimensions.
      - content: Contains all original input colors and the new color 8 (azure).
    actions: []
  - relation: expansion
    description: The output grid is created by expanding and transforming input.
  - constant: new_color
    value: 8 # azure

  - rule: insert_new_color:
      description: color 8 is inserted based on positions of other colors
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is expanded into output grid. The height and width of output is input multiplied by factor N.

2.  **Replication:** The original pattern from the input grid is replicated within the output grid.

3.  **Insertion:** Every column with original non-zero pixel, is followed by the insertion of a column filled entirely with color 8 (azure).

4.  **Insertion:** Every row with non-zero pixel is followed by insertion of the row, where value is 8 if:
    *   corresponding pixel in previous row was 0
    *   corresponding pixel in the next inserted column is 8

Let's break down the program further to describe generation of output:

*   Train 1
    *   input: 3 x 3, output: 6 x 6
    *   N = 2
    *   Columns 1, 3 contains non-zero, add column of 8 after them
    *   Rows 1, 3 contains non-zero, add row after them, filling by 8 according to rule

*   Train 2
    *   input: 6 x 6, output: 12 x 12
    *   N = 2
    *   Columns 2, 6 contains non-zero, add column of 8 after them
    *   Rows 1, 5 contains non-zero, add row after them, filling by 8 according to rule

*   Train 3
    *   input: 2 x 2, output: 4 x 4
    *   N = 2
    *    Columns 2 contains non-zero, add column of 8 after them
    *    Rows 1 contains non-zero, add row after them, filling by 8 according to rule
