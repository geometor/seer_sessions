They contain digits representing colors.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are larger than the input grids, appearing to be expansions or repetitions of the input patterns.\n*   **Color Changes:**\u00a0A new color (8, or azure) appears in the output that is not present in the input. This suggests a rule-based color insertion.\n*    **Pattern:** The input appears to get replicated, and the new color (8) is strategically placed, possibly as a border or fill.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
