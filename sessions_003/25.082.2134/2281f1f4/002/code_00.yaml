objects:
  - type: vertical_lines
    color: gray (5)
    description: One or more adjacent gray pixels in a column.
    behavior: Determine x-coordinates for color replacement.

  - type: target_rows
    description: Rows containing at least one gray pixel.
    behavior:  These rows are subject to pixel modification.

  - type: pixels_to_change
    color: black (0)
    location_constraint: Must be within target rows and at x-coordinates defined by vertical_lines.
    new_color: red (2)

actions:
  - action: identify_vertical_lines
    input: input_grid
    output: List of vertical line coordinates.

  - action: identify_target_rows
    input: input_grid, vertical_lines
    output: set of row indices

  - action: conditional_replacement
    input:  target_rows, vertical_lines, input_grid
    process: Iterate through target rows. Within each row, check for black (0) pixels at the x-coordinates of the vertical lines. If found, change the pixel color to red (2).
