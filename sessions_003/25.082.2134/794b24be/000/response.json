Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of varying dimensions, but mostly 3x3.\n*   The grids contain digits 0 and 1 in the input, and 0 and 2 in the output.\n*   0 represents white, 1 represents blue, and 2 represents red based on the provided color map.\n*   The transformation seems to involve changing blue (1) pixels to red (2) pixels.\n*   The location and number of red pixels in the output seem to correspond to the location and number of blue pixels in the input. Not all blues are changed to red.\n*   The position and extent of the cluster of changes is essential.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Change every pixel in identified blue object to red.\n4.  Continue scanning subsequent rows.\n5.  If a blue pixel is directly below a previously changed red pixel, change it and any contiguous blue object it is a part of to red.\n6.   If a blue object is encountered that is not connected to any previously changed red pixel, ignore it.\n7.  All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule is to change connected blue objects to red, starting from the top row and propagating downward, stopping propagation if a new disconnected blue object is encountered.\n"
