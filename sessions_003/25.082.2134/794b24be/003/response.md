1. Identify Blue Objects: Find all contiguous groups of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous group is defined as a set of blue pixels connected vertically or horizontally.
2. Check Top Row Connection: For each identified blue object, determine if any of its pixels are located in the top row (row 0) of the grid.
3. Transform Connected Objects: If a blue object has at least one pixel in the top row, change *all* pixels within that object to red (2).
4. Leave other blue object alone: If a blue object does not have a pixel on the top row, do not transform.
5. The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid, with the specified transformations.
