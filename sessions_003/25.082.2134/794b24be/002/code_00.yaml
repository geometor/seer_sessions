  - transform: Change blue objects connected to top row to red.

connectivity:
  - Adjacent pixels of the same color form a connected object.
  - Only vertical and horizontal adjacency is considered, not diagonal.

  - If a blue object contains a pixel in the top row, change all pixels in that object to red.
  - If a blue object does not contain any pixels in the top row it should not be changed.
