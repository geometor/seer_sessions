facts:
  - observation: |
      Blue pixels connected to the top row initiate the transformation.  The transformation does not affect just the connected
      blue pixels - it also affects blue pixels in the same column down the image and it also extends the transformation to fill in
      the space between blue pixels connected to the top row.
  - object_identification:
      - name: Initiating Blue Pixels
        color: blue (1)
        property: Must be located in the top row (row 0).
      - name: Affected Columns
        color: blue (1)
        property: columns where any 'Initiating Blue Pixels' are present, and all rows in those columns down to the bottom or until a non-blue pixel
      - name: Target Rectangle
        color: red (2)
        property: |
            Bounding box defined by:
              - Top row: 0 (always).
              - Leftmost column:  The leftmost column containing an 'Initiating Blue Pixel'.
              - Rightmost column: The rightmost column containing an 'Initiating Blue Pixel'.
              - Bottom row:  The bottom-most row in the input grid with a blue pixel present among the 'Affected Columns', or the bottom of the grid
  - transformation_rule: |
      1. Find all blue pixels in the top row (Initiating Blue Pixels).
      2. Determine the leftmost and rightmost columns of these pixels.
      3. Determine the lowest row among the 'Affected Columns' which has a blue.
      4. Fill a rectangle with red (2). The rectangle is bounded by the top row (0), the calculated leftmost and rightmost columns, and the lowest row
         with a blue pixel among affected columns, or the bottom of the grid, whichever is lower.
      5. All other pixels in the grid are set to black (0).
