facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Digit '5' (gray) remains constant in position."
  - observation: "Digits other than '5' in the input are replaced by other digits in output, preserving relative position."
  - observation: "The transformation seems to treat the columns to the left and right of '5' with some form of mapping that is specific for input value on left and right of 5."
  - observation: "0 on the left of 5, transforms to a specific value, and a different value to the right of 5, when there is a non-zero value in between the 0 and the 5."
  - mapping:
      left:
          0: 6 # white -> light grey
          1: 6 # blue -> light grey
          2: 7 # red -> orange
          3: 8 # green -> light blue
          4: 9 # yellow -> dark red
      right:
          0: 6 # white -> light grey
          1: 6 # blue -> light grey
          2: 7 # red -> orange
          3: 8 # green -> light blue
          4: 9 # yellow -> dark red
