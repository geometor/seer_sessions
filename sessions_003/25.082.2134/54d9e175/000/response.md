Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation in YAML, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of digits (representing colors) into another grid of digits. The output grid seems to have the same dimensions as the input grid in all provided examples. The digit '5' (gray) appears to be a constant, acting possibly as a separator or boundary. The digits to the left and right of '5' in the input grid (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) seem to be replaced by a corresponding different digits (6,7,8,9) in a patterned way. The digits 0s seem to get replaced as well.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Digit '5' (gray) remains constant in position."
  - observation: "Digits other than '5' in the input are replaced by other digits in output, preserving relative position."
  - observation: "The transformation seems to treat the columns to the left and right of '5' with some form of mapping that is specific for input value on left and right of 5."
  - observation: "0 on the left of 5, transforms to a specific value, and a different value to the right of 5, when there is a non-zero value in between the 0 and the 5."
  - mapping:
      left:
          0: 6 # white -> light grey
          1: 6 # blue -> light grey
          2: 7 # red -> orange
          3: 8 # green -> light blue
          4: 9 # yellow -> dark red
      right:
          0: 6 # white -> light grey
          1: 6 # blue -> light grey
          2: 7 # red -> orange
          3: 8 # green -> light blue
          4: 9 # yellow -> dark red
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Maintain '5'**: Copy all instances of the digit '5' from the input grid to the same positions in the output grid.
2.  **Left Side Transformation**: For each non-'5' digit in the input grid, to the *left* of a '5', replace it based on these mappings:
    *   0 -> 6
    *   1 -> 6
    *   2 -> 7
    *   3 -> 8
    *   4 -> 9
3.  **Right Side Transformation**: For each non-'5' digit to the *right* of a '5', transform them using this mapping
    *   0 -> 6
    *   1 -> 6
    *   2 -> 7
    *   3 -> 8
    *   4 -> 9
4. **If a zero is encountered to the left or to the right, but before a non-zero values, it transforms to 6**

In essence, the transformation maintains the '5's and applies a specific color mapping to other digits on the left and right of each 5.
