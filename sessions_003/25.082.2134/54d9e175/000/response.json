The output grid seems to have the same dimensions as the input grid in all provided examples. The digit '5' (gray) appears to be a constant, acting possibly as a separator or boundary. The digits to the left and right of '5' in the input grid (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) seem to be replaced by a corresponding different digits (6,7,8,9) in a patterned way. The digits 0s seem to get replaced as well.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
