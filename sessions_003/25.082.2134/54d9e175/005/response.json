These pixels are \"pivot pixels\" and their values will remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n2.  **Left Transformation:** For any pixel *to the left* of a pivot pixel, apply the following transformation to its value:\n    *   0 becomes 6 (white becomes magenta)\n    *   1 becomes 6 (blue becomes magenta)\n    *   2 becomes 7 (red becomes orange)\n    *   3 becomes 8 (green becomes azure)\n    *   4 becomes 9 (yellow becomes maroon)\n\n3.  **Right Transformation:** For any pixel *to the right* of a pivot pixel, apply the following transformation to its value:\n    *   0 becomes 6 (white becomes magenta)\n    *   1 becomes 6 (blue becomes magenta)\n    *   2 becomes 7 (red becomes orange)\n    *   3 becomes 8 (green becomes azure)\n    *   4 becomes 9 (yellow becomes maroon)\n\n4. **Output Construction:** Create the output grid by applying the above transformations. Copy pivot pixels (value 5) directly to the output grid. Transform the non-pivot pixels according to the left or right transformation rules based on their position relative to the nearest pivot pixel on the same row. If a pixel is both to the left of *one* pivot pixel and to the right of *another*, the transformation is applied consistently based on the mapping. The presence of any 5 transforms all of the digits to its left to the 'left_mapping' and all digits to the right to the 'right_mapping'.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the defined rules.\"\"\"\n\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)  # Ensure numpy array\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)   # Initialize output_grid\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    left_mapping = {0: 6, 1: 6, 2: 7, 3: 8, 4: 9}\n    right_mapping = {0: 6, 1: 6, 2: 7, 3: 8, 4: 9}\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        pivot_indices = np.where(input_grid[r] == 5)[0]\n\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 5:\n                continue  # Pivot pixels remain unchanged\n\n            if len(pivot_indices) > 0:\n                if c < pivot_indices[0]:\n                    # Apply left transformation\n                    output_grid[r, c] = left_mapping.get(input_grid[r, c], input_grid[r, c])\n                else:\n                    #Apply right transformation\n                    output_grid[r,c] = right_mapping.get(input_grid[r,c], input_grid[r,c])\n            # else no transformation (no pivot on that row)\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
