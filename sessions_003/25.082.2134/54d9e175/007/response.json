These are the \"pivot pixels.\"\n\n2.  **Nearest Pivot:** For every non-pivot pixel in a row, determine the *nearest* pivot pixel within that same row. Distance is measured by the difference in column indices.\n\n3.  **Left Transformation:** For each non-pivot pixel *to the left* of its nearest pivot pixel, apply the `left_mapping` to transform its value:\n    *   0 becomes 6 (white becomes magenta)\n    *   1 becomes 6 (blue becomes magenta)\n    *   2 becomes 7 (red becomes orange)\n    *   3 becomes 8 (green becomes azure)\n    *   4 becomes 9 (yellow becomes maroon)\n\n4.  **Right Transformation:** For each non-pivot pixel *to the right* of its nearest pivot pixel, apply the `right_mapping` to transform its value:\n    *   0 becomes 6 (white becomes magenta)\n    *   1 becomes 6 (blue becomes magenta)\n    *   2 becomes 7 (red becomes orange)\n    *   3 becomes 8 (green becomes azure)\n    *   4 becomes 9 (yellow becomes maroon)\n\n5.  **Pivot Pixel Preservation:** Pivot pixels (value 5) remain unchanged in the output grid. Copy their values directly.\n\n6.  **No Pivot Row:** If a row has no pivot pixels leave it unchanged\n\n7.  **Output:** Construct the output grid by combining the transformed non-pivot pixels and the unchanged pivot pixels.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the defined rules.\"\"\"\n\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)  # Ensure numpy array\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)   # Initialize output_grid\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    left_mapping = {0: 6, 1: 6, 2: 7, 3: 8, 4: 9}\n    right_mapping = {0: 6, 1: 6, 2: 7, 3: 8, 4: 9}\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        # Find pivot indices in the current row\n        pivot_indices = np.where(input_grid[r] == 5)[0]\n\n        # If no pivots in this row, skip to the next row\n        if len(pivot_indices) == 0:\n            continue\n\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Skip pivot pixels themselves\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 5:\n                continue\n\n            # Find the nearest pivot\n            nearest_pivot_index = min(pivot_indices, key=lambda x: abs(x - c))\n\n            # Apply transformation based on position relative to nearest pivot\n            if c < nearest_pivot_index:\n                output_grid[r, c] = left_mapping.get(input_grid[r, c], input_grid[r, c])\n            else:\n                output_grid[r, c] = right_mapping.get(input_grid[r, c], input_grid[r, c])\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
