            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code's logic is partially correct: it identifies the '5' (gray) pixels as pivots and attempts to transform digits to their left and right. However, the transformation logic appears flawed. It seems to apply the *same* transformation (using `left_mapping`) to both left and right sides of the '5's. Additionally, it doesn't correctly handle the *magnitude* of the change. The digits to the left of '5' are supposed to become corresponding higher number, and digits to the right of '5' are *also* supposed to become a corresponding *higher* number. The previous implementation seems to be assigning values based only on the position of '5', rather than applying a distinct transformation.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct the Transformation Logic:** Separate the left and right transformations and map them distinctly according to the natural language transformation given in the problem description (and example transformation output).\n2.  **Verify Logic:** I'll pay close attention to edges and corners to ensure the rules are applied uniformly.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's use code execution to get a precise view of the pixel value mappings in all training examples.\n\n"

Copy pivot pixels (value 5) directly to the output grid. Transform the non-pivot pixels according to the left or right transformation rules based on their position relative to the nearest pivot pixel on the same row. If a pixel is both to the left of *one* pivot pixel and to the right of *another*, the transformation is applied consistently based on the mapping. The presence of any 5 transforms all of the digits to its left to the 'left_mapping' and all digits to the right to the 'right_mapping'.\n\nThe code analysis and natural language program are now updated to reflect this logic and all examples seen.\n"
