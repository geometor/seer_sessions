            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and results to refine the natural language program and address the errors.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code have several shortcomings. The core idea of using '5' (gray) as a pivot and applying different transformations to the left and right is correct. However, the implementation fails to accurately capture the specific transformations for each digit based on its position relative to '5'. The results show consistent mismatches in pixel values, indicating errors in applying left and right mappings. Additionally, the special rule for zero seems misplaced. There's confusion about where the zeros that map to 6 appear.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Re-examine Mappings:** Carefully analyze each example, focusing on how each digit transforms based on its position (left or right of '5'). The current mappings seem to be consistently off for almost all inputs, and should be verified in terms of how each value transforms to the left and the right.\n2. **Zero Transformation:** The zeros are treated inconsistently. The intention seemed to be that zeros will map to 6 on either side of the '5', until another number is hit. We need to revisit how and where zeros map.\n3. **Refine Conditional Logic:** The code's logic for determining left and right needs to be very simple - anything to the left of a 5 should be transformed, anything to the right, using the *other* mapping, should be transformed.\n4. **Iterative Testing:** After each modification to the natural language program and code, test against *all* examples to ensure improvements and catch regressions.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's get more specific metrics. I'll analyze the differences between expected and transformed outputs for each example using numpy.\n\n"
