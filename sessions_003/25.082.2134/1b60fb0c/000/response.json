The input grids consist primarily of blue (1) and white (0) pixels.  The key seems to be a specific configuration of blue pixels. The output grids introduce red (2) pixels in a pattern related to the blue pixels in the input. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

This definition of \"center\" needs clarifying, but will be determined by observing the y-coordinates of the contiguous vertical group.\n3.  **Create the red region:**\n    *   Iterate through the rows of the target column.\n    *   If a blue pixel is found at the start (left-side) of a series of 3 or more contiguous blue pixels (horizontal or vertical), replace pixels to its left with red (2) pixels according to these rules:\n        *   If the blue pixel is part of a vertical run of at least 3 blue pixels, paint cells red to its left.\n        *   If there is one non-white pixel immediately to the left of a blue pixel, make that non-white pixel red, and any non-white pixels to *its* left.\n        *   The red fill extends up to 3 cells, including the replaced non-white pixel.\n4.  **Preserve other pixels:** All white (0) pixels that are not part of the identified blue region, or to the left of the blue region as per the prior rule, remain unchanged.\n\n**Clarifications & Notes:**\n*  the definition \"center\" of the shape is crucial. The current understanding from the examples indicates the target columns are: example 1 - column 5; example 2 - column 4; example 3 - column 4. It appears to locate the vertical blue group that is furthest to the left, *and* contains at least 3 consecutive vertical pixels.\n*   The red (2) pixels are always placed to the *left* of the identified target column, effectively replacing some of the white pixels.\n* If a blue pixel *starts* a series of blue pixels to the left, those left pixels are the ones replaced by red.\n"
