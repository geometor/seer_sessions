            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focuses on identifying a connected blue region and finding the leftmost column within that region containing at least three consecutive blue pixels. It then attempts to introduce red pixels to the left of this column. However, the results indicate inaccuracies in the placement and extent of the red pixels, leading to mismatches in all three examples. The core issue seems to be an incorrect assumption of applying red pixels to the left of the column and an issue of extending beyond the original 3 run.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Red Pixel Placement:** The current logic incorrectly places red pixels. We need to revise the rule for where and how many red pixels are added. The examples all show the position depends on where that run of 3 blue pixels start.\n2.  **Verify Consecutive Blue Pixel Logic:** Examine the code that identifies the target column with three consecutive blue pixels. Make sure it finds *only* the first instance from the top.\n3. Test the updated code on the existing examples until perfect matches are achieved.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nLet's use a manual approach. The provided images are helpful to identify the errors visually.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input:** A blue region exists with a clear leftmost column containing three consecutive blue pixels starting at row 4.\n*   **Expected Output:** Red pixels are placed to the left of the identified blue column, corresponding precisely to the rows where the three consecutive blue pixels start, and extend horizontally to fill white space to the left.\n*   **Transformed Output:** The red pixels are incorrectly offset upwards.\n*  **Pixels Off:** 15\n*  **Error:** Red pixels are placed 3 above where the continuous run of blue began\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input:** A blue region with a leftmost column of three consecutive blue pixels starting at row 3.\n*   **Expected Output:** Similar to Example 1, red pixels fill to the left of the starting row of the three consecutive blue pixels.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Red pixels are shifted\n*  **Pixels Off:** 19\n*  **Error:** Red pixels are placed 3 above where the continuous run of blue began\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input:** Blue region, leftmost column, three consecutive blue pixels start at row 3.\n*   **Expected Output:** Red pixels fill to the left, corresponding to the run.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Similar red pixel offset as in previous examples.\n*  **Pixels Off:** 21\n*  **Error:** Red pixels are placed 3 above where the continuous run of blue began\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
