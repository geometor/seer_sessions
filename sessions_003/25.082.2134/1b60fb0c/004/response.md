Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved identifying a contiguous blue region and adding red pixels to its left. However, subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The red pixels are not simply added to the left of *any* blue region. They're added to the left of a specific *column* within the blue region, and only in rows where there's a run of at least three consecutive blue pixels starting at that column. The code attempts to do this, but makes a critical error: It adds red pixels to *all* columns to the left of the target column in all contiguous rows of blue, *not* just the rows that have the initial run of three. It appears to extend the red too far to the left. The error is in how the `contiguous_rows` are applied with the `target_column`.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Target Row Identification:** The current code correctly identifies the `target_column` and `start_row` of the three consecutive blue pixels.
2.  **Precise Row Selection:** Instead of adding red to all contiguous blue rows, we need to add them only to rows that contain the original run of 3+ blue cells. This means we need to check each row starting from the `start_row`.
3. **Constrain Red Placement:** Ensure red pixels extend to the left only until the original blue pixels are no longer contiguous

**Gather Metrics (using code execution for additional insights - not needed):**

The results provided already includes pixel differences, so external code execution isn't necessary for calculating basic metrics. We can summarize them directly:

*   **Example 1:** 16 pixels different.
*   **Example 2:** 33 pixels different.
*   **Example 3:** 35 pixels different.

In all cases, the size and color palette are correct, indicating the core logic of identifying blue and adding red is present, but the placement logic is flawed.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml

  - name: blue_region
    type: contiguous_pixels
    color: blue
    properties:
      - min_consecutive_length: 3  # Minimum consecutive pixels in a column

  - name: target_column
    type: column
    properties:
      - leftmost_with_consecutive: True  # Leftmost column within blue_region meeting criteria

  - name: red_region
    type: added_pixels

  - name: find_target_column
    description: Finds the leftmost column in the blue region with at least 3 consecutive blue pixels.

  - name: add_red_pixels
    description: Adds red pixels to the left of the target column, but only in specific rows.
    constraints: only the run of blue

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of blue (color 1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Find Target Column:** Within the blue regions, find the *leftmost* column that contains at least three consecutive blue pixels. Record this column index as `target_column` and the row index where the three consecutive pixels begin, as `start_row`.
3.  **Identify Target Rows:** Check each row from the `start_row` downwards as long as the blue in `target_column` is still blue.
4.  **Add Red Pixels:** For each of the target rows, add red (color 2) pixels to the grid, starting from column 0 and going up to, but not including, the `target_column`. The run of red pixels should stop at the beginning of the three consecutive blue pixels.

This revised natural language program explicitly captures the constraint on red pixel placement, addressing the observed errors.
