Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements**

The task involves identifying a specific pattern within the input grid and modifying it in the output grid. The input grids consist primarily of blue (1) and white (0) pixels.  The key seems to be a specific configuration of blue pixels. The output grids introduce red (2) pixels in a pattern related to the blue pixels in the input. The surrounding white pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_region
    type: connected_component
    color: blue (1)
    description: A contiguous region of blue pixels.

  - name: target_column
    type: column
    color: blue (1)
    description: A column within the blue_region that meets specific criteria.

  - name: red_region
    type: connected_component
    color: red (2)
    description: new area where red pixels are added

actions:
  - name: identify_target_column
    description: Find the leftmost column within the blue_region that has at least three consecutive blue pixels, including the "center" of the shape.
    parameters: []

  - name: create_red_region
    description:  Generate red pixels to the left of the identified target column, based on a pattern related to the blue pixels in the target column.
    parameters: []

relationships:
  - target_column is_part_of blue_region
  - red_region adjacent_to target_column
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the blue region:** Find all connected areas of blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Find the target column:** Within the blue region, locate the *leftmost* column that has at least three consecutive blue pixels, *and* is the "center" of the overall shape. This definition of "center" needs clarifying, but will be determined by observing the y-coordinates of the contiguous vertical group.
3.  **Create the red region:**
    *   Iterate through the rows of the target column.
    *   If a blue pixel is found at the start (left-side) of a series of 3 or more contiguous blue pixels (horizontal or vertical), replace pixels to its left with red (2) pixels according to these rules:
        *   If the blue pixel is part of a vertical run of at least 3 blue pixels, paint cells red to its left.
        *   If there is one non-white pixel immediately to the left of a blue pixel, make that non-white pixel red, and any non-white pixels to *its* left.
        *   The red fill extends up to 3 cells, including the replaced non-white pixel.
4.  **Preserve other pixels:** All white (0) pixels that are not part of the identified blue region, or to the left of the blue region as per the prior rule, remain unchanged.

**Clarifications & Notes:**
*  the definition "center" of the shape is crucial. The current understanding from the examples indicates the target columns are: example 1 - column 5; example 2 - column 4; example 3 - column 4. It appears to locate the vertical blue group that is furthest to the left, *and* contains at least 3 consecutive vertical pixels.
*   The red (2) pixels are always placed to the *left* of the identified target column, effectively replacing some of the white pixels.
* If a blue pixel *starts* a series of blue pixels to the left, those left pixels are the ones replaced by red.
