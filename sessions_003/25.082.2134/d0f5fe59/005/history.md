Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to extract the longest diagonal of azure (8) pixels starting from the top-leftmost azure pixel. However, the test results reveal inconsistencies in selecting the correct diagonal and determining the output grid size. The code sometimes picks a shorter diagonal or incorrectly calculates the size of the output grid. The strategy to resolve this is to:

1.  **Improve Diagonal Selection:** Refine the logic for selecting the *correct* diagonal. The current implementation prioritizes the top-leftmost starting point, which is a good start. However the definition of the diagonal can cause issues. We need to reconsider the direction.
2.  **Correct Output Size:** Ensure the output grid's dimensions are correctly derived from the selected diagonal's length.

**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using code execution where necessary):**

Let's examine the diagonals more closely in each example.

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** The code correctly identifies the top-leftmost diagonal starting at (1,2). The expected output is 4x4, but the selected diagonal is of length 2, making the program select 2x2. The correct diagonal should be (3,1),(4,2) of len 2.
*   **Example 2:** The code identifies the top-leftmost diagonal, correctly, at position (1,3). However, it's only length 1. The program should create 3x3 grid.
*   **Example 3:** The code *correctly* chooses the longest diagonal that starts at the top-left azure pixel, starting from cell (2,2) and has a length of 3. The program generates a 3x3 grid.

The issue arises because the definition used by `find_azure_diagonals` includes any diagonal. We want only diagonals going from top-left to bottom-right, at a consistent 45 degree angle.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find all azure diagonals:** Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous sequences of azure (8) pixels that form a diagonal line going from the top-left to the bottom-right. A valid diagonal must have a consistent slope (row increment equals column increment).
2.  **Select Target Diagonal:** From the identified diagonals, choose the one that starts at the top-leftmost azure pixel. If multiple diagonals share the same top-leftmost starting pixel, select the longest one.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a square output grid where the side length equals the length of the selected diagonal.
4.  **Populate Output:** Place azure pixels along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) of the output grid. Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with white (0).
