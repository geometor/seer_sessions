            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to extract the longest diagonal of azure (8) pixels starting from the top-leftmost azure pixel. However, the test results reveal inconsistencies in selecting the correct diagonal and determining the output grid size. The code sometimes picks a shorter diagonal or incorrectly calculates the size of the output grid. The strategy to resolve this is to:\n\n1.  **Improve Diagonal Selection:** Refine the logic for selecting the *correct* diagonal. The current implementation prioritizes the top-leftmost starting point, which is a good start. However the definition of the diagonal can cause issues. We need to reconsider the direction.\n2.  **Correct Output Size:** Ensure the output grid's dimensions are correctly derived from the selected diagonal's length.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using code execution where necessary):**\n\nLet's examine the diagonals more closely in each example.\n\n"

The correct diagonal should be (3,1),(4,2) of len 2.\n*   **Example 2:** The code identifies the top-leftmost diagonal, correctly, at position (1,3). However, it's only length 1. The program should create 3x3 grid.\n*   **Example 3:** The code *correctly* chooses the longest diagonal that starts at the top-left azure pixel, starting from cell (2,2) and has a length of 3. The program generates a 3x3 grid.\n\nThe issue arises because the definition used by `find_azure_diagonals` includes any diagonal.
