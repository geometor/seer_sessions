            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focused on extracting a diagonal of azure (8) pixels and creating a square output grid. However, it seems the logic for identifying the \"correct\" diagonal is flawed. The code attempts to find the longest diagonal containing azure pixels, starting from the top-left and extending in both row and column directions. This doesn't align with the expected outputs, which seem to pick specific diagonals, not necessarily the *longest*. All test cases failed. The size is always incorrect.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Diagonal Selection:** Instead of simply finding the longest diagonal, we need to determine the rule for *which* diagonal is selected in each example. It is not necessarily the longest. We should assume it might be related to the structure, position relative to other objects, or a different property of the diagonal.\n2.  **Consider Object Interactions:** The current code only considers azure pixels. We need to consider if other colors/objects in the input influence the diagonal choice.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll likely need to adjust our understanding and code multiple times, examining the input/output pairs closely.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's use a code cell to create a visualization of the differences. We'll compare the input, expected output, and the current transformed output. This time we'll build a function to compute the size and location of the output diagonal.\n\n"
