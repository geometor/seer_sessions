examples:
  - example_1:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: azure (8)
            shape: diagonal line segments
            positions:  Multiple diagonal segments are present.
          - color: white (0)
            shape: background
            positions: Fills the rest of the grid.
        transformations:
          - Selects a specific azure diagonal segment:  Starts at (2,2) and ends at (3,3) in the original, which appears as the longest consecutive sequence on the true diagonal.
            output_shape: square grid
            output_size: 4x4, determined by the length of the selected diagonal sequence,
             which is continuous and complete on the main diagonal from topleft to bottom right
  - example_2:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: azure (8)
            shape: diagonal line segments
            positions: Multiple diagonal segments, some interrupted.
          - color: white (0)
            shape: background
            positions: Fills the rest of the grid.
        transformations:
           - Selects specific diagonal azure segment: Starts at 2,2 and ends at 4,4 in input.
             output_shape: square grid.
             output_size: 3x3, corresponding to the longest complete sequence of azure on the main diagonal.
  - example_3:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: azure (8)
            shape: diagonal line segments
            positions: Multiple segments, with varied lengths and starting points.
          - color: white (0)
            shape: background
            positions: Fills the rest of the grid.
        transformations:
          - Select specific azure diagonal segment: Starts at 2,2 and ends at 3,3.
            output_shape: square grid
            output_size: 2x2, corresponding to the longest continuous azure diagonal from top-left.
