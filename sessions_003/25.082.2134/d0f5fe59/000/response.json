The diagonal appears to be taken from the top-left to the bottom-right. The background is consistently white (color 0). The size of the output grid seems to be determined by the number of azure pixels along the diagonal. Irrelevant azure pixels not part of main diagonal are ignored.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ignore all of the other pixels.\n2.  **Determine Output Size:** Count the number of azure pixels in the identified diagonal. This count determines the dimensions of the square output grid (e.g., if there are 3 azure pixels, the output grid is 3x3).\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new square grid filled with white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Place Diagonal:** Place the extracted azure pixels along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) of the output grid.\n\nEssentially, the program extracts the \"main\" top-left to bottom-right azure diagonal, counts its length, and uses that diagonal as the diagonal of a new, smaller, square grid.\n"
