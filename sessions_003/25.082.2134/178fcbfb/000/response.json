Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** The input grids seem to contain single instances of different colors (represented by numbers) scattered within a background of black (0). The colored pixels appear to be sparsely distributed.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids show a pattern where:\n    *   One of the colors in the input grid becomes repeated in the output. All the locations of this color are replaced down.\n    *   The other colors are formed as full horizontal lines filling the width of the grid. These lines appear to be positioned relative to their original position in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The chosen row index should be equal to the row index where each 'other color' first appears.\n\nIn summary, the transformation seems to find the lowest color, make copies of it, and create full-width lines for all the others at their original locations.\n"
