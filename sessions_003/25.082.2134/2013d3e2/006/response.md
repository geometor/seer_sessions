Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying active rows, extracting sequences, and constructing an output grid. However, the discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs in both examples highlight key areas for improvement:

1.  **Incorrect Sequence Extraction:** The code extracts up to three non-zero pixels *from the beginning of the row*. It doesn't correctly handle the requirement of starting the extraction from the *leftmost* non-zero pixel and then taking up to three values.
2. **Incorrect Row Selection**: the rows are not selected based on the leftmost non-zero sequence, rather all non-zero values.

The strategy to address these issues involves:

1.  **Refine Sequence Extraction:** Modify the `extract_leftmost_sequence` function to correctly identify the starting index (leftmost non-zero pixel) and extract the sequence from that point.
2.  **Modify row selection logic**: we should select only unique rows that have unique leftmost non-zero sequences.

**Metrics and Observations**
Here's how to use code to collect some metrics.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)

    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    expected_shape = expected_output.shape
    transformed_shape = transformed_output.shape

    input_non_zero_count = np.count_nonzero(input_grid)
    expected_non_zero_count = np.count_nonzero(expected_output)
    transformed_non_zero_count = np.count_nonzero(transformed_output)

    print(f"Input Shape: {input_shape}, Non-zero Count: {input_non_zero_count}")
    print(f"Expected Shape: {expected_shape}, Non-zero Count: {expected_non_zero_count}")
    print(f"Transformed Shape: {transformed_shape}, Non-zero Count: {transformed_non_zero_count}")
    print("---")

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - rows: list of lists, each representing a horizontal row.
      - columns: list of lists, each representing a vertical column (derived).
      - pixels: individual elements within the grid, each with a color value (0-9).
      - active_rows: rows containing at least one non-zero pixel.
      - leftmost_non_zero_pixel: The first non-zero pixel encountered when traversing a row from left to right.

actions:
  - name: identify_active_rows
    description: Determines which rows in the grid contain at least one non-zero pixel.
  - name: extract_sequence
    description: Extracts a sequence of up to three non-zero pixels from a row, starting from the leftmost non-zero pixel.
  - name: select_rows
    description: Selects the first three unique rows by leftmost non-zero sequence.
  - name: construct_output
    description: Creates a new grid containing the extracted sequences.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Active Rows:** Examine the input grid to identify rows that contain at least one non-zero pixel. These are the "active rows."

2.  **Select Rows by Leftmost Sequence:**
     *   Iterate through the active rows.
     * For each row, find the index of the *leftmost* non-zero pixel.
     *   Extract the sequence starting at that index, including up to the first three non-zero pixels.
     *   select up to 3 rows that have unique leftmost non-zero sequences.

3.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   Create a new output grid. The number of rows in the output grid will be the number of selected active rows (up to 3).
    *   Populate each row of the output grid with the extracted sequence from the corresponding selected row. If a sequence has fewer than three pixels, the remaining cells in the output row should remain 0.
    *   The output grid will have at most 3 rows, if no active rows or no unique rows, the grid will be empty.
