            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying active rows, extracting sequences, and constructing an output grid. However, the discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs in both examples highlight key areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Sequence Extraction:** The code extracts up to three non-zero pixels *from the beginning of the row*. It doesn't correctly handle the requirement of starting the extraction from the *leftmost* non-zero pixel and then taking up to three values.\n2. **Incorrect Row Selection**: the rows are not selected based on the leftmost non-zero sequence, rather all non-zero values.\n\nThe strategy to address these issues involves:\n\n1.  **Refine Sequence Extraction:** Modify the `extract_leftmost_sequence` function to correctly identify the starting index (leftmost non-zero pixel) and extract the sequence from that point.\n2.  **Modify row selection logic**: we should select only unique rows that have unique leftmost non-zero sequences.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\nHere's how to use code to collect some metrics.\n\n"
