            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on extracting the leftmost non-zero pixel from each row containing non-zero pixels. This works partially, as the code gets the correct colors (pixels). However, it fails in two ways:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Output Shape**: It reshapes the output to be 3 columns wide, rather than maintaining the correct spatial arrangement of the extracted pixels. Example 1 output is 3x2 and should be 3x3, but missing some of the information. Example 2 has other spatial issues that are not as clear.\n2.  **Incorrect Pixel Selection**: It only grabs *the* leftmost pixel. This needs to be expanded to keep going until 0, the boundary, or the end of the row is encountered.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  Refine the pixel selection logic to capture all pixels in the sequence starting at the left.\n2. Modify the output construction to build the 2d array in its proper shape, not a fixed width of 3.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nLet's calculate some additional metrics beyond what's already reported. Specifically, let's see a comparison of the input grid, expected output, and transformed output as numpy arrays. This may offer hints as to how they differ.\n\n"
