Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed updates to the natural language program and code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a single example, and it's clear it didn't capture the complete transformation rule. The core issue is that the code extracts *all* rows with non-zero pixels and creates an output row for *each* of them. The actual transformation, as seen in the expected outputs, seems to select a *subset* of these rows and often truncates them. It is also clear that a maximum of three rows are kept.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze Row Selection:** Determine the criteria for selecting which rows from the input contribute to the output. The current code assumes all non-zero rows are included, which is incorrect.
2.  **Analyze Sequence Length:** Determine the correct length of the extracted sequence. The provided solution stops when the encountered pixel is 0. This is not always correct
3. **Verify Assumptions with Metrics:** Use `tool_code` to generate data about row lengths, pixel values, and positions to confirm or refute any hypotheses about the selection and truncation rules.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the description to precisely reflect the observed selection and sequence extraction rules.
5. **Maximum of three rows:** the correct result always has a maximum of three rows.

**Gathering Metrics (using tool_code)**

I'll use `tool_code` to get some specific metrics about the input and expected output grids. This will help clarify the row selection and sequence truncation logic.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Active Rows:** Examine the input grid and identify all rows containing at least one non-zero pixel.
2. **Select Rows:** From the active rows, choose up to first three unique rows to include for the output by selecting rows that are unique when comparing leftmost sequence.
3.  **Extract Sequences:** For each selected row:
    *   Find the index of the leftmost non-zero pixel.
    *   Starting from this index, extract pixels up to the third non-zero value.
    *    If the row contains fewer than three, extract until the last non-zero value.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with a maximum of three rows. Populate each output row with the corresponding extracted sequence.

**Key Changes and Observations from Previous Attempt**

*   **Row Selection is NOT all non-zero rows:** The key error was assuming *all* rows with non-zero pixels contribute to the output. The updated program specifies selecting up to the first *three* unique rows.
* **Sequence Truncation:** It is important to only extract values up to the third non-zero value.
