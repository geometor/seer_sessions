Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on extracting the leftmost non-zero pixel from each row containing non-zero pixels. This works partially, as the code gets the correct colors (pixels). However, it fails in two ways:

1.  **Incorrect Output Shape**: It reshapes the output to be 3 columns wide, rather than maintaining the correct spatial arrangement of the extracted pixels. Example 1 output is 3x2 and should be 3x3, but missing some of the information. Example 2 has other spatial issues that are not as clear.
2.  **Incorrect Pixel Selection**: It only grabs *the* leftmost pixel. This needs to be expanded to keep going until 0, the boundary, or the end of the row is encountered.

The strategy is to:

1.  Refine the pixel selection logic to capture all pixels in the sequence starting at the left.
2. Modify the output construction to build the 2d array in its proper shape, not a fixed width of 3.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**

Let's calculate some additional metrics beyond what's already reported. Specifically, let's see a comparison of the input grid, expected output, and transformed output as numpy arrays. This may offer hints as to how they differ.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Active Rows:** Determine which rows in the input grid contain at least one non-zero pixel.
2.  **Iterate:** For each active row, starting from the top and proceeding downwards:
3. **Extract the Leftmost sequence:**
   - Find the leftmost non-zero pixel in the row.
   - Starting at the position of the leftmost non-zero pixel, extract all consecutive non-zero pixels to the right. Continue until a zero pixel or the end of the row is encountered.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a new output grid. Place each extracted sequence of pixels into the output grid as a sequence of horizontal pixels. Preserve the vertical order of the extracted sequences. The output grid's dimensions will be determined by the number of extracted sequences (rows) and length of the longest extracted sequence. If an extracted row has less than the max number of pixels in any row, then pad the end of the shorter rows with 0.

This description is much more precise about the *sequence* of pixels to be extracted, and how to build the output grid from the extracted values.
