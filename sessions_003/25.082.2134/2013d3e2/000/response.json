            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input is a 10x10 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), with a central cluster of non-zero pixels forming a distinct shape. The shape appears symmetrical.\n*   **Output:** The output is a smaller, rectangular grid (3x3 in the examples) containing a subset of the non-zero colors from the input. It seems to capture the \"upper-left corner\" of the shape formed by the non-zero pixels in the input, but it's more complex than a simple crop, and it doesn't preserve the original spatial distribution exactly. It seems to select one pixel from each row and maintains the spatial relationship across rows.\n* **Transformation:** A reduction or extraction process. The rule selects specific colored pixels from the input to create a condensed representation.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

These form the \"active region\".\n2.  **Iterate Top to Bottom Rows of active region:** consider each row of pixels, starting at the top of the active region, proceeding to the bottom.\n3.  **Extract Leftmost non-zero Pixel in Row:** find the first, leftmost, non-zero pixel and add it to a new row in the output\n4. **Output:** build up the rows in order, to produce the final output.\n\nIn summary, the transformation extracts the leftmost non-zero pixel from each row of the shape created by the non-zero pixels in the input.
