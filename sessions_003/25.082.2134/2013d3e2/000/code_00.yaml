facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents a 2D array of colors.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents a condensed representation of the input grid.
  - object: non_zero_pixels
    type: set
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Pixels within the input grid with values other than 0. Form a distinct shape.
  - relationship: extraction
    subject: output_grid
    object: input_grid
    description: The output grid is derived by extracting specific pixels from the input_grid.
  - observation: top_left_corner_selection:
    description: The non-zero pixels from output_grid are present in input_grid and appears to be derived by some rule, possibly from the "top-left" corner of the input_grid shape.
  - observation: spatial_relationship
    description: output grid maintains the spatial relationship of pixels across rows, taking one pixel from each row.
