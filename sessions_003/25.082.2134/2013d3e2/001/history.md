Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is a 10x10 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), with a central cluster of non-zero pixels forming a distinct shape. The shape appears symmetrical.
*   **Output:** The output is a smaller, rectangular grid (3x3 in the examples) containing a subset of the non-zero colors from the input. It seems to capture the "upper-left corner" of the shape formed by the non-zero pixels in the input, but it's more complex than a simple crop, and it doesn't preserve the original spatial distribution exactly. It seems to select one pixel from each row and maintains the spatial relationship across rows.
* **Transformation:** A reduction or extraction process. The rule selects specific colored pixels from the input to create a condensed representation.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents a 2D array of colors.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents a condensed representation of the input grid.
  - object: non_zero_pixels
    type: set
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Pixels within the input grid with values other than 0. Form a distinct shape.
  - relationship: extraction
    subject: output_grid
    object: input_grid
    description: The output grid is derived by extracting specific pixels from the input_grid.
  - observation: top_left_corner_selection:
    description: The non-zero pixels from output_grid are present in input_grid and appears to be derived by some rule, possibly from the "top-left" corner of the input_grid shape.
  - observation: spatial_relationship
    description: output grid maintains the spatial relationship of pixels across rows, taking one pixel from each row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0. These form the "active region".
2.  **Iterate Top to Bottom Rows of active region:** consider each row of pixels, starting at the top of the active region, proceeding to the bottom.
3.  **Extract Leftmost non-zero Pixel in Row:** find the first, leftmost, non-zero pixel and add it to a new row in the output
4. **Output:** build up the rows in order, to produce the final output.

In summary, the transformation extracts the leftmost non-zero pixel from each row of the shape created by the non-zero pixels in the input. The output grid's size will change based on how tall the shape is.
