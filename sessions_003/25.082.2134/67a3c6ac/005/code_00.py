The transformation involves modifying the columns of the input grid, not just
reordering them.  The exact nature of the modification is not yet fully
understood, but it's clear that the output columns are not simply permuted
input columns.  The previous assumption of a simple column sort based on a key
is incorrect. The transformation likely involves element-wise changes within
each column.
