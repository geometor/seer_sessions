The provided examples show discrepancies, indicating that the sorting criteria or the handling of ties needs adjustment. The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examining each input-output pair, including the incorrect transformed outputs, to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails.\n2.  **Refined Sorting Criteria:** Determining the precise rule for ordering columns, going beyond just the last element. It seems like some combination of elements within the column determines the sorting, potentially involving multiple rows or a more complex comparison function.\n3.  **Tie Handling:** Observing how columns with similar characteristics are ordered relative to each other. It seems important that the original relative order for ties should be preserved.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nSince the provided information does not contain the input/output grids as lists. I cannot use the `tool_code` environment and will work with provided images.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
