The transformation appears to reorder the columns of the input grid to produce the output grid. The colors themselves don't seem to change; it's their positions that are altered.  The height and width of the grid remain constant across input and output. The crucial element is to identify how the order of columns is decided.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"

Let's analyze the column transformations more closely to infer the sorting rule. The program is likely to be quite simple, not involving complex image processing. It looks like a simple rule, based on the sorting of information in the columns.\n\n*   **Example 1**:\n    *   Input columns: `[6, 6, 7, 1]`, `[6, 1, 2, 7]`, `[6, 6, 7, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2]`\n    *   Output columns: `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, `[6, 6, 7, 1]`, `[6, 1, 2, 7]`, `[6, 6, 7, 2]`\n    * it appears the columns are sorted by their last element.\n\n*   **Example 2**:\n    * The last element sorting is also consisten with this example\n\n*   **Example 3**:\n    * The last element sorting is also consisten with this example\n\n**Final natural language program, refined:**\n\n1.  **Observe**: Treat the input as a collection of columns.\n2.  **Sort**: Sort the columns of the input grid in ascending order based on the value of the *last* element in each column. If two columns have the same last element, maintain their relative order from the input.\n3.  **Construct Output**: Create the output grid by placing the sorted columns side by side.\n\n"
