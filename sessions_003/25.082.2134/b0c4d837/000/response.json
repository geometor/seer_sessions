The primary colors involved seem to be black (0), gray (5), and azure (8). The input grids consistently have a pattern: a border of black (0) pixels, then a border of gray (5) pixels, and azure (8) pixels inside of the gray. The remaining of the grids are all black (0). The output grid seems to be a smaller, condensed representation derived from the inner azure region of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This region is enclosed by a border of gray (5) pixels, which is itself enclosed by a border of black (0) pixels.\n2.  **Extract Top-Left Azure:** Get the azure pixels that form from left to right, from top to bottom.\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.\n4.  **Populate Output Grid:** Place the extracted azure pixels into the top-left of the output grid.\n5.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with black (0) pixels.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies the inner \"azure\" object, extracts a particular portion of it relative to its top-left corner, and places this portion within a fixed-size (3x3) output grid, padding the rest with black.\n"
