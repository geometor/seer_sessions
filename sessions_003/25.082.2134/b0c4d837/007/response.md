1.  **Locate Azure Region:** Examine the input grid and identify the contiguous region of azure (8) pixels.

2.  **Select Consecutive Azure Pixels:** Starting from the top-left of the azure region and moving row-wise (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), select consecutive azure pixels. Select at most three azure pixels. If a non-azure pixel is encountered before three azure pixels are selected, stop the selection. If the azure region contains fewer than three total azure pixels, select all of the azure pixels.

3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled entirely with black (0) pixels.

4.  **Populate Output:** Place the selected azure pixels into the first row of the output grid, starting from the leftmost cell. If *n* azure pixels were selected, fill *n* cells in the first row of the output grid.

5. **Pad output:** fill the remaining cells in the output grid with black (0).

6.  **Return:** Return the 3x3 output grid.
