    description: >
      For pixels in the first row, create a diagonal shadow pattern.
      The shadow extends downwards and leftwards,
      starting one row below and one column to the left
      of the origin. The shadow is composed of objects with the same color of
      the origin object. The pattern repeats every two rows.
