            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies between the transformed outputs and expected outputs:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly copied the non-black pixels, the logic for adding pixels below and to the left was flawed. It didn't account for the repeating pattern extending beyond just one additional row. The pattern appears to create a diagonal \"shadow\" of the original pixels, extending downwards and leftwards. The current code stops after adding just one level of this \"shadow\".\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Pattern:** Carefully re-examine the input/output pairs to precisely define the transformation rule. We need to quantify the \"shadow\" effect: how many rows down does it extend, and what's the relationship between the original pixel and its \"shadow\" pixels?\n\n2.  **Metrics Gathering**: Calculate the extent of the expansion to understand the pattern of the new object creation, specifically looking at how each seed object creates the diagonal set of additional objects.\n\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the pattern analysis, update the description to accurately capture the full transformation.\n\n4.  **Modify the Code:** Revise the Python code to implement the refined natural language program. This will likely involve nested loops or a recursive function to generate the full \"shadow.\"\n\n**Metrics Gathering (via Observation):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Two non-black pixels: 2 (at 0,1) and 8 (at 0,5).\n    *   Expected Output: \"Shadows\" extend two rows down. For pixel 2, the shadow includes (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1) and repeats to row 5. The same for pixel 8.\n    *   Transformed output has one repetition and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: One non-black pixel: 4 (at 0,1).\n    *   Expected Output: \"Shadow\" extends two rows down. For pixel 4, the shadow includes (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1) and repeats to row 5.\n    *   Transformed output has one repetition and is incorrect.\n\nIt seems there's a consistent pattern: for every non-black pixel in the top row, a \"shadow\" pattern extends diagonally downwards and to the left, *repeating every two rows*.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n"
