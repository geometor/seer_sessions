1.  **Copy:** Iterate through all pixels in the input grid. Copy any non-black pixel to the output grid at the same position.

2.  **Shadow Generation (Top Row Only):** For each non-black pixel *in the top row* of the input grid:

    *   Create a "shadow" by repeating a 2x2 diagonal extending every two rows downwards and one column to the left:
    * calculate the number of shadow repetitions by dividing the number of
      rows by 2
    *    For each repetition:
        *   Add a pixel of the same color one row below the origin, one column to the left.
        *   Add a pixel of the same color one row below the origin, at the original column.

3.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the original non-black pixels plus the generated shadows.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example and only partially correct. The core idea of copying non-black pixels and creating a "shadow" is valid. However, the shadow generation logic is flawed. It incorrectly repeats the shadow pixels in *every* subsequent row instead of alternating every two rows, and it places two shadow pixels instead of the correct diagonal pattern. The second example further highlights this error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the differences between the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` for both examples. Focus on the positioning and repetition of the shadow pixels.
2.  **Refine Shadow Logic:** Correct the shadow generation algorithm to accurately reflect the observed pattern:
    *   Shadows extend diagonally downwards and to the left.
    *   Shadows are created in a 2x2 pattern down and to the left
    *   Shadows repeat on every other row.
3. **Update Natural Language Program** Rewrite the natural language program to provide accurate directions

**Metrics and Observations (using python code):**

Since I don't need calculations at the moment, I will skip using the code execution tool. Let us first list down the observations for each case:

**Example 1:**

*   Input has two non-black pixels on the top row (2 and 8).
*   Expected Output shows a diagonal shadow pattern:
    *   For '2': (1,0), (2,1) then (3,0), (4,1), then (5,0)
    *   For '8': (1,4), (2,5), then (3,4), (4,5), then(5,4)
*   Transformed Output incorrectly repeats shadow pixels in every row and adds them to the same column

**Example 2:**

*   Input has one non-black pixel (4) on the top row.
*   Expected Output shows the same diagonal shadow pattern as in Example 1.
*   Transformed Output has the same error as in Example 1.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: non-black_pixel
    properties:
      - color: varies (2, 8, 4 in the examples)
      - location: top_row (initial)
    actions:
      - copy: to_output_grid (same position)
      - create_shadow: diagonal_down_left

  - object: shadow_pixel
    properties:
      - color: same_as_origin
      - location: calculated (relative to origin)
    actions: []

  - relation: shadow_pattern
    properties:
      - direction: diagonal_down_left
      - repetition: every_other_row
      - shape: 2x2 block starting one row down and one col left
    related_objects: [non-black_pixel, shadow_pixel]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy:** Copy all non-black pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their original positions.

2.  **Shadow Generation (Top Row):** For each non-black pixel in the *top row* of the input grid:
    * Determine the pixel's color.
    * Calculate the number of shadow repetitions by integer dividing the number of rows in the grid by 2.
     - Start one row below and one col to the left
        *   Create a shadow pixel of the same color.
     - Move to the cell to the right
        * create a shadow pixel of the same color
    *   Repeat for the number of repetitions, starting the next block 2 rows down from the previous block.

3.  **Output:** The output grid is the combination of copied non-black pixels and the generated shadow pixels.
