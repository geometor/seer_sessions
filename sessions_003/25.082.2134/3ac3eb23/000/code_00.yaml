objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rectangular
      - cells: contain integer values representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid

actions:
  - name: add_pixels
    description: New pixels are added to the output grid.
    parameters:
      - color: The color of the added pixel is the color of the source.
      - position: relative to the source pixel in the input, with constraints on placement.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Output pixels are placed adjacent to and dependent on input pixels. There seems to exist a sort of "reflection" or "copying" of colored pixels.
  - type: color_based
    description:  The color of input pixels determines the action. Black (0) pixels are potentially ignored.
