The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid. The key change seems to be the addition of new colored pixels *around* the original colored pixels, and a particular pattern and constraints may exist that determines exactly how to insert the pixels in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
