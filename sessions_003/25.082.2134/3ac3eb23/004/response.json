            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and only partially correct. The core idea of copying non-black pixels and creating a \"shadow\" is valid. However, the shadow generation logic is flawed. It incorrectly repeats the shadow pixels in *every* subsequent row instead of alternating every two rows, and it places two shadow pixels instead of the correct diagonal pattern. The second example further highlights this error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the differences between the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` for both examples. Focus on the positioning and repetition of the shadow pixels.\n2.  **Refine Shadow Logic:** Correct the shadow generation algorithm to accurately reflect the observed pattern:\n    *   Shadows extend diagonally downwards and to the left.\n    *   Shadows are created in a 2x2 pattern down and to the left\n    *   Shadows repeat on every other row.\n3. **Update Natural Language Program** Rewrite the natural language program to provide accurate directions\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using python code):**\n\nSince I don't need calculations at the moment, I will skip using the code execution tool. Let us first list down the observations for each case:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input has two non-black pixels on the top row (2 and 8).\n*   Expected Output shows a diagonal shadow pattern:\n    *   For '2': (1,0), (2,1) then (3,0), (4,1), then (5,0)\n    *   For '8': (1,4), (2,5), then (3,4), (4,5), then(5,4)\n*   Transformed Output incorrectly repeats shadow pixels in every row and adds them to the same column\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input has one non-black pixel (4) on the top row.\n*   Expected Output shows the same diagonal shadow pattern as in Example 1.\n*   Transformed Output has the same error as in Example 1.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
