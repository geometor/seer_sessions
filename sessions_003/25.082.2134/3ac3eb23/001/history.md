Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where most cells are black (0) and a few cells have other colors. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid. The key change seems to be the addition of new colored pixels *around* the original colored pixels, and a particular pattern and constraints may exist that determines exactly how to insert the pixels in the output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rectangular
      - cells: contain integer values representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid

actions:
  - name: add_pixels
    description: New pixels are added to the output grid.
    parameters:
      - color: The color of the added pixel is the color of the source.
      - position: relative to the source pixel in the input, with constraints on placement.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Output pixels are placed adjacent to and dependent on input pixels. There seems to exist a sort of "reflection" or "copying" of colored pixels.
  - type: color_based
    description:  The color of input pixels determines the action. Black (0) pixels are potentially ignored.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Ignore** black (0) pixels.
3.  For each non-black pixel in the input grid:
    *   **Copy** the pixel to the output grid at the same location.
    *   If the input pixel is in the top row of the input, add a pixel of same color one below.
    *   If the input pixel is in other rows:
        *   Add a pixel with the same color to the output grid, one row below the current pixel's position, same column
        *   Add a pixel with same color to the outgrid, to the left of the previous pixel we added.
        *   Add a pixel with the same color to the outputgrid one row below the input pixel, two column to the left from the input.
4. **Return** the resulting output grid.

Essentially, the non-black input pixels are "extended" downwards, creating a duplicate of the input pixel one position below, and one more duplicate pixel to the left of the first added duplicate.
