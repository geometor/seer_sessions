The primary color observed is green (3) and white (0), and in the output, azure (8). The transformation seems to involve a spatial relationship or mirroring of the green (3) pixels, with azure (8) pixels appearing in the output grid. The size of the grid remains constant.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Visualize the diagonal axis running from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom left.\n\n3.  **Transform by mirroring.** For each green pixel, mirror its position across *both* diagonal axes.\n\n4.  **Populate Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input. If a location has the green color, check it's mirrored location.\n\n5.  **Replace** In the locations across the mirrored axes, place an azure (8) pixel. Green pixels from input are kept. All other cells remain white.\n\nKey Observations and Considerations:\n\n*   **Diagonal Mirroring:** The transformation appears to consistently involve a diagonal mirroring operation relative to the position of the green pixels.\n\n*   **Two Diagonals:** It is across both main diagonals.\n*   **Color Change:** Green pixels seem to \"trigger\" the appearance of azure pixels at the mirrored positions. The original green remains.\n*   **Whitespace Preservation:** White (0) pixels remain unchanged in areas not affected by the mirroring.\n\nThe program assumes there is a symmetrical relationship.\n\n"
