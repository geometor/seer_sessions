Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary color observed is green (3) and white (0), and in the output, azure (8). The transformation seems to involve a spatial relationship or mirroring of the green (3) pixels, with azure (8) pixels appearing in the output grid. The size of the grid remains constant.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 10
      columns: 10
      elements: integers (0-9)
      persistent: true # The grid itself persists through the transformation

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - green (3)
        - azure (8)
      position: (row, column)
      groupable: true  # Pixels of the same color can form an object

actions:
  - type: mirroring
    properties:
      axis: diagonal #or combination, needs verification
      agent: green pixels #hypothesis, will verify
      result: appearance of azure pixels

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Green pixels are mirrored diagonally, resulting in azure pixels in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all green (3) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Mirror** Locate the diagonal axis. Visualize the diagonal axis running from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom left.

3.  **Transform by mirroring.** For each green pixel, mirror its position across *both* diagonal axes.

4.  **Populate Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input. If a location has the green color, check it's mirrored location.

5.  **Replace** In the locations across the mirrored axes, place an azure (8) pixel. Green pixels from input are kept. All other cells remain white.

Key Observations and Considerations:

*   **Diagonal Mirroring:** The transformation appears to consistently involve a diagonal mirroring operation relative to the position of the green pixels.

*   **Two Diagonals:** It is across both main diagonals.
*   **Color Change:** Green pixels seem to "trigger" the appearance of azure pixels at the mirrored positions. The original green remains.
*   **Whitespace Preservation:** White (0) pixels remain unchanged in areas not affected by the mirroring.

The program assumes there is a symmetrical relationship.
