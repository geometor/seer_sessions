      Azure pixels are placed in locations related to the positions of green pixels.
      Specifically, it appears azure pixels form L shapes with the green blocks.
      The specific rule for placement depends on the shape and position of the green block.
      There are two 'L' shapes, and they are placed if a green block has 2 cells
      and they are diagonal to each other. The 'L' shapes have 2 azure cells.
      If the green block is a single cell, the azure cells form a cross.
