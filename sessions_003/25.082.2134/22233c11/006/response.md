Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code.

**General Assessment**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code have a fundamental flaw: the mirroring logic is not correctly applied, and it is dependent on the shape of the green block. The main and anti-diagonal mirroring are not independent operations; they depend on the initial placement of the green blocks and their shape. The initial code mirrors every green block, resulting in incorrect placements of azure pixels. The code also has minor implementation details, such as checking for valid coordinates and only changing pixels that are originally white.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors**

1.  **Re-examine Mirroring Logic:** The concept of "mirroring" needs to be clarified. It seems that "mirroring" here is not a simple reflection across diagonals but is related to finding specific corresponding coordinates based on the initial green cells.
2.  **Shape Dependent Logic:** We should recognize there are only specific shapes being created around the green and azure cells, and focus on developing that logic.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll adjust the natural language program and code based on discrepancies observed in *all* training examples, not just the first.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's examine the positioning of the azure (8) pixels relative to the green (3) pixels.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_positions(input_grid, output_grid):
    green_positions = np.argwhere(input_grid == 3)
    azure_positions = np.argwhere(output_grid == 8)
    print(f'{green_positions=}')
    print(f'{azure_positions=}')

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task: 22233c11
objects:
  - id: green_blocks
    color: 3 # green
    description: Contiguous blocks of green pixels
    behavior: Source for determining azure pixel positions.

  - id: azure_pixels
    color: 8  # azure
    description: Pixels placed based on green block positions.
    behavior:  Appear at specific locations relative to the green blocks.

rules:
  - description: |
      Azure pixels are placed in locations related to the positions of green pixels.
      Specifically, it appears azure pixels form L shapes with the green blocks.
      The specific rule for placement depends on the shape and position of the green block.
      There are two 'L' shapes, and they are placed if a green block has 2 cells
      and they are diagonal to each other. The 'L' shapes have 2 azure cells.
      If the green block is a single cell, the azure cells form a cross.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Green Blocks:** Find all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels.
2. **Determine Azure Placement Based on Green blocks:**
    - If there are two green pixels diagonal to each other: Place two azure (8) pixels to form a 2x3 or 3x2 L shape on either side of the diagonal. If the two green pixels form a 2x2 square, do not place any azure cells.
    - If there is only one green pixel: Place azure (8) pixels directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the single green pixel creating a cross shape.
3. **Output:** Return the resulting grid.
