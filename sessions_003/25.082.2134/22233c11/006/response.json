            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code have a fundamental flaw: the mirroring logic is not correctly applied, and it is dependent on the shape of the green block. The main and anti-diagonal mirroring are not independent operations; they depend on the initial placement of the green blocks and their shape. The initial code mirrors every green block, resulting in incorrect placements of azure pixels. The code also has minor implementation details, such as checking for valid coordinates and only changing pixels that are originally white.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Mirroring Logic:** The concept of \"mirroring\" needs to be clarified. It seems that \"mirroring\" here is not a simple reflection across diagonals but is related to finding specific corresponding coordinates based on the initial green cells.\n2.  **Shape Dependent Logic:** We should recognize there are only specific shapes being created around the green and azure cells, and focus on developing that logic.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll adjust the natural language program and code based on discrepancies observed in *all* training examples, not just the first.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's examine the positioning of the azure (8) pixels relative to the green (3) pixels.\n\n"
