Here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed natural language program update:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code attempted to mirror green pixels across both diagonals and place azure pixels at the mirrored locations. However, the results show discrepancies in all three examples. The core issue seems to be an incorrect understanding of *where* and *when* to place the azure pixels. The mirroring logic isn't consistently applied, and additional conditions for placing azure pixels need to be clarified based on *all* examples, not just the first. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Re-examining the Mirroring:** Carefully analyze how green pixels relate to azure pixels in *all* examples, not just the first.
2.  **Conditionality:** Determine the precise conditions (beyond just mirroring) that dictate azure pixel placement. It appears white space is very important.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated logic against all examples after each modification.

**Gather Metrics:**

I will use manual analysis and visual inspection of the provided images to determine object properties, as code execution won't be directly applicable here.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Green pixels at (3,2), (4,3), (6,7), (7,6).
    *   Azure pixels are expected at the mirrored positions, and some exist, but others are missing and in the wrong place.
    *   Expected azure: (2,3), (3,2) correct. (7,6), (6,7) correct. Others incorrect.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Green pixels form a 2x2 block at (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4) and a 2x2 block at (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2)
    *   Azure pixels form a 2x2 block at (1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6) and a 2 x 2 block at (7,3), (7,4), (8,3), (8,4). Note that these blocks of azure pixels are "mirrored across the diagonals" of the green pixel blocks.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Green pixels at (3,3) and (4,4)
    *   Azure pixel is at (5,2) and (2,5). This seems like correct mirroring.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: green_pixel
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      shape: single cell
      behavior: sources for mirroring
  - object: azure_pixel
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: single cell
      behavior: placed at mirrored positions of green pixels, *only* in originally white cells

  - observation: green_blocks
    description: Green pixels can form contiguous blocks
  - observation: azure_blocks
    description: Azure pixels form blocks mirrored across the diagonals of green blocks
  - observation: empty_space_constraint
    description: Azure pixels are placed in locations that are originally white.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Blocks:** Find all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2. **Mirror blocks:** For each block of green pixels, calculate the position of the "mirrored" block. Mirror the block across the main diagonal (y=x) and across the anti-diagonal (y = -x + (number of rows) - 1)
3.  **Place Azure Pixels, checking first for empty space:** For each mirrored block location from step 2: If the corresponding cell in the mirrored position is white (0), change that cell to azure (8). If not white, do *not* change it.
4. Leave all the original green pixels unchanged.
