            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to mirror green (3) blocks across both the main and anti-diagonals, replacing white (0) pixels with azure (8) pixels in the mirrored locations. The results show that this transformation rule is only partially correct. While the idea of mirroring is present in the examples, the current implementation has errors in the mirroring logic and placement of azure pixels. Specifically, it appears the mirroring is not always correctly calculated, and placement is not always happening the expected output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Verify Mirroring Logic:** We need to carefully re-examine the `mirror_block` function. It's crucial to ensure that the main diagonal (y=x) and anti-diagonal (y=-x+rows-1) mirroring calculations are flawless. We can use simpler examples to test this function in isolation.\n2. **Placement Conditions:** Review examples carefully, the placement is not just about mirroring. There may be extra constraints about how to place the resulting colors that must be taken into account, e.g. only placing azure on originally-white.\n3. **Object Identification:** Precisely define what constitutes an \"object\" in each case. In the current code objects are green blocks, we should verify and document this precisely.\n4. **Iterative Refinement:** Test the corrected code after each change, starting with single pixel mirroring and progressively working towards mirroring entire blocks.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Reports**\n\nHere's where I'll analyze the provided examples, expected outputs, and transformed outputs, and report on properties and actions performed:\n\nExample 1:\n*   Input has two 1x1 green blocks at (3,2) and (4,3) and (6,7), (7,6).\n*   Expected output has azure at (2,3), (3,4), (7,6),(6,7).\n*   It seems only diagonal and anti-diagonal of where green cells presents are transformed.\n\nExample 2:\n*   Input has a 2x2 green block.\n*   Expected output has two 2x2 azure blocks, one that is the main diagonal mirror of the green block, and another that is the anti-diagonal mirror.\n*   Original Green cells location remains unchanged.\n\nExample 3:\n\n*   Input grid contains two single green pixels at (3, 3) and (4, 4).\n*   Expected Output has azure pixels at (2,5) and (5,2)\n*    It seems only diagonal and anti-diagonal of where green cells presents are transformed.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

If the mirrored location in the original grid was white (0), place an azure (8) pixel at that location in the output grid.\n    *   Mirror the block across the anti-diagonal (y = -x + rows - 1, where 'rows' is the number of rows in the grid). If the mirrored location in the original grid was white (0), place an azure (8) pixel at that location in the output grid.\n3. **Preserve Originals** Ensure that the location of green cells are kept intact.\n\nThis natural language program accurately describes the transformation. The key improvements are: explicitly stating the mirroring rules and clarifying the conditional placement of azure pixels. The provided examples, outputs and code were all considered in crafting this.\n"
