However, the results show discrepancies in all three examples. The core issue seems to be an incorrect understanding of *where* and *when* to place the azure pixels. The mirroring logic isn't consistently applied, and additional conditions for placing azure pixels need to be clarified based on *all* examples, not just the first. The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Re-examining the Mirroring:** Carefully analyze how green pixels relate to azure pixels in *all* examples, not just the first.\n2.  **Conditionality:** Determine the precise conditions (beyond just mirroring) that dictate azure pixel placement. It appears white space is very important.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated logic against all examples after each modification.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI will use manual analysis and visual inspection of the provided images to determine object properties, as code execution won't be directly applicable here.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Green pixels at (3,2), (4,3), (6,7), (7,6).\n    *   Azure pixels are expected at the mirrored positions, and some exist, but others are missing and in the wrong place.\n    *   Expected azure: (2,3), (3,2) correct. (7,6), (6,7) correct. Others incorrect.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Green pixels form a 2x2 block at (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4) and a 2x2 block at (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,2)\n    *   Azure pixels form a 2x2 block at (1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6) and a 2 x 2 block at (7,3), (7,4), (8,3), (8,4). Note that these blocks of azure pixels are \"mirrored across the diagonals\" of the green pixel blocks.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Green pixels at (3,3) and (4,4)\n    *   Azure pixel is at (5,2) and (2,5). This seems like correct mirroring.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
