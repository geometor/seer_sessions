The core operation seems to be a kind of \"color substitution\" or \"recoloring\" based on specific rules. The transformation isn't simply copying the input; certain colors in the input are replaced with other colors in the output, and this replacement is conditional on the spatial arrangement. Specifically, isolated single-pixel colors along the top row of the input grid seem to \"seed\" or determine the replacement colors. Large blocks of colors within the main body are replaced, but by what rule? Comparing the input and output, it becomes clear, colors are replaced based on what is in the first row.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"
