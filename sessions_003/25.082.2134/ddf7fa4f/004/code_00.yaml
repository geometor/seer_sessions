objects:
  - name: seed_pixels
    description: Pixels in the first row that are not background (0).
    properties:
      color: The color value of the seed pixel.
      column: The column index of the seed pixel.

  - name: contiguous_blocks
    description: Vertical sequences of pixels in a column, starting from a seed pixel, that are either gray (5) or need to be replaced.
    properties:
      start_row: The row index where the block starts (usually 1, immediately below the seed).
      end_row: The row index where the block ends (determined by a non-gray, non-background pixel or the grid boundary).
      column: The column index of the block.
      seed_color: The color value of the seed pixel governing this block.

actions:
  - name: propagate_color
    description:  Replace pixels within a contiguous block with the seed color.
    parameters:
      block: The contiguous_block object to be modified.
    constraints:
      - Stop propagation when encountering a non-gray (value other than 5) pixel.
      - Stop propagation at the bottom edge of the grid.
