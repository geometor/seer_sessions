Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of drawing horizontal and vertical lines based on non-zero sequences clearly isn't capturing the full complexity of the transformations. The code is producing significantly different outputs from the expected ones, indicated by the high `pixels_off` count and `match: False` in all examples. The color palettes and pixel counts are not always correct either. The sizes sometimes match. The current strategy fails to account for the diagonal, and seemingly mirrored, or more probably, *duplicated* aspects of the transformation. The calculated scale in the prior code is very inaccurate.

The core issue is that the transformation is not simply about drawing horizontal and vertical lines based on the presence of non-zero pixels. There's a more intricate spatial relationship and duplication/reflection/tiling pattern involved. It seems like parts of input get duplicated in output, and stretching/shrinking of object occurs.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Scaling:** The scaling logic is incorrect, output sizes do not depend on simple linear scale of the full grid. There must be independent scaling of different parts of input grid, or a more complex rule.
2.  **Focus on Objects/Shapes:** Instead of just looking at rows and columns independently, identify connected components (objects) within the input grid.
3.  **Analyze Spatial Relationships:** Determine how these objects are repositioned, resized, or duplicated in the output. Look for patterns of reflection, rotation, or translation of individual objects or groups of objects.
4. **Consider interactions:** Check for interactions between objects.

**Gather Metrics & Observations (using imagined tool outputs, since I don't have the execution environment here):**

Here's where I would use the code execution tool to get detailed information. Since I don't have the tool here, I will provide *example* outputs as if I had run the code. I will simulate data gathering.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all connected components (objects) in the input grid. An object is defined as a group of one or more adjacent pixels of the same non-zero color.
2.  **Object Transformations:**
    *   **Duplication and Resizing**: In the output, the objects are recreated and formed into 2xN rectangle where N depends on object position.
    *   **Elimination**: Some object can be completely removed.

3. **Output grid assembly** The duplicated and resized objects are placed on the output at specific coordinates. The placement follows a tiling/mirroring pattern.
4. **Object selection for processing**: not all objects are processed. Object with color 8 are consistently removed.
