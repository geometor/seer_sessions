Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements**

*   **Input Grids:** Relatively small, sparse grids with single-digit values (colors).  Many zeros (background color).  Non-zero values often appear in horizontal or vertical lines, sometimes isolated.
*   **Output Grids:** Larger than input grids, also sparse.  Seem to involve a replication or expansion of the input grid's non-zero values. The output grids have a "cross" shape of the input grids. The colors in the cross shape are replicated horizontally and vertically.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve identifying non-zero pixels in the input, and then expanding these into lines (both horizontal and vertical) in the output. The length of the expanded lines appears related to the overall size of the output grid. The output grid size is not directly proportional to the input grid size, but it consistently expands. The expansion seems to be symmetric, centered on the original pixel's location, creating a cross-like pattern for each original non-zero pixel.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are smaller than output grids.
  - observation: Non-zero values in input represent distinct colored objects.
  - observation: Zero value represents background.
  - action: Non-zero input pixels are expanded in the output.
  - property: Expansion is both horizontal and vertical.
  - property: Expansion creates a cross shape centered on the original pixel position.
  - property: Each input color has the same color in output cross
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are consistently larger than, but not directly proportional to, input grid dimensions.
  - observation: The colors of the input are maintained during the transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** Calculate the dimensions of the output grid. It seems as if the dimensions are the next odd number that can contain a horizontal and vertical cross of each color in the output.
2.  **Iterate Input Pixels:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   **Check for Non-Zero:** If the pixel is not zero (background):
        *   **Center Cross:** Determine the row and column in the output grid that corresponds to the "center" of the cross for this input pixel. This center will be the same row and column as original pixel, but adjusted for size.
        *   **Horizontal Expansion:** In the output grid, set the pixels in the same row as the center, from the start to the end, to the color of the input pixel.
        *   **Vertical Expansion:**  In the output grid, set the pixels in the same column as the center, from top to bottom, to the color of the input pixel.
3. **Return output grid.** The expanded grid with crosses is now fully constructed.
