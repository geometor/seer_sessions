facts:
  - observation: Input grids are smaller than output grids.
  - observation: Non-zero values in input represent distinct colored objects.
  - observation: Zero value represents background.
  - action: Non-zero input pixels are expanded in the output.
  - property: Expansion is both horizontal and vertical.
  - property: Expansion creates a cross shape centered on the original pixel position.
  - property: Each input color has the same color in output cross
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are consistently larger than, but not directly proportional to, input grid dimensions.
  - observation: The colors of the input are maintained during the transformation.
