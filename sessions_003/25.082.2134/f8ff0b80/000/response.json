Diagonally connected pixels do not count.\n3.  **Extract Unique Colors:** For each identified object, get its color value. Add it to a *unique colors* set which does not accept duplicate values\n4. **Preserve Order of first appearance**: Preserve the top to bottom order in which the colors appear.\n5.  **Create Output List:** Create a 1D list from the set of extracted colors.\n\nEssentially, the program extracts the unique colors of the objects in the input grid, presented in the vertical order the colors first appear.\n"
