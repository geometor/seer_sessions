objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: height x width
      - cells: individual color values (0-9)
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous block of non-zero pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: integer value (1-9)
      - shape: irregular, defined by contiguous cells
  - type: list
    description: 1D array of integers.
    properties:
      - elements: unique color values from objects in the input grid

actions:
  - identify_objects: Locates all contiguous blocks of the same non-zero color.
  - extract_color: Retrieves the color value of an identified object.
  - order_colors: Arranges unique color values in a specific order (top to bottom based on first appearance).
  - create_list: Forms a 1D list from the ordered color values.

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains_objects: The input grid consists of multiple objects and background.
  - object_has_color: Each object is defined by a single color.
  - output_list_represents_colors: The output list contains the unique colors of the objects, ordered.
