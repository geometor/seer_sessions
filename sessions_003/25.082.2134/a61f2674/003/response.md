1.  **Iterate through Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid individually.
2.  **Row Condition:** For each row, check if there is *either* a gray (value 5) pixel in the third column (index 2) *or* a gray pixel in the seventh column (index 6).
3.  **Conditional Transformations:**
    *   If the condition in step 2 is true for a given row, then:
        *   If there's a gray pixel in the third column, change it to blue (value 1).
        *   If there's a gray pixel in the seventh column, change it to red (value 2).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid (those not in the third or seventh columns of rows meeting the condition) retain their original values. The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid.
