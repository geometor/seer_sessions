1.  **Iterate through Rows:** Process each row of the input grid separately.
2.  **Conditional Transformation for 3rd and 7th Columns:** For each row:
    *   If a row has a gray pixel (value 5) in *both* the 3rd column (index 2) and the 7th column (index 6), change the gray pixel in the 7th column to red (value 2).
    * If a row has gray pixel in 3rd column change it to blue (value 1).
3. **Conditional Transformation for 5th Column:** If the fifth column is grey, then change the fifth column to blue, independently.
4.  **Preservation:** All other pixels that do not meet the above conditions retain their original values. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
