        properties:
          - Pixels with value 5 (gray) in the 3rd and 7th columns.

        description: Grid with 9 rows and 9 columns.
        properties:
          - 3rd column pixels that were gray are now 1 (blue).
          - 7th column pixels that were gray are now 2 (red) only if 3rd column had grey.
          - Other pixels remain 0 (white).
    transformations:
      - description: Conditional color change based on column position and value.
        conditions:
          - If a row contains gray (5) in *both* the 3rd and 7th columns, change the 7th column's gray pixel to red (2).
          - If a row contains gray in the 3rd column, change it to blue (1).
        actions:
          - Change gray (5) to blue (1) in the 3rd column if grey.
          - Change gray (5) to red (2) in the 7th column if 3rd and 7th columns are grey.

      - object_id: 3
        description: Grid with 9 rows and 9 columns.
        properties:
          - Pixels with value 5 (gray) in various columns, notably the 3rd, 5th and 7th.
          - Other pixels are 0 (white).
    output_objects:
      - object_id: 4
        description: Grid with 9 rows and 9 columns.
        properties:
          - 5th column pixels that were gray (5) are now blue (1).
          - Pixels in 3rd column are changed to red (2) only if the 7th column does not have gray.
          - Other pixels remain 0 (white).
    transformations:
      - description: Conditional color change.
        conditions:
         - If the fifth column is grey, then change the fifth column to blue.
         - If there are grey pixels in the 3rd AND 7th columns change the color in the 7th column from grey to red.
        actions:
          - Change gray (5) to blue (1) in the 5th column.
          - Change gray (5) to red (2) in the third column if grey and the 7th is NOT grey
