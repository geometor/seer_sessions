The primary colors involved appear to be white (0) and gray (5) in the input, which change to blue (1) and red (2) respectively in the output. It seems that gray (5) objects along a particular column become blue (1), the third column from the left. The final set of gray(5) is in the seventh column. The gray (5) pixels in the seventh column is changed to red(2). The shape is constant between input and output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
