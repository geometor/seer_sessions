Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing numerical values representing colors. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0) and gray (5) in the input, which change to blue (1) and red (2) respectively in the output. It seems that gray (5) objects along a particular column become blue (1), the third column from the left. The final set of gray(5) is in the seventh column. The gray (5) pixels in the seventh column is changed to red(2). The shape is constant between input and output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task: color_transformation
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D array (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0), gray (5), blue (1), red (2)
      - position: (row, column)
observations:
  - input_color: gray (5)
    output_color_col_3: blue (1)
    output_color_col_7: red(2)
  - shape: constant between input and output
  - third_column_rule: column_3_gray_becomes_blue
  - seventh_column_rule: column_7_gray_becomes_red
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have the value 5 (gray).
2.  **Third Column Transformation:** For all gray pixels, if the pixel is in the third column, change its value to 1 (blue).
3. **Seventh Column Transformation:** Check the seventh column from left. If a pixel in the column is gray (5) change it to red (2).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels retain their original values. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
