Each of these blocks constitutes an \"object.\"\n2.  **Select Object:** From the identified objects, apply the following selection criteria:\n      *   Consider the largest object in each input\n      *   Eliminate objects with color 0 (white) because they form the background.\n      *   In example 1, the magenta object is chosen.\n      *   In example 2, the gray object is chosen.\n      *   In example 3, the red object is chosen\n      *   It appears we are looking for the color of the top-left-most largest object, excluding those of color 0.\n3. **Output:** Return the integer which represents the color of the object identified in Step 2.\n\nIn essence, it appears as though the goal is to determine and select a specific color and return the integer that represents the color of a particular object in the grid, chosen by a set of prioritized rules.\n"
