            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program correctly identified the core idea of extracting a sequence of non-zero digits and using it to populate the output grid. However, the interleaving logic and the indexing within the sequences are incorrect. The program assumes a simple alternating pattern between the reversed and original sequences, and also makes mistakes when filling in the values, and doesn't quite understand the wrapping around inside of those sequences. The expected output shows a repeating pattern derived from the *reversed* sequence, that fills each *row*, rather that alternate rows.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Sequence Extraction:** Double-check that the `extract_sequence` function is working as expected across all examples.\n2.  **Correct Filling Logic:** The output grid should be filled using elements of the *reversed* sequence, not a mix. The core issue lies in the filling part where the modulo operator (`%`) doesn't use the correct index to loop through the original/reversed sequences. We need to wrap the indexing by taking the modulo by the reversed sequence length.\n3. **No Interleaving**: All rows must be filled in the same way, from the reversed sequence.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\nFirst, let's get some utility code out of the way. I want to calculate how many items are the in the sequence for each example.\n\n"
