Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program correctly identified the core idea of extracting a sequence of non-zero digits and using it to populate the output grid. However, the interleaving logic and the indexing within the sequences are incorrect. The program assumes a simple alternating pattern between the reversed and original sequences, and also makes mistakes when filling in the values, and doesn't quite understand the wrapping around inside of those sequences. The expected output shows a repeating pattern derived from the *reversed* sequence, that fills each *row*, rather that alternate rows.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Sequence Extraction:** Double-check that the `extract_sequence` function is working as expected across all examples.
2.  **Correct Filling Logic:** The output grid should be filled using elements of the *reversed* sequence, not a mix. The core issue lies in the filling part where the modulo operator (`%`) doesn't use the correct index to loop through the original/reversed sequences. We need to wrap the indexing by taking the modulo by the reversed sequence length.
3. **No Interleaving**: All rows must be filled in the same way, from the reversed sequence.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

First, let's get some utility code out of the way. I want to calculate how many items are the in the sequence for each example.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Extract Input Sequence:** Scan the input grid from top-left to bottom-right, row by row. Create a list containing all non-zero digits encountered, preserving their order.
2.  **Reverse the Sequence:** Create a reversed copy of the extracted sequence.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with zeros (or any default value).
4.  **Fill Output Grid:** Iterate through each row of the output grid. For *every* row, fill the row by repeating the reversed sequence. The index into the reversed sequence should wrap around (using the modulo operator) so that if the sequence is shorter than the row length, it repeats seamlessly.
