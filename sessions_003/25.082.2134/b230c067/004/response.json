            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the basic concept: replacing azure (8) pixels based on whether they are \"border\" or \"interior\" pixels. However, the `is_border_or_isolated` function has a flaw. It incorrectly classifies some interior pixels as border pixels. The problem is that an all() check against neighbors includes diagonal neighbors. The definition of \"border\" needs to be refined to consider only directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) neighbors, not diagonal ones, when determining \"interior\" status. Isolated pixels should get treated as red and that works.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Refine `is_border_or_isolated`:** Modify the function to consider only the four directly adjacent neighbors (not diagonals) when determining if an azure pixel is part of a contiguous \"interior\" region.\n\n2. **Re-test:** After modifying the function, re-run the tests on all training examples to confirm that the issue is resolved.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis for now, as the automatic results have some limitations):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:** The top-left azure 'blob' is incorrectly outlined in red, whereas the expectation shows an inner blue and outer red 'layer'\n    *   **Metrics:** 20 pixels are off.\n    *   **Root Cause:** Incorrect border detection (includes diagonals).\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation:** Similar to Example 1. Incorrect border detection in top right, incorrectly labels an internal 8 as 2.\n    *   **Metrics:** 19 pixels are off.\n    *   **Root Cause:** Incorrect border detection (includes diagonals).\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
