The transformation identifies contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. 
It then replaces the "border" azure pixels of each region with red (2) pixels and the remaining interior azure pixels with blue (1) pixels. 
Background (0) pixels remain unchanged.  Border pixels are defined by 8-connectivity.
Isolated azure pixels are also turned red.
