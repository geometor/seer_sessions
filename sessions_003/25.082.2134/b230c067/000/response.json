The input grid primarily consists of azure (8) pixels and background (0) pixels. The output grid introduces two new colors: blue (1) and red (2). The azure pixels in the input seem to be replaced by either blue or red pixels in the output. The positioning of the blue and red pixels appears to be directly related to the original positions of the azure pixels. The red pixels seem to outline the original block of azure, and they replace a specific subset of the azure pixels. The background (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"

A border pixel is defined as an azure pixel that is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to a background (0) pixel.\n3.  **Color Replacement - Red:** Replace all identified border azure pixels with red (2) pixels.\n4.  **Color Replacement - Blue:** Replace all remaining (non-border) azure pixels within each region with blue (1) pixels.\n5. **Preserve Background:** All white/background (0) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation \"skins\" the azure regions with red, leaving the interior blue.\n"
