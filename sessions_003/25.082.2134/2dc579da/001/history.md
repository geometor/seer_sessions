Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements**

The task involves identifying a specific sub-grid within the input grid and extracting it as the output grid. The sub-grid appears to be defined by its position relative to a horizontal line of a distinct color. This line seems to act as a "marker" or "delimiter". The sub-grid is always above this marker line. The dimensions of output seem related to columns up until the first occurrence of a specified color.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input is a 2D grid of integers (colors). Each output is also a 2D grid.
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: integers 0-9
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: integers 0-9
  - relationship: |
      The output grid is a sub-grid extracted from the input grid.
  - marker:
    type: horizontal line
    property: made of the same color
    details: |
        Identifies rows above it which will determine the output grid height.
  - action: extract
    description: |
      A sub-grid is extracted from the input based on the marker and the first occurence of a different specified color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Marker Line:** Find the topmost horizontal line in the input grid where all pixels have the same color.
2.  **Determine Output Height:** The height of the output grid is the number of rows *above* the marker line.
3.  **Determine Output Width**: Scanning row by row from top, find the column index of first occurrence of second distinctive color.
4.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Create the output grid by taking all rows from the input grid that are above the marker line and truncate the width according the position from previous step.
