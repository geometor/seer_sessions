            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved finding a horizontal marker line and extracting a sub-grid above it. The width of this sub-grid was determined by the first occurrence of the second color before the marker row. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this approach is not entirely correct. The width extraction logic seems flawed, as evidenced by the incorrect outputs in all three test cases. We need to refine how the width of the output grid is determined. We will go through each example and investigate its construction with a tool and present the information in YAML for.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each example, use code execution to:\n    *   Calculate the dimensions of the input and expected output grids.\n    *   Identify the marker row index.\n    *   Determine the intended logic for width extraction.\n    *   Compare expected to transformed output\n\n2.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a YAML block summarizing key observations, focusing on:\n    *   Input and output grid dimensions.\n    *   Marker line properties (color, row index).\n    *   Output grid extraction logic (how height and width are determined).\n    *   Objects and their properties\n\n3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, formulate a more accurate and comprehensive natural language program that describes the transformation rule, accounting for the variations observed across all examples.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nLet's use code execution to gather detailed metrics for each example.\n\n"
