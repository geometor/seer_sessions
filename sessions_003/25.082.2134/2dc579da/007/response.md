1.  Identify the Marker Line: Find the topmost horizontal line in the input grid where all pixels have the same color. This is the "marker line." Note the row index of this line.
2.  Determine Output Height: The output grid's height is equal to the row index of the marker line.
3.  Identify First Color: The first color in the grid will be considered the background color.
4.  Determine Second Color and Column: Scan the rows *above* the marker line from top to bottom and left to right. The "second color" is the first color encountered that is *different* from the first color. Note the column index where this second color first appears.
5.  Determine Output Width: The output grid's width is equal to the column index of the "second color".
6.  Extract Sub-grid: Create the output grid by extracting the sub-grid from the input grid.  The sub-grid starts at row 0 and extends down to the row immediately *above* the marker line (exclusive). The sub-grid starts at column 0 and extends to the column immediately *before* the column where the second color was found (exclusive).
7. Handle No Marker: If no marker line is found in the input, the output is identical to the input.
8. Handle No Second Color: If no second color is found, return rows above the marker for the entire width of input grid.
