facts:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - height: Number of rows.
      - width: Number of columns.
      - marker_line: A horizontal line where all pixels have the same color.

  - transformation: sub_grid_extraction
    description: Extracts a portion of the input grid.
    properties:
      - output_height: Determined by the position of the marker line.
      - output_width: Based on the columns to the left of and including the second color in the grid above the marker row.

  - example_1:
      input_shape: [5, 5]
      output_shape: [2, 2]
      marker_row: 2
      output_height_rule: marker_row
      first_color: 8
      second_color: 3
      output_width_rule: Index of the first occurence of the second color + 1

  - example_2:
      input_shape: [7, 7]
      output_shape: [3, 5]
      marker_row: 3
      output_height_rule: marker_row
      first_color: 4
      second_color: 2
      output_width_rule: Index of the first occurence of the second color + 1

  - example_3:
      input_shape: [11, 11]
