The sub-grid appears to be defined by its position relative to a horizontal line of a distinct color. This line seems to act as a \"marker\" or \"delimiter\". The sub-grid is always above this marker line. The dimensions of output seem related to columns up until the first occurrence of a specified color.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"
