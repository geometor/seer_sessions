Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors involved seem to be 0 (white), 8 (azure), and 4 (yellow). The grids are of the same dimensions (6x9). The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex geometric manipulations like rotations or reflections. It appears to be focused on the azure (8) pixels, specifically their horizontal positions relative to each other within each row.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x9
      elements: integers (0-9)
      colors:
        0: white
        4: yellow
        8: azure

  - type: pixel
    properties:
        value: integer
        color: mapped from value

actions:
  - type: horizontal_expansion
    description: Azure (8) pixels in the top three rows are modified based on their relative positions.

relationships:
  - azure_pixels_top_rows:  Azure pixels influence other azure pixels in same row
  - yellow_pixels_static: Yellow (4) pixels in the bottom three rows remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the top three rows of the input grid.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion (Conditional):** For each row in top three:
    * Find all groups of consecutive horizontally adjacent azure pixels.
    * Compare the x coordinates of these groups and single azure pixels.
        * Where groups have overlaps in the columns they occupy, join them
            * if 2 groups share a single column, copy/expand all groups that overlap to occupy those combined columns
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels, including all yellow (4) pixels in the bottom three rows, remain unchanged in their original positions in output.

In essence, the transformation focuses on expanding or shifting the azure pixels in the top three rows based on position, while the bottom three rows (containing the yellow pixels) serve as a fixed base.
