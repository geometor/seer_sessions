            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a flawed understanding of the reflection and stacking rule. The code reflects azure pixels across the center column but doesn't handle the stacking or filling process as observed in the expected outputs. The main issue lies in how collisions and empty spaces are handled. It's also clear that there is a misalignment between the provided natural language program and the desired transformation. The original strategy was to start with the first example. I did not pay close attention to the next examples in the train set.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Reflection Logic:** Instead of simply placing the reflected pixel at the calculated index, implement filling mechanism. The goal is not to reflect, but to fill azure pixels at the opposite direction, respecting stacking.\n\n2.  **Address Collision and Stacking:** When \"reflecting\" an azure pixel, and the target cell is occupied, look the empty position on the target area, which should be reversed direction.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each modification to ensure improvements and catch regressions.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze each example to pinpoint the specific errors. Because of the limitations, I can not directly write tool code to analyze this, so this will be manual, focusing on identifying the issues.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 6x9 grid, azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Top 3 rows: Azure pixels are filled from the reflected side. Bottom 3 rows: Unchanged.\n    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect reflection. Not Filling\n    *   Observation: the \"reflect_across_center\" function needs a re-write to implement the correct filling logic.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 6x9 grid, azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Top 3 rows filled with azure pixels. Bottom 3 rows: unchanged.\n    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect reflection and filling.\n    *   Observation: The filling mechanism is missing.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 6x9 grid, azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Top 3 rows filled with azure pixels. Bottom 3 rows: unchanged.\n    *    Transformed output: incorrect reflection and filling.\n    *   Observation: More evidence of the core logic flaw.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"
