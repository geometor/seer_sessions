The grid consists of azure pixels (8) and yellow pixels (4). The transformation only affects the top three rows of the grid. The bottom three rows remain unchanged. Within each of the top three rows, the azure pixels are reflected across the center column (index 4 in a 9-column grid). If after reflection, multiple azure pixels would occupy the same cell, they are stacked from left to right.
