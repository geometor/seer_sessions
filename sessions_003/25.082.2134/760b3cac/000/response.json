            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors involved seem to be 0 (white), 8 (azure), and 4 (yellow). The grids are of the same dimensions (6x9). The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex geometric manipulations like rotations or reflections. It appears to be focused on the azure (8) pixels, specifically their horizontal positions relative to each other within each row.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
