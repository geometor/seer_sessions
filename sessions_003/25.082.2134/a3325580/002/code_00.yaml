    objects:
      - description: Input grid, a 2D array of color values.
        properties:
          - colors: Integers representing colors (0-9).
          - dimensions: Variable height and width.
      - description: Output grid, a 2D array of color values.
        properties:
          - colors: Subset of colors present in the input grid.
          - dimensions: Height is consistent, width varies based on distinct colors.
    actions:
      - description: Find colors that appear in at least one row together
        details: Iterate through each row of the input grid. Identify the colors present in that row.
      - description: find colors common to input and output
        details: find intersection of input and output sets
      - description: Determine output grid height.
        details: The height corresponds to the number of non-empty rows before the first empty row in the input, or until some other consistent stopping criterion is met.
      - description: Determine the horizontal order of colors in the output.
        details: The order is determined by looking at the rows that have *all* of the output colors present. The colors are ordered based on appearance.
      - description: Construct the output grid.
        details: Create a grid where each row contains the ordered sequence of colors identified. The number of rows is determined as described above.
