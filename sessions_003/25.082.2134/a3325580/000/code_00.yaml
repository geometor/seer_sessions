objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: variable (10x10 in examples)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: variable (rows seem related to input, columns significantly reduced)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9), representing colors, subset of input_grid values
  - type: color_block
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer value
      - shape: contiguous block of same-color pixels
      - count: number of pixels

actions:
  - identify: Find all distinct non-zero color blocks in the input grid.
  - extract:  Get the color value of each identified block.
  - order: Maintain the order of the color blocks, which seems to be by the column value of their first appearance.
  - condense: Reduce multiple instances of the same color to a single instance in the output.
  - construct: Create the output_grid, placing each identified color value in a new row and stacking those rows vertically.

relationships:
  - input_to_output:  The output grid contains a subset of the colors present in the input grid.
  - color_to_row: Each distinct color in the order they appear in the input is put on a new row in the output.
