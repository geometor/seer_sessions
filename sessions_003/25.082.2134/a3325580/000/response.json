The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, listing only the identified colors, and potentially their order of appearance, but *without* any spatial information from the input, other than the order of the colors. There appears to be a reduction in both dimensions and content: multiple instances of the same color in the input are reduced to one in the output, and many '0' (background) pixels are removed. The output grid's height corresponds to the number of rows containing relevant colors (non-zero pixels) in a simplified vertical representation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
