Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves identifying and extracting specific colored objects (represented by digits) from the input grid. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, listing only the identified colors, and potentially their order of appearance, but *without* any spatial information from the input, other than the order of the colors. There appears to be a reduction in both dimensions and content: multiple instances of the same color in the input are reduced to one in the output, and many '0' (background) pixels are removed. The output grid's height corresponds to the number of rows containing relevant colors (non-zero pixels) in a simplified vertical representation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: variable (10x10 in examples)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: variable (rows seem related to input, columns significantly reduced)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9), representing colors, subset of input_grid values
  - type: color_block
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer value
      - shape: contiguous block of same-color pixels
      - count: number of pixels

actions:
  - identify: Find all distinct non-zero color blocks in the input grid.
  - extract:  Get the color value of each identified block.
  - order: Maintain the order of the color blocks, which seems to be by the column value of their first appearance.
  - condense: Reduce multiple instances of the same color to a single instance in the output.
  - construct: Create the output_grid, placing each identified color value in a new row and stacking those rows vertically.

relationships:
  - input_to_output:  The output grid contains a subset of the colors present in the input grid.
  - color_to_row: Each distinct color in the order they appear in the input is put on a new row in the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Scan** the input grid from left to right, top to bottom.
2. **Identify** all distinct non-zero colors.
3. **Record** the colors in the order in which their *first instance* is encountered.
4. **Create** an output grid.
5. for each color, create a new row in the output and place the color value. The number of rows is determined by the number of unique colors identified.
6. **Return** the new output grid, containing a one color of each type stacked in order
