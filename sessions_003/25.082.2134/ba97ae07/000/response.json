The core operation seems to involve selectively modifying a specific row based on the presence of a consistent, multi-pixel object in a consistent column, spanning multiple rows. The modification seems to affect *only* the \"special row\" identified by unique consistent color.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
