facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input and output grid has the same dimensions.
  - object_identification: |
      There are vertical lines, represented by columns of identical, non-zero pixels, extending across multiple rows.
  - object_property: |
      These lines maintain their color and column position in both input and output.
  - object_identification: |
      There exists one horizontal line of a constant non-zero color.
  - action: |
    The horizontal line color get modified, except those that are underneath the vertical line columns
  - relation: |
