    description: >
      Iterate through each pixel in the horizontal line.
      If a pixel's column index is part of a vertical line OF THE SAME COLOR, keep the pixel's original color.
      Otherwise, replace the pixel's color with the color of the pixel directly above it.
      If it's the top row, replace it with the color of the pixel directly below.
