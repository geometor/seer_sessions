            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and as expected, it doesn't generalize perfectly to all cases. The core idea of identifying a horizontal line and modifying it based on vertical lines and the row above/below is partially correct. However, the conditions for identifying which pixels to modify within the horizontal line are not entirely accurate. Specifically, the current code incorrectly assumes that *any* vertical line of length 3 or greater should prevent modification of the horizontal line pixel at that column. The examples show this is too restrictive. It's more about vertical lines of the *same* color as the horizontal line. The code also doesn't copy the correct color.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Refine Vertical Line Detection:** Modify `find_vertical_lines` to consider only vertical lines of the *same color* as the horizontal line. This is crucial for correctly identifying which pixels in the horizontal line should be preserved.\n2.  **Correct Color Replacement:** Replace the incorrect implementation where it always uses the adjacent row and use the correct implementation.\n3.   **Detailed Analysis:** Examine each example meticulously, focusing on the differences between the expected and transformed outputs, as well as what parts of the code caused it.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nLet's break down each example's results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 6\n    *   **Issue:** The code correctly identified the horizontal line (row 3, color 3) and the vertical line (color 8). However, It failed to change only the blue.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 9\n    *   **Issue:** The code correctly identified the horizontal line (row 3, color 1) and the vertical lines (color 6). However, it changed every pixel instead of the 1's that don't match the vertical lines.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 7\n    *    **Issue:** The code correctly identified the horizontal line (row 3, color 7) and the vertical line (color 1). However, it failed to keep the 7's.\n* **Example 4:**\n    * **Pixels off**: 1\n    * **Issue:** The only vertical line is the same color as the horizontal line.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
