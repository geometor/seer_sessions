    description: >
       Pixels in HorizontalLine are changed based on intersection with VerticalLines.
       If a pixel in HorizontalLine is also part of a Vertical line, it keeps
       original color.  Otherwise color changes. The replacement color for changed pixels is
       determined by looking at the above row, or if that is not possible, the
       below row.
