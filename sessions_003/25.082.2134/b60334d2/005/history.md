Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to refine the natural language program and the corresponding code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and it's clear that the generated transformation rule doesn't generalize well to the second example. The core issue seems to be in how the checkerboard pattern of '1's and '5's is generated and how the final swap is conditioned. The existing code over-simplifies the relationship between the initial '5's and the surrounding pattern, and it uses the (row + col) % 2 == 0 condition incorrectly throughout.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the differences between the *Expected Output* and *Transformed Output* for both examples. Identify the specific pixels that are incorrect and try to discern a pattern in these errors.

2.  **Re-evaluate Checkerboard Logic:** The current checkerboard logic is too simplistic. We need to determine how the presence of '5's *actually* influences the surrounding pattern. It might be related to distance from a '5', or a more complex rule. Focus on the second example where there are many 5s to help with discernment.

3.  **Revise the Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis of mismatches and the re-evaluation of the checkerboard logic, create a new, more accurate natural language program that describes the transformation.

4. **Refactor code based on observations**

**Gather Metrics and Observations:**

I'll perform a more detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison using numpy, looking at the colors and positions of the errors.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify '5's:** Locate all pixels with a value of '5' (gray) in the input grid.

2.  **Create a Pattern:** Create a pattern of 5s and 1s around the seed 5s in the output grid, leaving 0 in locations where the original values in the input were 0 and where there are no 1s or 5s.
    The pattern appears as follows:
    - if the input grid cell is 5, then output grid cell is also 5.
    - find the closest 5 - the cell above, below, to the left or the right. If a neighboring cell has an existing 5, the current cell receives the alternate of 1 or 5. 
    - if there is no immediate neighbor, then determine the pattern by looking at the value of the neighbor - above, below, left, and right. Alternate from this value between 1 and 5.

3. Do not perform any swap.
