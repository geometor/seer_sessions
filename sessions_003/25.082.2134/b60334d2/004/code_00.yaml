example_1:
  input_grid:
    shape: [9, 9]
    objects:
      - color: 5 # Gray
        locations: [[2, 3], [5, 6], [7, 2]]
    background: 0
  output_grid:
    shape: [9, 9]
    objects:
        - color: 5
          locations: [[1,2],[1,4],[3,2],[3,4],[4,5],[4,7],[6,1],[6,3],[6,5],[6,7],[8,1],[8,3]]
        - color: 1
          locations:  [[1,3],[2,2],[2,4],[3,3],[4,6],[4,8],[5,5],[5,7],[6,0],[6,2],[6,4],[6,6],[6,8],[7,1],[7,3],[8,0],[8,2]]
    background: 0
  transformation:
    description: "Places 5 and 1 in a checkerboard pattern around initial 5s, leaving 0s where there's no influence."
  notes:
    - in the output, the influence of a 5 extends for a short distance
    - 0 values exist where no object exists, either original 5 or new 1
  errors:
      - the transformed image is completely 1s and 5s
      - the initial placement of the 5s and 1s is not right
      - the swap step at the end is not necessary

example_2:
    input_grid:
        shape: [9, 9]
        objects:
          - color: 5 # Gray
            locations: [[1, 2], [1, 7], [5, 2]]
        background: 0
    output_grid:
        shape: [9, 9]
        objects:
          - color: 5
            locations: [[0,1],[0,3],[0,6],[0,8],[2,1],[2,3],[2,6],[2,8],[6,1],[6,3],[6,6],[8,6]]
          - color: 1
            locations: [[0,2],[0,7],[1,1],[1,3],[1,6],[1,8],[2,2],[2,7],[5,1],[5,3],[6,2],[6,7],[7,5],[7,7],[8,5],[8,7]]
        background: 0 # Black

    transformation:
      description: "Places 5 and 1 around the initial locations of gray(5). The pattern seems complex, but related to existing 5s, and leaves some areas as 0."
    notes:
      - 0s remain in the output grid, not all cells are assigned a color

    errors:
      - the transformed image is completely 1s and 5s
      - the initial placement of the 5s and 1s is not right
      - the swap step at the end is not necessary
