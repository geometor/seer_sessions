The most prominent feature is the presence of the digit '5' (gray) in the input grids, and its apparent role in defining the transformation. The output grids seem to introduce '1' (blue) pixels in relation to the positions of the '5' pixels in the input. The rest of the grid is filled with '0' (white). It seems like an object creation/pattern generation task, built on existing objects.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

'5' from the input are copied to the same location in the output grid. '1' is placed in a position in the output grid when its neighboring position in *input* grid is occupied by a '5'.\n"
