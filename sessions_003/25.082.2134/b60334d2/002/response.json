            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a preliminary understanding of the transformation, likely focusing on a simple adjacency rule (placing '1's next to '5's). The results on the training examples reveal that this understanding is incomplete. The code fails to capture the full checkerboard-like pattern propagation and seems to only consider immediate horizontal neighbors. It also has errors in the diagonal checks. The `pixels_off` metric indicates significant discrepancies between the generated output and the expected output, especially in example 2.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze both training examples, paying close attention to the *relative* positions of '1's and '5's, not just immediate adjacency. Focus on the overall pattern.\n2.  **Refine the Pattern Description:** The core issue is the incomplete description of the pattern. We need to articulate the \"checkerboard\" rule more precisely. It appears that the '1' and '5' alternate.\n3. **Consider a more abstract approach.** Rather than hardcoding adjacent cells, calculate whether the row + column is odd or even, this will help to determine the location of 1s and 5s.\n4.  **Iterative Improvement:** We'll modify the natural language program, translate it to code, and test again.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's gather some concrete data on the examples.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input '5' count: 3\n    *   Output '5' count: 9\n    *   Output '1' count: 12\n    *   A clear alternating pattern exists, expanding from the seed '5's.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input '5' count: 3\n    *   Output '5' count: 9\n    *   Output '1' count: 12\n    *   Similar alternating pattern, but originating from different seed '5' locations.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Determine the expected value based on seed 5's.\n    * If input\\[row,col] is 5, then copy that to output.\n    * otherwise, walk through the input grid.\n    * If a cell in the input grid contains a '5', then the expected value of the output is determined by (row + col) % 2. If the sum of the row and column indices is even, and the value in the input is 5, the output cell should be 5. If the sum is odd, and the value in the input is 5, the output cell should be 1.\n    * If the sum of row and col is even, place a '5' in the output. If odd, place a '1'.\n    * if there is no 5 in the entire input grid, return all 0s.\n\nThis program describes a process to initialize an output grid with a copy of all\nof the 5's from the input, then to populate alternating 1s and 5s in the\nremaining cells. The position of the 1s and 5s are based on the row and column\nindices. If the indices are even, place a 5, else place a 1.\n"
