The current implementation has flaws in how it determines the checkerboard pattern, particularly in cases with multiple '5's influencing the same area. The code attempts to resolve this by checking neighboring pixels and their values, counting '5' and '1'. But it doesn't seem to handle the interaction and interference of multiple nearby 5's correctly and is applying the checkerboard pattern inconsistently. The strategy for resolution is to identify how influence of '5' propagates.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis:**\n\nLet's start with observation about example 1:\n\n"
