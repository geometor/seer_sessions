Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe task involves two grids (input and output) of the same dimensions. The grids contain single-digit integers representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a color substitution, specifically of a contiguous block of one color. It appears that the '5's are targeted and, within the bounds of a 3x3 object of color '5', replaced with the colors of the mirrored object at the top-left.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
