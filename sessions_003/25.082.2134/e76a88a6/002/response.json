            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improving the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed with a specific pattern in mind: replacing 3x3 gray blocks (color 5) with a mirrored version of the top-left 3x3 block. However, the results indicate this rule is too specific and doesn't generalize well to other examples. The errors in both Example 1 and Example 2 show that the mirrored top-left 3x3 block is not always the correct replacement, and the location of replacement should consider the location of 3x3 grey blocks.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze the input and expected output of all examples to identify a more general pattern. Consider alternative object properties beyond just being a \"3x3 gray block\".\n2.  **Focus on Relationships:** Look for relationships between the replaced block and other elements in the grid. For instance, is the replacement related to another part of the input, or are all grey blocks replaced.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect a more accurate and general transformation rule, considering the new observations.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze each example to derive more information.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 10x10 grid with a 3x3 block of color 2 and 4 in the top-left, and one 3x3 gray block (color 5).\n*   **Expected Output:** The 3x3 gray block is replaced with the 3x3 block with color 2, and 4.\n*   **Transformed Output:** top left mirrored is wrong, and the position is misaligned.\n*  Facts YAML:\n    "
