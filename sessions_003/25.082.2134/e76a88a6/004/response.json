            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of replacing 3x3 gray blocks with the top-left 3x3 block works partially, capturing the basic idea of pattern replication. However, it's too simplistic and doesn't correctly handle all cases. The main issues are:\n1.  Only considers replacing grey blocks. It doesn't account for copying the pattern into other blocks.\n2. It assumes the *entire* top-left 3x3 block is always the source pattern, which isn't always true. The dimensions of the block that is being copied can change.\n3. There might be a bug in how it copies.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples (both train and, if available, test examples). Pay close attention to *which* part of the input grid is being replicated and *where* it's being replicated to. Look at all the provided examples, not just the first.\n2.  **Identify Source Pattern:** Instead of assuming the top-left 3x3 is the source, develop a method to *identify* the source pattern dynamically. Consider its size, shape, and color composition.\n3.  **Identify Target Locations:** Determine the rule for where the pattern is copied. It might not always be 3x3 gray blocks. Look for patterns in the spatial relationship between the source and target locations.\n4. **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the improved understanding, create a new, more precise natural language description of the transformation.\n5. **Refactor Code** Write a new function in a later step, based on the revised program.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Example Analysis:**\n\nLet's look at the provided training examples.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input Size: 10x10\n    *   Output Size: 10x10\n    *   Source Pattern: Seems to be the 3x3 block at the top-left.\n    *   Target Locations: Two 3x3 gray blocks.\n    *   Problem. The output did not correctly copy the 3x3 top-left subgrid.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input Size: 10x10\n    *   Output Size: 10x10\n    *   Source Pattern: It looks like it should be a 3x4 block at top left.\n    *   Target Locations: One is the 3x4 block of 5's, one if the 3x3 of 5's.\n    *   Problem. The output did not copy the top left at all, and did not correctly locate where to copy.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"
