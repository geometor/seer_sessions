facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger and contain a region of non-zero pixels surrounded by zero-value pixels.
  - observation: Output grids are smaller and contain only the non-zero pixels from the input.
  - observation: The relative positions of the non-zero pixels are preserved in the output.
  - observation: Rows and columns containing only zero-value pixels are removed.
  - object: input_grid, type: 2D array, description: Contains a region of non-zero pixels.
  - object: output_grid, type: 2D array, description: Contains only the non-zero pixels from the input_grid, preserving relative positions.
  - action: extract_subgrid, description: Extracts the non-zero portion of the input_grid.
  - relationship: output_grid is a subgrid of input_grid.
  - property: zero_value, value: 0, description: Represents background or empty cells.
