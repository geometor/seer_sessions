The subgrid seems to be defined by the contiguous non-zero elements within the larger grid.  The surrounding zero-value pixels are removed. The output grid retains the spatial arrangement of the non-zero elements as they appeared in the input grid, but without any rows or columns that are all zeros. There appears to be only one connected component consisting of non-zero pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
