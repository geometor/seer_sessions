The azure pixels appear to be the primary objects of interest. The transformation seems to involve some kind of expansion or filling operation related to the azure pixels, but the precise rule isn't immediately obvious. It looks like azure pixels might be \"growing\" or \"connecting\" based on their initial positions. The shape of the azure regions in the output seems related to their positions and arrangements in the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The \"fill down\" operation adds pixels to the column based on min/max location.\n"
