Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of pixels, mostly black (0) with some azure (8) pixels.  The azure pixels appear to be the primary objects of interest. The transformation seems to involve some kind of expansion or filling operation related to the azure pixels, but the precise rule isn't immediately obvious. It looks like azure pixels might be "growing" or "connecting" based on their initial positions. The shape of the azure regions in the output seems related to their positions and arrangements in the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    description: Individual pixels of color 8.  These are the active elements in the transformation.
  - name: background
    color: black (0)
    description: The background, which is the canvas on which the azure pixels operate.

properties:
  - name: position
    description: The (row, column) coordinates of a pixel.
  - name: connectivity
    description:  Whether azure pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Azure pixels appear to "grow" horizontally, filling in gaps between them.
  - name: fill_down
    description: in some cases a "fill down" occurs, and the empty space between azure pixels gets filled

relationships:
  - name: horizontal_adjacency
    description: Two azure pixels are on the same row and adjacent columns.
  - name: vertical_adjacency
    description: Two azure pixels are in the same column and on adjacent rows
  - name: diagonal_adjacency
    description: Two azure pixels that touch at their corners, are on adjacent rows, and have columns that differ by one.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each row, if there are multiple azure pixels, fill the space between the *leftmost* and *rightmost* azure pixels in that row with azure pixels.

3. **Fill Down within bounds**: fill with azure pixels, every black pixel found between the top-most and bottom-most azure pixel *within each column*.

This program accounts for the observed behavior: existing azure pixels define the horizontal extent of the filled regions, and expansion happens only on rows that already contain at least two azure pixels. The "fill down" operation adds pixels to the column based on min/max location.
