The core issue seems to be the propagation of the repeating pattern upwards. The current logic appears too restrictive, extending patterns only when they are an exact match for the subpattern of the last row *and* start at the beginning of a row.  Example 3 shows a scenario where the subpattern to be extended in upper rows doesn't necessarily start at the row beginning, nor is it related to the pattern of the *last* row, rather it relates to the repeating pattern of row below it.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Relax the Subpattern Condition:** Instead of requiring subpatterns to match from the absolute start of the row, we should identify repeating subpatterns within the rows.\n2.  **Relative Propagation:** Propagate pattern found in row `n` to row `n-1`, not based on the bottom-most pattern.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**\n\n"
