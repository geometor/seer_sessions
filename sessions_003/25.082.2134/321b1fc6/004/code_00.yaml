          Replace each object of color 8. The first (top-left) object of color
          8 is replaced with the first objects of color 7 and 6 stacked vertically,
          starting at the top-left position of object 8. The object of color 7
          is placed first, and the object of color 6 directly below it. This combination is then replicated to replace all other color 8 objects.
