            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example, leading to an incomplete understanding of the overall transformation rule. The code correctly identifies objects and attempts to swap them based on color and shape. However, it fails to generalize to the second example, indicating a need for a more robust rule that considers all examples. The primary issue is that the logic is too specific, focusing on swapping particular colors (7 and 6, and 8) and not generalizing the swapping rule based on shape and relative position. It appears the code is attempting to memorize specific transformations instead of generalizing the concept of swapping based on a defined condition.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Both Examples:** Examine the input and expected output of both examples carefully, paying close attention to the changes in object properties (color, shape, position).\n2.  **Identify the General Rule:** Determine the underlying principle governing the swaps. It's not about specific colors but rather a relationship between objects that dictates the swap. Look at object properties, relationships and positions.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to express the general rule clearly and concisely, removing any example-specific assumptions.\n4.  **Modify the Code:** Adapt the `transform` function to implement the refined natural language program.\n5. **Iterate and Test:** Test the modified code on all training examples. If errors persist, repeat steps 1-4.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo understand the transformation better, let's define some functions to perform a detailed analysis of each example. This will help in defining object attributes and relations.\n"
