Some objects are 1x1 (single pixels), others are larger. The most prominent repeating object is a 3x2 or 2x3 rectangle of color 8 (azure).\n*   **Background:** The majority of both input and output grids is color 0 (white), acting as a background.\n*   **Changes:** The primary changes seem to occur around the azure rectangles and involve the isolated single-pixel colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all single pixels (1x1 color blocks) in the input grid that *aren't* color 8 (azure). Also, locate the azure colored rectangles.\n\n2.  **Process Top Row Singularities:** Scan the top row from the left to right and copy any non-zero pixel value to the position of the top-left pixel of the first azure rectangle underneath that area of the top row.\n\n3.  **Process Left Column Singularities:** Scan the left column from top to bottom, copy any non-zero pixel value to the position of the left-most pixel of the first azure rectangle to the right.\n\n4.  **Process Rectangle Changes:** For each azure rectangle:\n    *   If there's a single, non-azure pixel *directly above* the top-left corner of the azure block in the input, copy the top-left pixel of the first row of the azure rectangle to the top-left pixel location, then replace that original value in the azure rectangle with that of the singularity to its top-left.\n    *   If there is a single, non-azure pixel value immediately to the left of the azure rectangle on the left column of the grid, copy the value to the left-most pixel of the azure rectangle.\n\n5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid that weren't modified in the previous steps remain unchanged in the output grid. In other words, if a single pixel doesn't meet the 'above' or 'left' criteria relative to an azure rectangle, it stays in its original position. Also, the \"body\" of the rectangle is unchanged except if moved in an earlier step.\n"
