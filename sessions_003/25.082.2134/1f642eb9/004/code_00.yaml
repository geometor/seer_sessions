      description: "Move single pixels adjacent to azure rectangles"
      preconditions:
        - "Pixel must be a single pixel (not part of a larger object of the same color)."
        - "Pixel must be adjacent to an azure rectangle."
      postconditions:
        - "Pixel is placed at first empty place (color 0) and adjacent to any side of the azure rectangle."
        - "If there are no free positions, pixel is not changed"

  - observations:
      - "Azure rectangles act as anchors or reference points for the movement of single pixels."
      - "Only single pixels adjacent to the azure rectangles are moved."
      - "The final output maintains all the original colors"
