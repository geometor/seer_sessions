However, the results show mismatches in all three examples. The core issue seems to be in *how* and *where* the single pixels are moved. The current code:\n\n1.  **Incorrectly moves single pixels:** It doesn't move the single pixels correctly. It is supposed to swap one single pixel to an adjacent background empty space, not re-color all single pixels that are adjacent to the azure block.\n2.  **Doesn't handle multiple single pixels around the azure rectangle** The current algorithm seems to move the single pixels incorrectly. It does move single pixels adjacent to the azure rectangle, but doesn't consider correctly where they should go or the case where there are not enough positions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Adjacency and Movement Logic:**\n    *   The core logic needs to be changed to identify single pixels adjacent to azure blocks correctly.\n    *   Move only single pixels that are adjacent to an azure rectangle.\n    *   If there are not enough adjacent spots, the move should happen anyway.\n\n2.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each significant change on all provided examples to ensure the changes are moving towards the correct solution and avoid regressions.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**\nI need to get more details to be sure about counts, but at this stage, I don't have access to the ARC data set so will defer on gathering detailed metrics\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"
