Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code attempted to move single pixels adjacent to azure rectangles. However, the results indicate several discrepancies:

1.  **Incorrect Movement:** The code doesn't correctly move single pixels to available adjacent spots. It seems to either miss moving them or moves the wrong pixel. Example 2 shows single pixel '7' is not moved and in example 3, the '4' pixel in the first row is not moved.
2.  **Missing Logic:** The code doesn't account for the specific placement of moved pixels *around* the azure rectangles. Looking at the expected output, the single pixels appear to "fill in" spaces adjacent to the rectangle, taking up available spots in a somewhat predictable, possibly clockwise, order.
3. It seems like a single pixel is only considered to move if it NOT already adjacent to a rectangle

The strategy is to:

1.  **Refine Movement Logic:** Modify the code to correctly identify *all* single pixels that are not *already* adjacent to an azure rectangle.
2.  **Prioritize Adjacent Spots:** Iterate through the *available* spaces around the azure rectangle, moving a non-adjacent single pixel into the space. Prioritize the single pixels based on something like reading order (top to bottom, left to right).
3. **Iteration order:** The previous code found all valid empty spots and used pop(0). It might be better to find the locations in a clockwise or counter clockwise around the rectangle.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the errors:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Maroon (9) at (0,4) is correctly not moved, it is not a single pixel.
    *   Magenta (6) at (6,0) is a single pixel and should move, but did not.
    *   Yellow(4) at (9,5) is a single pixel and should move but did not
    *   Three available spots adjacent to rectangle, at (3,4), (6,3), (6,4)
    *   Expected output had moved 6 to (6,3), 4 to (6,4) and 9 to (3,4)

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Orange(7) at (0,4) correctly not moved (not single pixel)
    *   Magenta(6) at (3,0) is single, should move
    *   Red(2) at (5,9) is single, should move
    *   Green(3) at (7,0) is single, should move
    *   Blue(1) at (9,5) is single, should move.
    *  There are four open adjacent spots around rectangle at (3,3),(3,6), (5,6) and (7,3)
    *  Expected has: 6 moved to (3,3), 7 moved to (4,3), 2 moved to (5,6), 3 moved to (7,3), 1 moved to (8,3)

*   **Example 3:**
    * Yellow(4) at (0,3) - single pixel, should move
    * Green(3) at (4,0) - single pixel, should move.
    * Red(2) at (6,0) - single pixel, should move
    * Red(2) at (7,9) - single pixel, should move
    * Orange(7) at (9,3) - single pixel, should move
    * Magenta(6) at (3,9) - single pixel, should move.
    *  There are three open spots at (3,3), (3,6), (7,3).
    *  Expected Output has: 4 to (3,3), 3 to (4,0), 2 to (6,0), 7 to (7,3), 2 to (7,4), 6 to (3,4).

**YAML Fact Extraction**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    color: azure (8)
    size: 3x2 or 2x3
    role: anchor
    behavior: stationary

  - type: pixel
    size: 1x1
    role: mobile
    condition: not adjacent to any azure rectangle
    behavior: moves to an adjacent empty cell next to an azure rectangle
              if it exists

  - type: cell
    role: location
    states:
        - empty: value is 0
        - occupied: value is 1-9

actions:
  - name: move_single_pixel
    agent: single pixel not adjacent to an azure rectangle
    target: empty adjacent cell next to an azure rectangle
    precondition:
      - cell is empty (value 0)
      - cell is adjacent to an azure rectangle
      - pixel is a single pixel (1x1) and NOT of color 0
      - pixel is NOT already adjacent to any azure rectangle
    postcondition:
      - target cell now contains the pixel's original color.
      - original pixel location is now empty (value 0).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Rectangles:** Find all 2x3 or 3x2 azure (color 8) rectangles within the grid. These rectangles will serve as anchors.

2.  **Identify Single Pixels:** Find all single pixels (1x1 blocks of color) that have a color other than azure (8) or background (0).

3. **Identify non-adjacent single pixels**: From the single pixels, select only those that are not already adjacent to an azure rectangle.

4.  **Move Pixels:** For each azure rectangle:
     - Find all background(color 0) cells that are adjacent to the azure rectangle.
     - For each available empty adjacent cell, select the first (reading order) single, non-adjactent pixel, move it to the empty cell, and set the pixel's original location to background (0).

5. If there are any remaining non-adjacent single pixels after iterating through all rectangles and all empty spots are filled, leave them in their original positions.
