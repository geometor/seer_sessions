            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code attempted to move single pixels adjacent to azure rectangles. However, the results indicate several discrepancies:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Movement:** The code doesn't correctly move single pixels to available adjacent spots. It seems to either miss moving them or moves the wrong pixel. Example 2 shows single pixel '7' is not moved and in example 3, the '4' pixel in the first row is not moved.\n2.  **Missing Logic:** The code doesn't account for the specific placement of moved pixels *around* the azure rectangles. Looking at the expected output, the single pixels appear to \"fill in\" spaces adjacent to the rectangle, taking up available spots in a somewhat predictable, possibly clockwise, order.\n3. It seems like a single pixel is only considered to move if it NOT already adjacent to a rectangle\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Refine Movement Logic:** Modify the code to correctly identify *all* single pixels that are not *already* adjacent to an azure rectangle.\n2.  **Prioritize Adjacent Spots:** Iterate through the *available* spaces around the azure rectangle, moving a non-adjacent single pixel into the space. Prioritize the single pixels based on something like reading order (top to bottom, left to right).\n3. **Iteration order:** The previous code found all valid empty spots and used pop(0). It might be better to find the locations in a clockwise or counter clockwise around the rectangle.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the errors:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Maroon (9) at (0,4) is correctly not moved, it is not a single pixel.\n    *   Magenta (6) at (6,0) is a single pixel and should move, but did not.\n    *   Yellow(4) at (9,5) is a single pixel and should move but did not\n    *   Three available spots adjacent to rectangle, at (3,4), (6,3), (6,4)\n    *   Expected output had moved 6 to (6,3), 4 to (6,4) and 9 to (3,4)\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Orange(7) at (0,4) correctly not moved (not single pixel)\n    *   Magenta(6) at (3,0) is single, should move\n    *   Red(2) at (5,9) is single, should move\n    *   Green(3) at (7,0) is single, should move\n    *   Blue(1) at (9,5) is single, should move.\n    *  There are four open adjacent spots around rectangle at (3,3),(3,6), (5,6) and (7,3)\n    *  Expected has: 6 moved to (3,3), 7 moved to (4,3), 2 moved to (5,6), 3 moved to (7,3), 1 moved to (8,3)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    * Yellow(4) at (0,3) - single pixel, should move\n    * Green(3) at (4,0) - single pixel, should move.\n    * Red(2) at (6,0) - single pixel, should move\n    * Red(2) at (7,9) - single pixel, should move\n    * Orange(7) at (9,3) - single pixel, should move\n    * Magenta(6) at (3,9) - single pixel, should move.\n    *  There are three open spots at (3,3), (3,6), (7,3).\n    *  Expected Output has: 4 to (3,3), 3 to (4,0), 2 to (6,0), 7 to (7,3), 2 to (7,4), 6 to (3,4).\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction**\n\n"
