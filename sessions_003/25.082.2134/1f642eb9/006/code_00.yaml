objects:
  - type: rectangle
    color: azure (8)
    size: 3x2 or 2x3
    role: anchor
    behavior: stationary

  - type: pixel
    size: 1x1
    role: mobile
    condition: not adjacent to any azure rectangle
    behavior: moves to an adjacent empty cell next to an azure rectangle
              if it exists

  - type: cell
    role: location
    states:
        - empty: value is 0
        - occupied: value is 1-9

actions:
  - name: move_single_pixel
    agent: single pixel not adjacent to an azure rectangle
    target: empty adjacent cell next to an azure rectangle
    precondition:
      - cell is empty (value 0)
      - cell is adjacent to an azure rectangle
      - pixel is a single pixel (1x1) and NOT of color 0
      - pixel is NOT already adjacent to any azure rectangle
    postcondition:
      - target cell now contains the pixel's original color.
      - original pixel location is now empty (value 0).
