The transformation seems to involve changing the color of gray (5) pixels to either red (2) or blue (1) based on their position and neighbors. The background (white/0) appears to remain unchanged. The key seems to be identifying a pattern or rule governing *which* gray pixels become red and which become blue. It appears the output maintains the shape (height/width) of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Two gray pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n    * **Alternating Colors:** Change the colors of these gray islands to red (2) and blue (1). The overall effect is like a \"checkerboard\". The top-left most pixel that is gray will set the color for that group, where the colors will alternate based on orthogonal adjacency (horizontal and vertical, but *not* diagonal).\n4. **Output:** The output grid is the result of these transformations.\n\nEssentially, the program identifies connected groups (islands) of gray pixels. It colors them red (2) or blue (1) in an alternating pattern. White pixels act as separators between these groups.\n"
