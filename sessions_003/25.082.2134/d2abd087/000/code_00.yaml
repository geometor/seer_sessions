objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: int
      - width: int
      - cells: list[list[int]]  # Each cell is a pixel with a color value.

  - name: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: int  # 0-9, representing colors.
      - row: int
      - col: int
      - neighbors: list[pixel]

actions:
  - name: change_color
    description: Changes the color of a pixel.
    parameters:
      - target: pixel
      - new_color: int

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - type: containment
    description: The grid contains pixels.
  - type: transformation
    description: input grid maps to output grid.

observations:
  - gray_pixels_change: All, and only, gray (5) pixels in the input change color in the output.
  - background_constant: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
  - shape_preserved: The dimensions (height and width) of the grid are the same in the input and output.
  - color_change_pattern: The color change of gray pixels (to red or blue) isn't random; a pattern must exist.
