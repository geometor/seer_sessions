  - task_id: 56dc2b01
    objects:
      - description: Connected regions of color 2 (red) and 3 (green).
        properties:
          - color: [2, 3] # Red and Green
          - behavior: "These objects are extracted and stacked."
    actions:
      - description: Extract objects of interest.
        details: "Identify all connected components of colors 2 and 3."
      - description: Determine bounding box.
        details: "Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices that encompass all objects of interest in the input grid"
      - description: Create azure bar.
        details: "Create a horizontal bar of color 8 (azure) with a width equal to the bounding box of all identified and extracted objects. The heigh of this bar is always 1."
      - description: Stack objects.
        details: "Stack the extracted objects below the azure bar, preserving their original horizontal order and placing them in the order they were found."
      - description: Adjust output grid size.
        details: "The output grid's height is determined by the objects. Its width is determined by the bounding box in the original grid."
    spatial_relationships:
      - description: "Objects maintain their relative horizontal positions."
      - description: "Azure bar is positioned below the stacked objects."
      - description: "Original empty rows above, below and between the stacked objects are maintained."
