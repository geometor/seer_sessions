"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct, contiguous regions (objects) of color 2 (red) and color 3 (green) in the input grid.
2.  **Compute Bounding Box:** Calculate a single bounding box that encompasses all red and green objects. The bounding box parameters are (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
3.  **Order Objects:** Maintain the original top-to-bottom row order of the objects as they appear in the input grid.
4.  **Clear Objects:** Set all pixels within the identified objects in the input grid to 0 (background) to clear them
5.  **Stack and Position Objects:**
    - Start at the top row of the bounding box.
    - Stack each identified object vertically, starting at the current row.
    - Maintain the original horizontal (column) position relative to the bounding box.
    - Move down by the height of the object.
6.  **Create Azure Bar:** Directly below the last stacked object, create a horizontal bar of color 8 (azure). The bar's width spans the entire width of the bounding box calculated in Step 2, and the height is 1.
7.  **Output Grid:** Create the output grid, initially filled with 0. Place the stacked objects and azure bar within the output grid as determined in steps 4 & 5.
