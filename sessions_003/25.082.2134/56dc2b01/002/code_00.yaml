example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: 3  # green
        shape: irregular
        bounding_box: (0, 1, 3, 3) # (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      - color: 2  # red
        shape: irregular
        bounding_box: (0, 10, 3, 10)
  output:
    objects:
      - color: 8  # azure
        shape: rectangle
        # bounding box encompases all other objects
        bounding_box: (0, 5, 3, 10)
    arrangement: |
        A new azure shape is created that spans the width of the combined bounding boxes of all objects in the input. The original objects are stacked below the azure shape, maintaining their relative horizontal positions. The order is not reversed and is stacked top to bottom.
