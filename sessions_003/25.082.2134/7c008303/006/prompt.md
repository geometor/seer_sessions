"""
1.  **Identify the Azure Line:** Find the horizontal line composed entirely of azure (8) pixels.

2.  **Separate Sections:** Divide the input grid into two sections based on the location of the azure line: a section *above* the line and a section *below* the line.

3.  **Process Sections Independently:**
    *   **Above the Azure Line:** If the section above the azure line exist, take pairs of adjacent rows. Interleave the pixels of each pair of rows. Treat the section as circular - so if there are an odd number of rows, the last row becomes adjacent with the first row.
        The interleaved rows reduce to half of the original columns, and two rows become one combined row.
    * **Below the Azure Line:** If the section below the azure line exists, take pairs of adjacent rows. Interleave the pixels of each pair of rows. Treat the section as circular - so if there are an odd number of rows, the last row becomes adjacent with the first row.
        The interleaved rows reduce to half of the original columns, and two rows become one combined row.

4. **Combine the sections:** The output is created by stacking the processed "above" section on top of the processed "below" section.

5. **Special case** If the entire grid is only an azure line, the output is blank.
