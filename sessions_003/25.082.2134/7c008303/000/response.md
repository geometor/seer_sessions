Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** Rectangular grids of varying dimensions, containing single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors.
*   **Output Grids:** Rectangular grids, seemingly smaller in dimensions than the input grids, also containing single-digit integers (colors).
*   **Dominant Features:** A horizontal line of '8' (azure) consistently appears in the input grids. This line seems to be a key element for the transformation. The output grids appear to preserve some color information above of the azure line. The other sections of the output are related with sections in the input below the azure line.
*   **Spatial Relationships:** The transformation seems to involve a spatial compression or summarization, focusing on regions defined in relation to the azure line.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0-9]
      - has_azure_line: true
      - dimensions: variable

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: smaller_than_input

  - object: azure_line
    type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - color: 8 (azure)
      - role: separator

  - action: spatial_compression
    description: Input grid is compressed vertically and horizontally, maintaining key colors, in relation to the azure line.

  - relationship:
    subject: output_grid
    predicate: represents_compressed_version_of
    object: input_grid

  - relationship:
      subject: azure_line
      predicate: divides
      object: input_grid_into_sections
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Separator:** Locate the horizontal line of '8' (azure) in the input grid. This line divides the input grid into two sections (top and bottom).

2. **Top section compression**: Create an empty output grid. For the section above the azure line in input, consider vertical pairs of numbers.
   * If they are not the same, put them in the output grid.
   * If they are the same, represent the pair as a zero in the output.

3.  **Bottom section compression**: For the section below the azure line in input, consider vertical pairs of numbers.
   * If they are not the same, put them in the output grid.
   * If they are the same, represent the pair as a zero in the output.

4. The height of the output section is defined by number of pairs in the original section.

5. The width of the output is defined by number of pairs in the original section.

In simple terms, we identify the horizontal azure line, take the numbers by pairs above, and create an output for them. And, do the same below.
