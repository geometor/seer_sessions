This line seems to be a key element for the transformation. The output grids appear to preserve some color information above of the azure line. The other sections of the output are related with sections in the input below the azure line.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The transformation seems to involve a spatial compression or summarization, focusing on regions defined in relation to the azure line.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This line divides the input grid into two sections (top and bottom).\n\n2. **Top section compression**: Create an empty output grid. For the section above the azure line in input, consider vertical pairs of numbers.\n   * If they are not the same, put them in the output grid.\n   * If they are the same, represent the pair as a zero in the output.\n\n3.  **Bottom section compression**: For the section below the azure line in input, consider vertical pairs of numbers.\n   * If they are not the same, put them in the output grid.\n   * If they are the same, represent the pair as a zero in the output.\n\n4. The height of the output section is defined by number of pairs in the original section.\n\n5. The width of the output is defined by number of pairs in the original section.\n\nIn simple terms, we identify the horizontal azure line, take the numbers by pairs above, and create an output for them.
