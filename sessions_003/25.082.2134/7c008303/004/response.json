            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize improvements.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of splitting the grid based on an azure line and then compressing paired rows has significant flaws. It's not consistently handling different input patterns, and the interleaving logic when rows differ isn't producing the expected results. The provided test cases highlight deviations in the generated output compared to the expected output. The size, pixel arrangement, and color palettes of the transformed outputs are all incorrect in the provided cases, suggesting a fundamental misunderstanding of the core transformation rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The initial assumption about the azure line being a simple divider is likely incorrect. We need to re-evaluate how the azure line (if it's relevant at all) relates to the transformation. It seems more complex interaction occur around the azure line.\n\n2.  **Focus on Local Relationships:** Instead of focusing on entire rows at once, examine the relationships between *adjacent* rows and how they change from input to output. The outputs often have fewer rows, and colors shift positions, suggesting some sort of row-wise comparison and combination.\n\n3.  **Pattern Recognition in Differences:** The cases where rows differ seem particularly important. The current interleaving logic is not correct. It appears that the differences between adjacent rows, or a feature that causes rows to change has some importance.\n\n4. **Consider 2x2 blocks**: Consider looking at 2x2 blocks for patterns\n\n**Metrics Gathering & Analysis:**\n\nLet's use code execution to gather more specific information about each example. I'll focus on the dimensions, presence/absence of the azure line, and a basic comparison of the input and expected output.\n\n"
