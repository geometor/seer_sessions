1.  **Object Identification:** Examine the input grid. Identify all contiguous regions (objects) of the same non-zero color.
2.  **Candidate Selection:** Among the identified objects, check if any have a bounding box that is exactly 3x3. If no 3x3 object exist, return the input grid unchanged.
3. **Ambiguity Handling:**
    - If there is only one 3x3, extract it
    - If there are multiple 3x3 objects:
        - In example 2, select the yellow object, select by color.
        - In example 3, the first 3x3 found seems correct. Prioritize based on first found in top-down, left-right scan.
4.  **Extraction:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Copy the selected 3x3 object from the input grid to the output grid, preserving its original shape and color. The relative position within the 3x3 bounding box should be maintained.
