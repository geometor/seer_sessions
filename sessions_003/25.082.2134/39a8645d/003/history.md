1. **Identify the Target Object:** In each input grid, identify the largest contiguous block (object) of a specific non-zero color. The target color changes in each example, and seems to be the uppermost and leftmost.
2. **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that completely encloses the target object. This defines the dimensions of the output.
3. **Create Output Grid:**  Create a new, empty grid with the dimensions of the bounding box determined in step 2.
4. **Copy and Extract:** Copy the target object from the input grid to the output grid, preserving its shape and color.  The position of the object within the bounding box in the input grid is preserved in the output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the core concept of extracting a contiguous object based on the uppermost/leftmost non-zero pixel. It also correctly implements the bounding box concept. However, there are errors in target selection and object positioning. Example 1 had an error with the return value of find_target_object, and in Example 2 there was a color mismatch and the wrong object selection. Example 3 was solved correctly, which indicates the basic logic of bounding box and extraction is sound when the correct target object is identified. The primary issues are consistently and correctly identifying *which* object to extract and making sure it's copied to the correct position in the output.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Improve Target Object Identification:** The current "uppermost and leftmost" rule is insufficient. We need a more robust rule to select the correct contiguous object, taking into account all examples. It may involve color, size, or relative position to other objects.
2.  **Verify Bounding Box and Object Placement**: Double-check the bounding box calculation and ensure the identified object maintains its original relative position within the bounding box when copied to the output.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and prior results):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (14, 14)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (1,1)
    *   Target Color (Expected): 8 (azure)
    *   Target Color (Actual): 8 (azure)
    *   Error: Incorrect bounding box and object extraction. Only a single pixel extracted instead of 3x3 block.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (14, 14)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Target Color (Expected): 4 (yellow)
    *   Target Color (Actual): 1 (blue)
    *   Error: Incorrect target object selected. Selected the blue object instead of the yellow.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (14, 14)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Target Color (Expected): 8 (azure)
    *   Target Color (Actual): 8 (azure)
    *   Error: None.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Potential Target Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all distinct contiguous objects (blocks of connected pixels of the same non-zero color).
2. **Select Target**: For each example, find a 3x3 object that is the focus of the transformation.
3.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that completely encloses the target object.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, empty grid with the dimensions of the bounding box (always 3x3 in these examples).
5.  **Copy and Extract:** Copy the target object from the input grid to the output grid, preserving its shape and color. The position of the object within the bounding box in the input grid is preserved in the output grid.
