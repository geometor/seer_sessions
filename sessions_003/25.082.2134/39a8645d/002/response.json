            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core concept of extracting a contiguous object based on the uppermost/leftmost non-zero pixel. It also correctly implements the bounding box concept. However, there are errors in target selection and object positioning. Example 1 had an error with the return value of find_target_object, and in Example 2 there was a color mismatch and the wrong object selection. Example 3 was solved correctly, which indicates the basic logic of bounding box and extraction is sound when the correct target object is identified. The primary issues are consistently and correctly identifying *which* object to extract and making sure it's copied to the correct position in the output.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Improve Target Object Identification:** The current \"uppermost and leftmost\" rule is insufficient. We need a more robust rule to select the correct contiguous object, taking into account all examples. It may involve color, size, or relative position to other objects.\n2.  **Verify Bounding Box and Object Placement**: Double-check the bounding box calculation and ensure the identified object maintains its original relative position within the bounding box when copied to the output.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and prior results):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (14, 14)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (1,1)\n    *   Target Color (Expected): 8 (azure)\n    *   Target Color (Actual): 8 (azure)\n    *   Error: Incorrect bounding box and object extraction. Only a single pixel extracted instead of 3x3 block.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (14, 14)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Target Color (Expected): 4 (yellow)\n    *   Target Color (Actual): 1 (blue)\n    *   Error: Incorrect target object selected. Selected the blue object instead of the yellow.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (14, 14)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Target Color (Expected): 8 (azure)\n    *   Target Color (Actual): 8 (azure)\n    *   Error: None.\n\n**YAML Fact Base:**\n\n"
