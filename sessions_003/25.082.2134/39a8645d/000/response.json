The input grids are relatively large and sparse, with many '0' (white) cells. The output grids are significantly smaller and seem to contain a condensed version of a specific colored object from the input. The key seems to be isolating a particular object based on its color and possibly its shape, discarding everything else.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The target color seems to change with each example, it appears to the uppermost, leftmost non-zero color.\n\n2. **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that completely encloses the target object. This defines the dimensions of the output.\n\n3. **Create Output Grid:**  Create a new, empty grid with the dimensions of the bounding box determined in step 2.\n\n4. **Copy and Extract:** Copy the target object from the input grid to the output grid, preserving its shape and color.  The position of the object within the bounding box in the input grid is preserved in the output grid.\n"
