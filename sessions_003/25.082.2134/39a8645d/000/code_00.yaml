objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 14x14, 3x3)
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: a single digit (e.g., 8, 4)
      - shape: contiguous block of same-colored cells
      - bounding_box: smallest rectangle enclosing the object

actions:
  - identify_target_object: selects an object based on color and shape
  - extract_bounding_box: determines the smallest rectangular area containing the target object
  - create_output_grid: generates a new grid with the dimensions of the bounding box
  - copy_object: transfers the target object from the input grid to the output grid

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains multiple objects of different colors
  - target_object: a specific object within the input grid, defined by color
  - output_grid: contains only the extracted target object
