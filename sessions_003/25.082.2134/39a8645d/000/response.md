Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of digits (0-9), where each digit represents a color. The input grids are relatively large and sparse, with many '0' (white) cells. The output grids are significantly smaller and seem to contain a condensed version of a specific colored object from the input. The key seems to be isolating a particular object based on its color and possibly its shape, discarding everything else.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 14x14, 3x3)
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: a single digit (e.g., 8, 4)
      - shape: contiguous block of same-colored cells
      - bounding_box: smallest rectangle enclosing the object

actions:
  - identify_target_object: selects an object based on color and shape
  - extract_bounding_box: determines the smallest rectangular area containing the target object
  - create_output_grid: generates a new grid with the dimensions of the bounding box
  - copy_object: transfers the target object from the input grid to the output grid

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains multiple objects of different colors
  - target_object: a specific object within the input grid, defined by color
  - output_grid: contains only the extracted target object
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Target Object:** In each input grid, identify the largest contiguous block (object) of a specific non-zero color.  The target color seems to change with each example, it appears to the uppermost, leftmost non-zero color.

2. **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that completely encloses the target object. This defines the dimensions of the output.

3. **Create Output Grid:**  Create a new, empty grid with the dimensions of the bounding box determined in step 2.

4. **Copy and Extract:** Copy the target object from the input grid to the output grid, preserving its shape and color.  The position of the object within the bounding box in the input grid is preserved in the output grid.
