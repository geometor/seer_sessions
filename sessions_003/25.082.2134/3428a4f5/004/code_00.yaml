objects:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
      - cells: Individual elements of the grid, each with a color value.

  - name: separator_line
    description: A horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - row_index: The row index where the separator line is located.

  - name: red_blob
    description: A connected component of red (2) pixels.  Two red pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - pixels: A set of (row, col) coordinates representing the pixels belonging to the blob.
      - size: The number of pixels in the blob.

  - name: largest_red_blob
    description: The red blob with the maximum number of pixels located *above* the separator line.
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - pixels: Coordinates of pixels.
      - size: Number of pixels.
