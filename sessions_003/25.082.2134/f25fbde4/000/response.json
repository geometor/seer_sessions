The transformation appears to involve finding the bounding box for the input object, and inflating it by one pixel top, bottom, left and right.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Consider these pixels as forming a single, potentially irregular, object.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the yellow pixels. This defines a rectangular bounding box around the yellow shape.\n\n3.  **Inflate the Bounding Box:** Create the output grid.\n    -   Expand the boundaries on the left and right side by one pixel.\n    -   Expand the boundaries on the top and bottom by one pixel.\n    -   Fill the grid formed by the rectangle with yellow.\n\n4.
