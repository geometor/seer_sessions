observations:
  - object: yellow_shape
    description: A contiguous region of yellow pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      bounding_box: Defines the rectangular extent of the shape.
    actions:
      - identify: Locate the yellow pixels.
      - bound: Determine the minimum and maximum row/column indices.
      - inflate: Expand the bounding box by one pixel in all directions.

  - object: output_grid
    description: A new grid representing the transformed output.
    properties:
      dimensions: Determined by the inflated bounding box of the yellow shape, relative to the input.
      content: Contains a copy of the input, but the yellow shape's bounding box is inflated by one in all directions.
    actions:
      - create: Generate a new grid.
      - populate: Copy pixels from input, make all pixels in inflated bounding box yellow.

  - task: transformation
    input: A 2D grid of color values.
    output: A 2D grid of color values, with yellow shape's box inflated.
    rules:
      - Find the yellow shape in input.
      - Extract the region of input grid that is the inflated bounding box.
      - In the output grid, make pixels within the original bounding box yellow.
