1.  **Identify Diagonals:** For each non-zero color pixel in the input grid, check for a second diagonal of the same color.

2.  **Locate Intersection:** Identify the intersection of the second diagonal.

3.  **Change to yellow:** If the intersecting pixel is white (0), change it to yellow (4) in the output grid.

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
