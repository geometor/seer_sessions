facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids are of the same dimensions.
  - observation: All examples have numbers on diagonals.
  - object: Non-zero pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Varies (red, maroon, green in the examples).
      position: Defined by row and column indices.
    actions:
      change_adjacent_pixel: |
        A pixel on the second diagonal of the same color is changed to yellow color.
    relationships:
      - "adjacent to: zero-valued pixels"
  - object: Zero-valued pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: white (0).
      position: Defined by row and column indices.
    actions:
      potentially_modified: Some zero-valued pixels change to yellow (4) in the output.
    relationships:
      - "adjacent to: non-zero pixels"
  - object: Yellow pixels in output
    properties:
      color: Yellow
      position: Appears at intersections of diagonals defined by other single color
