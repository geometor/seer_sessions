The most noticeable change is the consistent appearance of yellow (4) pixels in the output grids where there were none in the input. The location of the yellow pixels seems related to the non-zero pixels. The changed pixel appears to be adjacent to diagonal lines of similar colors.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
