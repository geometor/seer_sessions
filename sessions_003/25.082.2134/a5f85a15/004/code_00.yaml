objects:
  - name: diagonal
    description: A sequence of two or more connected pixels of the same color extending diagonally.
    properties:
      color: The color of the pixels in the diagonal.
      direction: Top-left to bottom-right, or top-right to bottom-left.
      coordinates: A list of (row, column) tuples representing the pixels in the diagonal.
      length: number of pixels
  - name: intersection
    description: A point where two or more diagonals of the same color meet.
    properties:
      color: The color of the intersecting diagonals.
      coordinate: A (row, column) tuple representing the location of the intersection.

actions:
