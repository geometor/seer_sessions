            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was a good first attempt, implementing the core concept of identifying a central object, determining border/inner colors, and expanding it. However, the execution reveals errors in the border expansion and inner fill logic. The transformed outputs consistently show an incorrect border and an incomplete inner fill.\n\nThe primary strategy to resolve these errors involves:\n\n1.  **Precise Border Handling:** Re-evaluate how the border is expanded. The current logic seems to extend the original border incorrectly, leading to extra or misplaced border pixels. We need to ensure the border expansion precisely replaces the original, single layer with the correct color, in all cases including where inner color != border color\n2.  **Accurate Inner Fill:** The inner fill logic isn't correctly propagating the inner color. We need to ensure that *all* pixels within the expanded boundaries (excluding the new border) are set to the inner color.\n3. **Edge Case Consideration:** Ensure the solution gracefully handles the task's main input that does not contain any objects - right now the `transform` handles a central object by returning the output_grid.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution)**\n\nSince the results are already provided in a structured format, using tool_code would mostly involve parsing that structure - which can be handled effectively by the model here. I have reproduced the key metrics below:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels off: 5\n    *   Size correct: True\n    *   Color palette correct: True\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels off: 24\n    *   Size correct: True\n    *   Color palette correct: True\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels off: 24\n    *   Size correct: True\n    *   Color palette correct: True\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"

This defines the \"central object.\"\n\n2.  **Determine Border and Inner Colors:**\n    *   The \"border color\" is the color of the pixel at the top-left corner of the central object's bounding box.\n    *   If the central object has a width and height greater than 2, the \"inner color\" is the color of the pixel one step inward from the top-left corner of the bounding box.\n    *   Otherwise, if the width or height is 2 or less, the \"inner color\" is the same as the \"border color.\"\n\n3.  **Expand the Bounding Box:** Increase the size of the bounding box by one pixel in all four directions (up, down, left, right). This creates a new, larger rectangle. The dimensions increase by two in each direction (height + 2, width + 2).\n\n4.  **Fill the Expanded Region:**\n    * All cells that fall *within* the expanded bounding box, but were *outside* the original bounding box, are filled with the border color.\n    * All cells that fall *within* the expanded bounding box, and are *not* part of the border, are filled with the inner color.\n\n5.  **Preserve Unchanged Pixels:** All pixels outside the expanded bounding box remain unchanged from their original values in the input grid.\n6. If there are no objects, return the original input grid unchanged.\n"
