Okay, let's analyze these input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (10x10 in all provided examples).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors.
*   There's a central "object" in each input grid, composed of a rectangular block of one color surrounding a single pixel or a smaller rectangle of another color.
*   The output grid seems to expand this central object, maintaining its general shape but "inflating" it.
* The surrounding '0' (white) pixels remain mostly unchanged, except where the central object expands into them.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: central_object
    properties:
      shape: rectangle
      border_color: [4, 2, 3] # Yellow, Red, Green in examples
      inner_color: [6, 7, 1] # Magenta, Orange, Blue in examples
      position: centered_horizontally

  - name: background
    properties:
      color: 0 # White

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: central_object
    description: The central object expands outwards, maintaining its rectangular shape.

relationships:
  - object1: central_object
    object2: background
    relation: contained_within
    description: The central object is surrounded by the background.
  - object: central_object
    property: inner_color
    relation: inside
    description: one color inside the central object.
  - object: central_object
    property: boarder_color
    relation: surrounds
    description: another color surrounding the inner color

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the rectangular "central object" in the input grid. This object is defined by a contiguous block of pixels of the same color (the "border color"), potentially surrounding one or more pixels of a different color (the "inner color").

2.  Expand the central object outwards by one layer.

3. The border grows, one layer, maintaining its color.

4.  The inner color also grows to fill the expanded region, maintaining the overall rectangular shape. The new layer created by expansion will have the same inner color as the central object, except where the central object had a border, the new extended layer will have the same border.

5.  All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.
