The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), green (3) and magenta (6) and yellow (4). The most prominent objects are contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. The bottom row of the input appears to function as a kind of key, signaling the color that replaces the other. In the first example the red (2) is replaced with yellow (4) which is the signal color on the input bottom row. In the second example, green (3) is replaced by magenta(6).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
