1.  **Identify the Signal Color:** Determine the color of the pixel located in the bottom-left corner of the input grid. This is the "signal color".
2.  **Iterate Through Grid:** Examine each pixel in the input grid, one by one.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each pixel:
    *   If the pixel's color is *not* white (0) AND the pixel's color is *not* equal to the signal color, then change the pixel's color to the signal color.
    *   Otherwise if pixel is white, leave as-is
    *   Otherwise, it is the signal color, leave as-is
