objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 9x9, 9x9, 9x9 in the examples)
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 1 x variable
      - values: integers (0-1)
  - type: object
    properties:
      - name: blue_object
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - shape: contiguous block of 1s

actions:
  - name: count_blue_objects
    description: Counts the number of distinct, contiguous blue (1) regions in the input grid.
  - name: create_output
    description: Creates an output array where each blue region is represented by a 1.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains multiple blue_objects.
  - output_grid represents a count of blue objects, maybe with additional logic
