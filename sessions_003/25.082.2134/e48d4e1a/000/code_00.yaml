objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of digits (0-9)
    properties:
      - height: 10
      - width: 10
  - type: pixel
    description: Individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - color: represented by a digit (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: line_segment
    description: contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color
    properties:
      - color: represented by a digit
      - start_position: (row, column)
      - end_position: (row, column)
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical

transformations:
  - type: shift_column_to_row
    description: Transforms a vertical column of a specific color into a horizontal line of the same color.
    parameters:
      - source_color: The color of the vertical column to be transformed.
      - line_row_input: the row of the single-color line in the input
      - line_row_output: the row of the single-color line in the output

relationships:
    - input_grid contains multiple pixel objects.
    - output_grid contains multiple pixel objects.
    - input and output pixel have a positional relationship based on the transformation rule.
