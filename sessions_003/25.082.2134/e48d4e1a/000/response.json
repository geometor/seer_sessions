The transformation seems to involve a specific rearrangement of a single color within the grid, while a horizontal line of the same color remains unchanged. The key feature is a vertical column of a specific color in the input, which is transformed into a horizontal line segment of the *same* color in the output. The position of this horizontal line segment seems related to the position of the single-color horizontal line in the input. The remaining cells seem to be filled with zeros. There appears to be some kind of shifting and/or selective copying. The constant 5 at the (0,9) position doesn't appear on the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts)**\n\n"
