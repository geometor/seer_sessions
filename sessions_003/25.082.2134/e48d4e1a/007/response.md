1. Identify Objects: Find all vertical line segments within the input grid. Note their starting and ending row, column, and color.
2. Select Target Segment: From the vertical segments, we select the segment whose color is *not* 5.
3. Move Segment: Move the selected vertical line segment to the top of the grid (row 0). The new column of the moved segment is the original column of the *horizontal* section of the original selected vertical segment.
4. Transform to Horizontal Segment: A horizontal segment is drawn from column 0 to the original column of the vertical segment. This horizontal line is at the top of the grid (row 0). The color of the new horizontal line is the same as the vertical segment.
5. Clear Segment 2: Clear the second vertical line segment (of color 5) by replacing all its pixels with 0.
6. Output: Return the modified grid.
