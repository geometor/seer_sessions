objects:
  - name: vertical_line
    type: line_segment
    properties:
      orientation: vertical
      color: variable (2, 4, 6, or 3 in the examples)
      length: variable
      column_index: variable
      start_row: variable
      end_row: variable

  - name: horizontal_line_input
    type: line_segment
    properties:
      orientation: horizontal
      color: same as vertical_line
      length: full width of grid
      row_index: variable

  - name: horizontal_line_output
    type: line_segment
    properties:
      orientation: horizontal
      color: same as vertical_line
      length: variable, extends from column 0 to the column index of the vertical line.
      row_index: variable, derived from position of vertical line.
      start_row: derived
      start_col: 0
      end_col: column index of the vertical line

actions:
  - name: find_vertical_line
    description: Identifies the vertical line segment in the input grid.

  - name: find_horizontal_line
    description: Identifies a horizontal line of same color as vertical line.

  - name: create_output_horizontal_line
    description: Creates a new horizontal line in output.  The line starts
      at the (0,0) corner and extends to the right, up to and including the
      column where the input vertical line segment was located. The row
      of this new horizontal line is the same row as the topmost pixel in the
      vertical line.

  - name: move_vertical_line
    description: The original vertical line is moved to a new column in the
      output grid. The new location is the x coordinate of the top-most point
      in the identified vertical line.
