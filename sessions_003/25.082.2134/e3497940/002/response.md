Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and code correctly identify the gray line and the intention to preserve adjacent pixels of colored objects to the left of the gray line. However, the code isn't accurately handling the "cropping" or "preserving" logic. It seems to be preserving *all* pixels to the left of the gray line if at least one pixel in their shape is adjacent, and is missing part of each object to the *right* of adjacent pixels. The results consistently show missing or incorrect pixels, especially with objects that extend horizontally across multiple columns.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Adjacency Check:** The current adjacency check is too broad. It keeps entire objects if *any* part of the object is adjacent to the gray line. We need to restrict this to only keep the *individual pixels* that are directly adjacent.
2. **Adjust output width:** Because we're keeping only a subset of pixels, we should expect that output width is the distance from the gray line to the leftmost non-zero pixel which is adjacent to the gray line.
3.  **Re-evaluate Cropping Logic:** The concept of "cropping" needs to be clarified. The current implementation isn't correctly removing non-adjacent parts of objects. We are actually removing any parts of objects which are right of the gray line, and keeping those parts to the left.
4. **Object definition review:** the `get_objects` function works as expect to find objects as collections of adjacent pixels with the same color.

**Gather Metrics and Analysis:**

I'll use manual analysis for this step, as direct code execution is cumbersome for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparisons in this response format. The previous `tool_code` output already shows the necessary input/output/expected grids.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Pixels Off: 4
    *   Size Correct: True
    *   Issue: The yellow '4' and green '3' are not being fully cropped. One pixel of both objects is not adjacent, yet are included in the output, while the other pixel not adjacent, is not.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Pixels Off: 7
    *   Size Correct: True
    *   Issue: Similar to Example 1, parts of the blue '2' are adjacent, but all pixels to the left of the gray line are preserved, others not. Same problem with the '6'.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Pixels Off: 7
    *   Size Correct: True
    *   Issue: The azure '8' and orange '7' are not preserved correctly, same problem as the other examples.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - description: Vertical gray line
    color: gray (5)
    role: Separator
    behavior: Divides the input grid

  - description: Colored objects to the left of the gray line
    colors: Variable (yellow, green, blue, magenta, azure, orange)
    role: Targets for transformation
    behavior:  Pixels adjacent to the gray line are preserved; other are removed.
    properties:
        adjacency: horizontal or vertical, not diagonal

transformation_rule:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify gray line column index
  - step: 2
    action: Iterate through all pixels
    condition: pixel is to the left of the gray line
    sub_action: Check for horizontal or vertical adjacency of the current pixel to any gray pixel in the gray line column.

output:
  - description: Contains only the preserved adjacent pixels of the original colored objects, maintaining their original row positions. The gray line itself is not part of the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Gray Line:** Identify the vertical column composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Iterate through pixels left of the gray line:** check pixels in any colored objects.
3.  **Check Adjacency:** For each pixel in objects to the left of the gray line:
    *   Check if the pixel is *directly adjacent* (horizontally or vertically, *not* diagonally) to *any* pixel in the gray line.
    *  If it IS adjacent: Preserve the pixel.
    *  If it is NOT adjacent: remove the pixel.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid. Copy all preserved adjacent pixels from the objects, maintaining their row positions.
5. **Determine Output width:** the width of the output grid will equal the number of columns between and including the leftmost preserved pixel, and the gray line.
