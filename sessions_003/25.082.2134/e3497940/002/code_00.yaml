objects:
  - description: Vertical gray line
    color: gray (5)
    role: Separator
    behavior: Divides the input grid

  - description: Colored objects to the left of the gray line
    colors: Variable (yellow, green, blue, magenta, azure, orange)
    role: Targets for transformation
    behavior:  Pixels adjacent to the gray line are preserved; other are removed.
    properties:
        adjacency: horizontal or vertical, not diagonal

transformation_rule:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify gray line column index
  - step: 2
    action: Iterate through all pixels
    condition: pixel is to the left of the gray line
    sub_action: Check for horizontal or vertical adjacency of the current pixel to any gray pixel in the gray line column.

output:
  - description: Contains only the preserved adjacent pixels of the original colored objects, maintaining their original row positions. The gray line itself is not part of the output.
