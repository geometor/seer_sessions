All other objects are to the left of the gray pixels. The output grid has a reduced width.\n*   **Object Interaction:** The gray (5) pixels seems to be the key. Objects to the left of it, touching it, are preserved in some way.\n* **Output:** The gray vertical line is removed in the output. The objects touching it are maintained but the other parts are removed.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

Remove all other parts.\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by arranging the preserved portions of the colored objects, maintaining their relative vertical positions from the input grid. The width of the output will be the maximum x value of any of the colored objects, excluding any part which was to the right of a preserved pixel.\n\nEssentially, the gray line acts as a \"filter\". Only the pixels of colored objects directly \"touching\" this line are passed through to the output, and everything to the right of the line are removed.\n"
