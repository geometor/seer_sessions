Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements**

*   **Common Elements:** All input grids have a vertical line of gray (5) pixels. All other objects are to the left of the gray pixels. The output grid has a reduced width.
*   **Object Interaction:** The gray (5) pixels seems to be the key. Objects to the left of it, touching it, are preserved in some way.
* **Output:** The gray vertical line is removed in the output. The objects touching it are maintained but the other parts are removed.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: gray_line
    color: gray (5)
    shape: vertical line
    position: varies, but always present
    property: acts as a separator

  - name: colored_objects
    color: varies (yellow, green, red, magenta, azure, maroon)
    shape: irregular, contiguous blocks
    position: always to the left of the gray_line
    property: Some parts are preserved, other parts are removed.

actions:
  - name: remove_gray_line
    target: gray_line
    result: gray_line is absent in output

  - name: preserve_touching_parts
    target: colored_objects
    condition: adjacent to gray_line
    result: only parts of colored_objects directly touching the gray_line are present in the output. Other parts are removed.

relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      from: colored_objects
      to: gray_line
      property: Determines which parts are kept
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the gray line:** Find the vertical line of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Remove the gray line:** The output will not include this.
3.  **Identify the colored objects** the objects on the left of the gray line
4.  **Preserve and Crop:** For each colored object, keep only the pixels that are *directly adjacent* (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to the gray line. Remove all other parts.
5.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by arranging the preserved portions of the colored objects, maintaining their relative vertical positions from the input grid. The width of the output will be the maximum x value of any of the colored objects, excluding any part which was to the right of a preserved pixel.

Essentially, the gray line acts as a "filter". Only the pixels of colored objects directly "touching" this line are passed through to the output, and everything to the right of the line are removed.
