1.  **Find the Gray Line:** Identify the vertical column composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Iterate through pixels left of the gray line:** check pixels in any colored objects.
3.  **Check Adjacency:** For each pixel in objects to the left of the gray line:
    *   Check if the pixel is *directly adjacent* (horizontally or vertically, *not* diagonally) to *any* pixel in the gray line.
    *  If it IS adjacent: Preserve the pixel.
    *  If it is NOT adjacent: remove the pixel.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid. Copy all preserved adjacent pixels from the objects, maintaining their row positions.
5. **Determine Output width:** the width of the output grid will equal the number of columns between and including the leftmost preserved pixel, and the gray line.

Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The current code focuses on preserving pixels of objects to the left of a vertical gray line *if* they are directly adjacent to the gray line. The width of the output is determined by the leftmost preserved pixel's distance to the grey line. This approach works partially, but fails to accurately capture all the nuances of the transformations, particularly concerning which parts of the objects get preserved and why. The provided examples indicate that not all pixels are kept the same, parts get removed from them.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the differences between the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` in each example. Pay close attention to the pixels that are missing or incorrectly included.
2.  **Refine Adjacency Rule:** The current adjacency rule seems too strict. We need to determine a more precise condition for pixel preservation and how this relates to the gray line.
3.  **Re-evaluate Output Width:** While the output width calculation seems correct conceptually, there might be edge cases or subtle adjustments needed.
4.  **Object-Centric View:** Consider the objects as holistic entities. Instead of just focusing on individual pixel adjacency, think about how the gray line interacts with *entire objects*. Are entire objects removed, resized, or parts preserved?
5.  **Use Code Execution:** Use the given examples to execute code to confirm any calculated assumptions.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**

Here I am just checking on the previous outputs to see the shape, the gray line column, and the colors. This seems to all be working as expected in the current code.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Gray Line:** Find the vertical column composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.

2.  **Locate Objects:** Identify all contiguous blocks of non-black, non-gray pixels to the *left* of the gray line.

3.  **Preserve based on Adjacency and Connectedness to object adjacent to the gray line:**
    *   Iterate through each object to the left of the gray line
    *   If the object contains any pixels adjacent to the gray line, keep *only* the connected component of pixels of that object which are connected to the part of the object adjacent to the gray line.
    *  If the object has no pixels adjacent, remove the whole object.

4.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid with the same height as the input grid.

5. **Determine output width:** The output grid width is determined by the distance from column 0 to the gray line.

6. **Populate the Output Grid:** Copy the *preserved* parts of objects from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their original row positions and column positions relative to the gray line.
