            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a good start, focusing on identifying a \"seed\" pixel in the last row and expanding it. However, it's clear from the errors in all three examples that the expansion logic and, specifically, the alternating color pattern are not correctly implemented. The core issue lies in how the code handles the alternation of colors to the left and right of the seed pixel, especially the wrapping around logic (black/5). The last row also seems to have additional rules.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Pattern:** Carefully analyze the input/output pairs again to *precisely* define the color alternation rule. Pay close attention to the seed pixel's position and how the colors (seed color, 5, and 0) are placed relative to it.\n2.  **Correct Alternation:** Revise the `transform` function's expansion logic (both left and right) to correctly implement the identified pattern.\n3.  **Last Row Special Rule:** Investigate the last row more closely. It doesn't seem to perfectly follow the same rule as other rows, especially when close to the borders. Isolate its behavior.\n4.    Use numpy for efficiency, instead of loops.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\nI will use a `tool_code` block to collect some specific data points to pinpoint the exact issues:\n\n"
