objects:
  - name: seed_pixel
    description: The single non-black pixel in the last row of the input grid.
    properties:
      x: horizontal position (column index)
      color: color value (integer 0-9)

  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
    properties:
      width: number of columns
      height: number of rows
      cells: individual pixel values

actions:
  - name: find_seed
    description: Locates the seed pixel in the input grid.
    input: grid
    output: seed_pixel

  - name: expand_pattern
    description:  Creates the output grid by expanding a pattern from the seed pixel.
    input: seed_pixel, grid
    output: grid
    rules:
      - "All rows except the last follow the same pattern."
      - "The pattern starts with the seed pixel's color at the seed pixel's x-coordinate."
      - "To the right of the seed pixel, the pattern alternates between the seed color and 5."
      - "To the left of the seed pixel, the pattern alternates between 0 and the seed color, then gray(5), repeating."
      - "The last row has a modified version of this pattern."
      - "If the x coordinate is even, the pattern to the right is seed_color, 0, seed_color"
      - "If the x coordinate is odd, the pattern to the right is seed_color, 5, seed_color"
      - "On the last row moving right, stop one short of the pattern that would occur for other rows"
      - "On the last row, replace what would be 0 based on the above rule, with gray(5)"
