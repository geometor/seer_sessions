objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 10
      columns: 10
      cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - name: seed_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      x: x-coordinate (column index) in the last row
      color: integer (0-9) representing color
      is_seed: True  # Marks this pixel as the source of the transformation

  - name: output_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      x: x-coordinate
      y: y-coordinate
      color: integer (0-9) representing color
      relative_x: difference between output_pixel.x and seed_pixel.x

actions:
  - name: find_seed
    input: grid
    output: seed_pixel
    description: Locates the non-black pixel in the last row of the grid.

  - name: generate_pattern
    input: seed_pixel
    output: 2D array (pattern)
    description: Creates a repeating pattern based on seed_pixel.color and seed_pixel.x. The seed color alternates with black and grey.

  - name: apply_pattern
    input: grid, pattern
    output: transformed_grid
    description: Replaces the entire input grid with the generated pattern. The last row is slightly modified.
