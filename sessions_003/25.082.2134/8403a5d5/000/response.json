The transformation expands this single colored pixel into a repeating pattern in the output grid. The pattern seems to alternate the original color with grey (5) and then copy the color again. The pattern extends across the entire row and also propagates upwards through all rows of the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"

Note its color (C).\n\n2.  **Create the repeating sequence:** Construct a repeating sequence for each row based on the position of the colored pixel in the input: `[black, black, ..., C, grey, C, black, C, grey, C, black, ...]` The position of C, gray, C and black should depend on original location, and grey(5) appear on the right or left of 'C' if the column of 'C' is even or odd, respectively.\n\n3.   **Fill all rows:** Apply this sequence to every row in the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the input's colored pixel dictates the color used in the output grid's repeating pattern. The position of the colored pixel define the start of a sequence. The pattern fills the entire output grid, row by row.\n"
