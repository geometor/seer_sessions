The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a manipulation of rows, specifically, a repositioning or duplication of certain rows based on their color/digit value. The bottom section of the output grid contains rows that exist in the input grid, but their order and/or location have changed.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Ignore rows that have the color white (value '0').\n2.  **Reorder/Duplicate:** Extract all the rows that are not the color white, reverse the block of non-white rows.\n3.  **Construct Output:** Create the *output* grid using the original input rows, overwriting the last n rows with the reversed block, where n = count of non-white rows found in step 1.\n\nIn essence, the non-white rows at the top of the input grid are extracted, reversed in their vertical stacking order, and then placed at the bottom of the output grid.\n"
