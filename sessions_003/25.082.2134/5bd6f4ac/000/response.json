A significant portion of the input grid is filled with 0s (white).\n*   **Output:** The output is a much smaller grid compared to the input. It appears to be a selection of specific rows and columns (or parts of them) from the input, seemingly excluding a lot of 0s. The output consistently maintains a rectangular shape.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve extracting a sub-grid from the input. The selected sub-grid appears to be the top-right non-zero 3x3 section in each of the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
