facts:
  - task: "Identify and modify multi-colored edge objects."
  - observation_1: "The code identifies multi-colored objects touching the grid's edges."
  - observation_2: "The current implementation creates a new blank grid instead of modifying the input grid in place."
  - observation_3: "The expected output shows modified objects within the original grid structure."
  - observation_4: "In example 1, a multi-colored object (colors 1, 8, 5, 4) on the bottom edge should change to red (color code 2). Other pixels are expected to remain unchanged."
  - observation_5: "In example 2, a multi-colored object (colors 1,3,6) on the right edge is expected to change partially to color 2 around color 6, preserving color 6, which is adjacent to the right edge."
  - observation_6: "In example 3, a multi-colored object (colors 5,3,6) on the bottom edge, near the center of the edge is expected to chane to color 2 around color 3, preserving color 3, which is adjacent to the edge."
  - observation_7: "The color replacement rule is not simply 'red' but should depend on existing colors on the edge, we should preserve the non-black color on the edge object adjacent to the bottom border"
  - action: "Modify a multi-colored object touching the edge, using a non-black edge pixel color of this object"
  - constraint: "Modification must happen in place on the original grid."
