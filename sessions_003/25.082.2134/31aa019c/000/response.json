The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color substitution or mirroring/rotation. Instead, it appears to focus on specific regions or objects within the input grid and modifies them based on certain criteria. There's a strong indication of objectness being key as contigous block of one color. A key element appears to be the creation of shapes of color 'red' (2) in the output. The source of these in input vary.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Identify \"objects\", and then select the objects that include pixels at edges of the grid, and have pixels with more than one color.\n\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with 0 (white).\n\n3. **Create shapes**: replace target object's pixels with the value of the pixels that are at the grid edge. If there are multiple such pixels, use the pixel at the lowest edge.\n\n4.  **Transfer:** Copy the object of red pixel to the output grid in the same position as the target object.\n\n5.  **Final Output:** The modified grid is the final output.\n"
