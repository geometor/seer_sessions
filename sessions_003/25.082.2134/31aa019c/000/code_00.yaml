facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The output grid is mostly empty (filled with color 0/white).
  - observation: The output grid contains shapes of red, color 2.
  - observation: Input example 1, bottom shape including 4,5,8 becomes red 2s shape.
  - observation: Input example 2, right side object including 1,6,9 turns into a red 2s shape.
  - observation: Input example 3, right side object including 2,3,5,6 turns into a red 2s shape.
  - hypothesis: Red shapes in the output replace specific multi-colored objects in the input.
  - hypothesis: Multi-colored shapes which includes pixels at the grid edges become solid color 2, i.e. red, shape in the output grid.
