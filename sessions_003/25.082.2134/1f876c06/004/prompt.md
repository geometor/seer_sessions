The transformation rule involves moving non-zero pixels in the input grid to new positions in the output grid. 
These new positions lie on diagonals, with the constraint that the sum of their row and column indices 
equals the sum of the original row and column indices of the input pixel. The pixels are moved in such a way 
that, the output cell's row index is always less than or equal to its column index.
