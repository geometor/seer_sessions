            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for resolving the errors in the transformations.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were based on the observation of a diagonal shifting pattern. However, the results on the additional training examples reveal that the logic is incomplete. The code only considers placing pixels at `k <= l`, which creates an upper triangular matrix bias. This is incorrect, as the output examples show that pixels can also occupy positions where `k > l`. Moreover, the filling order isn't simply about the sum of row and column indices but involves a more complex arrangement of these diagonals.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** Analyze each input/output/transformed output triplet. We need to carefully observe:\n    *   The original positions of non-zero pixels in the input.\n    *   Their corresponding positions in the expected output.\n    *   How the current code's transformed output deviates.\n    * The relationship among the objects in the input, output and transformed.\n\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Based on the metrics, adjust our understanding of the transformation rule. The key is to identify the correct order in which the diagonals are filled and how pixels are distributed along those diagonals. The idea of diagonals is not wrong but the order needs to be corrected.\n\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Formulate a more precise description of the transformation, incorporating the refined observations.\n\n4.  **Iterate:** This refined description will then inform the next iteration of code generation.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nLet's calculate the row+column sum for each non-zero pixel in the input and expected output for all three examples. This should help visualize the diagonal mapping.\n\n"
