The transformation seems to involve a combination of object identification, specifically non-zero colored pixels, and a diagonal mirroring or reflection operation, coupled with a filling operation towards the center. The key aspect seems to lie in how the non-zero pixels are re-arranged. There are different ways that the non-zero values are treated, including location, number, color, or some combination of them.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
