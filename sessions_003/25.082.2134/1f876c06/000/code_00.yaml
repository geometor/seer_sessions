task_description: |
  The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid.
  The transformation appears to be a diagonal reflection of non-zero pixels, 
  combined with a diagonal 'filling' operation towards the center.

facts:
  - type: object_identification
    description: Non-zero pixels are treated as distinct objects.
    properties:
      - color: Represented by the integer value (0-9).
      - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.

  - type: transformation_operation
    description: Diagonal reflection/mirroring of objects.
    details:
      - axis: The reflection seems to operate along a diagonal axis (top-left to bottom-right).

  - type: filling
    description: non-zero values are copied multiple times
    properties:
      - direction: Diagonally towards the main diagonal

  - type: grid_properties
    description: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    dimensions: 10x10
