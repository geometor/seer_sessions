"""
The transformation rule involves moving non-zero pixels in the input grid to new positions in the output grid.
These new positions lie on diagonals, with the constraint that the sum of their row and column indices
equals the sum of the original row and column indices of the input pixel. The order is determined first by the
diagonal sum.  For pixels with the same diagonal sum, use the original row/column position in the input grid.
Within each diagonal, pixels are filled in sequentially.
