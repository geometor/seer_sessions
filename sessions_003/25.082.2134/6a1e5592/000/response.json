Here's my breakdown of the task, including my perception, a YAML block of facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves transforming 2D grids of integers (representing colors).\n*   The input grids contain 0s (white), 2s (red), and 5s (gray).\n*   The output grids contain 0s (white), 1s (blue), and 2s (red).\n*   The 5s (gray) seem to disappear in the output, or are at least not present in their input form.\n*   The 2s (red) remain unchanged.\n*   Some 0s (white) are replaced by 1s (blue). It looks like the white pixels that change to blue are next to the red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"

If a pixel has a value of 2 (red), copy that value to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Color 5 Removal/Ignore:** Pixels with value 5 will not directly exist in the output.\n\n4.  **Color 0 Transformation:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid.\n    *   If a pixel in the input grid has the value of 0, and that location in the *output* grid does not have a value of 2, check its adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the *input* grid.\n    *    If *any* of the adjacent pixels in the *input* grid have a value of 2 (red), change the value of that pixel to 1 (blue) in the *output* grid.\n    *   If a pixel has value 0 and is not adjacent to any pixels with value 2, the pixel remains unchanged.\n5. **Return:** Once every input pixel is evaluated, the output grid, which will be a combination of 0, 1, and 2 values, will represent the solution.\n"
