            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies between the generated outputs and the expected outputs:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, capturing the core idea of preserving color 2 (red) and transforming some color 0 (white) pixels to color 1 (blue) based on adjacency to red pixels. However, the code fails to correctly apply the transformation rules in all cases, as evidenced by the pixel differences in both examples. The primary issue seems to be an over-aggressive transformation of 0s to 1s, particularly in rows further from the initial red pixels. The '5's in the input, seem to act like 0s and are not output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Adjacency Rule:** The current code transforms any '0' to a '1' if *any* neighbor is a '2'. This needs more precise conditions. We should carefully evaluate the cases that are being incorrectly evaluated. It is very close to a dilation operation, with color 2.\n2.  **Handle '5's:** The role of '5' (grey) pixels needs to be clarified. In the provided examples, they seem to be treated as background (like '0') and are removed in the output.\n3. Consider propagation: look to see if there is a concept of diffusion or\n   propagation of a color, where a color \"spreads\" to it's neighbors and beyond.\n4. Review - after examining each, provide and updated Facts YAML and Natural\n   Language Program\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Has a block of '2's at the top, some '0's, and some '5's towards the bottom.\n*   **Expected Output:** '2's are preserved. '0's adjacent to '2's become '1's. A single row of 0's remains. All 5's disappear, and some 0's are added to the left and bottom of the output to complete a uniform shape.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Too many '0's are transformed to '1's, in particular the 4th line has too many ones.\n* **Key discrepancies**:\n  * 4th row: Several pixels are incorrectly 1\n  * bottom rows: All non-'2' pixels are '0', all rows of pixels that are all 0 are removed\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Similar structure to Example 1, with '2's, '0's, and '5's.\n*   **Expected Output:**  '2's are preserved. '0's adjacent to '2's become '1's. Two lines of zeros between the red cluster and the rest of the image, all '5's have been removed.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Again, too many '0's become '1's.\n*   **Key Discrepancies:**\n    *   4th row: Again, many are incorrectly '1'.\n    *   The bottom rows, as in example 1, are empty.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

The key here is that a 0 in the input becomes a 1 in the output *only* if it is directly adjacent to a 2 in the input.\n5. **Remove empty rows**: if there is any all 0 row in output, remove it from the\n   output\n\n6.  **Return:** The output grid now contains the transformed image.\n\n**Next Step Recommendation:**\n\nThe above should resolve the major issues. The next step will be to implement these refined rules in a new Python function.\n"
