            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code have a fundamental flaw in how they handle the positioning and interaction of the generated rectangles. The code currently overwrites previous rectangle values, leading to incorrect outputs. The core issue is that the rectangles are being drawn independently and based purely on the seed pixel's *color*, not it's *position* relative to other colored pixels. The expected output shows a clear interaction *between* colored regions, which is not being addressed.\n\nThe strategy should be:\n\n1.  **Correct Rectangle Interaction:** Instead of simply overwriting, the algorithm needs to consider the positions of *all* non-zero pixels when drawing the rectangles. The rectangles of different colors should \"meet\" but not overwrite each other.\n2.  **Refine Positioning:** The current logic extends rectangles to the edges of the grid. The examples clearly show that the rectangles extend until they encounter another colored pixel (or the grid edge).\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution where necessary)**\n\nI don't need code execution here. The metrics are presented clearly in the provided results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   `match`: False\n    *   `pixels_off`: 84\n    *   Notes: The seed pixel colors are reversed (6 becomes 7, 7 becomes 6). The top rectangle is drawn using the color of the bottom seed, the bottom by the color of the top. The filled columns do not correspond to the locations of the non-zero pixels in the input.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   `match`: False\n    *   `pixels_off`: 84\n    *   Notes: Similar to Example 1, the colors are inverted and positions wrong. The seed pixels are at (2,6) and (7,5), but the program fills whole grid with the respective colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction**\n\n"

These are the \"seed\" pixels.\n2. **Sort:** Order the seed pixels vertically, by row index from top to bottom.\n3.  **Iterate:** Loop through each seed pixel, considering its row index, column index, and color.\n4. **Midpoints**: Calculate the midpoint *row* between vertically adjacent seed pixels.\n5. **Top Rectangle:** For each seed pixel, create a horizontal bar of that seed pixel's color in every column of the grid. The bar starts at the top edge of the grid or the row below the midpoint row between this seed pixel and the one *above*, whichever is closer to the current seed. The bar extends to the seed pixel row.\n6.  **Bottom Rectangle:** Similarly, create a horizontal bar of the seed pixel's color in every column. The bar starts from one row below the seed pixel, and extend it *down* to the midpoint between this seed and the seed *below*, or the bottom edge of the grid, whichever is closer to the seed pixel row.\n\nThis revised program addresses the interaction between rectangles by using midpoints and takes vertical order into consideration. It still fills all columns, as indicated by the examples.\n"
