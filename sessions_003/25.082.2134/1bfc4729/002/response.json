            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate an updated natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, but the results clearly show discrepancies. The code creates columns above and below each non-zero pixel, and fills the seed row and top row, which is not the correct behavior. The expected outputs show a pattern of creating two rectangles of the same color, connected at the corners: one above the seed and one below, both expanding up/down to the edges of the grid and horizontally to touch the sides. Instead of filling the top row and identified non-zero seed row, the transformation extends rectangles to edges.\n\nThe primary issue is that the rectangles do not extend to the grid limits, both horizontal and vertical.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection and code analysis, no `tool_code` needed for this high-level pass)**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has two non-zero pixels: 6 (blue) at (2, 2) and 7 (orange) at (7, 7).\n    *   Expected Output: Two corner-connected rectangles. Top-left is blue, bottom-right is orange.\n    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect. Rectangles are formed, but not the right shapes and filling the whole top and 'seed' rows.\n    *   Pixels Off: 44\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has two non-zero pixels: 1 (blue) at (2, 6) and 4 (yellow) at (7, 5).\n    *   Expected Output: Two corner-connected rectangles. Top-right is blue, bottom-left is yellow.\n    *   Transformed Output: Similar error to Example 1. Rectangles don't extend and connect correctly, also incorrectly fills the top and non-zero seed rows.\n    *   Pixels Off: 44\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

This rectangle's bottom edge is the row *above* the seed pixel's row. The rectangle extends upwards to the top edge of the grid (row 0). The rectangle extends horizontally to the left and right edges of the grid.\n4.  **Bottom Rectangle:** Create another rectangle of the same color. This rectangle's top edge is the row *below* the seed pixel's row. This rectangle extends downwards to the bottom edge of the grid. The rectangle extends horizontally to the left and right edges of the grid.\n\nThis revised program eliminates the filling the 'seed' row, and top row, focusing instead on extending the top and bottom rectangles horizontally to the left and right edges.\n"
