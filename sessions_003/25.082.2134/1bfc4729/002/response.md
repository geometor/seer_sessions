Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate an updated natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, but the results clearly show discrepancies. The code creates columns above and below each non-zero pixel, and fills the seed row and top row, which is not the correct behavior. The expected outputs show a pattern of creating two rectangles of the same color, connected at the corners: one above the seed and one below, both expanding up/down to the edges of the grid and horizontally to touch the sides. Instead of filling the top row and identified non-zero seed row, the transformation extends rectangles to edges.

The primary issue is that the rectangles do not extend to the grid limits, both horizontal and vertical.

**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection and code analysis, no `tool_code` needed for this high-level pass)**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has two non-zero pixels: 6 (blue) at (2, 2) and 7 (orange) at (7, 7).
    *   Expected Output: Two corner-connected rectangles. Top-left is blue, bottom-right is orange.
    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect. Rectangles are formed, but not the right shapes and filling the whole top and 'seed' rows.
    *   Pixels Off: 44
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has two non-zero pixels: 1 (blue) at (2, 6) and 4 (yellow) at (7, 5).
    *   Expected Output: Two corner-connected rectangles. Top-right is blue, bottom-left is yellow.
    *   Transformed Output: Similar error to Example 1. Rectangles don't extend and connect correctly, also incorrectly fills the top and non-zero seed rows.
    *   Pixels Off: 44

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Each non-zero pixel in the input acts as a "seed" for two rectangles.
  - observation: One rectangle extends upwards from the seed pixel to the top of the grid.
  - observation: The top rectangle expands horizontally to the edges, keeping the same height.
  - observation: The second rectangle extends downwards from the seed pixel to the bottom of the grid.
  - observation: The bottom rectangle expands horizontally to the edges, maintaining height.
  - observation: The rectangles use same color as their seed.
  - observation: the rectangles extend to the edge, forming corner-connected shapes.
  - observation: there is no filling of seed row.
  - observation: There is no filling of the top row.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify:** Find all non-zero pixels in the input grid. Each of these is a "seed" pixel.
2.  **Iterate:** For each seed pixel:
3.  **Top Rectangle:** Create a rectangle of the same color as the seed pixel. This rectangle's bottom edge is the row *above* the seed pixel's row. The rectangle extends upwards to the top edge of the grid (row 0). The rectangle extends horizontally to the left and right edges of the grid.
4.  **Bottom Rectangle:** Create another rectangle of the same color. This rectangle's top edge is the row *below* the seed pixel's row. This rectangle extends downwards to the bottom edge of the grid. The rectangle extends horizontally to the left and right edges of the grid.

This revised program eliminates the filling the 'seed' row, and top row, focusing instead on extending the top and bottom rectangles horizontally to the left and right edges.
