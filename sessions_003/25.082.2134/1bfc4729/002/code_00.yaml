facts:
  - observation: Each non-zero pixel in the input acts as a "seed" for two rectangles.
  - observation: One rectangle extends upwards from the seed pixel to the top of the grid.
  - observation: The top rectangle expands horizontally to the edges, keeping the same height.
  - observation: The second rectangle extends downwards from the seed pixel to the bottom of the grid.
  - observation: The bottom rectangle expands horizontally to the edges, maintaining height.
  - observation: The rectangles use same color as their seed.
  - observation: the rectangles extend to the edge, forming corner-connected shapes.
  - observation: there is no filling of seed row.
  - observation: There is no filling of the top row.
