Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of the Elements**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 10x10 grids.
*   **Colors:** The input grids contain a single non-zero (colored) pixel in a field of zeros (white).
*    Colors in example 1: magenta (6) and orange (7).
*   Colors in example 2: blue(1) and yellow(4)
*   **Transformation:** The output grids seem to be generated based on the location of the non-zero pixels in the input grid. The non-zero pixels appear to trigger the creation of two filled rectangles, one above and one below, using each non-zero pixel as a seed. The seed is expanded, to fill top and bottom.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - observation: "Each input grid has one or two single pixels of non-zero value."
  - observation: "each non zero input grid cell generates a set of cells of the same value in the output"
  - observation: "output cells are arranged in two rectangles, above and below, up to top and bottom edges"
  - relation: "The output grid's non-zero values correspond to the input grid's non-zero values and locations."
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than zero.
2.  **Iterate:** do the following steps for each identified non-zero pixel
3.  **Generate Top Rectangle:** create a column of cells the same color (value)
    as the identified pixel, starting one row above the seed and extending up
    to the top of the grid.
4.  **Fill Remainder of Top Row:** fill the row at the top of the column of cells with
    the same value (color).
5.  **Generate Bottom Rectangle:** Create a column of cells with same color
    (value) as the identified pixel, starting one row below the identified cell and
    extending to the bottom of the grid.
6.  **Fill Top of Bottom Rectangle**: fill the row above the column of cells with the
    same value (color).

Essentially, each non-zero pixel in the input grid acts as a "seed" to generate a two filled rectangles in the output grid, colored with the same value as the seed pixel.
