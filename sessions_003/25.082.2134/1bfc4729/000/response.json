Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of the Elements**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 10x10 grids.\n*   **Colors:** The input grids contain a single non-zero (colored) pixel in a field of zeros (white).\n*    Colors in example 1: magenta (6) and orange (7).\n*   Colors in example 2: blue(1) and yellow(4)\n*   **Transformation:** The output grids seem to be generated based on the location of the non-zero pixels in the input grid. The non-zero pixels appear to trigger the creation of two filled rectangles, one above and one below, using each non-zero pixel as a seed. The seed is expanded, to fill top and bottom.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
