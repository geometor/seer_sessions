  - observation: "Each input grid has one or two single pixels of non-zero value."
  - observation: "each non zero input grid cell generates a set of cells of the same value in the output"
  - observation: "output cells are arranged in two rectangles, above and below, up to top and bottom edges"
  - relation: "The output grid's non-zero values correspond to the input grid's non-zero values and locations."
