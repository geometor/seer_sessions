Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies non-zero pixels and attempts to draw rectangles based on their positions. However, it fails to accurately reproduce the expected outputs in both provided examples. The primary issue is the incorrect placement and, in some instances the shape of the colored bars. The existing code draws full-width horizontal bars, while the desired output has bars that seem to be "broken up", and there are some "0" values within those bars.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Midpoint Calculation and Bar Extents:** The midpoint calculation is likely correct, but its *usage* in defining the start and end rows of the colored bars needs adjustment. It appears the "0" are only inserted *at* the column of the seed pixel.
2.  **Column-Specific Logic:** We need to apply logic that is *dependent* on the original *column*. It seems we should preserve input pixel values *at the column of the seed*.
3. **Iterative Refinement:** Test the adjustments on all example pairs, compare, and refine.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Sort Seeds:** Find all non-zero pixels ("seed pixels") in the input grid. Sort these seed pixels by their row index, from top to bottom.

2.  **Iterate through Seeds:** For each seed pixel:

    *   **Calculate Midpoints:** Determine the midpoint row between the current seed pixel and the seed pixel above it (if any). Also, determine the midpoint row between the current seed pixel and the seed pixel below it (if any).

    *   **Create Top Bar:** Create a horizontal bar of the seed pixel's color.
        *   The bar starts at the top of the grid, or one row below the midpoint between this seed and the previous seed, whichever is *lower*.
        *   The bar ends at the row of the current seed pixel.
        *   The bar extends across all columns, *except* the column containing the seed pixel. At the seed pixel's column, the output grid retains the original input value for all rows.

    *   **Create Bottom Bar:** Create a horizontal bar of the seed pixel's color.
        *   The bar starts one row below the current seed pixel's row.
        *   The bar ends at the bottom of the grid, or at the midpoint between the current seed and the next seed, whichever is *higher*.
        *   The bar extends across all columns, *except* the column containing the seed pixel. At the seed pixel's column, the output grid retains the original input value for all rows.

3. **Preserve Original Columns:** For *every* row in the grid and for *each* seed pixel, ensure that the output grid, at the column of that seed pixel, retains the value from the *input* grid at that location. This step is crucial for creating "breaks" in the bars.
