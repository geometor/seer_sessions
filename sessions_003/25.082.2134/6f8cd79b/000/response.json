The input grids are all composed entirely of black pixels and vary in size. The output grids maintain a similar shape but are always one row and column smaller on each side and have an azure border. The core concept is creating a border around a potentially smaller interior region.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Reduce the number of rows by one for top and bottom, and reduce number of columns by one for each side. These are the dimensions of the output grid.\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize a new grid with the calculated dimensions.\n3.  **Draw Border:** Iterate over all cells of the output grid. If a cell is on the edge (first row, last row, first column, or last column), set its color to azure (8).\n4.  **Fill Interior:** Iterate over the internal cells of the output grid (excluding the border cells). Set the color of these interior cells to black (0).\n5. **Return:** Return the output grid.\n\n"
