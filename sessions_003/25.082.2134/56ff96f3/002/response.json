It correctly identified the core idea of horizontal expansion but failed to handle several critical aspects:\n\n1.  **Partial Expansion:** The initial code only expanded some of the objects partially. It did not take the whole object, but just expanded the position.\n2.  **Missing Expansions**: The second example includes both horizontal and vertical expansion of the single pixels in separate rows and columns.\n\nThe core issue seems to be an incomplete understanding of how \"objects\" are defined and how far the expansion should go. The code expands the objects that are connected, it should consider all pixels of the same color as a potential object.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Object Definition:** Instead of doing a complex connected components, the code needs to consider all the pixels of same color.\n2.  **Expansion Logic:** Revisit the concept of \"extending to the end of that object\" - needs clarification\n3.  **Metrics Analysis:** Calculate the bounding boxes for correct and detected objects\n4. **Revise the code by:**\n  - simplifying object detection - just group by color\n  - build bounding box for min, max, row, col\n  - iterate rows, and expand colors within the bounding box.\n\n**Metrics Analysis (using manual inspection and reasoning, supported by assumed tool outputs - no actual tool use yet):**\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Colors (Input) | Colors (Output) | Object Definition Correct? | Expansion Correct? | Notes                                                                  |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 10x10       | 10x10        | 0, 1, 2        | 0, 1, 2         | No                       | No                | Correctly expanded colors, missing.                              |\n| 2       | 7x8         | 7x8          | 0, 3, 7        | 0, 3, 7         | No                      | No                 | Missing object definition, Missing fill to min max of the same color.       |\n| 3       | 10x10       | 10x10        | 0, 4           | 0, 4            | No                       | No                | Incorrect object expansion, and partial missing fill.             |\n| 4       | 6x11       | 6x11         | 0,7           | 0,7         | No                       | No        |      Missing object and fill                                                      |\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
