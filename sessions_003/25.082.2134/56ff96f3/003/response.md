1.  **Identify Objects:** Group all pixels of the same non-zero color as a single object, regardless of their position.
2.  **Bounding Box:** For each object (color group), determine the bounding box that encompasses all pixels of that color. The bounding box is defined by `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, and `max_col`.
3.  **Fill:** For each object, fill the entire rectangular region defined by its bounding box with the object's color.  This means setting all pixels within the `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, and `max_col` to the object's color.
4. **Output:** The output is the grid with all bounding boxes filled.
