1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero color (i.e., not white).
2.  **Horizontal Expansion/Replication:** For each identified pixel, replicate its color horizontally.
    *   If there are two pixels of the same color on different rows, replicate it to create a rectangle using those two pixels.
    *   If only one pixel of the color exits, extend to the end of that "object".

3.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of these replications, with all other pixels remaining 0 (white).
Essentially, single non-zero pixels in a row of an object are expanded, so that the row is fully occupied by the color. If more than one colored pixel of same color are present in separate rows, a filled rectangle is created using them.

Okay, here's an assessment of the situation, strategy, and the requested deliverables:

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial natural language program and code were too simplistic. It correctly identified the core idea of horizontal expansion but failed to handle several critical aspects:

1.  **Partial Expansion:** The initial code only expanded some of the objects partially. It did not take the whole object, but just expanded the position.
2.  **Missing Expansions**: The second example includes both horizontal and vertical expansion of the single pixels in separate rows and columns.

The core issue seems to be an incomplete understanding of how "objects" are defined and how far the expansion should go. The code expands the objects that are connected, it should consider all pixels of the same color as a potential object.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Object Definition:** Instead of doing a complex connected components, the code needs to consider all the pixels of same color.
2.  **Expansion Logic:** Revisit the concept of "extending to the end of that object" - needs clarification
3.  **Metrics Analysis:** Calculate the bounding boxes for correct and detected objects
4. **Revise the code by:**
  - simplifying object detection - just group by color
  - build bounding box for min, max, row, col
  - iterate rows, and expand colors within the bounding box.

**Metrics Analysis (using manual inspection and reasoning, supported by assumed tool outputs - no actual tool use yet):**

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Colors (Input) | Colors (Output) | Object Definition Correct? | Expansion Correct? | Notes                                                                  |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 2       | 7x8         | 7x8          | 0, 3, 7        | 0, 3, 7         | No                      | No                 | Missing object definition, Missing fill to min max of the same color.       |
| 3       | 10x10       | 10x10        | 0, 4           | 0, 4            | No                       | No                | Incorrect object expansion, and partial missing fill.             |
| 4       | 6x11       | 6x11         | 0,7           | 0,7         | No                       | No        |      Missing object and fill                                                      |

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Group all pixels of the same non-zero color as a single object, regardless of their position.
2.  **Bounding Box:** For each object (color group), determine the bounding box that encompasses all pixels of that color. The bounding box is defined by `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, and `max_col`.
3.  **Fill:** For each object, fill the entire rectangular region defined by its bounding box with the object's color.  This means setting all pixels within the `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, and `max_col` to the object's color.
4. **Output:** The output is the grid with all bounding boxes filled.
