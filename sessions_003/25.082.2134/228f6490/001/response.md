The transformation rule appears to implement a contextual color replacement. The rule, which would be applied for each pixel location:

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Examine** the color of the current pixel and its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
3.  **Identify** distinct regions of pixels, based on contiguous same-colored pixels.
4. **Apply a set of rules**. It is too difficult to establish what they might be.
    Here is what I can identify:
    *   In example 1, Orange (7) pixels stay the same. Gray(5)'s at coordinates (2,1) and (3,1) are changing to Azure(8). Gray(5) at coordinate (8,5) turns into gray(6)
    *   In example 2, Green(3) pixels change to gray(0) at coordinates (5,0), (6,0) and (7,0).
    *   In example 3, Red(2) changes to gray(0) in the top left corner.

5. The new color seems to be pulled from other colors in the grid, not any fixed mapping
