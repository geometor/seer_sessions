facts:
  - domain: 2D grid
  - elements: colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9)
  - observation_1:
    - input_grid_1:  Identifies several distinct colored regions.
    - output_grid_1: Some colored regions change while others remain.
    - relationship: "Changes are not global color substitutions."
  - observation_2:
    - input_grid_2: More complex arrangement of colors than grid_1.
    - output_grid_2:  Color transformations are dependent on surrounding colors.
    - relationship: "Contextual color changes are apparent."
  - observation_3:
    - input_grid_3: Contains isolated single-pixel colors and larger blocks.
    - output_grid_3: Transformations impact both single pixels and blocks based on neighborhood
    - relationship: "Transformation considers both isolated and grouped pixels within their context."
  - transformation_type: "Contextual color replacement"
  - context_factors:
    - adjacent_colors: Colors of neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right, diagonal).
    - object_boundaries: The size/shape of a contiguous block of the same color may influence the change.
