The transformation seems to involve a complex interplay of color replacement based on spatial relationships and possibly object identification. It's not a simple global color swap, as different instances of the same color are treated differently based on their context.  The changes appear to be localized and dependent on the surrounding colors. It is difficult to see the precise transformations without more examples, or with more interaction between the input and output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

It is too difficult to establish what they might be.\n    Here is what I can identify:\n    *   In example 1, Orange (7) pixels stay the same. Gray(5)'s at coordinates (2,1) and (3,1) are changing to Azure(8). Gray(5) at coordinate (8,5) turns into gray(6)\n    *   In example 2, Green(3) pixels change to gray(0) at coordinates (5,0), (6,0) and (7,0).\n    *   In example 3, Red(2) changes to gray(0) in the top left corner.\n\n5. The new color seems to be pulled from other colors in the grid, not any fixed mapping\n\nThis description is incomplete, because I don't see the consistent logic of the color replacement based just on the neighborhood. I've shown my observations from the limited set of examples.\n"
