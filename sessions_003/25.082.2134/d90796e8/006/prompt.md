"""
1.  **Identify Pairs:** Examine the input grid to identify pairs of adjacent green and red pixels. Adjacency is defined as being directly above, below, to the left, or to the right (not diagonal).

2.  **One-to-One Transformation:** For each *unique* green-red pair identified, the red pixel in that pair transforms into an azure pixel. The green pixel is considered "consumed" and cannot participate in further transformations.

3.  **Unpaired Pixels:** If a red pixel is not adjacent to any green pixel, it remains unchanged. If a green pixel has no adjacent red pixels it remains unchanged. If there are more red pixels adjacent to green pixels than there are green pixels available to create pairs, not all of the red pixels will transform. It appears there may be an implicit spatial ordering determining which green/red pairing will occur, but it is not immediately obvious from these examples. Assume a left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering of priority when matching.

4. **All Other Pixels:** Any pixel that is not red or green remains unchanged in the output grid.
