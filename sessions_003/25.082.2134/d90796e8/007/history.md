```python
"""
1.  **Identify Pairs:** Examine the input grid to identify pairs of adjacent green and red pixels. Adjacency is defined as being directly above, below, to the left, or to the right (not diagonal).

2.  **One-to-One Transformation:** For each *unique* green-red pair identified, the red pixel in that pair transforms into an azure pixel. The green pixel is considered "consumed" and cannot participate in further transformations.

3.  **Unpaired Pixels:** If a red pixel is not adjacent to any green pixel, it remains unchanged. If a green pixel has no adjacent red pixels it remains unchanged. If there are more red pixels adjacent to green pixels than there are green pixels available to create pairs, not all of the red pixels will transform. It appears there may be an implicit spatial ordering determining which green/red pairing will occur, but it is not immediately obvious from these examples. Assume a left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering of priority when matching.

4. **All Other Pixels:** Any pixel that is not red or green remains unchanged in the output grid.

Here's an analysis of the results and a plan for improving the natural language program and, subsequently, the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of green-red adjacency leading to a transformation. However, the test results across multiple examples reveal a critical flaw in the *order* of processing and which green pixel gets "priority" when multiple are adjacent to a single red pixel. The existing code prioritizes green pixels in a strict left-to-right, top-to-bottom order. The provided examples suggest a more nuanced rule, but it is not consistently applied. This indicates a misunderstanding.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the pixel-level differences between the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` for each example. This will pinpoint precisely where the transformation logic deviates. The number of `pixels_off` is helpful, but we must look at *where* they are incorrect.

2.  **Re-evaluate Priority:** The core issue is the green pixel selection. We will re-examine the natural language program. The existing logic checks for red pixels *first* and then assigns a neighboring green, using a simple top-left priority. Instead we must account for all green pixels, and for each, transform adjacent reds to azure *unless* that red has already been transformed due to adjacency with a *different* green.

3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We will adjust the natural language program and likely the code multiple times.

actions:
  - name: transform_red_to_azure
    preconditions:
      - A red pixel is adjacent to a green pixel.
      - The green pixel has not been used in a previous transformation.
    postconditions:
      - The red pixel's color changes to azure.
      - The green pixel is marked as "consumed".

```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Iterate through the grid, focusing on *green* pixels first.

2.  **Find Adjacent Reds:** For *each* green pixel, identify all adjacent red pixels (horizontally or vertically).

3.  **Transform Adjacent Reds (One-to-One):** For each red pixel found adjacent to the current green pixel, change the red pixel to azure. Mark the *green* pixel as "consumed" after processing all its adjacent red pixels so that this green pixel cannot be used to process any additional reds in the future.

4. **Iterate:** Continue this process for all remaining *green* pixels in the grid.

5.  **Unchanged Pixels:** Any pixel that is not transformed by the above rules remains unchanged.
