      notes: "The top-left pixel is Green (3) and the pixel to the right
              of it is Red (2). The expected result is that the red becomes
              azure"

      notes: "Red pixels *adjacent* to green pixels are changed, the change in
             the initial code is not sufficient"

    notes: "Diagonal adjacency alone is insufficient, red pixels only change to
            azure if they have a single side touching the green pixel. If there
            are two green pixels, one on the side, and the other on the
            diagonal, it will not change the red to azure"
