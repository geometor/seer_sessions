Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes.\n*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color.\n*   The transformation involves changing some of the digits/colors while keeping others the same.\n*   The dimensions of the grid (height and width) remain constant between input and output.\n*   It seems like colors \"red\" and \"green\" are somehow related\n*   It seems like specific locations with non-zero colors may drive color changes\n*   The transformation appears localized. It does not change all values of a specific\n    color\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
