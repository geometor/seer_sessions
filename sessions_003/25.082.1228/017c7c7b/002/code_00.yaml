facts:
  - object: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - height: Number of rows.
      - width: Number of columns.
      - cells: Individual color values (0-9).

  - object: output_grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors, derived from the input_grid.
    properties:
      - height: Number of rows (dependent on input_grid).
      - width: Number of columns (same as input_grid).
      - cells: Individual color values, primarily 0 (white) and 2 (red).

  - action: replace_color
    description: Replace all instances of blue (1) with red (2) in a row.
    input: row (list of integers)
    output: modified_row (list of integers)

  - action: add_conditional_row
    description: Add a new row below the current row, containing only white (0) pixels, except where the original row had blue (1) pixels, in which case it's red (2).
    input: original_row (list of integers)
    output: new_row (list of integers)

  - action: transform_grid
    description: The overall transformation process. Iterates through each row of the input grid, applies 'replace_color' and 'add_conditional_row'.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
