The input grids consist of a repeating vertical pattern of blue and white pixels. It appears the output maintains the columns' original width and expands the height. The blue pixels (1) in the input seem to be replaced by red pixels (2) in the output, and it looks like an extra row of 0's is added at the bottom for every existing line.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
