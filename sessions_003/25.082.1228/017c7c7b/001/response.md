Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, copy it to the output grid, replacing all 'blue' pixels (value 1) with 'red' pixels (value 2). Then, append a row of 'white' pixels (value 0) to the output grid, except at the column where a blue pixel was, place another 2. Repeat this process for all rows in the input grid.
