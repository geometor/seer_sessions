observations:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - transformation:  "blue pixels (1) within the grid are replaced by red pixels (2).  A summary row of only red and white pixels is appended at the bottom, indicating the original locations of all blue pixels in the input"
    invariants:
      - "The width of the grid remains constant."
      - "Only blue and white pixels in the input are considered in the transformation."
