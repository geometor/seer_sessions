"""
Iterate through each row in the input grid. If a row contains any blue (1) pixels, first create a copy of the row, replacing all blue pixels with red (2) pixels, and add this modified row to the output grid. Then, create a new row with the same width as the input, filled initially with white (0) pixels. For each position in this new row, check the corresponding position in the *original* input row. If the original row had a blue (1) pixel at that position, place a red (2) pixel in the new row at that position. Append this conditionally created row to the output grid. If a row does not contains any blue pixels, simply skip it.
