            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results, focusing on identifying the issues and refining the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good start, identifying key shapes (vertical/horizontal lines, L-shapes, 2x2 blocks) formed by the green (3) pixels and attempting to transform the topmost/leftmost/corner pixel to azure (8). However, the test results clearly show inconsistencies and failures to correctly transform all shapes. The main issue is that the logic is *incomplete*: it only handles specific, simple cases and does not capture the underlying rule for all green connected components. The core logic relies on checking certain types of shapes and not accounting for other shapes.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Failures:** Carefully examine the `input`, `expected output`, and `transformed output` for each example where `match: False`. Identify the specific green components that were *not* correctly transformed.\n2.  **Identify the Common Rule:** Determine what rule would correctly explain turning which green pixel to azure, in all of these examples.\n3. **Refine the Description:** Update the natural language program, adding additional logic to better represent what happens in the examples.\n4. **Test Again**: Use the updated description to develop new code.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nI'll summarize the key observations from each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has two vertical lines of green (3).\n    *   Expected Output: Top pixels of both lines should be azure (8).\n    *   Transformed Output: Only one line's top pixel is changed.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has a horizontal line and a single green pixel.\n    *   Expected Output: Leftmost of horizontal line is changed. The single pixel is unchanged.\n    *   Transformed Output: Correctly transforms the horizontal line.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input has multiple 2x2 green blocks, a horizontal line, and a vertical line.\n    *    Expected: Top leftmost pixel in each 2x2 is changed to azure, topmost of the vertical line, leftmost of the horizontal line.\n    *    Transformed: Only transformed one pixel in one of the 2x2 blocks.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    Input includes vertical and horizontal green lines, and one L shape.\n    *   Expected Output: Top of vertical, left of horizontal, corner of L, should all be azure (8).\n    *   Transformed output: Correctly transformed the L and the horizontal line, but missed one in the vertical line.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification**\n\n"
