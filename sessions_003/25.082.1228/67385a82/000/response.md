Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The primary colors involved in the examples are green (3) and white (0), with the output introducing azure (8).
*   The transformation seems to selectively replace green (3) pixels with azure (8) pixels.
*   The spatial arrangement and connectivity of the green pixels appear to be crucial.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - green (3)
        - azure (8)
      position: [row, column]
      connectivity: adjacent (up, down, left, right)

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    agent: transformation_rule
    input: green (3)
    output: azure (8)
    conditions:
      - connectivity_pattern: "Specific configurations of adjacent green pixels"

relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      description: "Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonally)."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all green (3) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Analyze Connectivity:** Examine the arrangement of adjacent (up, down, left, right) connected groups of green pixels.
3. **Conditional Replacement:**
    - if a connected group of green (3) cells are in a vertical straight line, the top cell will be transformed to azure (8).
    - if a connected group of green (3) cells are in a horizontal straight line, the left cell will be transformed to azure (8).
    - if a connected group of green (3) cells make an L shape, the corner cell in the L will be transformed.
4. All the cells remain unchanged.

The core of the transformation is a conditional color replacement based on pattern, more specifically on *linear components*. It *selects one of the green cells of a linear component and transforms its color to azure.*
