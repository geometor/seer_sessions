Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The primary colors involved in the examples are green (3) and white (0), with the output introducing azure (8).\n*   The transformation seems to selectively replace green (3) pixels with azure (8) pixels.\n*   The spatial arrangement and connectivity of the green pixels appear to be crucial.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

All the cells remain unchanged.\n\nThe core of the transformation is a conditional color replacement based on pattern, more specifically on *linear components*. It *selects one of the green cells of a linear component and transforms its color to azure.*\n"
