            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focuses on identifying connected components of green pixels and applying transformations based on whether they form vertical lines, horizontal lines, or L-shapes. The results show that the code fails to correctly transform all the examples. The primary issue seems to be an incomplete understanding of the L-shape transformation and potentially missing other shape considerations. The code sometimes turns the incorrect pixel to azure. It also might miss turning a green pixel to azure, when by the rules it should.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Re-examine L-shapes:** The current `is_l_shape` function seems too restrictive. It only checks components of length 3. It seems to be capturing the intent, but not generalizing it properly.\n\n2. **Consider Other Shapes:** The provided examples suggest there might be shapes beyond simple vertical/horizontal lines and basic L-shapes. We need to analyze connected green pixels and the transformations to understand the general rule better. It might be diagonal lines.\n\n3. **Refine Corner Detection:** The `find_corner` function seems to be off. We need to make the logic more accurate and robust.\n\n4. **Iterative Refinement:** We'll use the provided examples to iteratively refine the natural language program and the corresponding code.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI don't need to use code execution here. The provided results clearly show the pixel differences between the expected output and the transformed output. We have:\n\n*   **Example 1:** 2 pixels off.\n*   **Example 2:** 4 pixels off.\n*   **Example 3:** 7 pixels off.\n*   **Example 4:** 6 pixels off.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The rule so far is unclear for shapes that are neither lines nor L-shapes.\n3. **Output the updated output grid.**\n\nThe main focus areas for the next coding phase are: making sure that the `L_shape` function handles larger than 2x1 and 1x2, making a new block function, and then updating the main transform to handle these two changes.\n"
