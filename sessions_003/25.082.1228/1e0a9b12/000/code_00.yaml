objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: variable (integer)
      - columns: variable (integer)
      - cells: 2D array of integers (0-9)
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
            - value: integer (0-9)
            - color:  (derived from value using COLOR_MAP)
            - position: (row, column) - (x,y) coordinates

actions:
  - name: move_pixels
    description: Non-zero pixels are moved.
  - name: sort_pixels
    description: Non-zero pixels can potentially be sorted, but not always.
  - name: compress
      description: fills in any gaps created

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels have positions relative to each other within the grid.
  - type: value-based
    description:  Zero vs. non-zero pixels are treated differently.
  - type: ordering  #POSSIBLE, NEEDS VERIFICATION
    description: Within the compressed/stacked, non zero pixels on a row, sort ascending

transformations:
  - rows: 0 values are inserted into the grid so the output grid has the same number of rows as the input grid
  - columns: The output grid has same number of columns as the input grid.
  - stacking: Non-zero pixels "stack" at the bottom.
