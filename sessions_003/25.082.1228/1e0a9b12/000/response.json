The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of non-zero pixels within the grid, primarily focused on the bottom rows.  There's a sense of \"stacking\" or \"compressing\" the non-zero values towards the bottom, potentially sorting them in the process. The top rows seem mostly to become empty (filled with 0). The number of rows and columns does change, but not always.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
