The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid. The colors (represented by digits) in the input grid seem to be preserved and replicated in the output grid. There's a definite sense of mirroring and repetition, creating a symmetrical, larger structure. The transformation does not seem to mix the existing colors in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In other words the input grid is used as a \"tile\" for the output grid, located at the top left of the output.\n\n4.  **Mirror Horizontally:** Mirror the input quadrant (top-left) horizontally to the top-right quadrant of the output grid. Each pixel at `(row, col)` in the top-left quadrant is copied to `(row, width - 1 - col + input_width)`.\n\n5.  **Mirror Vertically:** Mirror the top-left quadrant vertically to the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid. Each pixel at `(row, col)` in the top-left quadrant is copied to `(height - 1 -row + input_height, col)`.\n\n6. **Mirror Both Directions:** Mirror the top-left quadrant both vertically and horizontally, which copies to bottom-right. Each pixel at `(row, col)` in the top-left quadrant is copied to `(height - 1 - row + input_height, width -1 - col + input_width)`.\n\nIn short, the input grid becomes the top-left quadrant of the output, and is then mirrored horizontally and vertically to fill the remaining quadrants.\n"
