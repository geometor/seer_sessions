            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code implements a quadrant-based transformation, mirroring the input grid across different axes. While it works perfectly for Example 3, it fails for Examples 1 and 2. The primary issue seems to be in the mirroring operations for the top-right and bottom-left quadrants. The expected outputs show different mirroring than the current `np.fliplr(input_grid).T` and `np.flipud(input_grid).T`. The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Comparison:** Pinpointing exactly which pixels are incorrect in Examples 1 and 2 to understand the precise mirroring transformation needed.\n2.  **Corrected Mirroring:** Adjusting the top-right and bottom-left mirroring logic based on the detailed comparison. It seems like simple flips and transposes aren't sufficient.\n3. Re-evaluating the natural language program to be clear and complete.\n\n**Gathering Metrics**\n\nLet's use code execution to get a more structured view of the errors, which will be very helpful later.\n\n"
