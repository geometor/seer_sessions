Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a quadrant-based transformation, mirroring the input grid across different axes. While it works perfectly for Example 3, it fails for Examples 1 and 2. The primary issue seems to be in the mirroring operations for the top-right and bottom-left quadrants. The expected outputs show different mirroring than the current `np.fliplr(input_grid).T` and `np.flipud(input_grid).T`. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Comparison:** Pinpointing exactly which pixels are incorrect in Examples 1 and 2 to understand the precise mirroring transformation needed.
2.  **Corrected Mirroring:** Adjusting the top-right and bottom-left mirroring logic based on the detailed comparison. It seems like simple flips and transposes aren't sufficient.
3. Re-evaluating the natural language program to be clear and complete.

**Gathering Metrics**

Let's use code execution to get a more structured view of the errors, which will be very helpful later.


``` python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(expected, transformed):
    expected_grid = np.array(expected)
    transformed_grid = np.array(transformed)

    if expected_grid.shape != transformed_grid.shape:
        return "Shapes differ"

    diff = expected_grid != transformed_grid
    diff_indices = np.where(diff)
    diff_details = []

    for i in range(len(diff_indices[0])):
        row, col = diff_indices[0][i], diff_indices[1][i]
        expected_val = expected_grid[row, col]
        transformed_val = transformed_grid[row, col]
        diff_details.append(f"Pixel at ({row}, {col}): Expected {expected_val}, Got {transformed_val}")

    return diff_details

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Create Output Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid (both height and width) to create the output grid.

2.  **Copy Input (Top-Left):**  Place a direct copy of the input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid.

3.  **Mirror Top-Right:** Copy the transposed and flipped input to the top-right quadrant. The specific transformation is equivalent to swapping rows and columns of input, *then* flipping the result left to right.

4.  **Mirror Bottom-Left:** Copy the transposed and flipped input to the bottom-left quadrant. The specific transformation is equivalent to swapping rows and columns of the input and flipping the result upside down.

5.  **Rotate 180 (Bottom-Right):** Rotate the input grid by 180 degrees and place it in the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid.
