The most prominent feature is the consistent presence of the color 5 (gray) and its movement. Other colors seem to \"shift\" or be displaced based on the movement of the gray pixels. It seems like the relative positions of other non-zero, non-gray colored pixels may be maintained if they are moved and do not \"collide\" with other non-zero non-grey pixels. It is important to understand the behavior of zeros, how the gray pixels move, and if there is a pattern.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
