description: Reorder elements within each row based on specific rules involving gray and non-gray pixels.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - red (2)
        - green (3)
        - yellow (4)
        - gray (5)
        - magenta (6)
        - orange (7)
        - azure (8)
        - maroon (9)
      position: [row, column]
observations:
  - example_1:
    - input:  The gray pixel is at the beginning of the first row, and there's one other nonzero number. In the second row, the gray number goes to the second place with one other nonzero number before it. Third-row gray stays at the end.
    - output: Gray is in the first position when there is any other non-zero object in that row.
  - example_2:
      - input: Gray pixels appear at the start of first two rows. There are duplicated 6.
      - output: If the gray pixel is at the beginning of the row followed by 0 in the second column. And if there are any duplicate numbers, they go after the gray pixel in the original order.
  - example_3:
    - input: Multiple gray pixels, and duplicates.
    - output: The rightmost gray is moved towards the beginning depending on how many non-zero objects are to its left.
actions:
  - move:
    - object: gray pixel
    - condition: dependent on other non-zero and non-gray pixels
    - destination: varies
  - reorder:
    - object: non-gray pixels
    - condition: preserve relative order of unique values
    - destination: dependent on gray and other non-zero objects
