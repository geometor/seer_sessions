"""
The input grid is a 3x2 grid. The output grid is a 9x4 grid. The non-zero color in the input grid is replicated in a 2x2 pattern in the output grid, forming a rectangle. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros. The input grid is repeated to create the corners of a rectangle, and the empty space inside and outside of the rectangle is filled with zeros.

1.  **Identify the non-zero color:** Determine the single non-zero color value present in the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Structure:** prepare an empty 9x4 output_grid
3.  **Repeat Input:** The 3x2 input grid pattern is repeated four times to create the corners of a rectangle in the output.
    *   The original input is placed into output[0:3,0:2].
    *   horizontally mirrored, input is placed at output[0:3,2:4].
    *   vertically mirrored input is placed at output[6:9,0:2]
    *   mirrored on both axes, input is placed at output[6:9,2:4]
4. **Fill Zeros:** fill the rest of output_grid with zeros.
