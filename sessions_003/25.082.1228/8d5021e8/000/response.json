The core elements seem to be:\n\n*   **Input Grid:** A 3x2 grid of single-digit integers representing colors.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 9x4 grid, also of single-digit integers.\n*   **Colors:** The input grids feature distinct colors (represented by the digits). There is always 'white' (0) and one other color.\n*   **Pattern:** The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with a specific arrangement of the input colors. It seems the non-zero colors define the corners of a shape and the zeros fill the inside and the outside of that shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
