Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The output grids appear to be a horizontally duplicated version of the input grids.
*   The dimensions of the output grid are double the width of the input grid, while the height remains the same.
*   The values and their relative positions within the input grid are perfectly replicated in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: height x width
      - elements: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - colors: Each integer represents a color.

actions:
  - name: horizontal_duplication
    description: The input grid is duplicated horizontally to create the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of elements within the input grid are maintained in the output grid.
  - type: dimensional
    description: Output grid width is double the input grid width, height is equal.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive an input grid of integers.
2.  **Duplicate:** Create an exact copy of the input grid.
3.  **Concatenate:** Join the original input grid and its copy horizontally (side-by-side).
4.  **Output:** The resulting concatenated grid is the output.
    *   The width has been doubled.
    *    The height remains the same.

Essentially, the transformation rule is to duplicate the input grid horizontally.
