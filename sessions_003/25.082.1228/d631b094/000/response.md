Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and formulating a natural language program:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color.
*   The outputs are smaller grids, also containing single-digit color values.
*   The outputs seem to be related to the non-zero values in the input grids. The zero values (white) in the inputs seem to act like a background or are ignored.
*   The non-zero values appear to determine the output, and their count is significant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: varies (3 in examples)
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: varies
      - height: varies
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - observation: non_zero_values
    description: Cells in the input grid with values other than 0.
    properties:
       - color: varies
       - count: varies and matches a dimension of output_grid

  - relationship: output_size
    description: The dimensions of the output_grid are determined by the count of the repeated non-zero color in the input_grid.
    
  - relationship: output_contents
    description:  The output_grid is filled with the color of non_zero values found in the input_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Values:** Examine the input grid and identify the non-zero color values, ignoring any cells with the value 0 (white).
2.  **Check repetition** Find which non-zero color is repeated.
3.  **Count Occurrences:** Count the number of times the identified non-zero repeated color appears in the input grid.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new output grid. The output grid will be square. The side of the square is equal to the count from Step 3.
5.  **Populate Output:** Fill every cell of the output grid with the non-zero color identified in step 2.

Essentially, the rule extracts the non-zero repeated color from the input, counts the occurrences, and creates a square output grid of that size filled with the extracted color.
