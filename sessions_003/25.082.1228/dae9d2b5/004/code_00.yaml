facts:
  - task_id: dae9d2b5
  - input_grid_size: varies (e.g., 3x6)
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - object_types:
    - pixels:
      - colors: [0, 3, 4, 6]  # white, green, blue, magenta
      - properties:
        - position: (row, column)
        - color_value: integer
  - transformations:
    - color_change:
      - from: [3, 4] # green, blue
      - to: 6 # magenta
    - subgrid_extraction:
      - size: 3x3
      - method: Based on position/existence of color 3,4 pixels. Copy of area of the input grid.
  - overall_goal: Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid, transforming all blue and green pixels within that subgrid to magenta.
