facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The input grids are always 3x6.
  - observation: |
       Blue (4) and Green (3) pixels in the input grid are replaced with Magenta (6) in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      The positions of Blue and Green pixels in input influence output grid creation.
  - observation: |
    Example 1: Input has Blue/Green at (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,3), (2,5). Output 3x3 subgrid.

    Example 2: Input has Blue/Green at (0,0), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3). Output 3x3 subgrid.
  - observation: |
      The output grid appears to be a cropped section of the input.
