facts:
  - observation: "Output grid is always 3x3."
    evidence: "All provided examples have 3x3 output grids."
  - observation: "Blue (1) and Green (3) pixels in the input are often, but not always, transformed to Magenta (6) in the output."
    evidence: "Visual inspection of input/output pairs."
  - observation: "The transformation is position dependent within a 3x3 section."
    evidence: "Comparing transformed outputs with expected outputs shows consistent positional errors when using naive top-left extraction."
  - observation: "The output 3x3 region corresponds to a section of the input grid, but the selection rule is complex."
    evidence: "Pixels that are not 3 or 4 retain their values, and the 3x3 output grid size suggests copying of data, not generation."
  - observation: "In some examples, all greens and blues are transformed, in others, not all."
     evidence: "Example 2 transforms everything in a 3x3 area correctly, but others fail. Example 3 transforms more than the top left."
  - observation: "The top-left corner of the input is not always the top-left corner of the output."
    evidence: "Examples 3, 4 and 5 have differing top-left corners between input and output. Example 2 matches by chance, but is still instructive."
