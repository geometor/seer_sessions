The most prominent change is the replacement of certain colors (specifically blue (4) and green (3)) with magenta (6). The positions of the replaced pixels seem to correlate between input and output.\u00a0Zeros (white) seem to mostly stay as zeros, acting almost like a background or unchanged element. The core operation is selective color replacement, maintaining the grid structure.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
