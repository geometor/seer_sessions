facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Pixels with the value 0 (white) generally remain unchanged.
  - observation: |
      Pixels with the value 4 (blue) in the input grid are changed to 6 (magenta) in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      Pixels with the value 3 (green) in the input grid are changed to 6 (magenta) in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      The spatial arrangement of pixels is preserved; only specific color values are altered.
  - relationship: |
      Input grid (i, j) == 4 or Input grid (i,j) == 3 maps to Output grid (i, j) == 6
