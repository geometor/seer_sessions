Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core transformation appears to be a form of "doubling" or "mirroring" of the input grid. The output grid is significantly larger than the input, suggesting a replication or expansion process. The colors present in the input are also present in the output, maintaining their relative positions within the expanded structure. It seems that both rows and columns are duplicated. There's a symmetrical property apparent in all examples.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: "grid"
    description: "Input and output are 2D grids of integers representing colors."
  - property: "input_dimensions"
    description: "Dimensions (height, width) of the input grid."
  - property: "output_dimensions"
    description: "Dimensions of the output grid are double input + input."
  - object: "pixel"
    description: "Each cell in the grid, represented by an integer color code."
  - relationship: "spatial_duplication"
    description: "Pixels in the input grid are duplicated in both x and y dimensions in output"
  - relationship: "doubling output"
    description: "dimensions are 2x + 2y dimensions"
  - action: "expand"
    description: "The input grid expands symmetrically creating the output."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Get Dimensions:** Determine the height (h) and width (w) of the input grid.

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, empty output grid with dimensions (2h x 2w). This indicates doubling, creating space.

3.  **Double horizontally:** Iterate through each cell of the input. For each cell at `input[y][x]`, set two cells in output horizontal to the same value, `output[y][x]` and 'output[y][2w-1-x]`.

4.  **Double vertically:** Repeat process but iterate for each cell in previous output, 'output[y][x]`. For the cells at `output[y][x]`, set two cells in output vertical to the same value, `output[y][x]` and `output[2h-1-y][x]`.
