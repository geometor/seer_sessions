The output grid is significantly larger than the input, suggesting a replication or expansion process. The colors present in the input are also present in the output, maintaining their relative positions within the expanded structure. It seems that both rows and columns are duplicated. There's a symmetrical property apparent in all examples.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
