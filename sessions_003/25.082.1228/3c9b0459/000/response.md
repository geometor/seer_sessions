Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all provided examples.
*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the grid elements, rather than a change in values.
*   The rearrangement appears to be a rotation or reflection of some kind, but it's not a simple 90 or 180-degree rotation, nor a basic horizontal or vertical flip. It looks like the grid gets reflected along a diagonal, that goes from down-left up-right.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - dimensions: same for input and output
      - values: integers from 0 to 9
      - arrangement: transformation involves rearrangement of elements

  - type: transformation
    description: rearrangement of grid elements
    properties:
      - type: likely a diagonal reflection.
      - input_output_relationship: elements are swapped across the diagonal.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a reflection (transposition) of the input grid across the main diagonal, going from down-left up-right (secondary diagonal, anti-diagonal, counter-diagonal). Specifically, the element at position (row, col) in the input grid is moved to the position (n - 1- col, n-1 -row) in the output grid, where 'n' is the number of rows (which equals to the number of columns).

Another way: The output grid is generated by swapping the row and column indices, starting from 0, but flipped such that row `i` becomes column `n-1-i` and vice versa.
