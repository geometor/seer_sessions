Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers representing colors. The transformation seems to be related to the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid appears to be a cropped or sliced version of the input grid, retaining only a specific number of columns from the left side. The number of columns retained appears to be consistent within each example, but changes in the number columns of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - shape: rows x columns
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - shape: rows x output_columns
    relationships:
      - output_grid is a subset of input_grid
      - output_grid contains leftmost columns of input_grid
  - action: crop
    description: Select a subset of columns from the input_grid.
    parameters:
      - number_of_columns: determines how many columns to keep
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Width:** Divide the number of columns in the input grid by two (integer division).
2.  **Crop Input:** Create the output grid by taking all rows from the input grid, but only the columns from index 0 up to (but not including) the calculated output width.

In essence, the transformation is: "Extract the left half of the input grid to create the output grid."
