            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too simplistic, only considering the horizontal division. It correctly processed the first two examples because they happened to fit the initial, overly narrow rule (taking the left half). The third example failed because the initial rule does not account for odd numbered widths or specify taking anything other than the left side. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis was incomplete. We need a more robust rule that correctly describes a consistent relationship between all inputs and outputs.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Carefully examine *all* provided input/output pairs, not just the first one. Pay close attention to the third example, as it highlights the flaw in the current logic.\n2.  **Identify the Correct Rule:** Determine the *actual* relationship between the input and output grids. It's not simply taking the left half, when there is an odd numbered with, the \"left\" side needs to be determined.\n3.  **Revise the Natural Language Program:** Based on the corrected understanding, rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.\n4. **Document in YAML**: provide a detailed YAML documenting objects, properties, and actions in the transformation.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution when needed):**\n\nI'll analyze the dimensions and content of each input/output pair. Since the core problem isn't about color, I'll focus on dimensions, and verify the content programmatically to build confidence.\n\n"
