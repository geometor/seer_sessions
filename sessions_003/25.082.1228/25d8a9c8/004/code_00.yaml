observations:
  - example: 1
    input_first_row: [4]
    other_rows: [[2, 3], [2, 3]]
    expected_output_first_row: [5]
    expected_output_other_rows: [[0], [0]]
    rule: If the first row contains a single unique value, output 5. If a row contains only values present in the first row, output all 0s. Otherwise 5.
  - example: 2
    input_first_row: [3, 7]
    other_rows: [[6], [3, 7]]
    expected_output_first_row: [0]
    expected_output_other_rows: [[5], [0]]
    rule: If the first row contains more than one unique value, it is all 0s. If any value in any other row is not present in the first row it should be all 5. Otherwise 0.
  - example: 3
    input_first_row: [9, 2]
    other_rows: [[4], [9]]
    expected_output_first_row: [0]
    expected_output_other_rows:  [[5], [5]]
    rule: If the first row contains more than one unique value, output 0. If any value in any other row is not present in the first row, that row should be all 5. Otherwise 0.
  - example: 4
    input_first_row: [2, 4]
    other_rows: [[2, 4], [1]]
    expected_output_first_row: [0]
    expected_output_other_rows: [[0], [5]]
    rule: If the first row contains more than one unique value output all 0. If any value in any other row is not in the first row, output 5s, otherwise 0.
