facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The output grid consists of only 0s and 5s.
  - observation: |
      The first row of the output grid is all 5s if the first row of the input has one unique colors.
  - observation: |
      The first row of the output grid is all 0s if the first row of the input grid has more than one unique color.
  - observation: |
      Subsequent rows are all 5 if any colors in the current row is not present in the first row.
  - observation: |
      If all the colors are in the first row, the output row will be all 0.
  - rule_hypothesis: | #this summarizes example 2 and 4, also describes example 1 and 3
      The core rule is that the output rows after the first row
      are all 5s if a row has any colors that are not
      present in the colors of the first row. Otherwise the output row is all 0s.
