facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger and primarily blue (value 1).
  - observation: Output grids are smaller and do not contain blue (value 1).
  - observation: Non-blue colors in the input form contiguous rectangular shapes.
  - observation: Output grids contain the same non-blue colors as the input.
  - observation: Train example 1 has size 2x2 of color red and 1x1 of green.
  - observation: Train example 2 has size 1x2 of color green and red.
  - observation: Train example 3 has size 2x2 of color grey and size 2x2 of color magenta.
  - object_identification: The primary object is the input grid.
  - object_identification: Secondary objects are the non-blue rectangular shapes within the input grid.
  - object_identification: The output grid is a re-arrangement/extraction of the secondary objects.
  - property: Input grid size varies (e.g., 5x7, 7x7, 7x6).
  - property: Output grid size varies (e.g., 3x3, 3x2, 2x3).
  - property: The value '1' (blue) represents a background or padding.
  - action: Extraction of non-blue shapes from the input grid.
  - action: Possible rearrangement or removal of padding (blue) from the extracted shapes.
  - relationship: The colors in the output grid directly correspond to colors in the input.
  - relationship: The shape and size of non blue rectangle is somehow perserved.
