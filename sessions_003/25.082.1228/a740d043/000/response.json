The input grids seem to consist primarily of the color blue (1) with some other colors forming rectangular shapes within the blue background. The output grids appear to extract these non-blue rectangular shapes, and potentially modify their arrangement and remove the surrounding blue. The size of non blue shapes seems to be 2x2 mostly.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Place the extracted shapes into this new grid based on the following criteria:\n    - maintain the shape and color\n    - place shape on the rows in order they appear from top to bottom.\n    - remove the blue.\n    - Remove all columns with only 0 values.\n\n"
