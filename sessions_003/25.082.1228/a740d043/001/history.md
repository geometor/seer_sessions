Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grids seem to consist primarily of the color blue (1) with some other colors forming rectangular shapes within the blue background. The output grids appear to extract these non-blue rectangular shapes, and potentially modify their arrangement and remove the surrounding blue. The size of non blue shapes seems to be 2x2 mostly.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger and primarily blue (value 1).
  - observation: Output grids are smaller and do not contain blue (value 1).
  - observation: Non-blue colors in the input form contiguous rectangular shapes.
  - observation: Output grids contain the same non-blue colors as the input.
  - observation: Train example 1 has size 2x2 of color red and 1x1 of green.
  - observation: Train example 2 has size 1x2 of color green and red.
  - observation: Train example 3 has size 2x2 of color grey and size 2x2 of color magenta.
  - object_identification: The primary object is the input grid.
  - object_identification: Secondary objects are the non-blue rectangular shapes within the input grid.
  - object_identification: The output grid is a re-arrangement/extraction of the secondary objects.
  - property: Input grid size varies (e.g., 5x7, 7x7, 7x6).
  - property: Output grid size varies (e.g., 3x3, 3x2, 2x3).
  - property: The value '1' (blue) represents a background or padding.
  - action: Extraction of non-blue shapes from the input grid.
  - action: Possible rearrangement or removal of padding (blue) from the extracted shapes.
  - relationship: The colors in the output grid directly correspond to colors in the input.
  - relationship: The shape and size of non blue rectangle is somehow perserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Blue Shapes:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous rectangular regions that are *not* the color blue (value 1).
2.  **Extract Shapes:** Extract each of these identified non-blue rectangular shapes.
3. **Remove all zeros at the edges:** Remove all the padding rows or cols with all zero values at top, bottom, right and left.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid. Place the extracted shapes into this new grid based on the following criteria:
    - maintain the shape and color
    - place shape on the rows in order they appear from top to bottom.
    - remove the blue.
    - Remove all columns with only 0 values.
