            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies between the generated outputs and the expected outputs.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a single example, and it's clear that the logic doesn't fully generalize to the other examples. The core idea of expanding the grid and duplicating pixels is partially correct, but the positioning and border placement need adjustments. The current implementation adds a border of zeros that's too large (an extra row/column on all sides). The output shape is always `2 * input_shape + 2`, it should depend on the content of the input, as we can see that the output rows can either be equal to input rows or +1.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the differences between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` for each example. Pay close attention to the size of output and the placement of the expanded pixels.\n2.  **Refine Border Logic:** The border should be re-evaluated. It's likely a single row/column of zeros around the expanded content is the accurate approach, or it might only be needed on top and on the left, or not at all.\n3. **Adjust Pixel Expansion:** It expands the grid by duplicating each value, but it does not correctly position these duplicates to match what the expected output is.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when needed):**\nI will check properties of input and expected output of the examples.\n\n"
