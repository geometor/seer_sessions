Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies between the generated outputs and the expected outputs.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a single example, and it's clear that the logic doesn't fully generalize to the other examples. The core idea of expanding the grid and duplicating pixels is partially correct, but the positioning and border placement need adjustments. The current implementation adds a border of zeros that's too large (an extra row/column on all sides). The output shape is always `2 * input_shape + 2`, it should depend on the content of the input, as we can see that the output rows can either be equal to input rows or +1.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the differences between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` for each example. Pay close attention to the size of output and the placement of the expanded pixels.
2.  **Refine Border Logic:** The border should be re-evaluated. It's likely a single row/column of zeros around the expanded content is the accurate approach, or it might only be needed on top and on the left, or not at all.
3. **Adjust Pixel Expansion:** It expands the grid by duplicating each value, but it does not correctly position these duplicates to match what the expected output is.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when needed):**
I will check properties of input and expected output of the examples.

I apologize for the errors. It seems I am having trouble with the numpy arrays in the code. Let's try a different approach without code execution to analyze the provided input/output pairs.

**Metrics and Observations (without code execution):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input shape: (2, 2)
    *   Expected Output shape: (4, 4)
    *   Observation: The output grid's first row seems to add a 0 at the beginning and the end of the input first row. Then, it duplicates the input rows and columns.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input shape: (2, 3)
    *   Expected Output shape: (4, 5)
    *   Observation: Similar behavior to Example 1. It prepends and adds a 0, duplicates the input elements.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input shape: (3, 3)
    *   Expected Output shape: (5, 6)
    *   Observation: Again, adds zeros to the beginning and the end of the first row, expanding and duplicating other elements.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - description: "The input grid is expanded to create the output grid."
  - description: "Each element in the input grid is duplicated horizontally and vertically in the output grid."
  - description: "A border of '0' is added at the top and the left of the expanded grid, and bottom and right."
  - objects:
    - name: Input Grid
      properties:
        - type: 2D array
        - values: integers (0-9)
    - name: Output Grid
      properties:
        - type: 2D array
        - values: integers (0-9)
        - relationship: "derived from Input Grid by expansion, duplication, and adding a border"
  - actions:
    - name: Expand
      description: "Increase the dimensions of the grid."
    - name: Duplicate
      description: "Copy each element horizontally and vertically."
    - name: Add Border
      description: "Add a row of zeros at the top, and a column of zeros at the left, and bottom and right."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Border Addition (Top and Left):** Create a new grid that has one extra row at the top and one extra column to the left, filled with zeros. The dimensions of the new grid are initially (input\_rows + 1, input\_cols + 1).
2.  **Expand and Duplicate:** Iterate through each element of the *original* input grid. For each element at position (i, j):
    *   Place the element in the new grid at position (i+1, j+1).
    *   Also, Place the element to (i+1, j+2), (i+2, j+1), (i+2, j+2). This requires adding another row and col.
3. **Border Addition(Bottom and Right):** Add zeros at the bottom and right.

Revised program:

1.  **Create Expanded Grid:** Create a new grid that will hold the expanded and duplicated elements, along with a border of 0s. output\_row\_size = input\_row\_size \* 2; output\_col\_size = input\_col\_size \* 2
2.  **Add top and left border**: shift all elements by 1 to the bottom and right. output\[i+1]\[j+1] = input\[i]\[j].
3. **Expand and Duplicate**: Place each input element to form a 2x2 subgrid with the same value.
4. Copy the first row (except first and last element) to the top with prepended 0.
5. Copy the last row (except first and last elements) to the bottom, with prepended 0.
