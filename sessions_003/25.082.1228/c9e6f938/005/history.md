Okay, here's a breakdown of the information and a plan to address the errors:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a horizontal expansion by a factor of 2, correctly copying each original column and then inserting a duplicate of that column to its right. However, the mirroring aspect described in the docstring isn't accurate, as it simply duplicates the column instead of reflecting it. The errors highlight that the inserted column should sometimes mirror values from other columns, not just always duplicate the previous one. The strategy will involve identifying when and how this "mirroring" occurs, likely based on the position or content of the original columns. It also might not be a true mirror.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Focus on the pixels that differ between the expected and transformed outputs.
2.  **Identify the Pattern:** The key is to figure out the rule that governs what the inserted column contains. It's not a simple duplication. It *might* involve mirroring a different column or a more complex pattern.
3.  **Refine the Program:** Revise the natural language program to reflect the discovered rule accurately.
4.  **Test:** the revised program will guide future coding, so be sure it is clear, consistent and accurate.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand:** Double the width of the input grid.
2.  **Copy:** Copy each column of the original input grid into the even-numbered columns (starting at 0) of the output grid.
3.  **Insert:** Fill the odd-numbered columns of the output grid. The odd columns take on the values of the other odd columns, scanning the grid from left to right, and alternating. The first inserted column copies from the first original column, the second copies from the third.
