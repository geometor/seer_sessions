observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      shape: varies (e.g., 6x3)
      values: integers 0-9
      colors: includes maroon (9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      shape: fixed 3x3
      values: integers 0-9, primarily 0 and 2
      colors: white (0) and red (2)
  - relation: maroon_to_red
    properties:
        input_maroon_count: varies
        output_red_count: varies, but seems linked to anti-diagonal pattern
  - pattern: anti_diagonal
    description: Red (2) pixels in the output appear to form an anti-diagonal pattern (top-right to bottom-left), and the presence or absence of a maroon (9) pixels in the input grid within a 3x3 section may affect if an anti-diagonal position is filled.
