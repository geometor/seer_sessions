facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x5)."
  - observation: "The first two rows in both input and output are always all zeros."
  - object: "row_3"
    properties: "Contains a mixture of 0, 1, and potentially other digits."
  - object: "row_4"
    properties: "Contains a mixture of 0 and 5."
  - object: "row_5"
    properties: "In the input, it's always all 5s. In the output, it changes based on values in row_3."
  - action: "Replace values in row_5 based on corresponding values in row_3."
  - relationship: "If a value in row_3 is 1, the corresponding value in row_5 becomes 1 in the output."
  - relationship: "If a value in row_3 is not 1 (0 or any other number), the corresponding value in row_5 remains 5 in the output."
  - action: "Replace values in row_4."
  - relationship: "row_4 in output has the 5 where row_3 in the input is non-zero"
