The primary focus seems to be on the interaction between specific rows and the values they contain. The transformation consistently modifies the bottom row and sometimes a row higher up, based on values present in another specific row.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

For each cell index, if the input value is non-zero at the same index in row three, place a 5, else a zero.\n3.  **Transform Row 5:** Create the bottom row (row 5) of the output based on row 3 of the input.\n4.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each cell index in row 5:\n    *   If the value at the same index in row 3 of the input is 1, set the value in the output's row 5 to 1.\n    *   Otherwise, set the value in the output's row 5 to 5.\n\nEssentially, the program replaces 5s in the last row of the input with 1s in the output, but only at the positions where row 3 of the input has 1s. The other positions in last row remain as 5. Row four is all 5s at index positions where row three has non-zero.\n"
