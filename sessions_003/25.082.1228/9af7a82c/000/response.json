They also contain single-digit integers (colors).  There's a consistent presence of '0' (white) in the output, often filling areas not directly corresponding to the input. The output grid seems to be generated in a consistent order (left to right). The output is always 5 rows tall.\n*   **Color/Number Correspondence:**  The numbers in the input grid do not seem to map *directly* to the *same* numbers in the output grid. Instead, the input numbers seem to be *ordered* and then placed sequentially from top to bottom, left to right in the output.\n*    **Ordering**: It appears the input numbers are put in ascending order to generate the output.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
