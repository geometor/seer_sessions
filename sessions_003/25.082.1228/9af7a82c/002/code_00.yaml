facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid's width is determined by the number of unique colors in the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The output grid's height is determined by a more complex rule combining input and output, where the height will be as tall as necessary to include each instance of each value, up to the height of the original input.
  - observation: |
      Unique colors from the input grid are placed in the output grid, column by column, and repeated downwards.
  - observation: |
       If a column runs out of unique values for that color while filling before reaching the bottom, it is padded to the input grid with zeros.
  - observation: |
      The order of unique values in the output is the same order as a sorted list of unique values in the input grid.
