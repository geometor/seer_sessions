The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex spatial manipulations or rotations. It appears to be a color substitution or conditional change, perhaps based on the presence of certain colors or patterns within the input grid. There is one specific color that is always changed to grey (5)\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
