Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was on the right track, aiming to replace specific colors with grey. However, it incorrectly replaced *all* specified colors, including those it should have left unchanged. The code needs to be adjusted to be more selective, replacing a color only when it matches the specified trigger colors AND maintains the original colors according to the examples. The issue is not the logic of replacement, but the condition under which a replacement occurs. Example 4 succeeded only by chance.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze the differences between the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Pay close attention to which colors were changed and which remained the same, and the context/position.
2.  **Refine Conditions:** The core issue is that original colors should not be changed, so the code must preserve the values of colors that are not meant to be replaced.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, aided by code execution to confirm some observations:

    print(input_grid)
    print("Expected Output:")
    print(expected_output)

    # Check which cells are different between Input and Expected Output
    changed_cells = input_grid != expected_output
    print("Changed Cells (Boolean Matrix):")
    print(changed_cells)

    # Get the values in the input grid that were changed

**Natural Language Program:**

Replace all instances of the colors blue (1), red (2), green (3), and azure (8) with the color grey (5). Preserve all the original colors.

The original prompt was a correct description. The error was introduced in the implementation, where the original colors were not preserved.
