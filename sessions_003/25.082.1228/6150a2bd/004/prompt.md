The transformation rule almost performs a transposition of the input grid followed by reversing each row of the result. 
The only difference between this simple rule and the correct output is that column 1 and column 3 of the 
expected result have been swapped.

The program comprises these steps:

1.  **Transpose:** Transpose the input grid (swap rows and columns).
2.  **Reverse Rows:** Reverse each row in the transposed grid.
3.  **Swap Columns:** Swap the first and third columns of the result.
