## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both are 3x3 in the first example, and 3x2 on the second). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color substitution; instead, the positions of the numbers (pixels) are changing. It appears to be some kind of rotation or reflection, combined with a reordering or sorting.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - object: "Pixels (represented by digits 0-9)"
  - property: "Each pixel has a color (represented by the digit)."
  - property: "Each pixel has a position (row, column)."
  - action: "Pixels are reordered/moved."
  - relationship: "The transformation preserves the set of unique pixel values (colors), although the count per color can change."
  - observation: "The transformation appears to involve rotation and mirroring."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Transpose:** The input grid is transposed. This effectively swaps rows and columns, which is a combination of a reflection along the main diagonal.
2. **Reverse rows** Reverse each rows of the result.

In simpler terms, the transformation appears to flip the grid along its main diagonal and reverse the order of elements.
