Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid seems to contain a pattern of non-zero pixels (colored) interspersed with zero-value pixels (white). The output grid appears to be a diagonally expanded version of the input grid, with the original input values propagated along diagonals. The output grid's dimensions are related to the input grid's size.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The number of rows in output is rows + cols -1, and number of columns of output is also rows + cols - 1.\n2.  **Iterate Input Grid:** Examine each pixel of the input grid.\n3.  **Diagonal Propagation:** For each non-zero pixel in the input grid, propagate its value diagonally down and to the right in the output grid. The propagation continues until the edge of the output grid is reached. Zero-value pixels in input do not propagate.\n4.  **Fill Output Grid:** Initialize all cells in the output grid to zero. Then populate output using diagonal propagation of each of input grid.\n5. Output grid is complete.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule can be summarized as \"diagonally expand the non-zero elements of the input grid to create the output grid.\"\n"
