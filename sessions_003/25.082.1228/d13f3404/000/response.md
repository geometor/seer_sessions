Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid seems to contain a pattern of non-zero pixels (colored) interspersed with zero-value pixels (white). The output grid appears to be a diagonally expanded version of the input grid, with the original input values propagated along diagonals. The output grid's dimensions are related to the input grid's size.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      description: Contains initial pixel values.
      properties:
        rows: int
        cols: int
        pixels: list of int (0-9)
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      description: Result of transformation.
      properties:
        rows: int
        cols: int
        pixels: list of int (0-9)
relationships:
  - diagonal_expansion:
      from: input_grid
      to: output_grid
      description: Each non-zero pixel in the input grid propagates diagonally downwards and to the right in the output grid.
actions:
  - expand:
      object: input_grid
      result: output_grid
      description: Creates a larger grid by diagonally propagating non-zero pixel values.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output grid's dimensions are determined by a function of input grid's original dimensions. The number of rows in output is rows + cols -1, and number of columns of output is also rows + cols - 1.
2.  **Iterate Input Grid:** Examine each pixel of the input grid.
3.  **Diagonal Propagation:** For each non-zero pixel in the input grid, propagate its value diagonally down and to the right in the output grid. The propagation continues until the edge of the output grid is reached. Zero-value pixels in input do not propagate.
4.  **Fill Output Grid:** Initialize all cells in the output grid to zero. Then populate output using diagonal propagation of each of input grid.
5. Output grid is complete.

In essence, the transformation rule can be summarized as "diagonally expand the non-zero elements of the input grid to create the output grid."
