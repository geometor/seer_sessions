facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows, cols)
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: derived from input_grid (rows + cols, rows+cols)
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors), inherited from input_grid

  - action: diagonal_expansion
    description: Non-zero elements in the input grid are propagated diagonally in the output grid.
    details:
      - Each non-zero element becomes the starting point of a diagonal line.
      - The diagonal extends downwards and to the right.
      - The output grid size needs to accommodate full diagonals

  - observation: output_size
    details: output grid is always square and has dimensions (rows + cols) x (rows + cols), based on the examples.
