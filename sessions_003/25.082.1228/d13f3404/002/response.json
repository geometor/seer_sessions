            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the errors in the diagonal expansion code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a reasonable, but incomplete, interpretation of the first training example. It correctly identifies the diagonal expansion concept but fails to account for the full extent of the expansion in both dimensions. The output grids are consistently smaller than the expected output grids, indicating that the expansion logic needs adjustment to create a larger canvas.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Pay close attention to:\n    *   The dimensions of each grid.\n    *   The placement of non-zero elements and how they propagate.\n\n2.  **Refine the Expansion Rule:** The current code expands diagonally downwards and to the right. We need to refine the rule to determine the precise relationship between the input grid dimensions and the output grid dimensions. The current implementation seems to make a grid n + m -1 on each size, but this isn't correct.\n\n3. **Update Natural Language Program**\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\n"
