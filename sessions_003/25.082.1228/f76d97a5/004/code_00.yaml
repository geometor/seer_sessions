examples:
  - id: 1
    input_grid: [[4, 5, 4], [5, 5, 5], [4, 5, 4]]
    output_grid: [[0, 4, 0], [4, 4, 4], [0, 4, 0]]
    observations:
      - The central element of the input (5) is replaced with 4 if present on edge, 0 otherwise.
      - object: "central element"
        type: "pixel value"
        properties: { value: 5 }
        actions: [replaced by 4 at edge or 0]
      - The 4's in input become 0 when not on an edge, remain 4 if on the edge

  - id: 2
    input_grid: [[5, 5, 6, 6, 6], [6, 5, 5, 6, 6], [6, 6, 5, 5, 6], [6, 6, 6, 5, 5], [5, 6, 6, 6, 5]]
    output_grid: [[6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]]
    observations:
      - 6's remain as 6's at the edges and corners, and are turned to 0's elsewhere.
      - 5's are turned into zeros.

  - id: 3
    input_grid: [[9, 5, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 5, 5, 9], [9, 5, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 5, 5]]
    output_grid: [[0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9]]
    observations:
      - 9's turn to 0 if not on an edge. Otherwise they remain.
      - 5's are replaced with zeros.
      - The "edge" is important.
