facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The central element of input grid is replaced by 0 in the output grid.
  - observation: Elements diagonally adjacent to the center are often, but not always, replaced by 0.
  - observation: The transformation focuses on replacing the number with 0, creating a kind of "anti-cross" or X shape.
  - objects:
    - name: input_grid
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - values: integers (0-9)
    - name: output_grid
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - values: integers (0-9)
  - actions:
      - name: replace
        description: Replaces specific values in the input_grid with 0 in the output_grid.
        parameters:
          - value: original value
          - replacement: 0
  - relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: The transformation rule depends on the positions of elements relative to each other (center, diagonal, surrounding).
