The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example. There's a clear alteration of specific digits/colors based on their position and surrounding elements. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain digits with 0 (white) based on a pattern related to the central digit(s).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
