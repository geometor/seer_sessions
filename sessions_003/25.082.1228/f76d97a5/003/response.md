1.  **Find the Center:** Determine the central element(s) of the input grid. This is the element at the middle row and middle column if the grid has odd dimensions. If either dimension is even, the center will consist of the two or four elements closest to the geometric center.

2.  **Calculate Manhattan Distance:** For every cell in the grid, calculate its Manhattan distance (L1 distance) from *any* of the center elements.

3. **Conditional Replacement:** Examine the input grid again. Create the output grid such that for any cell in the grid with an L1 distance of 2 or greater from *any* of the center elements, if the value of the pixel does not appear in any of the central positions, then in the output grid set the value to 0.

4. **Copy other values:** If a cells L1 distance is less that 2 from the center elements, its value in the input grid is the same as its value in the output grid.
