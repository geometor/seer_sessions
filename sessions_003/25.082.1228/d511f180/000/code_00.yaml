objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        rows: variable (across examples)
        columns: variable (across examples)
        dimensions:  consistent (input/output have same dimensions)

  - cells:
      type: individual elements within the grid
      properties:
        value: integer (0-9)
        row_index: integer
        column_index: integer
        neighbors: adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)

actions:
  - value_change:
      description:  A cell's value changes to a new value.
      trigger:  Appears to be column-specific, likely the second column.
      rule:  Needs further investigation (see natural language program)

relationships:
  - input_output_grid:
      relation:  Direct transformation, same dimensions.
  - cell_cell:
      relation:  Neighboring cells, potential influence on value change.
  - column_transformation:
       relation: Specific column(s) exhibit a consistent change rule.
