1.  **Find Azure Block:** In the input grid, locate the contiguous block of azure (8) pixels. Determine its shape and the coordinates of its top-left corner.

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, initially empty, grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.

3. **Create shifted output:** fill a region in output grid with color red (2) that is the same size and shape as the identified azure block, with its top-left corner one row *below* the azure block's top-left corner.

4.  **Clear Unchanged:** Set all other pixels in the output grid to white(0).
