The primary colors involved seem to be azure (8) and white(0) in the input, and red (2) and white (0) in the output. The key change appears to be the replacement of a contiguous block of azure pixels with red pixels, while all other pixels remain as white (0). The positioning of red pixels in the output corresponds to the previous positioning of the azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
