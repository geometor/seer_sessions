The input grid (9x3) is divided into three 3x3 subgrids. The output grid is one of these subgrids. 
The selection criteria isn't immediately obvious (not always top, middle, or bottom).
The function implements selecting one subgrid. Currently, it takes the top section, but it
could also select middle or bottom.
