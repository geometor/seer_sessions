The input grids appear to be composed of distinct 3x3 subgrids, each containing a single color or a repeating pattern of colors. The output grid consistently corresponds to one of these 3x3 subgrids within the input. The selection of which 3x3 sub-grid to take seems arbitrary. It is not the top, middle, or bottom set. The selected grid section might also be dependent on the colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It could be:\n    *   The first sub-grid that appears\n    *   The last sub-grid that appears\n    *  A sub-grid that is dependent on the colors.\n3.  **Output**: The selected 3x3 subgrid is the output.
