1. Divide: Divide the 9x3 input grid into three 3x3 subgrids. These subgrids are created by taking rows 0-2, 3-5, and 6-8 of the input grid, respectively.
2. Compare: Compare each of the three 3x3 subgrids with the expected 3x3 output grid.
3. Select: Select the 3x3 subgrid that is identical to the expected output grid.
4. Output: The selected 3x3 subgrid is the output.
