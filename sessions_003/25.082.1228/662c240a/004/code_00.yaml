facts:
  - task: 662c240a
  - objects:
    - input_grid: 9x3 grid of colored pixels.
    - subgrids: 3x3 grids, derived from the input grid. Three subgrids are created by dividing input_grid vertically.
    - expected_output_grid: 3x3 grid of colored pixels, represents the desired output.
  - properties:
      - grid_size:
          input: 9x3
          subgrids: 3x3
          output: 3x3
      - colors: Integers from 0 to 9, representing different colors.
  - actions:
    - divide: The input grid is divided into three 3x3 subgrids.
    - compare: Each subgrid is compared to the expected output grid.
    - select: The subgrid that matches the expected output grid is selected.
  - relationships:
    - spatial: subgrids are vertically stacked within the input_grid.
