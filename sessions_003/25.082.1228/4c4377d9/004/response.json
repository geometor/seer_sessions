While the output grid's size is double the input grid's height, the content is not a simple stack of two identical reflected images. There's a consistent error across all examples, indicating a flaw in the reflection or stacking logic. The core issue seems to be that the reflection is correct, but the stacking combines the *original* with it's reflection. The examples, however, show the *output* is the reflected grid stacked on top of itself.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to correct the stacking part of the transformation. Instead of stacking the reflected grid with the original, it must stack the reflected input grid with itself.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nLet's examine the structure of the incorrect transformed outputs and compare that to the structure of correct expected output to build our understanding.\n\nAll images show similar characteristics, so just do this for example 1.\n\n"
