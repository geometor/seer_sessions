Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a form of "filling" or "expansion" of colors, specifically downwards. The rightmost non-zero value in each row seems to be important.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid: Input grid (2D array of integers)
  - grid: Output grid (2D array of integers)
  - pixels: Individual cells within the grids, represented by integers (colors).
  - non_zero_pixels: Pixels with values other than 0.
  - rightmost_non_zero: The non-zero pixel furthest to the right in each row.

properties:
  - color: The integer value of a pixel.
  - position: The row and column index of a pixel.

actions:
  - fill_down: Replicating the value of a pixel in the cells below it.

relationships:
  - row_membership: Pixels belonging to the same row.
  - column_membership: Pixels belonging to the same column.
  - rightmost_in_row: A non-zero pixel with the largest column index in a given row.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.

2. **Identify** the rightmost non-zero pixel in the current row.

3. **If** a rightmost non-zero pixel exists:
   - **Iterate** through all rows below the current row, within the same grid.
   - In each of these lower rows:
     - **Iterate through each cell starting from the beginning of the row and finishing at the same column as the rightmost non-zero-pixel identified in step 2**
     - **Set** these cells to the value of the rightmost non-zero pixel, identified in step 2.

4.  **Result**: Return the modified grid.

In essence, the program finds the rightmost non-zero pixel in each row and uses its value to fill the cells directly below and those to the left in the subsequent rows.
