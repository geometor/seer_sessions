## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, likely representing colored pixels.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical within each example pair, but different between pairs (3x3 and 3x3 vs 3x2 and 3x2)
*   The digits (colors) in the input grid appear to be re-arranged in the output grid. The transformation doesn't introduce new colors or eliminate any existing ones present, its a permutation.
*   The most striking feature is how the bottom row from input becomes the top row of the output, top row becomes bottom row of output and, middle row is transposed.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves rearranging the pixels of a grid. The transformation maintains the dimensions of the grid.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - values: digits (0-9, representing colors)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns (same as input_grid)
      - values: digits (0-9, representing colors)

  - name: row
    type: 1D array

actions:
    - name: transpose
      description: order of elements in rows is reversed

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - input_grid and output_grid contains same set of unique digits, in other words color counts are same.

transformations:
  - name: row_rearrangement
    description: The rows of the input grid are reordered and/or transposed to form the output grid.
    details: |
        Spefically,
        1. the last input row becomes first output row.
        2. the first input row become last output row, and
        3. the middle row is transposed i.e. values are placed in reverse order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input Rows**: Access the input grid and treat each horizontal line as a row.
2. **Rearrange:**
    *   Take the last row of the input and make it first row in output
    *    Take first row of the input and make it last row in output
    *   Take the middle row and transpose it (reverse elements) to form the middle row of the output.
3.  **Construct Output**: Combine the reordered rows to create the output grid.
