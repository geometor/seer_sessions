The output grid consists of a single, repeated digit. The core challenge seems to be identifying which digit from the input grid becomes the uniform digit in the output grid. It's not immediately obvious which input digit is chosen, it is not the most frequent, or any corner, center, or edge element. I will look for a consistent rule governing this selection.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
