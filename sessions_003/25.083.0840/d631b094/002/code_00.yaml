observations:
  - example_set: training
    example_count: 5
    input_grid_common_properties:
        shape: 3x3
        colors: contains 0 and one other color
    output_grid_common_properties:
        shape: varies, can be 1x1 or (1,) #Note, numpy treats (1,) and 1x1 as slightly different
        colors: the single non-zero color from the input
    transformation_rules:
        size_derivation: output grid is always 1x1 or (1,) - the single non-zero pixel in the input grid becomes the single pixel in the output grid
        color_derivation:  The single non-zero color is extracted.
        object_identification: The single non-zero pixel.
