task_description: |
  The task involves extracting a specific color from a 3x3 input grid and
  creating a new grid containing only that color. The size of output appears
  to be related to number of instances of the identified color in input.

observations:
  - object_types:
      - input_grid:
          type: 3x3 grid
          elements: integers 0-9
          properties:
            - contains single non-zero color
      - output_grid:
          type: variable size grid (rows x cols)
          elements: integers 0-9
          properties:
            - contains only the non-zero color from the input_grid
  - relationships:
      - input_to_output_color: output_grid color is the same as the non-zero color in the input_grid.
      - input_count_to_output_size: the number of times the non-zero color appears in input is related to the size of the output.
