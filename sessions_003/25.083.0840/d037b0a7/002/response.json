            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. They only considered the first example and made an incorrect generalization about propagating colors only from non-zero pixels that *don't* touch zeros. The results on the other examples clearly show this is wrong. The propagation rule needs to be revised.  The current implementation also seems overly complicated (checking neighbors).  A simpler approach focusing on the actual core transformation is needed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the failures:** Carefully examine *why* the existing code failed on examples 2 and 3. Pay close attention to the expected outputs.\n2.  **Identify the *correct* propagation rule:**  The core issue is understanding exactly *which* non-zero pixels propagate and in *what direction*.\n3.  **Simplify the approach:**  The neighbor-checking seems unnecessary. Focus on a direct rule based on row and column position.\n4.  **Revise the natural language program:**  Clearly state the new, corrected rule.\n5.  **Generate new code (in the next phase):** Based on revised natural language instructions.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Observations (using code execution for verification):**\n\n"
