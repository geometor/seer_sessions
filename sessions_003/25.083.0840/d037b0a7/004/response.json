            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program performed well on the first two examples but failed on the third. The core issue seems to be an over-propagation of the diagonal fill in the down-right direction. In Example 3, the '2' (red) pixel propagated one step too far diagonally, filling a cell that should have remained '0' based on the expected output. This suggests a need to refine the stopping condition for the diagonal propagation.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Example 3 Closely:** Carefully examine the pixel-by-pixel comparison of the transformed output and the expected output for Example 3 to pinpoint *exactly* where the propagation logic deviates.\n2.  **Refine Stopping Condition:** The current stopping condition for diagonal propagation is encountering a non-zero pixel or reaching the grid edge. We need to consider if there's an additional constraint, possibly related to the original positions of non-zero pixels, that limits the diagonal fill. It might relate to the vertical propagation, the propagation should stop when the vertically propagated pixel below the \"source\" is not 0.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Re-describe the transformation rule, incorporating the refined stopping condition.\n4.  **Test:** Create a hypothesis and test it.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using print statements for clarity - no code execution needed for this simple case):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Match: True\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n    *   Observation: Perfect match. Downward and diagonal propagation worked as initially intended.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Match: True\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n    *   Observation: Perfect match. Again, propagation works correctly. The presence of a zero row at the bottom doesn't affect the outcome.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 1\n    *   Observation: Incorrect. The diagonal propagation of '2' (red) extended one cell too far to the bottom-right. The cell at the bottom right corner should be 0, but it is now a 2.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

These are the \"source\" pixels.\n2.  **Downward Propagation:** For each source pixel:\n    *   Propagate its color downwards in the same column, replacing any zeros. Stop when a non-zero pixel or the bottom edge of the grid is encountered.\n3.  **Diagonal Propagation:** For each source pixel:\n    *   Propagate its color diagonally down and to the right (increasing row and column index), replacing any zeros.\n    *   Stop when:\n        *   A non-zero pixel is encountered.\n        *   The edge of the grid is reached.\n        *   The cell directly below the current cell in the downward propagation, relative to the *source* pixel's column, is non-zero. This means if a color has *not* propagated vertically to the row below the position of the diagonal propagation, the diagonal stops.\n\nThe key addition is the last stopping condition for diagonal propagation. It links the diagonal propagation to the vertical propagation, preventing the over-extension seen in Example 3.\n"
