objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:  # Represents the pixel's value (0-9)
      position: [row, column]  # Grid coordinates
      is_source: boolean  # Indicates if the pixel is a starting point for propagation (initial non-zero)

actions:
  - name: propagate_down
    description: Extends a pixel's color downwards in the same column until a non-zero pixel or the grid edge is reached.
  - name: propagate_diagonal
    description: Extends a pixel's color diagonally down and to the right until a non-zero pixel, the grid boundary, or another condition specific to the task.
