task_type: grid_transformation
input_grid_dimensions: 3x3
output_grid_dimensions: 3x3
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: color_propagation
    properties:
      - source: specific color(s) within the grid. Not constant, based on pattern.
      - direction: Appears to be bottom-right, but conditional
      - constraint: Bounded by zeros (white) or edges of grid.
observations:
  - train_1:  Magenta (6) propagates to the bottom right, filling one space each direction. Yellow(4) expands to the bottom, filling space until it hits edge of grid
  - train_2: Red (2) propagates, but remains bound by zeros, not filling empty space. Orange(7) and Azure(8) expand left and right respectively, filling empty spaces.
  - train_3: Yellow (4) propagates, filling empty bottom and bottom-left spaces, as does Green(2).
rules:
  - The transformation fills the bottom right diagonal and the bottom.
