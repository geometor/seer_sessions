The transformation seems to involve extending or replicating certain colors based on a specific rule, which isn't immediately obvious but likely involves some form of pattern recognition and conditional application. The key seems to be identifying which color(s) get propagated, and in which direction. The surrounding zeros (white) appear important, acting as boundaries or potentially \"empty space\" to be filled.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Yellow(4) expands to the bottom, filling space until it hits edge of grid\n  - train_2: Red (2) propagates, but remains bound by zeros, not filling empty space. Orange(7) and Azure(8) expand left and right respectively, filling empty spaces.\n  - train_3: Yellow (4) propagates, filling empty bottom and bottom-left spaces, as does Green(2).\nrules:\n  - The transformation fills the bottom right diagonal and the bottom.\n```"

If the original color is on the right, continue to fill the bottom-right diagonal.\n3.  **Stop propagation** when encountering a non-zero value, a zero, or the edge of the grid.\n\nEssentially, the program identifies a non zero color in the grid, and propagates that value to fill the bottom and bottom-right spaces based on the original location, bounded by zeros or the grid edge.\n"
