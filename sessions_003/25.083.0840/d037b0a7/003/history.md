2.  **Propagate, non-zero color to fill zeros along the bottom row, then the bottom-right direction.** If the original color is to the left of non-zero, continue to fill bottom until complete. If the original color is on the right, continue to fill the bottom-right diagonal.
3.  **Stop propagation** when encountering a non-zero value, a zero, or the edge of the grid.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. They only considered the first example and made an incorrect generalization about propagating colors only from non-zero pixels that *don't* touch zeros. The results on the other examples clearly show this is wrong. The propagation rule needs to be revised.  The current implementation also seems overly complicated (checking neighbors).  A simpler approach focusing on the actual core transformation is needed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze the failures:** Carefully examine *why* the existing code failed on examples 2 and 3. Pay close attention to the expected outputs.
2.  **Identify the *correct* propagation rule:**  The core issue is understanding exactly *which* non-zero pixels propagate and in *what direction*.
3.  **Simplify the approach:**  The neighbor-checking seems unnecessary. Focus on a direct rule based on row and column position.
4.  **Revise the natural language program:**  Clearly state the new, corrected rule.
5.  **Generate new code (in the next phase):** Based on revised natural language instructions.

**Gather Metrics & Observations (using code execution for verification):**

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify all non-zero pixels** in the input grid.
2.  **For each non-zero pixel:**
    *   Propagate its color downwards, replacing any zeros in the same column until a non-zero pixel or the edge of the grid is reached.
    *   Propagate its color diagonally down and to the right (increasing row and column index), replacing any zeros until a non-zero pixel or the edge of the grid is reached.
3. **Pixels propagate independently**

The key difference compared to the previous one, is the removal of checking neighbors.
