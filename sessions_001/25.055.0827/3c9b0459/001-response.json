Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The input and output grids appear to have the same dimensions and overall structure, suggesting a transformation that might involve rearranging or modifying the existing elements rather than creating new ones. The colors (represented by numbers) seem to be the primary objects, and the transformation involves a re-ordering of these colored pixels. It seems like it is performing a mirroring transformation over the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"

Each element at position (row, column) in the input grid is moved to position (column, row) in the output grid. In essence, the rows of the input become the columns of the output, and vice versa.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   Input (0,0) which is 2 -> Output (0,0)\n*   Input (0,1) which is 2 -> Output (1,0)\n*   Input (0,2) which is 1 -> Output (2,0)\n*   Input (1,0) which is 2 -> Output (0,1)\n*    ...and so on for other positions.\n"
