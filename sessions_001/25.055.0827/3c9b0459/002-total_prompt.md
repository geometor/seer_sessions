## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x795D0C77B0D0>

**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x795D0C9CAC20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The input and output grids appear to have the same dimensions and overall structure, suggesting a transformation that might involve rearranging or modifying the existing elements rather than creating new ones. The colors (represented by numbers) seem to be the primary objects, and the transformation involves a re-ordering of these colored pixels. It seems like it is performing a mirroring transformation over the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).

**YAML Fact Identification:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (representing colors)
    input_state: "2 2 1\n2 1 2\n2 8 1"
    output_state: "1 8 2\n2 1 2\n1 2 2"
  - type: transformation
    description: "mirroring of the values over the grid's main diagonal"
  - observation: colors swap positions based on the diagonal reflection rule
  - geometry: square grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation can be described as a reflection or mirroring of the grid elements across the main diagonal (the diagonal line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner).  Each element at position (row, column) in the input grid is moved to position (column, row) in the output grid. In essence, the rows of the input become the columns of the output, and vice versa.

For example:

*   Input (0,0) which is 2 -> Output (0,0)
*   Input (0,1) which is 2 -> Output (1,0)
*   Input (0,2) which is 1 -> Output (2,0)
*   Input (1,0) which is 2 -> Output (0,1)
*    ...and so on for other positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
