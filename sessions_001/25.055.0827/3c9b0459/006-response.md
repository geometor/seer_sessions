"""
The transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid. The output grid's dimensions are the inverse of the input grid's dimensions; the number of rows in the input becomes the number of columns in the output, and the number of columns in the input becomes the number of rows in the output. The elements are mapped such that each row of the input grid becomes a column in the output grid, progressing from the first row becoming the last column to the last row becoming the first column.
