Previous Code:

The transformation rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.  The number of rows in the input becomes the number of columns in the output, and the number of columns in the input becomes the number of rows in the output. The elements are mapped such that the first row of the input becomes the last column of the output, the second row of the input becomes the second-to-last column of the output, and so on.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code correctly describe a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The provided code works perfectly for all given examples.  Since all training examples produced correct output, there are no "errors" to address. The strategy, therefore, is to confirm that the initial observations are valid for all given examples, gather some basic descriptive metrics, and produce the YAML and natural language program deliverables. Because no discrepancies exist, the initial analysis will be re-enforced.

**Metrics and Observations**
Because this task involves simple grid rotation, code execution is not necessary to confirm dimensions. Visual confirmation will be sufficient, but the size data will still be provided for completeness.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input dimensions: 3x5
    *   Output dimensions: 5x3
    *   Result: Correct.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input dimensions: 7x5
    *   Output dimensions: 5x7
    *   Result: Correct.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input dimensions: 1x1
    *   Output dimensions: 1x1
    *   Result: Correct.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
task: 90_degree_rotation
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
    actions:
      - name: rotate_90_degrees_clockwise
        description: Rotates the grid 90 degrees clockwise.

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      dimensions: transformed (columns x rows of input_grid)
    derivation:
      source: input_grid
      method: rotation

```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid. The output grid's dimensions are the inverse of the input grid's dimensions; the number of rows in the input becomes the number of columns in the output, and the number of columns in the input becomes the number of rows in the output. The elements are mapped such that each row of the input grid becomes a column in the output grid, progressing from the first row becoming the last column to the last row becoming the first column.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
