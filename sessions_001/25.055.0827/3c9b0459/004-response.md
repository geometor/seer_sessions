"""
The transformation rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.  The number of rows in the input becomes the number of columns in the output, and the number of columns in the input becomes the number of rows in the output. The elements are mapped such that the first row of the input becomes the last column of the output, the second row of the input becomes the second-to-last column of the output, and so on.
