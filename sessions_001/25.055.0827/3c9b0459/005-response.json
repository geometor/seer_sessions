            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code correctly describe a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The provided code works perfectly for all given examples.  Since all training examples produced correct output, there are no \"errors\" to address. The strategy, therefore, is to confirm that the initial observations are valid for all given examples, gather some basic descriptive metrics, and produce the YAML and natural language program deliverables. Because no discrepancies exist, the initial analysis will be re-enforced.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\nBecause this task involves simple grid rotation, code execution is not necessary to confirm dimensions. Visual confirmation will be sufficient, but the size data will still be provided for completeness.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 3x5\n    *   Output dimensions: 5x3\n    *   Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 7x5\n    *   Output dimensions: 5x7\n    *   Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 1x1\n    *   Output dimensions: 1x1\n    *   Result: Correct.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 90_degree_rotation\nobservations:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      type: 2D array\n      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n      dimensions: variable (rows x columns)\n    actions:\n      - name: rotate_90_degrees_clockwise\n        description: Rotates the grid 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      type: 2D array\n      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n      dimensions: transformed (columns x rows of input_grid)\n    derivation:\n      source: input_grid\n      method: rotation\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid. The output grid's dimensions are the inverse of the input grid's dimensions; the number of rows in the input becomes the number of columns in the output, and the number of columns in the input becomes the number of rows in the output. The elements are mapped such that each row of the input grid becomes a column in the output grid, progressing from the first row becoming the last column to the last row becoming the first column.\n"
