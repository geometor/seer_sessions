## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
1 5 1
5 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x795D0C865870>

**output:**
```
2 1 5
2 5 2
1 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x795D0C65D3F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation appears to involve some kind of rearrangement or permutation of the cell values, as the same set of numbers are present in both input and output but in different positions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: cells
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer values (0-9)

  - type: cell
    properties:
       - value: integer (0-9)
       - color: derived from value
       - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: rearrange
    description: Permutes the positions of cells within the grid.

relationships:
  - grid contains cells
  - cells are arranged in rows and columns within grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule appears to involve a rotation of the grid. Comparing the input and output, it looks like a clockwise rotation by 90 degrees. To describe the program:

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of colored cells.
2.  **Process:** Rotate the entire grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
3. **Output:** The new 3x3 rotated grid.

Another way to express this is to describe the mapping of cell positions:

1. Input cell at (row, col) moves to (col, 2 - row) in the output grid.

For example:
Input(0,0) which has value 2 goes to Output (0, 2).
Input(0,1) which has value 2 goes to Output(1,2)
Input(0,2) which has value 1 goes to Output(2,2)
Input (1,0) which has value 1 goes to Output(0,1)
Input(1,1) which has value 5 goes to Output(1,1)
etc.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
