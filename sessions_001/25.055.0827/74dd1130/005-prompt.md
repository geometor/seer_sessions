Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule appears to be more complex than a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation. Based on the analysis of the training examples, the transformation seems to depend on the specific input grid. 

- Example 1: The output is identical to the input. It could be interpreted as no rotation, or a 360-degree rotation, or even mirroring across both axes.
- Example 2: Similar to Example 1, the input and output are the same.
- Example 3: The output is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input.

The initial hypothesis of a consistent 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. A new hypothesis could be a conditional transformation based on some properties like color or position.
The code attempts to address cases where the input grid remains the same (identity transformation) and cases involving rotation.

The input may remain unchanged if it is all of uniform color.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on observed patterns.
    The transformation can be identity or 90-degree clockwise rotation, seemingly dependent on object uniformity.
    """
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_array.shape

    # Check if the grid is uniform (all pixels have the same color)
    unique_colors = np.unique(input_array)
    if len(unique_colors) == 1:
        return input_grid.tolist()  # Identity transformation

    # If not uniform, perform 90-degree clockwise rotation
    output_grid = np.zeros((cols, rows), dtype=int)
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            output_grid[j, rows - 1 - i] = input_array[i, j]

    return output_grid.tolist()

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
