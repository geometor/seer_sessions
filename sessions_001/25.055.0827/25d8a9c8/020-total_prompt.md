## Example 4

**input:**
```
2 2 4
2 2 4
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x795D0C864220>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x795D0C6F0220>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains three distinct colors: red (2), yellow (4), and blue (1). The output grid contains two colors: white (0) and gray (5).  The most salient feature is the change in the bottom row. The blue row in the input is changed to a gray row in the output. The rest of the grid changes to white.

**YAML Fact Identification:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3).
  - input_colors:
      - red (2)
      - yellow (4)
      - blue (1)
  - output_colors:
      - white (0)
      - gray (5)
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The bottom row of the input grid is transformed.
  - transformation_rule: |
       The bottom row colors change, others change to white.
  - object_constancy: |
      Grid size does not change.
  - color_change: |
        Blue changes to gray.
        Red changes to white.
        Yellow changes to white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Obtain the input grid, which consists of pixels of various colors.
2.  **Top Two Rows:** Iterate over all cells of the top two rows. Set these to white (0).
3. **Bottom Row:** Iterate over all cells on the last row of the input grid. Replace with grey (5).
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
