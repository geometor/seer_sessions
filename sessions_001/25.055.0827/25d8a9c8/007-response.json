The input grid contains various colors (represented by numbers 0-9), while the output grid seems to simplify the colors, primarily using white (0) and gray (5). The transformation appears to be related to the colors in the input. Specifically, the output grid's middle row becomes gray, and all other locations are white. The shape is maintained.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
