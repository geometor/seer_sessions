Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation involves a simple color mapping. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
1.  If a pixel is red, change it to white (0).
2.  If a pixel is yellow, change it to gray (5).
3. If a pixel is maroon, change it to gray (5).
4.  Maintain the grid's original 3x3 structure. Other colors are not present in input, thus no explicit rule needed.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a copy to modify
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # change output pixels based on color mapping
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if output_grid[i, j] == 2:  # Red
                output_grid[i, j] = 0  # White
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 4:  # Yellow
                output_grid[i, j] = 5  # Gray
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 9:  # Maroon
                output_grid[i, j] = 5  # Gray

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
