observations:
  - task_type: grid_transformation
  - objects:
      - input_grid:
          type: 2D array
          elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
          properties:
            - dimensions: variable (height, width)
      - output_grid:
          type: 2D array
          elements: integers (0-9)
          properties:
            - dimensions: same as input_grid
            - color_palette: limited to gray (5) and white (0)
  - actions:
      - transform_row:
          input: middle row index
          operation: set all pixels in the row to gray (5)
      - transform_other_rows:
            operation: set all pixels to 0 (white)
  - relationships:
      - spatial: middle_row is determined by grid height
      - color_transformation: all pixels change to either gray or white.
