## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 9 2
4 4 4
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x795D0C8663E0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
5 5 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x795D0C865C00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors in the input grid seem to correspond to specific colors in the output grid. The spatial arrangement of the pixels remains the same (i.e. a pixel at a particular row,col in input maps to the same row,col in output), suggesting a simple color substitution.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (red, maroon, yellow)
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (white, gray)
  - type: transformation
    description: color substitution
    rule:
      red:   white
      yellow: gray
      maroon:  gray
    scope: element-wise (pixel by pixel)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation involves a simple color mapping. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
1.  If a pixel is red, change it to white (0).
2.  If a pixel is yellow, change it to gray (5).
3. If a pixel is maroon, change it to gray (5).
4.  Maintain the grid's original 3x3 structure. Other colors are not present in input, thus no explicit rule needed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
