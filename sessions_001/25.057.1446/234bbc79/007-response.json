The colors and their spatial arrangements change between the input and output. There appears to be some interaction or relationship between vertically adjacent pixels, and possibly some kind of object movement or replacement. Certain colors seem to trigger changes in other colors below them.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These vertical relationships carry from the second to last row, and appear on the last row.\n3.  **Blue(1) Addition** Where blue (1) appears in the first row, a series of blue pixels (1) is added to the last row.\n4. **Green(3) Addition** Where green appears (3) in the second row, green (3) appears in the last row.\n5.  **Preservation of Other Colors:** Colors not mentioned above are preserved in their original positions if there are not interactions.\n6.
