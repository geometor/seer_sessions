The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11 in this example). The transformation seems to involve selectively replacing certain colors based on their spatial arrangement and possibly their neighboring colors. Specifically, gray (5) and one type of red (2) is replaced, while blue (1) and another shade of red(2) pixels are retained, and white (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
