observations:
  - example: 1
    objects:
      - color: gray (5)
        property: seed for blue propagation
        location: all rows
        behavior: If a gray pixel is present and above a non-black, blue appears
      - color: blue (1)
        property: propagates upwards
        location: bottom row, and above gray pixels
        behavior: Appears in the bottom row where gray is above, and continues upwards in connected cells above other blue cells.
      - color: black (0)
        property: blocking
        behavior: Prevents vertical propagation of blue.

  - example: 2, 3
    objects:
      - color: gray (5)
        property: seed for blue propagation
        location: any row
        behavior: If a gray pixel is present, check below. If below is not black, blue replaces the gray. Blue propagates upward from here.
      - color: blue (1)
        property: propagates upwards
        location: vertically adjacent to other blue pixels, originating from initial gray replacement.
        behavior:  Replaces gray pixels vertically above if the pixel directly below is blue.
      - color: black (0)
        property: blocking
        behavior: Prevents vertical propagation.
