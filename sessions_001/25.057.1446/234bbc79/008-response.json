These vertical relationships carry from the second to last row, and appear on the last row.\n3.  **Blue(1) Addition** Where blue (1) appears in the first row, a series of blue pixels (1) is added to the last row.\n4. **Green(3) Addition** Where green appears (3) in the second row, green (3) appears in the last row.\n5.  **Preservation of Other Colors:** Colors not mentioned above are preserved in their original positions if there are not interactions.\n6.
