## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0 5 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x786C54816ED0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6
0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x786C547D33D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids (input and output) of colored pixels. The grids have the same dimensions (3x11). Several distinct colored objects exist, and single pixels and colors can exist.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
    dimensions: [3, 11]
  - type: object
    description: Objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color.
  - type: color
    description: Colors are represented by integers 0-9.
    mapping:
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red
      3: green
      4: yellow
      5: gray
      6: magenta
      7: orange
      8: azure
      9: maroon
  - type: observation
    description: There is a relationship between colored objects that move in a predictable way.
  - type: transformation
    description: two colored objects switch places
    details:
      object1:
         color_input: 5 (gray)
         color_output: 8 (azure)
      object2:
         color_input: 8 (azure)
         color_output: 6 (magenta)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of the same color within the input grid.
2.  **Locate Target Objects:** Find the gray (5) object in the input grid. Locate the adjacent object to its right, azure (8).
3.  **Color and location Swap (object):** Gray(5) object changes to Azure(8). The Azure(8) to the right of gray object in input changes to magenta (6). All pixels in gray(5) change to azure (8). All pixels in azure(8) change to magenta(6).
4. All other object in input, except for color, change their location to location + 1 in row to the right.
5.  **Create Output Grid:** Generate the output grid with the location and color-swapped objects based on object of the previous input.

In summary the gray, azure objects change to azure, magenta. All other objects shift +1 column, starting at their original column.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
