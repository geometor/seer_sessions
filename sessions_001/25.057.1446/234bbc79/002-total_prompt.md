## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 5 1 0 5 2 2
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x786C54814AD0>

**output:**
```
0 2 1 1 0 0 0
2 2 0 1 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x786C54816ED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have different dimensions. The colors in the input grid seem to be replaced or removed based on certain rules, resulting in the output grid. There's a noticeable reduction in the number of columns and rows. Specific colors seem to trigger changes, and the spatial arrangement of colors appears crucial. Gray (5) and Blue (1) seem to play central roles in this process, while white pixels are ignored.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is 9x3 and the output grid is 7x3.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x3
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x3
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - action: color_replacement
    description: |
       Specific colors in the input grid are replaced based on context of surrounding
       colors.
  - relationship: |
      Gray (5) pixels in the input grid seem to be removed, and the surrounding pixels
      are shifted.
  - relationship: |
      The Blue(1) in the input grid seems to be preserved.
  - relationship:  |
    The red (2) next to the gray in the input is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Remove:** Locate all gray (5) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Collapse Columns:** For each column containing a gray pixel, remove that pixel and shift all pixels to the right of the removed pixel one position to the left. This reduces the width of the grid. Do not remove the entire column.
3.  **Preserve Blues:** Preserve the values, in the same positions, of the blue pixel(s) where the value is 1.
4. Preserve Reds: Preserve red pixels that were adjacent to the removed gray pixels.
5. All other pixels are converted to white(0)

Essentially, the transformation removes gray pixels and shifts to the left, preserving blue pixels, and reds that were next to gray.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
