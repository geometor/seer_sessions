facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels of various colors, including gray (5).
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains a subset of non-gray pixels from the input grid, in a specific order.
  - property: gray_pixels
    value: 5
    description: Act as separators or delimiters within the input grid.
  - action: extraction
    description: Non-gray pixels are extracted from the input grid.
  - action: ordering
    description: The extracted pixels are arranged in a specific order in the output grid.
  - observation: row_reduction
    description: The output grid often has fewer rows than the input, and in many cases, collapses to a single row.
  - observation: column_reduction
    description: The output_grid has fewer columns than the input.
  - observation: gray_influence
    description: gray pixels are removed, and the non-gray values that preceed them are kept.
