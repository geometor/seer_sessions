## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 5 1 5 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3
0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x786C54816ED0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 0 0 0 3 3 3
0 2 1 1 1 3 3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x786C5470B450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The colors and their spatial arrangements change between the input and output. There appears to be some interaction or relationship between vertically adjacent pixels, and possibly some kind of object movement or replacement. Certain colors seem to trigger changes in other colors below them.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]  # Observed colors
      row: integer
      column: integer
    relationships:
      - vertically_adjacent_to: pixel

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    parameters:
      original_color: integer
      new_color: integer
      location: [row, column] # or a range, or based on a condition

  - name: move
    parameters:
      object: pixel
      from: [row,column]
      to: [row,column]
observations:
    - input_grid_size: [3, 11]
    - output_grid_size: [3, 11]
    - color_changes:
        row_1:
            '5': may be related to appearance of 1 in last row
            '1': may be related to appearance of 1 in last row
        row_2:
            '3': may be related to apearance of 3 in last row
        row_3:
            '5': replaced by 1
            '3': replaced by 3, no change
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.

2.  **Gray (5) Replacement:** Any gray (5) pixel in the input grid that has a vertically adjacent pixel *directly above* it is replaced with the color blue (1) on the *last* row. These vertical relationships carry from the second to last row, and appear on the last row.
3.  **Blue(1) Addition** Where blue (1) appears in the first row, a series of blue pixels (1) is added to the last row.
4. **Green(3) Addition** Where green appears (3) in the second row, green (3) appears in the last row.
5.  **Preservation of Other Colors:** Colors not mentioned above are preserved in their original positions if there are not interactions.
6. The output grid is the result of those changes.

Essentially, there seems to be some kind of filtering. Gray (5) pixels that appear in the second to last row are replaced by blue(1), and the location of a series of blues is controlled by the blues on the top row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
