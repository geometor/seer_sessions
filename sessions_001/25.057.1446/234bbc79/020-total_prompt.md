## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0
1 1 0 0 5 2 0 5 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x786C546CBCD0>

**output:**
```
0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2
1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x192 at 0x786C546CB250>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9) into another grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11 in this example). The transformation seems to involve selectively replacing certain colors based on their spatial arrangement and possibly their neighboring colors. Specifically, gray (5) and one type of red (2) is replaced, while blue (1) and another shade of red(2) pixels are retained, and white (0) pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x11
      - values: integers 0-9 (representing colors)

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - 0: white
          - 1: blue
          - 2: red
          - 5: gray
      - position: (row, column)

  - action: replacement
    description: changing pixel color based on a rule.
    parameters:
      - original_color: [5,2]
      - replacement_color: [0,2] depends on context described below
    conditions:
      - "if color is 5, replace with 0"
      - "if color is 2, and it is directly adjacent to a 5 horizontally, replace with 0, otherwise if 2 leave as 2"

  - relationship: adjacency
    description: two pixels are adjacent if they share a side (horizontally or vertically, can include diagonally but not in this task).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **If** the pixel's color is gray (5), change it to white (0).
3. **If** the pixel color is a specific shade of red (2).
    * check adjacent for any gray(5) pixels, if one is directly left or right, change to white (0)
    * else leave as red(2)
4.  **Else**, keep the pixel's original color.
5. output new grid

Essentially, all gray (5) pixels become white (0). Some red (2) are preserved, others are changed to white(0) depending on adjacency to gray(5). Blue (1) and White(0) are unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
