Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves identifying a single blue pixel in the input grid and generating a specific, diagonally repeating pattern of blue pixels in the output grid, starting from the location of the initial blue pixel.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros (white).
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Find the location of the blue pixel (value 1) in the input grid.
    blue_pixel_location = np.where(input_grid == 1)
    
    # start populating output grid from bottom left
    row = input_grid.shape[0] - 1
    col = 0

    # The pattern '1' placement can be described by alternating placement along x % 2 == 0, if not, then x+1
    while row >= 0:
      output_grid[row, col] = 1
      if row % 2 == 0:
          row -= 1
          col = 1
      else:
        if col == 1:
            row -= 2
            col = 0
        else:
            row -=1
            col = 2

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
