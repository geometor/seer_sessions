<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x640 at 0x786C547D3650>

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), which represent different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0) and blue (1). The input grid seems to have a single blue pixel in the bottom left corner, while the output grid features a repeating pattern of blue pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 10x3 (rows x columns)
      - elements: pixels
        - color: white (0)
        - color: blue (1)
      - location: blue pixel at [9,0] (row, col)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 10x3
      - elements: pixels
        - color: white (0)
        - color: blue (1)
      - pattern: repeating sequence of blue pixels

actions:
  - name: transform
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Replaces a specific pattern in the input grid with an alternating pattern of blue and white pixels.

relationships:
   - input_grid is transformed into output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the single blue pixel** in the input grid.
2.  **Create a repeating pattern** on the output grid starting from the bottom-left.
3.  The pattern follows an alternating sequence, starting with the value '1' at position [9,0], then '1' placed diagonally up and to the right [8,1], next vertically up at [6,1], then diagonally up and to the right, repeating until the entire output\_grid array is populated. The pattern '1' placement can be described by alternating placement along x % 2 == 0, if not, then x+1.

In essence, the single blue pixel in the input acts as a seed or trigger for generating a specific, diagonally repeating pattern of blue pixels in the output grid. The rest of the input grid (all white pixels) is seemingly ignored, replaced with an alternating sequence of '0' and '1' pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
