Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), which represent different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0) and blue (1). The input grid seems to have a single blue pixel in the bottom left corner, while the output grid features a repeating pattern of blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The pattern follows an alternating sequence, starting with the value '1' at position [9,0], then '1' placed diagonally up and to the right [8,1], next vertically up at [6,1], then diagonally up and to the right, repeating until the entire output\\_grid array is populated. The pattern '1' placement can be described by alternating placement along x % 2 == 0, if not, then x+1.\n\nIn essence, the single blue pixel in the input acts as a seed or trigger for generating a specific, diagonally repeating pattern of blue pixels in the output grid. The rest of the input grid (all white pixels) is seemingly ignored, replaced with an alternating sequence of '0' and '1' pixels.\n"
