The input grid seems to consist primarily of '0' (white) pixels, with a single '1' (blue) pixel in the bottom left corner. The output grid has the same dimensions, but the values appear to have changed. The single blue pixel in the input has become a white pixel. There is an alternating pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Where the input is `1`, the output is `0`, and vice versa.\n3.  **Second column complementing:** Each value in the second column of the output is the complement of the value in the first column, that is if the value in column 1 is `1`, then column 2 is `0`, and vice versa.\n\nEssentially, the transformation inverts the first column of the input and then creates a second column in the output that alternates opposite colors with the first column.\n"
