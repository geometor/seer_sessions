Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Locate the 2x2 block at the bottom right corner of the input grid.
2. Change all pixels within this 2x2 block to green (color code 3) in the output grid.
3. Fill the remaining upper region of the output grid with white (color code 0).

    # Initialize output grid as all zeros with size 4x4
    output_grid = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=int)

    # Get dimensions of the input grid
    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape

    # locate the bottom right 2 x 2 region
    bottom_right_region = input_grid[input_rows-2:input_rows, input_cols-2:input_cols]

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single training example, which led to an oversimplified rule. The rule assumes a fixed 4x4 output grid and only focuses on setting the bottom-right 2x2 block to green. The subsequent training examples reveal that this assumption is incorrect. The output grid size varies and isn't always 4x4. The core concept of a 2x2 green block in the bottom right seems consistent, but the handling of the rest of the grid needs adjustment. The strategy should be to generalize the size of the output to match and to ensure that only the designated 2x2 area is modified, leaving other areas from input intact when possible.

**Example and Result Analysis:**

To get a clearer picture, let's analyze each example pair and the code execution results. Because I can't execute the code, let me create reports base on my reasoning.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3, various colors
    *   Output: 4x4, bottom-right 2x2 is green, rest is white.
    *   Result: `SUCCESS` - initial conditions established.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5, various colors
    *   Output: 4x4, bottom-right 2x2 is green, rest is white.
    *  Result: `FAIL`, output was 4x4, it should be 4 x 4 according to current rule, however, comparing the result with the provided example output, we see that the output extends beyond the lower right corner - there are additional changes in the grid.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 2x2, various colors
    *   Output: 4x4, bottom-right 2x2 is green, rest is white
    *   Result: `FAIL`. Same reasoning as with the failure in Example 2.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: 2x2 block
    properties:
      location: bottom-right
      color: green
    actions:
      - identified in input
      - set to green in output

  - object: output grid
    properties:
      size: fixed at 4 x 4 in the provided examples
      color: varies
    actions:
      - initialized with zeros

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Grid Size**: The output grid is always 4x4, based on the examples.
2.  **Locate Bottom-Right 2x2 Block:** Identify the 2x2 block at the bottom-right corner of the *output* grid.
3. **Set to Green**: Regardless of the input, set all pixels within the located 2x2 block in the *output* grid to green (color code 3).
4.  **Fill Remaining**: fill the remaining cells in the *output* grid to white (color code 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
