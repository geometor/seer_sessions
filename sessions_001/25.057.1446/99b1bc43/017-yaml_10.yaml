objects:
  - description: Connected regions of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      color: Integer value (0-9) representing the color.
      shape: The arrangement of pixels within the region.
      position: The relative location within the grid, defined by row and column indices.
      size: the total number of pixels in the object.

actions:
  - name: Identify Regions
    description: Locate all distinct connected regions of the same color.
  - name: Determine Output Size
    description: Calculate the necessary dimensions of the output grid to accommodate all identified regions, preserving their relative positions. The max row and max col of *all* pixels determine bounds.
  - name: Reconstruct Regions
    description: Recreate each identified region in the output grid, maintaining its original color, shape, and relative position to other regions.
