is non-zero, the corresponding element in the output grid is set to 3; otherwise, it's set to 0.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and devise a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code attempted to divide the input grid into six specific blocks and map them to locations in a 4x4 output grid. The presence of any non-zero element within a block would result in a '3' (green) in the output; otherwise, a '0' (white). The later rows of the output are then defined to be copies of the other rows/columns.

The code produces the correct output only in the first example, and only partially correct in some other. This indicates that the core concept of block-checking and mapping to an output grid might have some relevance, but the specific block divisions, mapping logic, and output size/copying strategy are incorrect for a universal rule applicable to all examples. The task requires a more general approach, probably not fixed to particular grid regions.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The initial assumption about six fixed blocks and their specific mapping is clearly wrong. We need to shift towards a more flexible approach that detects patterns and relationships *across all* examples, rather than being tied to the first example's structure.
2.  **Focus on Object Properties**: Identify common elements or objects, their colors, positions, and how they relate in the input and output grids. Look for consistent object transformations, regardless of specific location on the grid.
3.  **Consider Alternative Transformations:** Experiment with different logical conditions beyond just "any non-zero value". Consider color-specific rules, spatial relationships (above, below, adjacent), and potentially counting.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with a simpler, more general rule, and gradually refine it based on the errors observed in each example.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**

I'll simulate code execution (since I'm an LLM) to get data on each example. I'll focus on describing what the code *does* and what the *correct* output should have been.

*Example 1:*

*   Input: 9x4, mostly white, with some scattered colored pixels.
*   Code Output: Correct (4x4, green in top-left, top-right, and bottom-left, rest white).
*   Correct Output: Same as code output.
*Example 2:*

    *   Input: 5x5 grid, various colors.
    *   Code Output: 4x4 with [0,3,3,3],[3,0,0,0],[3,0,0,0],[3,0,3,0]
    *   Correct Output: Should be a 4x4 grid with [0,3,3,0],[3,0,0,3],[3,0,0,3],[0,3,3,0]. The output from provided function is incorrect.

*Example 3:*
    *   Input: 6x3 grid, mix of 0 and 3.
    *   Code Output:4x4 with [3,3,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[3,0,0,0],[3,3,0,0]
    *   Correct Output: should be 4x4 with [3,3,0,0],[3,3,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]. The output from provided function is incorrect.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
facts:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: blue, position: scattered
        - color: red, position: scattered
        - color: yellow, position: scattered
        - color: green, position: scattered
      output_objects:
        - color: green, position: top-left, top-right, bottom-left
        - color: white, position: rest of the grid
      input_size: 9x4
      output_size: 4x4
      transformation: "presence of non-zero in a block"

  - example_2:
    input_objects:
      - shape: scattered pixels of multiple colors
    output_objects:
      - shape: 4x4 green frame with white interior
    input_size: 5x5
    output_size: 4x4
    transformation: "green appears around the edge"

  - example_3:
    input_objects:
      - shape: two columns and six rows of green and white.
    output_objects:
        -shape: 4x4 two rows of green at the top and two rows of white at the bottom.
    input_size: 6x3
    output_size: 4x4
    transformation: "green on top rows"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Output Grid Size:** The output grid is always 4x4.
2. **Example 1**: Consider input divided in sections, where each non zero section of the input maps a green color in a fixed position on the output.
3. **Example 2**: Build a 4x4 output frame. Check each input column and row. When there is a non-zero, put green in output frame.
4. **Example 3**: Split input grid in two. Upper goes in upper section of the ouput, bottom at the bottom.

This program combines and revises the initial attempt with a more generalized "if an input area has something, then a specific output area gets something", then changes to specific output area to follow the frame pattern, and ends with a generalized version of splitting input into upper/lower sections.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
