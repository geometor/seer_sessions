The input grid contains multiple colors, while the output grid seems to consolidate or summarize regions of the input grid with a single color (green, represented by '3') and white (represented by '0'). There's a clear reduction in dimensions. The input seems to be divided into distinct blocks.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
