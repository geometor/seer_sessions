## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0
1 1 1 0
4 4 4 4
0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2
2 2 0 2
0 2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x786C54B112D0>

**output:**
```
0 3 0 0
3 3 3 0
0 0 3 3
3 0 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x786C546CAC50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid is larger and contains a variety of colors (blue, yellow, red, white). The output grid is smaller and only contains green and white.  The output grid seems to be a distillation of the most prominent shapes, in a condensed space, from top-left. The relative positions are maintained.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x4
      - colors: [blue, yellow, red, white]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - colors: [green, white]
  - object: blue_region
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: blue
      - location: top-left
      - shape_approx: rectangle
  - object: yellow_region
     type: shape
     properties:
      - color: yellow
      - location: middle
      - shape_approx: horizontal line
  - object: red_region
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: red
      - location: bottom
      - shape_approx: rectangle
  - relation: size_reduction
    type: transformation
    description: Input grid is reduced in size to the output grid.
  - relation: color_change
    description:  blue,yellow,red in the input are replaced by green in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Find the distinct colored regions in the top-left quarter of the input grid. Ignoring any isolated single pixels, we look at areas 2x2 or larger. In this case: a blue rectangle-like shape in the upper part, a solid yellow horizontal line of pixels in the center, a red rectangle in the lower part.
2.  **Translate the Shape:** The relative position and size of these should be represented in the output.
3.  **Map Colors:** Map the colors blue, yellow, and red each become green in the output. White stays white.
4.  **Resize and Reconstruct:** Create a 4x4 output grid. Fill the grid with the color-mapped version from the top-left corner:
    -  A green 2x1 block where the blue region was
    -  A green 1x2 where the yellow block was
    -  A green 2x1 block where the red region was
    - All remaining spaces are filled white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
