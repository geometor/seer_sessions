Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples and results to refine the natural language program and understand the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial `transform` function (not shown, but implied) clearly doesn't capture the complete logic of the transformation. The code execution provides valuable information about shapes and non-white pixel locations, which are key to understanding what's happening. The consistent mismatch between predicted and actual outputs across all examples suggests a fundamental flaw in the initial approach, rather than edge-case issues. The main insight so far, it appears the output is a 2x2 grid. The current function is not returning any colors, but it appears that colors might relate to position.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Focus on Relative Positioning:** The output consistently being a 2x2 grid, and containing a '2' suggests the transformation extracts or summarizes information from the input and represents it in a compressed form. The position of the non-white pixel in the input seems relevant, as the placement of the 2 varies.
2.  **Hypothesis Generation and Testing:** We'll formulate hypotheses about how the input's non-white pixel position and color relate to the output's structure and color placement.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll refine the natural language program and corresponding code based on each example, paying close attention to discrepancies.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Let's break down each example using the `code_execution` output (which I will reproduce conceptually, as I am the one providing that in the first place).

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input shape: (4, 8)
    *   Output shape: (2, 2)
    *   Input non-white pixel locations: [[3, 6]] (blue (1))
    *   Output non-white pixel locations: [[1, 1]] (red (2)
    *   Prediction: Incorrect

*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input shape: (4, 8)
    *   Output shape: (2, 2)
    *   Input non-white pixel locations: [[2, 3]] (yellow (4))
    *   Output non-white pixel locations: [[1, 0]] (red (2))
    *   Prediction: Incorrect

*   **Example 3:**

    *   Input shape: (4, 8)
    *   Output shape: (2, 2)
    *   Input non-white pixel locations: [[1, 4]] (green (3))
    *   Output non-white pixel locations: [[0, 1]] (red (2))
    *   Prediction: Incorrect
    *   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Shape: (4,8)
    *   Output Shape: (2,2)
    *    Input non-white pixel location: [[1,2]] (grey (5))
    *    Output non-white pixel locations: [[0,1]] (red (2))

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** The output grid is always a 2x2 grid initialized with all zeros (white).

2.  **Quadrant Mapping:** The input grid (which appears to always be 4x8) is conceptually divided into four quadrants, each corresponding to a cell in the 2x2 output grid. These quadrants are:
    *   Top-Left (TL): Input rows 0-1, columns 0-3  -> Output cell [0, 0]
    *   Top-Right (TR): Input rows 0-1, columns 4-7 -> Output cell [0, 1]
    *   Bottom-Left (BL): Input rows 2-3, columns 0-3 -> Output cell [1, 0]
    *   Bottom-Right (BR): Input rows 2-3, columns 4-7 -> Output cell [1, 1]

3.  **Object Detection:** Within the input grid, identify if there is *exactly one* non-white pixel. If not present transformation is all 0.

4. **Color Assignment:** The cell at output\[1,1] is assigned to red (2) IFF there is one object in the input grid in the Bottom-Right quadrant

5. **Color Assignment.** The cell at output\[1,0] is assigned red (2) IFF there is one object in the input grid in the Bottom-Left quandrant.
6. **Color Assignment.** The cell at output\[0,1] is assigned to red (2) IFF there is one object in the input grid in the *either* Top-Right *or* Top-Left quadrant

7.  **Default:** If there isn't a non-white pixel in the corresponding input quadrant, the output cell remains 0 (white).

Key improvements in this version:

*   **Quadrant Concept:**  Explicitly defines how the input maps to the output.
*   **One Object Rule:** Handles cases where there might be no objects.
*   **Specific Color:** Describes exact location where the red (2) pixel is assigned
*. **Clarity**: Combines the object detection into a single concise rule

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
