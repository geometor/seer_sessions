## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3
0 3 3 0
0 0 3 3
3 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x512 at 0x786C5492F750>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0
2 0 0 0
0 2 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x786C546CAED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid contains pixels of various colors (represented by integers 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a simplified or abstracted version of the input. The dimensions of the input and output grids are different (8x4 input, 4x4 output). There appears to be some relationship between colored regions in the input and a single color (red, value 2) in the output.  Specifically, groups of non-white colored squares seem to correspond to areas of red in the output. White in the input disappears entirely.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 8x4, output grid is 4x4.
  - observation: Input grid contains multiple colors (0, 1, 3).
  - observation: Output grid contains only colors 0 and 2.
  - object: Input_Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 8x4
      colors: [0, 1, 3]
  - object: Output_Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      colors: [0, 2]
  - relationship: Input grid transforms to output grid.
  - action: Group contiguous regions of the same non-white color.
  - action: Count size/area of colored regions.
  - action: output squares colored 2 appear to related to these count
  - rule: "If the count of a non-zero colored is > 0 represent color is the area in red."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Iterate** through the input grid.
2. **Identify** contiguous regions (shapes) of non-white pixels (i.e., pixels with values other than 0). Consider pixels adjacent horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally.
3. **Determine** the location and size of each shape detected.
4. Check if any non-zero group is present in each quadrant of the input grid.
   - Divide the 8x4 input grid into four 4x2 quadrants (upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right).
5. **Create Output** 4x4 grid. For each 2x1 segment in the output grid set the value of `2` if the associated quadrant contains a non-zero shape, otherwise `0`.

Essentially, the presence of *any* non-white color in a quadrant of the input grid results in a red (value 2) in the corresponding location of the output grid. The output is a 4x4 grid, and maps to 2x1 vertical segments that correspond to 4x2 input quadrants.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
