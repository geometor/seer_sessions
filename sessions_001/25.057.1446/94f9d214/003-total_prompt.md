Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Focus on the upper half: Consider only the top four rows of the input grid.
2. Maintain width: the output has the same width, 4 columns.
3. Check for colored pixel: For each cell in the focused region of the input grid.
4. Transform colored pixels in the region:
    *   If the input cell is not white (0), set output to red (2).
    *   If the input cell is white (0), output remains white(0).

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms an input grid to an output grid based on the defined rule."""

    # Get dimensions of the input grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Initialize the output grid with the same width and half the height, filled with white (0)
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows // 2, cols), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the top half of the input grid
    for i in range(rows // 2):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Check if the pixel in the input grid is not white (0)
            if input_grid[i, j] != 0:
                # If not white, set the corresponding output pixel to red (2)

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
