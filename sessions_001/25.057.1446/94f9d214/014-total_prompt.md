## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 3 3 0
0 3 0 3
0 0 3 0
3 3 3 3
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x512 at 0x786C546CB0D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0
0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x786C54814E50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid contains various colors (represented by integers 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a simplified or filtered version of the input, primarily containing white (0) and red (2) pixels. The input grid is 8x4 and the output grid is 4x4. It appears there are distinct regions or objects of uniform color in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 8x4
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: integers (0, 2) representing white and red colors
  - observation: output_grid_height: one half input grid height.
  - observation: output_grid_width: same as input grid width.
  - observation: input grid contains regions/objects of uniform color, specifically blue (1), green (3), and white (0).
  - observation: output grid contains only white (0) and red (2) pixels.
  - relationship: output_grid seems to be a transformation of the input_grid.
  - action: transformation includes color filtering and potentially spatial reduction or object extraction
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Halve the Height:** Divide the input grid into two equal halves vertically. Consider only the top half of the input grid (rows 1-4).

2.  **Locate Green:** Within this top half, identify the locations (coordinates) of all green (3) pixels.

3.  **Change to Red:** Replace each green pixel in the top half with a red (2) pixel.

4. **Fill Rest:** Fill the remaining pixels from the top half with white (0).

5.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 grid is the output.

In essence, the transformation finds all the green pixels from the top half of the input and replaces them with red. Everything else in the top half of the grid becomes white to make up the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
