            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid contains two distinct subgrids, separated by what looks like a one-pixel border. The top subgrid uses colors green (3) and white (0) while the bottom subgrid uses blue(1) and white(0). The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid, and primarily contains white (0) pixels. A single red (2) pixel stands out. The position of this single coloured pixel has a relation with the two separated input subgrids.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Subgrids:** Divide the input grid into two subgrids based on a single-pixel horizontal white(0) divider.\n2.  **Locate First White Pixel in Top Subgrid:** Within the top subgrid, consider the top row of the first sub-grid, find the column index of the first occurrence of a white (0) pixel. Use this column index as a way of selecting that row number (minus one, to deal with index offset) from the top grid.\n3.  **Locate First White Pixel in Bottom Subgrid:** Within the bottom subgrid, consider the top row of the second sub-grid, find the column index of the first occurrence of a white(0) pixel. Use this column index directly.\n4.  **Combine Results:** consider the row and column determined above to be the location of the red pixel in the otherwise empty output grid.\n5. **Output Creation:** copy the colour of selected row,col to the output.\n6. fill everything else with white(0).\n\nEssentially, the program identifies two subgrids, uses the position of the first white(0) pixel on the top row of each subgrid to locate a single row and single column, it then finds the intersection of the two and copies its color to a smaller, blank output grid. The size of the smaller grid depends on the indices found.\n"
