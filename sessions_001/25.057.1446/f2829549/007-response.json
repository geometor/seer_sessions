The input grid appears to have various colors (orange, white, blue, gray), while the output grid primarily uses only white and green. The dimensions of the grids also change, with the input grid having a size of 4x7, and the output grid a size of 4x3. There seems to be a reduction of information in some structured way. The dominant change seems that a set of columns is somehow summarized into a single column.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If it's blue, it will turn to green. If it's any other color, it becomes white.\n"
