## Example 5

**input:**
```
7 0 0 1 0 5 0
0 0 7 1 5 0 0
0 0 0 1 5 5 5
7 7 7 1 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x256 at 0x786C546B4150>

**output:**
```
0 0 3
0 3 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x786C548805D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a larger dimension (4x7) than the output grid (4x3). The colors in the input grid include orange (7), white (0), blue (1), and gray (5), while the output grid only contains white (0) and green (3).  The output grid seems to be a compressed or summarized representation of the input, with a specific color (green) highlighting some aspect of the original. The relationship between the two grids isn't immediately obvious, but the consistent reduction in width (from 7 to 3) suggests a column-wise operation.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 4x7
    colors: [orange, white, blue, gray]
    color_codes: [7, 0, 1, 5]
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 4x3
    colors: [white, green]
    color_codes: [0, 3]
  - type: observation
    description: output grid width is smaller than input grid width
  - type: observation
    description: specific color change observed - some locations transform into green(3)
  - type: relationship
    description: possible column-wise transformation or summary
  - type: objects
    description: input grid contains regions or 'objects' of contiguous color.
  - type: objects
    description: input grid objects have relationships based on colors and location (adjacency)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through the columns of the input grid, taking three columns at a time.
2.  For each group of three columns. find columns that have 2 or more of the same number (color) and has at least 2 different numbers.
3. create a new column for the output for each match,
4. replace the column with green (3) and the other elements with white (0).
5. assemble all of the output columns into the final output grid.

Alternative and more concise natural language program

1. Iterate through the columns of the input grid in groups of three.
2.  For each group, examine if at any of the column there's is a predominant color (appears at least twice) and that color is not the only number.
3.  If a predominant color is found in a column, construct a new column for the output grid where all cells in that column are green (3). otherwise construct an output column of all white (0)
4. Combine the resulting columns to create the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
