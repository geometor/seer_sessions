The input grid appears to have a larger dimension (4x7) than the output grid (4x3). The colors in the input grid include orange (7), white (0), blue (1), and gray (5), while the output grid only contains white (0) and green (3).  The output grid seems to be a compressed or summarized representation of the input, with a specific color (green) highlighting some aspect of the original. The relationship between the two grids isn't immediately obvious, but the consistent reduction in width (from 7 to 3) suggests a column-wise operation.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
