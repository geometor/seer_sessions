The input grid appears to have distinct regions of color, while the output grid seems to highlight a very specific feature or pattern within the input. The crucial element appears to be the vertical blue stripe in the input. The output grid is smaller than the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
