Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the vertical blue stripe:** Locate the single-pixel-wide, full-height vertical stripe of blue (value 1) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Determine Output Grid Dimensions:** the output width is 3, the height is the same as the input

3.  **Construct output**: Create an output grid with height equal to the height of the input, and width 3.

4.  **Populate the output grid:**
    - The middle column is all white (0) pixels.
    - Output pixels to the left or the right are green, at row indeces offset by one.
    - if a green pixel would be placed outside the boundaries, do not place a green pixel
    - all other pixels are white (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
