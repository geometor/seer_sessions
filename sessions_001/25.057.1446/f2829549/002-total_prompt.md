## Example 1

**input:**
```
7 7 0 1 5 0 0
7 0 0 1 5 0 0
0 0 0 1 5 0 5
0 0 0 1 5 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x256 at 0x786C548818D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 3
0 3 3
0 3 0
0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x786C54881850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have different dimensions. There appears to be a selective replacement of certain colors based on some criteria, potentially related to their spatial arrangement or adjacency. The color 7 (orange) in input becomes 0(white) in output and 1(blue), 5(grey) are replaced with 3(green).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x7
      - values: [0, 1, 5, 7]
      - description: Represents a grid of colored pixels.

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x3
      - values: [0, 3]
      - description: Represents the transformed grid of colored pixels.

  - observation: color_change
    properties:
      - original_colors: [7, 1, 5]
      - new_color: [0, 3] # 7 becomes 0. 1 and 5 become 3.
      - description: Specific colors in the input grid are replaced by a different color in the output grid.

  - relationship: dimension_change
    properties:
      - input_width: 7
      - output_width: 3
      - input_height: 4
      - output_height: 4
      - description: The width of the grid changes from input to output, while the height remain the same.

  - relationship: column_selection
    properties:
      - selected_columns: [2,4,5]
      - description: It seems that some columns are being selected to make the output, counting starting at 0.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Column Selection:** From the input grid, select columns 3, 5 and 6 (remembering that columns and rows are zero indexed).

2.  **Color Replacement:** In the selected columns,
    *   Replace all instances of color 1 (blue) with color 3 (green).
    *   Replace all instances of color 5 (gray) with color 3 (green).
    *   Replace all instance of color 7 (orange) with color 0 (white)

3. **Output Formation:** Create a new output grid using only the modified selected columns. The dimensions of the output grid will be 4x3 (height x width).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
