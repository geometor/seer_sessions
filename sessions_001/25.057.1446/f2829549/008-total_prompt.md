## Example 2

**input:**
```
7 7 0 1 5 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0
7 7 0 1 5 0 0
0 7 7 1 5 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x256 at 0x786C548818D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 3
3 3 3
0 0 3
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x786C547D35D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have various colors (orange, white, blue, gray), while the output grid primarily uses only white and green. The dimensions of the grids also change, with the input grid having a size of 4x7, and the output grid a size of 4x3. There seems to be a reduction of information in some structured way. The dominant change seems that a set of columns is somehow summarized into a single column.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 4x7.
  - observation: Output grid is 4x3.
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 0 (white), 1 (blue), 5 (gray), and 7 (orange).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 0 (white) and 3 (green).
  - observation: The output grid's height matches the input grid's height.
  - observation: The output grid's width is less than half the input grid's width.
  - relationship: The output seems to represent some simplified feature set of the input grid.
  - object: Column 4 (index 3) of the input (all blue pixels) corresponds to column 3 of the output(all green)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Examine**: Check if there is color 1 (blue) in the current row.
3. **Check column**: Column 4 (index 3) is unique in that it contains only the color blue (1).
4.  **Transform**: Create an output row that is the length of unique column.
5.  **Fill**: If the unique column has a value of 1(blue), then the output pixel will be 3 (green), otherwise, the output pixel will be 0 (white).
6.  **Output**: Combine these rows to construct the output grid.

In simpler terms, the transformation checks each row of the whole input grid. If it's blue, it will turn to green. If it's any other color, it becomes white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
