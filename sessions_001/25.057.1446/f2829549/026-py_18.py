Iterate through the columns of the input grid in groups of three. For each group,
examine if at any of the column there's is a predominant color (appears at
least twice) and that color is not the only number. If a predominant color is
found in a column, construct a new column for the output grid where all cells
in that column are green (3). otherwise construct an output column of all white
