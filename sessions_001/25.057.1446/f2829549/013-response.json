The colors in the input and output grids seem to follow the standard ARC color mapping. The output grid appears to be related to specific vertical lines detected within the input grid. In this example the line of blue pixels transforms into a line of green pixels at an offset.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
