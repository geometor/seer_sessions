Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterate through the columns of the input grid in groups of three. For each group,
examine if at any of the column there's is a predominant color (appears at
least twice) and that color is not the only number. If a predominant color is
found in a column, construct a new column for the output grid where all cells
in that column are green (3). otherwise construct an output column of all white
(0) Combine the resulting columns to create the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program and observations.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a hypothesis formed from the first training example. It seems the core idea of focusing on columns was partially correct, but the specifics of "groups of three" and the predominant color logic are flawed when considering all the examples. The code fails to produce correct results for two training sets. It's necessary to rethink the transformation rule. The correct approach seems to be using 3 columns of the input to make each column, but not groups of three columns. Also, the most prevelant color is not a good approach.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully look at all input-output pairs, paying close attention to *all* examples not just the first.
2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Instead of focusing on "groups of three," look for a consistent relationship between *individual* input columns and output columns.
3.  **Revise Logic:** The "predominant color" concept is likely incorrect. We need to identify the *exact* condition that determines when an output cell is green.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Develop a new natural language program, generate corresponding code, and test it against *all* training examples.

**Example and Results Metrics:**

To get a clearer view, I'll use a simple representation of input and output, and whether the current code succeeded. I will denote the colors by their first letter (except for G=green, Y=yellow, A=azure, R=red, B=blue, M=magenta, W=white, K=gray, N=maroon).

```
Example 1:
Input:          Output:         Success:
WWK             GGG
WBK             GGG
WWK             GGG

Example 2:
Input:          Output:         Success:
WWR             GGG             
WWR             GGG
WWR             GGG

Example 3:
Input:          Output:         Success:
WWW             WWW
WRW             GWW
WWW             WWW

```

      input_objects:

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each of the three columns of the input grid *individually*.
2.  **Examine** each column.
3.  **Check**: If *all* the pixels in the input column are the *same* color, AND that color is NOT white (0), then the corresponding output column is all green (3).
4.  **Otherwise**, the corresponding output column is all white (0).
5.  **Combine:** The three resulting columns form the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
