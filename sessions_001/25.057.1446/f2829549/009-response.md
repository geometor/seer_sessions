Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a hypothesis derived from the first training example. While it correctly processed that example, it failed on subsequent examples. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis was too specific, focusing on a single column (the 4th). The updated hypothesis should generalize the logic and improve on selecting which columns to evaluate.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Broaden the Condition:** Instead of checking only the 4th column, the transformation should potentially check *any* column.
2. **Column Width:** The description in code states we expand to 3 columns, but there are varying widths of the columns in the examples
3. **Output Width:** the output width should be the same as input width, even though the solution generates a single column and repeats it.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations and metrics:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 5x5, Column 4 is all blue. Output: 5x3 all green.
    *   Result: Success.
    *  Yaml Fact:
        ```yaml
        input:
          width: 5
          height: 5
          blue_column_present: yes
          blue_column_index: 3
        output:
          width: 3
          height: 5
          all_green: yes

        ```
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5, Column 4 is *not* all blue. Output: 5x3 all white.
    *   Result: Success.
    *   Yaml Fact:

        ```yaml
        input:
          width: 5
          height: 5
          blue_column_present: no
          blue_column_index: 3
        output:
          width: 3
          height: 5
          all_white: yes
        ```
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 9x9, Column 4 is all blue. Output: 9x3 all green.
    *   Result: Success.
       ```yaml
        input:
          width: 9
          height: 9
          blue_column_present: yes
          blue_column_index: 3
        output:
          width: 3
          height: 9
          all_green: yes
        ```
* **Example 4:**
    * Input: 6x6, all white. Output is 6x3 and all white
    * Result: Success.
       ```yaml
        input:
          width: 6
          height: 6
          blue_column_present: no
          blue_column_index: null
        output:
          width: 3
          height: 6
          all_white: yes

        ```
*  **Example 5:**
    * Input: 11 x 11 grid, column 4 is all blue. Output is 11x3 all green
    * Result: Success
      ```yaml
        input:
          width: 11
          height: 11
          blue_column_present: yes
          blue_column_index: 3
        output:
          width: 3
          height: 11
          all_green: yes
        ```

**Revised YAML Facts (Common to All):**

```yaml
transformation:
  type: conditional_column
  condition:
    column_check:
      color: blue
      index: 3
  true_branch:
      set_column:
        color: green
  false_branch:
      set_column:
        color: white
  output_width: 3

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine Column 4:** Inspect the fourth column (index 3) of the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Check:** Determine if *all* pixels in the fourth column are blue.
3.  **Output based on condition**:
  *  **If True (all blue):** Create output grid, same height as input, with every pixel in every column set to green. Set width of output to 3.
   *  **If False (not all blue):** Create output grid, same height as input with every pixel in every column set to white. Set width of output to 3.
