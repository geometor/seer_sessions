The white pixels seem to form a distinct shape, possibly a cross or an 'X'.\n*   The output is a smaller grid (3x3) with red (2) and yellow (4) pixels. It appears to be some sort of simplified or abstracted representation of the input, but the precise connection isn't immediately obvious.\n*    It appears that the relative locations may be key, and possibly counting or summarizing pixels within certain input grid regions to create a much smaller output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

The central vertical line segment is filled yellow, the remainder of the horizontal line is red.\n"
