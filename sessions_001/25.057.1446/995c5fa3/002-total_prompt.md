## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 0
5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 0
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x786C54B107D0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
8 8 8
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C54B102D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The input grid seems to have a pattern of gray (5) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid has red (2), azure (8), and green (3) pixels. The spatial relationship and arrangement of pixels seem crucial. The input is a 14x4 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 14x4
    elements:
      - color: gray
        value: 5
        description: background
      - color: white
        value: 0
        description: forms a distinct shape within the background

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: red
        value: 2
        description: occupies top row
      - color: azure
        value: 8
        description: occupies middle row
      - color: green
        value: 3
        description: occupies bottom row

  - observation: |
      The white pixels in the input grid appear to be grouped and the arrangement
      is relevant. The sections of the input grid do not overlap

  - relationship: |
     The spatial arrangement of the distinct groups of white area in the
     input maps to rows in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Distinct White Regions:** Divide the input grid into three non-overlapping horizontal sections based on groups of white area.
    *   The first section is based on white area in rows 1.
    *   The second section is based on white area in rows 2.
    *   The third section is based on white area in rows 3.

2.  **Map Sections to Rows:** Each identified section from the previous step corresponds to a row in the output grid.

3.  **Assign Colors:**
    *   The first section/white area (rows 1) maps to red (2) in the output's first row.
    *   The second section/white area (rows 2) maps to azure (8) in the output's second row.
    *   The third section/white area (rows 3) maps to green (3) in the output's third row.

4.  **Populate Output:** Fill each row of the output grid (3x3) with the assigned color for that section. The row are all the same color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
