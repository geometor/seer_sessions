## Example 4

**input:**
```
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x786C6F638F50>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C547D3D50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, documenting facts in YAML, and creating a natural language program to describe the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements**

*   The input is a larger grid (14x4) primarily filled with gray (5) pixels and some white (0) pixels. The white pixels seem to form a distinct shape, possibly a cross or an 'X'.
*   The output is a smaller grid (3x3) with red (2) and yellow (4) pixels. It appears to be some sort of simplified or abstracted representation of the input, but the precise connection isn't immediately obvious.
*    It appears that the relative locations may be key, and possibly counting or summarizing pixels within certain input grid regions to create a much smaller output.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 14x4
    elements:
      - color: gray
        value: 5
        majority: true
      - color: white
        value: 0
        minority: true
        shape: "cross-like"

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: red
        value: 2
      - color: yellow
        value: 4

  - relationship: input_to_output_mapping
    type: unknown_rule # Placeholder for the actual rule
    description: "Transforms the input grid to the output grid based on some logic concerning the shape, position, and/or number of colored blocks."
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Divide** the input grid into nine approximately equal regions in a 3x3 layout. Since it's 14 wide and 4 high, these can't perfectly equal, but map closely to cells in the output.
2. **Analyze** each of the nine regions of the grid, based on the presence of the white (0) shapes.
    *   If the section of the input grid contains at least part of the section formed by white pixels that form a '+' sign in the center columns, and the vertical bar is not broken in this region, output yellow (4) pixel.
    *   Otherwise, if this part of the input grid contains white pixels where the horizontal bar of the '+' crosses, and there is no yellow region adjacent, then output a red (2) pixel.
    *   if no white pixels exist, skip and output nothing for this region.
3.  **Construct** a 3x3 output grid based on the above analysis

Essentially, this program is about finding the approximate center of the "cross" shape and representing it with a pattern in a smaller grid. The central vertical line segment is filled yellow, the remainder of the horizontal line is red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
