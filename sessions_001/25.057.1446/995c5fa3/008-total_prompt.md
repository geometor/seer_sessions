## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
0 5 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x786C54B102D0>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C5492F8D0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A rectangular grid of pixels, primarily gray (5) and white (0). The gray pixels appear to form a larger rectangular boundary.
*   **Output:** A smaller rectangular grid of pixels, with seemingly arbitrary colors (3, 4, and 2).
*   The output grid is much smaller (3x3) as the input grid (4x14)
*   The position of the white and gray pixels are very regular

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [4, 14]
      elements: [0, 5] # white, gray
      primary_color: 5  # gray
      secondary_color: 0 #white

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      elements: [3, 4, 2] # green, yellow, red
      primary_color: None
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Interior:** Locate the largest contiguous rectangular region within the input grid that is surrounded by a boundary of gray (5) pixels. This interior region will only contain white (0) pixels, and is defined by at least a one pixel thick border of gray pixels.
2.  **Define areas:** The white pixels form a rectangle. Split this rectangle area into 9 equal areas, like a tic-tac-toe board.
3. **Create Output Grid**: Generate a 3x3 output grid.
4. **Assign Colors**: Map the 9 equal parts of the input area onto the output grid. The top-left sector of input pixels will be represented as green(3) in the top-left cell of output grid.The center-top input sector will be represented as green(3) in the center-top cell of output grid, etc. The pattern is to fill each output cell using an arbitrary color (3,2 or 4) in the same layout as it appears in input.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
