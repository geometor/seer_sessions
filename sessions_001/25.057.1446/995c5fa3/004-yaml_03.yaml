observations:
  - task: "Map white-row-bounded sections of the input grid to colors in the output grid."
  - input:
      properties:
        - "2D array of integers (0-9)."
        - "Variable height and width."
        - "Contains rows of white pixels (0) that separate other rows."
      objects:
        - name: "White Row Region"
          description: "One or more contiguous rows containing only white pixels."
          properties:
            - "Defines boundaries for other pixel regions."
        - name: "Pixel Region"
          description: "A section of rows bounded by white row regions or the edges of the grid."
  - output:
      properties:
        - "2D array of integers (0-9)."
        - "Always 3x3."
        - "Each row corresponds to a maximum of three 'Pixel Regions'."
      objects:
        - name: "Output Row"
          description: "A row in the output grid."
          properties:
            - "Filled with a color based on the order of the corresponding 'Pixel Region'."
            - "First Region is always Red (2)"
            - "Second region (if present) is Azure (8)"
            - "Third region (if present) is Green (3)"
  - transformation:
      steps:
        - "Identify 'White Row Regions'."
        - "Count distinct 'Pixel Regions' between 'White Row Regions'."
        - "Create a 3x3 output grid."
        - "Map the first 'Pixel Region' to Red (2) in the first output row."
        - "If a second 'Pixel Region' exists, map it to Azure (8) in the second output row."
        - "If a third 'Pixel Region' exists, map it to Green (3) in the third output row."
        - "If fewer than three regions exist, use the mapping and complete with up to three rows."
