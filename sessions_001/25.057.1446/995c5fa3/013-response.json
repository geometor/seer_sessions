The output is a smaller grid containing the numbers 8 (azure), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow). The output grid appears to be a condensed representation of the input grid, with each row seemingly corresponding to a pattern or feature within the input.  There's a clear reduction in dimensionality from input to output. It seems the input is divided vertically in blocks, maybe.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
