The gray pixels appear to form a larger rectangular boundary.\n*   **Output:** A smaller rectangular grid of pixels, with seemingly arbitrary colors (3, 4, and 2).\n*   The output grid is much smaller (3x3) as the input grid (4x14)\n*   The position of the white and gray pixels are very regular\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This interior region will only contain white (0) pixels, and is defined by at least a one pixel thick border of gray pixels.\n2.  **Define areas:** The white pixels form a rectangle. Split this rectangle area into 9 equal areas, like a tic-tac-toe board.\n3. **Create Output Grid**: Generate a 3x3 output grid.\n4. **Assign Colors**: Map the 9 equal parts of the input area onto the output grid. The top-left sector of input pixels will be represented as green(3) in the top-left cell of output grid.The center-top input sector will be represented as green(3) in the center-top cell of output grid, etc. The pattern is to fill each output cell using an arbitrary color (3,2 or 4) in the same layout as it appears in input.\n\n"
