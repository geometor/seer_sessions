## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
5 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
5 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x786C546B43D0>

**output:**
```
8 8 8
2 2 2
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C5497D8D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of numbers, primarily 5s (gray) and 0s (white). The output is a smaller grid containing the numbers 8 (azure), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow). The output grid appears to be a condensed representation of the input grid, with each row seemingly corresponding to a pattern or feature within the input.  There's a clear reduction in dimensionality from input to output. It seems the input is divided vertically in blocks, maybe.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4 x 14
      elements: [0, 5]  # white, gray
      patterns:
        - vertical_blocks:
          description: "Grid appears divided into repeating vertical blocks."
          block_width: 4 # conjecture
          block_pattern: [5,5,5,5] [5,0,0,5] [5,0,0,5] [5,5,5,5]
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3 x 3
      elements: [8, 2, 4]  # azure, red, yellow

actions:
  - name: condense
    description: "The input grid is condensed into a smaller output grid."
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: representation
    description: "Each row in the output grid seems to represent information extracted a different part of input grid."
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide Input Vertically:** Divide the input grid into vertical blocks. Considering white spaces as delimiters, in the given example, the block length can be identified as 4.
2.  **Analyze Rows in blocks:** For each block.
    *   If a row exists filled with only gray, encode the number 8.
    *   If a row exists in which the second and third pixel is white, encode the number 2.
    *   If the entire block does not satisfy any condition above, encode 4.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Each row in it represents the extracted information using rules from step 2 for first three blocks vertically.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
