## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 0
7 4 0
0 0 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C6EBACB50>

**output:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0
3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0
3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0
7 7 7 4 4 4 0 0 0
7 7 7 4 4 4 0 0 0
7 7 7 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to be a compressed representation of the output grid. Each non-zero pixel in the input grid expands into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid. Zero-valued pixels in the input grid also expand to 3x3 blocks of zeros in the output grid. The spatial relationships between the colors in the input are perfectly maintained in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: derived from input_grid (input_rows * 3, input_cols * 3)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - relation: expansion
    subject: input_grid non-zero pixels
    object: output_grid 3x3 blocks
    properties:
      - type: one-to-many
      - color: preserved
      - spatial_arrangement: preserved
  - relation: expansion
    subject: input_grid zero pixels
    object: output_grid 3x3 blocks
    properties:
      - type: one-to-many
      - color: preserved (zero remains zero)
      - spatial_arrangement: preserved

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** Multiply the number of rows and columns of the input grid by 3. This determines the dimensions of the output grid.

2.  **Iterate:** For each pixel in the input grid:

3.  **Expand Non-Zero Pixels:** If the pixel's value is not zero, create a 3x3 block in the output grid. The top-left corner of this block corresponds to the position of the current input pixel, scaled by 3 (e.g., input pixel at (0,0) corresponds to output block starting at (0,0), input at (0,1) maps to output at (0,3) etc.). Fill this entire 3x3 block with the value (color) of the input pixel.

4.  **Expand Zero Pixels:** If the pixel's value is zero, create a 3x3 block in the output grid, using the same positional mapping as above. Fill this entire 3x3 block with the value 0.
5. The relative position between all pixels will be conserved after expanding.

In essence, the program takes each pixel in the input grid and expands it into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid, maintaining the spatial relationships.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
