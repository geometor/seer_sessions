"""
1.  **Identify Key Columns:** Find the columns containing the color combinations [9, 3] and [2, 4]. Note their positions.  It appears that 9 and 3 always appear together, and 2 and 4 always appear together.  Let's call the columns with [2,4] c24 and the column with [9,3] c93.

2.  **Vertical Flip within Columns:**  Within the identified columns (c24 and c93), the colored pixels are vertically flipped (inverted) within their respective column. If a column contains both combinations, both sets of pixels are flipped within that column.  Specifically, if there's a vertical line of colored pixels, the order of those colors is reversed in the output.

3. **Column Swap:**  c24 and c93 are swapped.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial strategy was partially correct in identifying key columns and performing vertical flips within them. The column swapping logic also seems correct. However, the vertical flip implementation had a bug, flipping all colored pixels when it should only flip colors in the target groups. This logic needs to be improved to only operate on the target colors, and not disrupt other parts of the column. The provided results show differences across all three training examples, highlighting these areas.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Refine Vertical Flip:** Modify the `vertical_flip_within_column` function to specifically target the [9, 3] and [2, 4] color pairs for flipping, leaving other colors in the column unchanged.
2.  **Re-evaluate Examples:** After fixing the flip, re-run the code and carefully examine the outputs to confirm all training examples now match.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed)**

I'll analyze each example pair (input vs. expected output) and the actual output produced by the code. Since I can't directly execute code here, I'm simulating the process. I'll note discrepancies.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Has [9,3] in column 0 and [2,4] in column 2.
    *   Expected Output: [9,3] in column 2, flipped to [3,9], and [2,4] in column 0, flipped to [4,2].
    *   Actual Output (from initial run): Matches the expected output.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Has [9,3] in column 2 and [2,4] in column 4.
    *   Expected output: [9,3] in column 4 flipped to [3,9] and [2,4] in column 2 flipped to [4,2]
    *   Actual output (from initial run): Differed from the expected output.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Has [9,3] in column 1, [2,4] in column 0 and one pixel of another color in column 1.
    *   Expected Output: [9,3] swapped and flipped with [2,4] in column 1, flipped to [3,9], and [2,4] in column 0, flipped to [4,2].
    *   Actual output (from initial run): Differed from the expected output, also changing an unrelated color.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: column_9_3
    properties:
      colors: [9, 3] #maroon, green
      behavior: vertical_flip, swap
  - name: column_2_4
    properties:
      colors: [2, 4] #red, yellow
      behavior: vertical_flip, swap
  - name: other_columns
    properties:
      colors: "any color other than 9, 3, 2, or 4"
      behavior: none

actions:
  - name: vertical_flip
    description: Invert the order of colors within a specific column.
    targets: [column_9_3, column_2_4]
  - name: swap
    description: Exchange the positions of column_9_3 and column_2_4.
    targets: [column_9_3, column_2_4]
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Find the columns containing the color pairs [9, 3] (maroon, green) and [2, 4] (red, yellow). We'll refer to these as `column_9_3` and `column_2_4`, respectively.

2.  **Vertical Flip within Target Columns:** Within `column_9_3` and `column_2_4`, *only* vertically flip the order of the pixels that are part of the target color pairs (9, 3 and 2, 4). Other colored pixels within these columns should remain in their original positions.

3.  **Column Swap:** Swap the entire contents of `column_9_3` with `column_2_4`.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
