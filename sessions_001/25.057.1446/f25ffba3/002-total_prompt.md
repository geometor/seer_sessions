## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 9
0 0 3 9
0 0 3 9
2 0 3 9
2 4 3 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x640 at 0x786C546B4150>

**output:**
```
2 4 3 9
2 0 3 9
0 0 3 9
0 0 3 9
0 0 0 9
0 0 0 9
0 0 3 9
0 0 3 9
2 0 3 9
2 4 3 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x640 at 0x786C546B5ED0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the example provided:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9).
*   The most salient feature is a vertical line of pixels on the right-hand side of the input grid, composed of maroon (9) and green (3) pixels.
* The left part of the vertical line, we can observe, red(2) and yellow(4) pixels.
*   The output grid appears to be a mirrored or reflected version of the input, with the "axis of reflection" running down the center of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: vertical_line
    properties:
      colors: [maroon, green, red, yellow]
      position: right_side
      shape: column
  - action: reflection
    description: The grid is reflected across a vertical axis in the center.
  - relationship:
      subject: left side colors
      relation: mirrored
      object: right side colors
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the vertical line of pixels along the rightmost edge of the input grid, there are the color of marron, and green.
2.  **Locate** the vertical line of pixels along the input grid, there are the color of red, and yellow.
3. **Mirror** the location of the pixels from the left side to the right side, and vice-versa.

In essence, the transformation rule is a reflection or mirroring of the grid across a central vertical axis. The right side is mirrored to the left, and the bottom on the top.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
