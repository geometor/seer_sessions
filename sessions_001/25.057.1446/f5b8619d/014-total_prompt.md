## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 4
0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x786C6F638F50>

**output:**
```
0 4 0 4
0 8 0 8
0 4 0 4
0 8 0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x786C5492F850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2x2 grid into a 4x4 grid. The input grid contains a single colored pixel (yellow, represented by the number 4) in the top right corner, with the rest being white (represented by 0). The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input. The single yellow pixel in the input seems to be replaced by a 2x2 block in the output. Within that 2x2 block an alternating checkerboard like expansion exists, a yellow pixel and a newly introduced azure pixel (value 8).  The white pixels in the input remain as the background and are expanded.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 2x2
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1]]
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        positions: [[0,1]]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [[0,0], [0,2], [1,0], [1,2], [2,0], [2,2], [3,0], [3,2]]
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        positions: [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 1], [2, 3]]
      - value: 8
          color: azure
          positions: [[1, 1], [1, 3], [3, 1], [3, 3]]

  - transformation: expansion
    input_grid_size: 2x2
    output_grid_size: 4x4
    pattern: |
      Each pixel in the input grid is expanded to a 2x2 block in the output grid.
      - If the input pixel is white (0), the 2x2 block is filled with white (0).
      - If the input pixel is not white, the 2x2 block contains a checkerboard of the original pixel color and azure (8).
    new_color: 8
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** The input grid (2x2) is expanded to an output grid (4x4).
2.  **Pixel Mapping:** Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid.
3.  **White Pixel Expansion:** If a pixel in the input grid is white (0), all corresponding pixels in its 2x2 output block are also white (0).
4.  **Colored Pixel Expansion:** If a pixel in the input is not white (in this case, yellow '4'), then fill the 2x2 block with a 2x2 checkerboard, using yellow (4) and introducing the azure (8), making sure it is not a solid color.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
