This suggests a scaling or expansion operation.\n*   The input grid contains mostly 0s (white) and some 5s (gray).\n*   The output grid contains 0s (white), 5s (gray), and 8s (azure).\n*   The 5s in the input seem to correspond to 5s in the output, but their positions and surrounding pixels change.\n*   The 8s (azure) in the output appear to be \"filling in\" around and between the 5s, and forming borders.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
