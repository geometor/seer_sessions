## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C5486CDD0>

**output:**
```
2 0 8 2 0 8
8 0 8 8 0 8
8 0 2 8 0 2
2 0 8 2 0 8
8 0 8 8 0 8
8 0 2 8 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x786C54B10650>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors involved are red (2), white (0), and azure (8). The smaller grid seems to be a "seed" pattern that gets expanded and tiled. There's a clear repeating pattern in the output, suggesting a simple rule based on the input grid's elements. The output grid appears to be created by replacing each cell in the input grid with a 2x2 block. Red cells in the input become a 2x2 block with alternating red and azure. White cells remain white (all zeros).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2] #red and white
      type: seed_pattern
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: 6x6
      elements: [2, 0, 8, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 8, 0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 8, 0, 2] #red, white, and azure
      type: expanded_pattern
  - transformation:
      type: expansion
      rule: replace_and_tile
      details:
          - input_element: 2 # Red
            output_block: [2, 8, 8, 2] # Red, Azure, Azure, Red (2x2 block)
          - input_element: 0 # White
            output_block: [0, 0, 0, 0]  # White, White, White, White(2x2 block)
  - objects:
      - name: red_cell
        input_value: 2
        output_pattern: [2, 8, 8, 2]
      - name: white_cell
        input_value: 0
        output_pattern: [0, 0, 0, 0]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Expansion:** For each cell in the input grid:
    *   If the cell is red (2), replace it with a 2x2 block: `[[2, 8], [8, 2]]`.
    *   If the cell is white (0), replace it with a 2x2 block: `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 6x6 grid is the output.

In essence, the program takes each cell of the input grid and expands it into a 2x2 block according to the cell's color, creating the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
