1.  **Initialization:** Start with an input grid of size 3x3. Create an output grid of size 6x6, initialized with zeros.
2.  **Expansion:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   If the pixel is red (2), replace it with a 2x2 block: `[[2, 8], [8, 2]]`.
    *   If the pixel is white (0), replace it with a 2x2 block: `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
    *  If the pixel is orange (7), replace it with a 2x2 block: `[[7, 7], [7, 7]]`.
    *  If the pixel is blue (1), replace it with a 2x2 block: `[[1,1], [1,1]]`
3.  **Placement:** Place the 2x2 block in the output grid at the position corresponding to twice the row and column index of the input pixel. For example, an input pixel at (0, 1) would result in the top-left corner of its 2x2 block being placed at (0, 2) in the output grid.
4. **Output:** The 6x6 grid is completed output grid.
