Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (10x10) of colored pixels into a smaller grid (3x3). The colors in the output grid seem to correspond to the central colored region of the input grid, with the surrounding white (0) pixels being removed. The transformation appears to be a form of "cropping" or "extraction" of the central non-zero colored region, preserving the spatial relationships of the colors within that region.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: [0-9]  # Integer values representing colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: [0-9]
  - name: core_region
    type: subgrid
    parent: input_grid
    properties:
        - colors: non-zero
actions:
  - name: extract
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Extracts the central non-zero colored region from the input grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid preserves the relative spatial arrangement of colors in the core_region of the input grid.
  - type: part_of
      - subject: core_region
      - object: input_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core Region:** Locate the contiguous block of non-zero (non-white) pixels in the center of the input grid.
2.  **Determine Boundaries:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the non-zero pixels. These boundaries define a rectangular subgrid.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create the output grid by copying the pixel colors from the identified subgrid (core region) of the input grid. All rows and columns outside of these boundaries are omitted.

In simple terms, the input is trimmed down to the colored object at it's core.
