## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 1 4
5 5 5
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x512 at 0x786C5470A850>

**output:**
```
2 1 4
5 5 5
2 2 2
1 1 1
4 4 4
2 2 2
1 1 1
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x512 at 0x786C5456C9D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have two distinct sections based on color: a top section with varying colors (red, blue, yellow, grey) and a bottom section filled entirely with white pixels. The output grid retains the top section from the input but replaces the bottom section with a repeating pattern derived from the colors in the first row of the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    dimensions:
      input_height: 8
      input_width: 3
      output_height: 8
      output_width: 3
  - object: top_section
    description: The top two rows of the input grid.
    properties:
      colors: [red, blue, yellow, grey]
      persistence: Remains unchanged in the output.
  - object: bottom_section
    description: The remaining rows of the input grid below the top section.
    properties:
     initial_color: white
     transformation: Replaced by a repeating pattern.
  - pattern: repeating_pattern
    description: Derived from the first row of the input grid.
    source: [red, blue, yellow]
    repetition: Repeated vertically to fill the bottom section of the output grid.
  - colors:
    red: 2
    blue: 1
    yellow: 4
    grey: 5
    white: 0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the top section:** The top section consists of the first two rows of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve the top section:** Copy the top section directly to the output grid.
3.  **Identify the repeating pattern**: The first row of the input represents the colors to build a vertically repeating pattern.
4.  **Generate repeating pattern rows:** Create new rows with the colors from the top row.
5.   **Fill the bottom section of output:** Starting from the 3rd row, fill rows of output with the colors red, blue, and yellow repeated. The output has the same dimensions as the input.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
