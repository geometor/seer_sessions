The input grid appears to have two distinct sections based on color: a top section with varying colors (red, blue, yellow, grey) and a bottom section filled entirely with white pixels. The output grid retains the top section from the input but replaces the bottom section with a repeating pattern derived from the colors in the first row of the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
