Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code execution results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial `transform` function (not shown, but called in `code_execution`) clearly doesn't capture the complete transformation logic, as evidenced by the varying degrees of correctness across the examples. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair and the corresponding code execution results, paying close attention to discrepancies between `output_shape` and `predicted_shape`, and the `correct` flag.
2.  **Object Identification:** Pinpoint consistent objects, their attributes (color, size, position), and how they change (or don't change) across examples.
3.  **Transformation Rule Refinement:** Iteratively update the natural language program to account for the observed behaviors. The goal is a single, consistent rule that applies to *all* training examples.
4.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Use observations to form hypotheses about the transformation rule.
5.  **Prioritization of Errors:** Focus on the most fundamental errors first. For example, if the output dimensions are consistently wrong, address that before fine-tuning pixel placement.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of the `code_execution` results:

```
Example 1:
{'input_shape': (3, 3), 'output_shape': (9, 9), 'predicted_shape': (9, 9), 'correct': False}
Example 2:
{'input_shape': (1, 1), 'output_shape': (3, 3), 'predicted_shape': (3, 3), 'correct': False}
Example 3:
{'input_shape': (3, 3), 'output_shape': (9, 9), 'predicted_shape': (9, 9), 'correct': False}
Example 4:
{'input_shape': (3, 3), 'output_shape': (3, 3), 'predicted_shape': (3, 3), 'correct': True}
Example 5:
{'input_shape': (4, 4), 'output_shape': (8, 8), 'predicted_shape': (8, 8), 'correct': False}
```

Key observations from these metrics:

*   **Correctness:** Only Example 4 is entirely correct. This is a very important clue. Example 4 is all zeros.
*   **Shape Changes:** The output shape isn't a simple, consistent scaling of the input shape. The relationship between input and output dimensions varies.
*   **Example 4:** This all-zero input/output pair is the simplest case and provides a baseline. It suggests that *absence* of certain features might lead to no transformation.
*   **Green (3) is important:** All examples except #4 contain green, and none are correct.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - example_1:
      input_object:
        type: rectangle
        color: green
        size: 2x2
      output_object:
        type: rectangle
        color: green
        size: 4x4
        position: center surrounded by white
      transformation: object expands and position changes, padding of white is added

  - example_2:
      input_object:
        type: single pixel
        color: green
      output_object:
        type: cross
        color: green, white
        size: 3x3
        position: 2 green pixels added
      transformation: one green pixel to cross

  - example_3:
      input_object:
       type: rectangle
       color: green
       size: 3 x 3
      output_object:
        type: L shape
        color: green, white
        size: 9 x 9
        position: 2 green rectangles added, rotated
      transformation: object appears duplicated and reoriented

  - example_4:
      input_object:
       type: rectangle
       color: white
       size: 3x3
      output_object:
       type: rectangle
       color: white
       size: 3x3
      transformation: no change

  - example_5:
      input_object:
        type: rectangle
        color: green
        size: 1x1 at (1,1)
      output_object:
        type: two pixels
        color: green
        size: two 1x1
        position: (1,1), (5,5)
      transformation: object duplicated diagonally
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a refined natural language program, taking into account the new information:

1.  **Zero Handling:** If the input grid contains *only* white (0) pixels, the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  **Green Object Identification:** If the input grid contains any green (3) pixels, identify the green object.
3. **Duplication/Expansion and Shifting:**
    *   If a single green pixel present, create a cross shaped object, the initial object at the top left, and two added green pixels
    *    Otherwise: The original green pixels remains in their original positions relative to the overall output grid, but a copy is created and moved. The direction and magnitude of the move depend on the size and potentially shape of original green. The pattern appears to be one where the green pixels also are placed diagonally down.
4. **Padding:** Empty cells are filled with zeros

This multi-stage process accounts for the zero-preservation, the appearance of expansion and shifting, and the role of green. The padding stage ensures the output dimensions match those in the examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
