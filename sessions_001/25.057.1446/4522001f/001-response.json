The green (3) pixels in the input seem to define the regions of green in the output. The red (2) pixel in the input grid is replaced with green.\n* **Objects:** the input grid is an object, and its sub-regions can be considered objects, especially continguous sections of the same color\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The top-left corner of each 4x4 block corresponds to a cell that had a value of 2 or 3 in the original input. Empty cells are filled with a value of 0. More precisely, the green and red cells in the input map to the top-left corner of the 4 x 4 green areas in the output.\n\nI believe this program explains the change from a small input grid with some 2 and 3 to a bigger output grid with only 0 and 3.\n"
