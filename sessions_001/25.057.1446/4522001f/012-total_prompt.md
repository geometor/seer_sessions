Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is expanded by a factor of three in both dimensions. That is, a 3x3 input becomes a 9x9 output.
2.  **Color Replacement**: All instances of color 2 (red) in the expanded grid are replaced with color 3 (green).
3.  **Object Replication and Translation**: The original 2x2 block of color 3(green) is duplicated to form a new 4x4 block of color 3 in the bottom right of the output grid, and a 4x4 block is created in the top-center. The remaining cells are set to color 0 (white).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, which involved expansion, color replacement, and object replication. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the transformation rule is more nuanced and doesn't strictly adhere to a fixed expansion factor or predetermined object placement. The strategy should shift from fixed expansion and placement to identifying and manipulating specific colored objects based on their presence and relative positions in the *input* grid.

The errors are primarily caused by creating a 4x4 grid. The code attempts to replicate the 2x2 green area in the examples, but the size and shape are not consistent.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the patterns better, let's analyze each example pair, focusing on the objects and their transformations. I'll use a simplified representation for brevity, but the core concepts are:

*   **Example 1:** Input has a 2x2 green square and a red pixel. Output has two 4x4 green squares.
*   **Example 2:** Input has a 1x1 green square. Output has two 1x1 green squares
*   **Example 3:** Input has a 3x3 green square. Output has two 3x3 green squares.
*   **Example 4**: Input is all white (0), output is the same
*    **Example 5**: Input has a 1x1 green area. Output has two 1x1 green areas.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The presence of green (color 3) objects in the input consistently leads to the creation of green objects in the output."
  - observation: "The output grid dimensions are not a simple multiple of the input dimensions in all cases."
  - observation: "If the input grid contains green, two green objects of the same shape are created"
  - observation: "The size of green objects in the output match the size of green objects in the input"
  - observation: "The top-left green object is created at the top-left of the output grid."
  - observation: "The bottom-right green object is created at the bottom-right of the output grid."
  - observation: "If a color other than green is present, replace the color with green."
  - observation: "If no green is present, do nothing"
  - object: GreenObject
    properties:
      color: 3
      behavior: "Replicated in output"
    rules:
      - "Create one instance at the top-left corner of the output."
      - "Create another instance at the bottom-right corner of the output."
      - "The shape of the output object equals the shape of input object."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Green Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of color 3 (green) in the input grid.
2.  **Replicate and Position:** If green objects are present, replicate each distinct green object twice in the output grid:
    *   The first replica should be placed at the top-left corner of the output grid, aligned with the top-left corner.
    *   The second replica should be placed at the bottom-right corner of the output grid, aligned with the bottom-right corner.
3. **Handle non-green, non-zero values:** If any other non-zero colors exist in the original input image, replace with green (3).
4.  **Preserve Dimensions (if no green):** If no green objects are found in the input, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
5. **Fill Empty Cells:** Fill the rest with zeros.

This revised natural language program accounts for the variable sizes and avoids unnecessary expansion. It focuses on identifying and replicating *existing* green objects rather than imposing a fixed transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
