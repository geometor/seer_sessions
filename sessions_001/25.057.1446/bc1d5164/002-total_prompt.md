## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 8 0 0 0 8 0
8 8 0 0 0 8 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
8 8 0 0 0 8 8
0 8 0 0 0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x786C546B4450>

**output:**
```
0 8 0
8 8 8
0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C546B7350>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numerical values, representing colors. The input grid is larger (5x7) than the output grid (3x3). It appears that a specific region of the input grid is being extracted to form the output. The dominant colors involved are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation seems to focus on a specific, contiguous block of azure pixels within a larger field of white pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 7
      elements: [0, 8] # Values representing colors
      dominant_colors: [white, azure]

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 3
      elements: [0, 8]
      dominant_colors: [white, azure]

  - relation: output_is_subgrid_of_input
    properties:
      location: centered, appears to extract a continuous region
      boundary_color : white
      content_color : azure
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the boundaries:** Locate the largest rectangular region within the input grid that contains a solid block, which can include different colors, but has at least one azure (8) and is surrounded by a continuous border of a different color (white/0).
2.  **Extract the subgrid:** Extract this rectangular region.
3. The extracted sub-grid is the output.

In simpler terms, find the azure/white block inside input and output that block.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
