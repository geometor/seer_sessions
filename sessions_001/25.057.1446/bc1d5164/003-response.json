            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focuses on finding a rectangular region of non-white pixels and extracting it, assuming it's surrounded by a white border. This works for the first example, but fails on the others, since the rule does not full capture the required transformation. The main issue is the shape and colors of the objects - which is dependent on the example. We need a more general approach that correctly identifies the transformation for all examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze each example:** Examine the input and output grids of each training example, focusing on identifying the shapes, colors and the transformations.\n2.  **Identify object properties:** define bounding box, color, position, shape.\n3. **Identify the actions.** Focus on the operations on the identified objects - copy, move, scale, color, etc.\n4.  **Refine the natural language program:** Based on the error analysis, update the natural language program to reflect a more accurate and general transformation rule.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo better understand the transformations, let's manually inspect each example and describe what *should* happen.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** A rectangular block of azure surrounded by white.\n*   **Output:** The azure block is extracted.\n*   **Result:** `success` - The initial code correctly extracts the azure block.\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: azure\n        border: white\n  output:\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: azure\n  action: extract\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** A rectangular block of green, with some internal white blocks and a single magenta pixel, all surrounded by white.\n*   **Output:** The green block, with internal white blocks removed, the magenta cell changes to green.\n*   **Result:** `fail` - code extracts the whole block, no change in color, no pixels removed\n\n```yaml\nexample_2:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: green\n        border: white\n        internal:\n          - color: white\n          - color: magenta\n  output:\n    objects:\n      - type: rectangle\n        color: green\n  action: extract, fill, recolor\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** A complex shape of orange, with many internal white pixels. surrounded by white\n*   **Output:** The orange shape is extracted, inner white pixels removed.\n*   **Result:** `fail` - The code extracts a larger area than needed, and does not handle internal white blocks.\n\n```yaml\nexample_3:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - type: shape\n        color: orange\n        border: white\n        internal:\n          - color: white\n  output:\n    objects:\n      - type: shape\n        color: orange\n  action: extract, fill\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - properties:\n      - color:\n        - white\n        - azure\n        - green\n        - magenta\n        - orange\n      - shape:\n        - rectangle\n        - other\n      - border: white\n\nactions:\n  - extract\n  - fill # remove internal white space\n  - recolor # single magenta pixel changes to green\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the primary object:** Find the largest connected region of non-white pixels, excluding any white pixels that form a continuous border around the entire object.\n2. **Extract:** Isolate this region.\n3.  **Fill:** Remove any white pixels found within the extracted object.\n4.  **Recolor:** If a magenta pixel is found, change it to the primary color of the object.\n\n"
