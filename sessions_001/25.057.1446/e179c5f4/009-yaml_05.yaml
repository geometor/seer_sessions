observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable, square (NxN)
      elements: integers from 0 to 9
      initial_state: contains a single '1', rest are '0'
      final_state: '1' is replaced by '8', '0's replaced by alternating '1' and '8'
  - object: single_pixel_1
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      action: changes to orange (8)
    relations:
      - to: surrounding_zeros
        type: defines_replacement_pattern
  - object: surrounding_zeros
    properties:
       color: white (0)
       action: replaced based on pattern
    relations:
      - to: single_pixel_1 (now 8)
        type: determines replacement by checkerboard from location
  - pattern: checkerboard
    properties:
      colors: azure (8) and blue (1)
      origin: location of initial '1' (now '8')
    description: Alternating '1' and '8' pattern expanding outwards from the original '1' location.
