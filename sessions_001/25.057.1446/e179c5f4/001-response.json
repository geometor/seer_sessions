The input grid primarily consists of '0' (white) pixels, with a single '1' (blue) pixel near the bottom. The output grid alternates between '8' (azure) and '1' (blue) pixels in a checkerboard pattern. The key transformation seems to be a replacement of all '0' pixels with an alternating pattern of '8' and '1', and changing the '1' on the original input with a '1'.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
