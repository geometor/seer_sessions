The primary colors observed are white (0), green (3), and magenta (6).  There's a clear geometric shape formed by the green pixels in the input, which is then mirrored by magenta pixels in the output. The single magenta pixel in the input seems to act as a seed or a replacement key. The grid dimensions remain constant.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
