The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and yellow (4). The output grid contains only white (0) and yellow (4) pixels. The primary change seems to be a color replacement within a specific shape. The yellow pixel in the input at the bottom left, seems to be a 'seed color' which gets used to replace the red objects.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
