Okay, here's an analysis of the provided examples, results, and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial `transform` function was based on a very limited observation (the first training example). It correctly identified the placement of green squares in the corners but failed to generalize the rule for determining the output grid's size. The current logic calculates height based on the row index of the first non-zero pixel. This works for the first example, but not the others. The width is incorrectly assumed to be always equal to the calculated height.

The strategy to resolve the errors is:

1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Carefully examine *all* provided examples to identify a consistent pattern for determining the output grid's dimensions.
2.  **Refine Size Determination:** The most obvious error is in how the output size is calculated. We need a rule that holds true across all examples. It's likely related to the position of the blue (1) pixel, but not simply its row index.
3.  **Verify Corner Placement:** Re-affirm that corner placement of green pixels is consistent across all examples.
4. **Update Program**: modify the natural language program

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**

The provided code already includes an `analyze_example` function that gives us the necessary metrics. The printed output shows shape and colors for the input, expected output, and predicted output, along with a boolean indicating prediction correctness. Here's a summary of those results, emphasizing the failures:

*   **Example 1:** Correct. Input (4x5), Output (3x3), Predicted (3x3).
*   **Example 2:** Incorrect. Input (5x7), Output (4x4), Predicted (4x4).
*   **Example 3:** Incorrect. Input (6x8), Output (5x5), Predicted (4x4).

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: "Determine output grid size and populate corners with green."
  - input_objects:
      - description: "Input grid containing white (0) and blue (1) pixels."
        properties:
          - "Blue pixel acts as a marker."
          - "White pixels are background."
  - output_objects:
      - description: "Output grid containing white (0) and green (3) pixels."
        properties:
          - "Green pixels always in corners."
          - "Output size is related to the position of blue pixel in the input, though the original rule hypothesis is flawed."
  - actions:
      - description: "Calculate output grid dimensions based on input."
        details: "The current method, using the row index of the first non-zero element, is incorrect. Must observe the relationship of the number of 0's after the blue pixel"
      - description: "Place green pixels in the four corners of the output grid."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find the Marker:** Locate the blue (1) pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Calculate Output Dimensions** Count the total number of columns to the right of the blue pixel, inclusive, Call this count `c`. The output grid is a square with dimensions `c` x `c`
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid of the calculated dimensions, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
4.  **Place Corner Markers:** Set the pixel values at the four corners of the output grid to green (3):
    *   Top-left: (0, 0)
    *   Top-right: (0, c-1)
    *   Bottom-left: (c-1, 0)
    *   Bottom-right: (c-1, c-1)
5. return the output grid
