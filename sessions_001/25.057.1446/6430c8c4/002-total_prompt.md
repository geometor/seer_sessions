## Example 1

**input:**
```
7 7 0 7
0 7 7 0
0 7 7 7
0 7 7 0
4 4 4 4
0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2
2 2 2 0
2 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x786C6F638F50>

**output:**
```
0 0 3 0
3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x786C5492F850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The output is a significantly smaller grid, also containing single-digit integers.
*   The output grid seems to be derived from a specific region of the input grid.
*   The output grid's dimensions (4x4) are smaller compared to the input grid (9x4)
*   There's a change in the color representation between the input and output. Most of the output grid is white (0), but there are two green (3) pixels.
*   It appears that parts of the input are extracted, and then the colors may be changed.

      to: output_grid
      rule: "Extract a subgrid and change some colors."
  - observation:
      description: "The output grid contains two green pixels (3) and the rest are white(0)."
  - observation:
    description: "The green pixels in output occupy the locations where orange (7) pixels were present at the top left corner of input."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Region:** Locate the 4x4 subgrid at the top-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Extract Subgrid**: Create a new, empty 4x4 grid.
3.  **Map Colors:** For each cell within the located 4x4 subgrid in the *input* grid:
    *   If the cell's value is 7 (orange), set the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to 3 (green).
    *   Otherwise, set the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to 0 (white).
4. **Return Output Grid**: Return the resulting 4x4 output grid

Essentially, the transformation isolates a particular area on the input grid, replaces one color in it, and sets others to the background and returns a new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
