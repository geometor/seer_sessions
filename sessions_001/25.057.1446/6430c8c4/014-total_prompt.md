## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 7
0 7 7 7
0 7 0 0
0 7 7 7
4 4 4 4
0 0 2 0
0 2 2 2
2 2 0 0
0 2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x786C548818D0>

**output:**
```
3 3 0 0
3 0 0 0
0 0 3 3
3 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x786C5470AB50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (9x4) of colored pixels into a smaller grid (4x4). The input grid appears to contain distinct rectangular blocks of color (orange, yellow, and red). The output grid seems to be a simplified, abstracted representation, using only green and white pixels, and it's significantly smaller. The output appears to discard much of the detail of the input. The size reduction from 9x4 to 4x4 indicates information loss which likely removes rows/cols and reduces resolution.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 9x4, output grid is 4x4.
  - observation: Input grid contains blocks of orange (7), yellow (4), and red (2), and white(0).
  - observation: Output grid contains only green (3) and white (0).
  - object: Input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x4
      - colors: [0, 2, 4, 7]
  - object: Output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - colors: [0, 3]
  - relationship: Output grid is a transformation of the input grid.
  - action: transformation
    details: "The transformation appears to simplify and reduce the size of the input grid."
  - inference: there is a color map - input colors are mapped to a single color
  - inference: The output may count or represent specific input regions with a single color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into 2x2 regions of pixels ignoring the final row.
2.  **Map Colors** If a 2x2 region in the input contains *any* non-white pixels, represent that entire region as a single green (3) pixel in the output grid.
3.  **Fill** If the input region contains only white, make it white in the output.
4.  **Construct Output** Construct the 4x4 output grid from the resulting colors for each region.

Essentially, the program is checking for the presence of *any* non-white color within each 2x2 block of the original image (excluding the bottom row), and if found, marks a corresponding cell as green (color 3) on the output grid. Otherwise the ouput is white (color 0)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
