Previous Code:

"""
The transformation rule involves dividing the input grid into 2x2 regions (ignoring the last row if the height is odd).
If any non-white pixel exists within a 2x2 region, the corresponding output pixel is green (3).
Otherwise, if the 2x2 region contains only white pixels, the output pixel is white (0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the concept of dividing the input grid into 2x2 regions and checking for the presence of non-white pixels. While this approach worked for the first training example, it's clear from the subsequent examples that the output grid size is directly related to the input grid size, and the 2x2 block processing is related to the input grid. It appears there is also a relationship to a fixed size 4x4 output. The initial hypothesis is partially correct in identifying the 2x2 region processing, but needs refinement to accurately capture the size relationship and specific conditions for setting output pixel values. The updated natural language program and resulting code will need to use all pixels and dynamically size the output grid.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze all examples**: Go through each input/output pair in the training set, paying close attention to the dimensions and the specific pixel values within the 2x2 regions.
2.  **Dynamic Output Size**: Modify the natural language program (and subsequently the code) to account for output grid dimensions equal to one half the input, rounded down.
3.  **Refine Pixel Value Logic:** The rule is: If *any* non-white pixel is present in a 2x2 region of the input, the corresponding output pixel is green (3). Otherwise it is white (0). Ensure this is clearly and correctly stated.
4. Test and refine on additional examples, if available.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**

I will use the provided `code_execution` tool to generate reports on each of the examples, summarizing my assumptions and how well the output handled them.

```python
def analyze_example(example):
    input_grid = example['input']
    expected_output_grid = example['output']
    predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)

    input_shape = (len(input_grid), len(input_grid[0]) if input_grid else 0)
    expected_output_shape = (len(expected_output_grid), len(expected_output_grid[0]) if expected_output_grid else 0)
    predicted_output_shape = (len(predicted_output_grid), len(predicted_output_grid[0]) if predicted_output_grid else 0 )

    correct_pixels = 0
    total_pixels = 0

    if predicted_output_shape == expected_output_shape:
      total_pixels = expected_output_shape[0] * expected_output_shape[1]
      for r in range(expected_output_shape[0]):
          for c in range(expected_output_shape[1]):
              if predicted_output_grid[r][c] == expected_output_grid[r][c]:
                  correct_pixels += 1
    
    accuracy = (correct_pixels / total_pixels) * 100 if total_pixels > 0 else 0

    print(f"Input Shape: {input_shape}")
    print(f"Expected Output Shape: {expected_output_shape}")
    print(f"Predicted Output Shape: {predicted_output_shape}")
    print(f"Pixel Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}% ({correct_pixels}/{total_pixels})\n")
    print(f"Input grid: {input_grid}")
    print(f"Predicted output: {predicted_output_grid}")
    print(f"Expected output: {expected_output_grid}\n")
    print("---")

examples = task["train"]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide and Conquer:** Divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 pixel regions.
2.  **Output Dimension:** The output grid's dimensions are determined by dividing the input grid's dimensions by two, rounding down for both height and width.
3.  **Process Regions:** For each 2x2 region in the input grid:
    *   If *any* pixel within the region is *not* white (0), the corresponding pixel in the output grid is set to green (3).
    *   If *all* pixels within the region are white (0), the corresponding pixel in the output grid is set to white (0).
4. **Output Generation:** The output is the resulting grid created in step 3.

This revised natural language program captures the core logic observed across all provided training examples, addressing the sizing issues and accurately describing the pixel-setting rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
