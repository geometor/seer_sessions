The input grid contains several distinct colored regions, while the output grid appears to represent a simplified, abstracted version of the input. The colors in the input do not directly translate to the color in the output; instead the relative color positions in the input determine locations in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The other cells are white (0).\n\n4.  **Populate Corners:** Using only the top section of the input image, find the color that fills the corners of that section and use its location for placing the color green in the output, or if that section has all corners equal to color 0, then skip.\n\nIn summary, the transformation constructs an output grid where cells in the four corners are colored based on the non-zero color from the input. The other cells will be filled with white (0).\n"
