facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 9x4, output grid is 4x4.
  - observation: Input grid contains blocks of orange (7), yellow (4), and red (2), and white(0).
  - observation: Output grid contains only green (3) and white (0).
  - object: Input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x4
      - colors: [0, 2, 4, 7]
  - object: Output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - colors: [0, 3]
  - relationship: Output grid is a transformation of the input grid.
  - action: transformation
    details: "The transformation appears to simplify and reduce the size of the input grid."
  - inference: there is a color map - input colors are mapped to a single color
  - inference: The output may count or represent specific input regions with a single color.
