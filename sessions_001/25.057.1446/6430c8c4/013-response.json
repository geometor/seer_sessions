The input grid appears to contain distinct rectangular blocks of color (orange, yellow, and red). The output grid seems to be a simplified, abstracted representation, using only green and white pixels, and it's significantly smaller. The output appears to discard much of the detail of the input. The size reduction from 9x4 to 4x4 indicates information loss which likely removes rows/cols and reduces resolution.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Otherwise the ouput is white (color 0)\n"
