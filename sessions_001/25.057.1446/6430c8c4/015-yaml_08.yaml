observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      size_relationship: output grid dimensions are half the input, rounded down
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0 and 3, representing white and green)
      size_relationship: output grid dimensions are half the input, rounded down
  - object: 2x2_region
    properties:
      type: sub-section of input_grid
      size: 2x2 pixels
      content_check: determines output pixel value based on presence of non-white pixels

actions:
  - action: divide
    agent: input_grid
    target: 2x2_regions
    description: The input grid is conceptually divided into non-overlapping 2x2 regions.
  - action: check
    agent: 2x2_region
    target: pixel_values
    condition: If any pixel in the 2x2 region is not white (0).
    result_true: Corresponding output pixel is set to green (3).
    result_false: Corresponding output pixel is set to white (0).
  - action: create
    agent: output_grid
    source: results of 2x2_region checks.
    description: construct the output grid based on the 2x2 region processing
