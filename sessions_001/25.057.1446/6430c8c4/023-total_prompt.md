Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial `transform` function on the training examples and outline a strategy for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focuses solely on the orange (7) colored object, extracting its bounding box and size. The assumption was that this orange shape would somehow determine the placement of green pixels in the output. However, the provided results across multiple examples will help reveal the actual pattern, which is not as simplistic as expected. Looking at the results, we can see cases where `all_match` is `False`, and the relationship between input and output is different.

The initial approach is too limited. It needs to be broadened significantly to:

1.  **Consider other colors/objects:** The transformation doesn't solely rely on the orange object. Other colors, like green and black, and potentially their relationships, play a critical role.
2.  **Identify the correct transformation rule:** It is not a simple bounding box extraction of a single color. We need to analyze if a pattern or shape made of specific colors is copied or moved.
3. **Understand the action**: Determine is the copied object translated, rotated, or scaled.

The strategy involves iteratively refining the natural language program and the corresponding code:

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Examine all input/output pairs and `analyze_example` results meticulously. Pay close attention to:
    *   The positions, sizes, and colors of objects in both input and output.
    *   Cases where `all_match` is `False`. What differs between `output_grid` and `predicted_output`? This indicates where the current logic fails.
2.  **Formulate Hypotheses:** Based on the analysis, propose new hypotheses about the transformation rule. Start with simpler explanations and gradually increase complexity if needed.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Express the refined hypothesis in a clear, concise natural language program.
4.  **Modify Code:** Translate the updated natural language program into a revised `transform` function.
5.  **Test and Iterate:** Run the updated code on all training examples and repeat the analysis. If discrepancies persist, reiterate steps 2-5.

**Example Metrics and Results**
Looking at the example data previously provided, the input and output grids both seem to have the same height and width.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the orange object:** Find the contiguous block of orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Determine its shape and size:**  Calculate the dimensions (height and width) of the orange object. It may be a square or a rectangle.
3.  **Copy the shape:** Create a copy of the orange object's shape.
4.  **Recolor the copy:** Change the color of all pixels in the copied shape to green (3).
5.  **Place the green shape:** Position the green shape in the output grid at the *exact same location* as the original orange shape in the input grid. The top-left corner of the green shape should have the same row and column coordinates as the top-left corner of the orange shape.
6. The program should ignore any other colors.

In essence, the transformation rule is to *copy the orange object, change its color to green, and place it in the output grid at the identical position it occupied in the input grid.*

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
