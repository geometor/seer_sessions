## Example 3

**input:**
```
9 0 0 1 9 0 9
9 0 0 1 0 9 0
9 0 0 1 9 0 0
0 9 9 1 0 9 9
0 0 9 1 0 9 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x786C5492CA50>

**output:**
```
0 8 0
0 0 8
0 8 8
8 0 0
8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x786C546B4350>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception:**

The input grid seems to be simplified in the output grid. The input grid has a prominent vertical line of blue (1) pixels. The output grid replaces some of those original input pixels adjacent to the blue with azure (8) pixels. The dimensions of the grid are reduced.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [maroon, white, blue]
      dimensions: [5, 7] # [height, width]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [white, azure]
      dimensions: [5, 3]
  - name: blue_line
    type: object
    properties:
      color: blue
      shape: vertical line
      location: input_grid, column 4
      notes: the center column in input.

actions:
  - type: simplification
    description: Reduce the input grid to create the output grid

  - type: substitution
    description: Replace some pixels around blue with azure

relationships:
    - input_grid contains blue_line
    - azure pixels are placed adjacent to where the original blue pixels were located.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central vertical line:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels running down the center (column index 3, starting from 0) of the input grid.

2. **Create a new grid, smaller than the first.** The new grid should have the same height as the input grid and width of 3.

3.  **Transfer and Transform.** Create the new output grid based on the original central vertical line of blue pixels as follows, working from left to right in the output, one column at a time, starting at the left-most column:
    *   Original column to left of the blue line in the input, replace all the maroon pixels with white and the white pixels with azure.
    *   Original blue line - replace all the blue pixels with white.
    *   Original column to the right of the blue line in the input, replace all the maroon pixels with white and the white pixels with azure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
