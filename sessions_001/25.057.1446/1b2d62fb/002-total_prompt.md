## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
0 0 9 1 9 9 0
9 0 9 1 9 9 0
0 0 0 1 9 0 0
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x786C54883450>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 8 8
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x786C547D3950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a vertical blue line (color 1) in the center, surrounded by various other colors (9 and 0). The output grid is smaller and seems to focus on a specific region of the input grid, replacing the blue line with two azure pixels (color 8). Other pixels become white (color 0).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x7
      - colors: [0, 1, 9]

        parameters:

        parameters:
            row: replace all values in row 3 except where value is 8
            new_value: 0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Extract Subgrid:** From the input grid, extract a 3-column wide subgrid. The subgrid starts from the 3rd column (index 2) and end at column 5 (index 4) of the input grid.
2.  **Replace Color:** Within this subgrid, locate all pixels with the color blue (value 1). Replace these pixels with the color azure (value 8).
3. **Finalize:** In the subgrid, modify row 3 to set value to 0, except any pixels of color 8.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
