Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify the blue line:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Note its column index (starting from 0). in this case, 3.
2.  **Extract and check first element**: Get the first row element from the input_grid, and see it's color.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** if the color of the checked element is not 0, take the row index, change the input_grid color 1 to 8, and fill that column with the new color. else, fill with 0.
4. The height of the output grid is same to the input grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
