## Example 5

**input:**
```
0 9 9 1 9 0 9
9 0 9 1 9 9 9
9 9 9 1 0 0 9
9 0 0 1 9 0 0
9 9 9 1 0 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x786C547D3650>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 8 8
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x786C547D3C50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The input grid appears to have a larger dimension (7x5) than the output grid (5x3).  There's a prominent vertical blue (1) line in the center of the input grid. The output grid has two azure (8) pixels on the fourth row. Other pixels are white (0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 7x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 5x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: blue_line
    type: vertical_line
    color: blue (1)
    location: input_grid, column 4
  - object: azure_pixels
    type: pixel_pair
    color: azure (8)
    location: output_grid, row 4, columns 2 & 3
  - relation: input_grid_column_4 corresponds_to some_element_of output
  - action: extract_subgrid
    parameters: center_column, height
    description: extracts a subgrid, preserving the center, using the height of the output grid
  - action: map_column
  	parameters: a_column, index_in_column
  	description: select a column. Scan the column by index, map value
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Center Column:** Locate the central vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. In this case, it's column 4 (index 3).
2. **Determine the section**: find the bounding box of the input, in the center of that, find a column with solid color.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a subgrid centered on the identified column. The width of output grid can vary. The height of the output equals the height of the input, in this case, 5.
4.  **Map Values:** Iterate through the central column from the *input* grid.
5. Map value `1` to `8`. Map the rest of the values to `0`.
6.  **Construct Output:** Create an output grid that is the same height as the input and as wide as the number of unique values in the central column. Place the mapped pixels from step 5 into the output grid into a centered single column, where the mapped value corresponding to the original central column is placed in the center row. Fill the rest of the output grid with the default value (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
