Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the central vertical line:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels running down the center (column index 3, starting from 0) of the input grid.

2. **Create a new grid, smaller than the first.** The new grid should have the same height as the input grid and width of 3.

3.  **Transfer and Transform.** Create the new output grid based on the original central vertical line of blue pixels as follows, working from left to right in the output, one column at a time, starting at the left-most column:
    *   Original column to left of the blue line in the input, replace all the maroon pixels with white and the white pixels with azure.
    *   Original blue line - replace all the blue pixels with white.
    *   Original column to the right of the blue line in the input, replace all the maroon pixels with white and the white pixels with azure.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
