Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Get First Row:** Extract the first row of the input grid. This row determines the colors and order of columns in the output grid.
2. **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid with a height equal to the input grid's height and a width of 3.
3. **Iterate and Fill Columns:** Iterate through the first row elements.
    - If an element is not 0, it represents a color to be filled in a column of the output grid.
    - Determine the column index based on where we are in our iteration within the first 3 relevant colors (non-zero values).
    - Fill the entire corresponding column in the output grid with that color. if the element is 1, change it to 8.
4. **Return Output:** The output grid will have the same number of rows as the input and three columns, filled according to the non-zero colors from the first row of the input.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
