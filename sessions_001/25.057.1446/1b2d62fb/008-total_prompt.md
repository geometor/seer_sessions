## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 1 9 0 0
9 0 9 1 9 9 9
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
0 0 0 1 9 9 9
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x786C5526F950>

**output:**
```
0 8 8
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x786C54881850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of different dimensions and colors. The input grid contains a vertical line of blue (1) pixels, surrounded by maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The output grid appears to extract and simplify information from the input grid, focusing on the presence and location of certain colors. Specifically, only white and Azure(8) are in the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 7
      - height: 5
      - colors: [0, 1, 9] # White, Blue, Maroon
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: 5
      - colors: [0, 8] # white, azure
  - object: blue_line
    type: line
    properties:
      - orientation: vertical
      - color: 1 # Blue
      - position: column 4 (index 3)
    relationship: "present in input_grid"
  - action: extract_column
    description: The 4th element from first row is taken to the first row of the output grid
  - action: fill_column
    description:  fill the new column with the new color if the extracted element is not 0.
  - action: change_color
      input_color: 1
      output_color: 8

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the blue line:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Note its column index (starting from 0). in this case, 3.
2.  **Extract and check first element**: Get the first row element from the input\_grid, and see it's color.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** if the color of the checked element is not 0, take the row index, change the input\_grid color 1 to 8, and fill that column with the new color. else, fill with 0.
4. The height of the output grid is same to the input grid.

Essentially, the program detects a specific feature (the blue vertical line) in the input, and map the feature with new value into output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
