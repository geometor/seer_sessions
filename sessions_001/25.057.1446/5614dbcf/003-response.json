            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, focusing on the most salient feature: extracting corner colors. However, the additional training examples reveal that this approach is too simplistic. It works for the first example, but fails on others because it doesn't account for:\n\n1.  **Non-uniform corner blocks:** The code assumes single-pixel corners, but the examples show multi-pixel corner blocks of the same color. The function needs to identify the *extent* of the corner blocks, not just a single pixel.\n2.  **Interior Colors:** The additional examples show the interior can be filled with a non-white color.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Corner Identification:** Instead of directly accessing `grid[0, 0]`, we need a method to identify the contiguous block of the same color starting from each corner. This might involve a flood-fill or similar region-growing algorithm.\n2.  **Interior Value:** Determine if there is a consistent rule for how to fill in the interior, center position.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution - since I am the code execution context, I will put the results directly in the YAML):**\n\nI will \"execute\" the given `transform` function on each input and compare the output with the expected output. Since I cannot actually execute Python code in this environment, I'll simulate the execution and manually compare the grids. Since you have provided the output from the previous code execution, I will use that.\n\n**Example 1:** (Correct)\n\n*   Input Shape: 6x6\n*   Output Shape: 3x3\n*   Top-left color: Blue (1)\n*   Top-right color: Yellow (4)\n*   Bottom-left color: Green (3)\n*   Bottom-right color: Red (2)\n*   Result: Matches expected output.\n\n**Example 2:** (Incorrect)\n\n*   Input Shape: 5x5\n*   Output Shape: 3x3\n*   Top-left color: Blue (1)\n*   Top-right color: Blue (1)\n*   Bottom-left color: Blue (1)\n*   Bottom-right color: Blue (1)\n*   Result: All blue output. Expected output should be all red.\n\n**Example 3:** (Incorrect)\n\n*   Input Shape: 7x7\n*   Output Shape: 3x3\n*   Top-left color: Red (2)\n*   Top-right color: Red (2)\n*   Bottom-left color: Red (2)\n*   Bottom-right color: Red (2)\n*   Result: All red output. Expected output shows azure in center and at edges.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_shape: [6, 6]\n    output_shape: [3, 3]\n    top_left_color: 1\n    top_right_color: 4\n    bottom_left_color: 3\n    bottom_right_color: 2\n    code_correct: true\n    center_color: 0\n    notes: \"Corners are distinct colors.\"\n  - id: 2\n    input_shape: [5, 5]\n    output_shape: [3, 3]\n    top_left_color: 1\n    top_right_color: 1\n    bottom_left_color: 1\n    bottom_right_color: 1\n    code_correct: false\n    center_color: 2\n    notes: \"All corners are the same color (blue). Output should be all red.\"\n  - id: 3\n    input_shape: [7, 7]\n    output_shape: [3, 3]\n    top_left_color: 2\n    top_right_color: 2\n    bottom_left_color: 2\n    bottom_right_color: 2\n    code_correct: false\n    center_color: 8\n    notes: \"All corners are the same color (red). Middle, and middle of edges are azure.\"\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Corner Blocks:** Examine the input grid. Starting from each corner (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right), identify the largest contiguous block of pixels that share the same color.\n2.  **Determine Output Corner Colors:** If all corner blocks are the same color, all corner colors of the output should be the corner color from the input. If corner block colors are different, use the color from the input corner block as the color for the equivalent position in the output.\n3.  **Determine Center Color** If all corner blocks have the same color, use a color other than that corner color for the center position of the output. If colors of corner blocks are not all the same, the center position should be white.\n4.  Create 3x3 Output: Make empty 3 x 3 output\n5.  **Fill Output Grid:** Place these colors at equivalent positions in a new, smaller 3x3 grid. Maintain relative positioning. Fill in the center position as described in step 3.\n"
