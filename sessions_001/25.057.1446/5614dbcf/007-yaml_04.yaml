facts:
  - observation: Input is a 9x9 grid, output is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: Input grid contains colored squares and some single colored pixels.
  - observation: Colors in the input are white (0), gray (5), red (2), and orange (7).
  - observation: Colors in the output are white (0), red (2) and orange(7).
  - observation: Gray pixels in the input are not present in the output.
  - object: red_square:
      properties:
        color: red (2)
        shape: square
        input_location: top-center
        output_location: top-center
  - object: orange_square:
      properties:
        color: orange (7)
        shape: square
        input_location: bottom-center
        output_location: bottom-center
  - object: gray_pixels:
      properties:
        color: gray(5)
        shape: single pixels
      behavior: eliminated in output
  - relationship: Output grid retains the central red and orange colors in their relative positions of input, but removes single pixel and reduces the size.
  - action: size_reduction:
      input: 9x9 grid
      output: 3x3 grid
  - action: color_filtering:
      input:  white, gray, red, orange
      output: white, red, orange
