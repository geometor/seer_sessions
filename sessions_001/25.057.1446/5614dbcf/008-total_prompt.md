## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0
0 5 0 2 2 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 7 7 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 7 5 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x786C6EBACB50>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
0 0 0
0 7 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C54881950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains several colored squares and isolated pixels.  The colors present are white (0), gray (5), red (2), and orange (7). The output grid seems to represent a highly simplified version of the input, retaining only certain colors and seemingly their relative positions. The output grid is a 3x3, much smaller than the 9x9 input grid. Gray (5) is eliminated, along with many of the white (0) pixels. The process involves a significant reduction in size and complexity.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 9x9 grid, output is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: Input grid contains colored squares and some single colored pixels.
  - observation: Colors in the input are white (0), gray (5), red (2), and orange (7).
  - observation: Colors in the output are white (0), red (2) and orange(7).
  - observation: Gray pixels in the input are not present in the output.
  - object: red_square:
      properties:
        color: red (2)
        shape: square
        input_location: top-center
        output_location: top-center
  - object: orange_square:
      properties:
        color: orange (7)
        shape: square
        input_location: bottom-center
        output_location: bottom-center
  - object: gray_pixels:
      properties:
        color: gray(5)
        shape: single pixels
      behavior: eliminated in output
  - relationship: Output grid retains the central red and orange colors in their relative positions of input, but removes single pixel and reduces the size.
  - action: size_reduction:
      input: 9x9 grid
      output: 3x3 grid
  - action: color_filtering:
      input:  white, gray, red, orange
      output: white, red, orange
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Focus on the red (2) and orange (7) colored areas, ignoring gray (5).
2.  **Locate Centers:** Determine the center of the input grid (conceptually).
3.  **Extract Central Colors:** Find the red and the orange colors at their position at input.
4. **Reduce Size:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
5. **Translate central colors:** Place the identified red and orange colors at the corresponding position. Fill the remainig cells with white(0).

In essence, the transformation extracts the central-most red and orange colored regions of the input grid, maintains their relative center positions within a new, smaller 3x3 grid and removes the single gray colored pixel. The final output consists of just red, orange, and white pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
