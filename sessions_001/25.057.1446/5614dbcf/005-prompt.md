Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Corner Blocks:** Examine the input grid. Starting from each corner (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right), identify the largest contiguous block of pixels that share the same color.
2.  **Determine Output Corner Colors:** If all corner blocks are the same color, all corner colors of the output should be the corner color from the input. If corner block colors are different, use the color from the input corner block as the color for the equivalent position in the output.
3.  **Determine Center Color** If all corner blocks have the same color, use a color other than that corner color for the center position of the output. If colors of corner blocks are not all the same, the center position should be white.
4.  Create 3x3 Output: Make empty 3 x 3 output
5.  **Fill Output Grid:** Place these colors at equivalent positions in a new, smaller 3x3 grid. Maintain relative positioning. Fill in the center position as described in step 3.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
