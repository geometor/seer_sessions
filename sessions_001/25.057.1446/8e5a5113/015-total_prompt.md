Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation involves a specific type of reflection where the left side of the input is mirrored onto the right and left sides of the output grid, using the gray and white pixels as a central pivot area, with specific ordering on the left hand side of the output.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # 1. & 2. Identify and Extend Pivot: Find the vertical line of gray (5) pixels and
    # extend to the left in the output.  This doesn't involve modification
    # because gray (5) is already present on input in those locations.
    
    # 3. Reflect Left Side: Reflect columns 0-3 of the input to columns 7-10 of the output.
    for i in range(3):
        output_grid[i, 7:11] = input_grid[i, 0:4]

    # 4. & 5. Mirror to Left Side. columns 4-6 = columns 3-1, and columns 0-2 are 7-9 on input.
    for row_index in range(3):

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
