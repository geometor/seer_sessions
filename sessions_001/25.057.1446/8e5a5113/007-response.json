I can see colors like magenta (6), green (3), red (2), grey (5), and white (0).\n*   **Regions:**  There appear to be distinct regions or blocks of color within the grids. The left side of the input grid has a 4x3 block of colors. The right side of the input grid looks like it could be all zeros (white).\n*   **Transformation:** The output grid seems to retain the colored region on the left, but the right portion is filled with colors, mirroring and perhaps expanding upon existing colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In this case, it's a 4x3 block.\n\n2.  **Preserve Left Block:** Copy the left block of pixels directly to the same position in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Propagate Colors to the Right (Row-wise):** For each row, examine the colors in the identified left block:\n    *   Iterate through the colors on each row of the identified left block from left to right\n    *   For each color, populate cells of the output to the right of the left block with the same color.\n    *   If there is a color change to the left, then repeat the process for the new color, until the end of the row.\n    *   If at any step, the colors of the left block are the same, fill all the remaining cells to the right with the color that changed.\n\nIn simpler, high-level terms: The left block of colors is kept as is. Then, for each row, colors from left block \"fill in\" the rest of the row to the right, repeating each color. The colors are replicated in the same relative positions as they appear in the identified left block.\n"
