The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). There's a noticeable mirroring or reflection pattern, but it's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. The gray and white pixels in the right half of the input seem to act as a divider or pivot point for the reflection of colored objects on the left half, though the colors appear on both halves in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The ordering of the output grid is: column 6 = column 3, column 5 = column 2, column 4 = column 1, and column 3 = column 0 of input.\n5. Columns 0-2 on the output are columns 7-9 respectively on the input.\n\nIn essence, the transformation involves a specific type of reflection where the left side of the input is mirrored onto the right and left sides of the output grid, using the gray and white pixels as a central pivot area, with specific ordering on the left hand side of the ouput.\n"
