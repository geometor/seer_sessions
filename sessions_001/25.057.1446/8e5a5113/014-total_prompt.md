## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 7 8 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
7 7 8 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
8 8 8 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x786C5492CA50>

**output:**
```
2 7 8 5 8 7 2 5 8 8 8
7 7 8 5 8 7 7 5 8 7 7
8 8 8 5 8 8 8 5 8 7 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x11 grid of colored pixels into another 3x11 grid. The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). There's a noticeable mirroring or reflection pattern, but it's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. The gray and white pixels in the right half of the input seem to act as a divider or pivot point for the reflection of colored objects on the left half, though the colors appear on both halves in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x11
    elements: pixels
    element_type: integer (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x11
    elements: pixels
    element_type: integer (0-9)
  - relationship: transformation
    type: mirroring_with_pivot
    details: >
      The left half of the input grid (columns 0-3) appears
      to be reflected onto the right side of the output grid (columns 7-10) around a central "pivot" area
      (columns 4-6). The colors on the left half of the output include this pivot section and the inverse of the
      left half of the input.
  - observation: pivot_colors
    details: >
        The colors of gray (5) and white (0) form a vertical line in the center-right of the input grid.
        In the ouput, the gray extends to the left to form a vertical line as well.
  - observation: color_repetition
    details: >
      Colors on the left side of the input grid (columns 0-3) reappear on the right
      side of the output grid, and colors on the left side of the output grid reflect a pivot area (columns 4-6) and an inverse
      of the left hand side of the input.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Pivot:** Locate the vertical line of gray (5) pixels followed by white (0) pixels in the input grid (columns 4 and 5).
2.  **Extend Pivot:** In the ouput grid, extend the gray area to the left.
3.  **Reflect Left Side:** For the portion of the input grid to the left of the pivot (columns 0-3), reflect these colors to the right side of the output grid from (columns 7-10), and also to the left side of the pivot (columns 4-6).
4.  **Mirror to Left Side:** Maintain the ordering, but reflect around the central vertical axis of columns 4-6. The ordering of the output grid is: column 6 = column 3, column 5 = column 2, column 4 = column 1, and column 3 = column 0 of input.
5. Columns 0-2 on the output are columns 7-9 respectively on the input.

In essence, the transformation involves a specific type of reflection where the left side of the input is mirrored onto the right and left sides of the output grid, using the gray and white pixels as a central pivot area, with specific ordering on the left hand side of the ouput.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
