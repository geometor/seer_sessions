If a row contains only '0' pixels, it will still be only '0's.\nIn cases where there are distinct row patterns, the pattern is shifted to start from the beginning of the row, and '0's may be added to end.\n\n1.  **Iterate through each row** of the input grid.\n2.  **Identify the repeating color sequence** : within the row find non-zero colors, up to the first zero after non-zeros start.\n3.  **Extend/Repeat Pattern**: Repeat the identified sequence across the entire row to the right, starting from the beginning of the sequence.\n4. If the row has a distinct pattern, shift the whole pattern so it starts from the left and fill any remaining cells with '0' if needed.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_repeating_sequence(row):\n    \"\"\"Finds the repeating non-zero sequence in a row.\"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    started = False\n    for val in row:\n        if val != 0:\n            started = True\n            sequence.append(val)\n        elif started:\n            break\n    return sequence\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each row\n    for r in range(rows):\n        # Find the repeating sequence in the current row\n        sequence = find_repeating_sequence(input_grid[r])\n\n        #if we have a sequence\n        if (len(sequence) > 0):\n          # Extend the pattern across the entire row\n          for c_fill in range(cols):\n            output_grid[r, c_fill] = sequence[c_fill % len(sequence)]\n        #else, consider row pattern shifting if sequence is empty, but not a zero row\n        elif any(input_grid[r] != 0): #distinct row\n            # find the pattern\n            pattern = []\n            for c in range(cols):\n                if input_grid[r,c]!=0:\n                    pattern.append(input_grid[r,c])\n            #shift the pattern so it fills the cells, then fill the remaining cells with 0\n            for c in range(cols):\n                if c < len(pattern):\n                    output_grid[r,c] = pattern[c]\n                else:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 0\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
