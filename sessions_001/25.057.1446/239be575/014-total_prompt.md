## Example 3

**input:**
```
8 2 2 8 8 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 8
0 8 8 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 8
8 0 8 8 8 2 2
8 0 0 0 0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x384 at 0x786C548172D0>

**output:**
```
8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x786C546B4350>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels, represented by digits 0-9. The output appears to be a single digit, also within the range 0-9, potentially representing a color. The task involves analyzing the input grid and producing a single color/digit as output. The dominant colors in the input grid are azure (8), red (2), and white (0). The output is azure (8). It seems like the task might involve identifying a specific color based on some criteria within the input grid. It's possible it's the most frequent, or top-left, or something else that forms a simple rule.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input
    description: 2D grid of digits (colors)
    dimensions: 6x7
    colors:
      - 8 (azure)
      - 2 (red)
      - 0 (white)
  - type: output
    description: single digit (color)
    value: 8 (azure)
  - observation: output color is present in the input grid
  - hypothesis: output is determined by a property of input colors.
  - candidate_properties:
    - most_frequent_color
    - top_left_color
    - some other calculated color/value based on position and combination
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input grid.
2.  **Identify** the color in the top-left corner of the input grid.
3.  **Output** this color as a single digit.

In slightly different terms.

1. Load the input grid
2. Find the pixel at coordinate (0, 0)
3. Output the value of the (0, 0) coordinate.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
