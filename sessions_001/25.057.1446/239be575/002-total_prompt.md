## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 8 0 8
2 2 8 0 0
2 2 0 0 8
0 0 0 2 2
8 8 0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x786C5492F850>

**output:**
```
0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x786C547D0750>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x5 grid of colored pixels, where each color is represented by a digit (0-9). The output is a single pixel of color 0 (white). The input grid contains colors 0 (white), 2 (red), and 8 (azure). The output grid appears to be significantly smaller than the input grid - possibly a single pixel. It appears that some selection rule is being applied to reduce the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    colors:
      - 0 (white)
      - 2 (red)
      - 8 (azure)
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 1x1
    colors:
        - 0 (white)
  - observation: output_size < input_size
  - observation: output_grid contains single pixel
  - relationship: input colors include output color

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program selects a single pixel from the input grid and uses that as the output grid. The selected color is white (0). The rule for selection is not obvious in this single example. It might relate to a count of total pixels, a specific location, or some combination of location, color, and neighbor pixels. More examples are needed to infer the selection rule. Currently I hypothesize that it is the most frequent value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
