"""
The transformation rule is to reduce an input grid of arbitrary size to a 1x1 output grid. The single pixel in the output grid should have the value of the most frequently occurring color (pixel value) in the input grid. If there are multiple colors with the same highest frequency, any of those colors is acceptable (though the current implementation will pick the first one encountered).
