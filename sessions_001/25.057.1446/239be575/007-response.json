The input grid contains various digits (0, 2, and 8), representing different colors (white, red, and azure). The output grid appears to consist of a single azure pixel with the value 8. The most prominent feature in the input seems to be the azure (8) pixels, and these appear most influential on the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
