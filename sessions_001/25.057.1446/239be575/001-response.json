The output is a single pixel of color 0 (white). The input grid contains colors 0 (white), 2 (red), and 8 (azure). The output grid appears to be significantly smaller than the input grid - possibly a single pixel. It appears that some selection rule is being applied to reduce the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The rule for selection is not obvious in this single example. It might relate to a count of total pixels, a specific location, or some combination of location, color, and neighbor pixels. More examples are needed to infer the selection rule. Currently I hypothesize that it is the most frequent value.\n"
