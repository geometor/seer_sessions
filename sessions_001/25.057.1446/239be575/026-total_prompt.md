## Example 5

**input:**
```
8 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 2 2 0 8 0
8 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 2 2 0 8
8 0 0 2 2 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x384 at 0x786C5474B550>

**output:**
```
8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x786C547D3150>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into a single-pixel output. The input grid appears to contain distinct regions of color. The output grid is a single pixel, and its color (and corresponding numerical value) seems to be derived from the input grid. The key challenge is to determine the rule governing which color from the input becomes the color of the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input
    description: A 2D grid of integers representing colored pixels.
    dimensions: 6x7
    elements:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: dispersed
        positions: [(0,0), (0,5), (2,0), (3,3), (3,5), (4,2), (4,6), (5,0), (5,5)]
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: dispersed
        positions: filling the rest of the grid
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: contiguous block
        positions:  [(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3),(4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(5,4)]

  - type: output
    description: A 2D grid (single pixel) representing a colored pixel.
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: single pixel

  - observation: The output color (8/azure) is present in the input grid.
  - observation: There is contiguous block of red (2) pixels.
  - observation: The azure and white are dispersed throughout the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colors:** Examine the input grid and identify all unique colors present.
2.  **Select Output Color:** The output is a single pixel of the color, among existing colors, that exists most frequently on the edges (perimeter) of the input. In the case where there is a tie, use a tie breaker (below)
3.  **Perimeter Color Count:** The perimeter is considered row 0, row 5, column 0 and column 6. We count:
    *   azure (8): six times
    *   white (0): six times
    *   red (2): zero times
4. **Tie Breaker**: Examine the input, find all of colors matching the tied perimeter color. Find color from that set with the greatest number of occurrences.
   *   azure(8): three more times, so nine total
   *   white(0): eleven more times, so seventeen total
5. **Final Selection**: white appears most often, but in this case azure is chosen. This implies a rule where, if there is a perimeter tie, and one of the colors involved in the perimeter tie exists as corner pixels, that will be selected. If not, or if both or neither are corners, use the maximum overall occurrences count.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
