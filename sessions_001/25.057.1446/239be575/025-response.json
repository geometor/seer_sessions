The input grid appears to contain distinct regions of color. The output grid is a single pixel, and its color (and corresponding numerical value) seems to be derived from the input grid. The key challenge is to determine the rule governing which color from the input becomes the color of the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In the case where there is a tie, use a tie breaker (below)\n3.  **Perimeter Color Count:** The perimeter is considered row 0, row 5, column 0 and column 6. We count:\n    *   azure (8): six times\n    *   white (0): six times\n    *   red (2): zero times\n4. **Tie Breaker**: Examine the input, find all of colors matching the tied perimeter color. Find color from that set with the greatest number of occurrences.\n   *   azure(8): three more times, so nine total\n   *   white(0): eleven more times, so seventeen total\n5. **Final Selection**: white appears most often, but in this case azure is chosen. This implies a rule where, if there is a perimeter tie, and one of the colors involved in the perimeter tie exists as corner pixels, that will be selected. If not, or if both or neither are corners, use the maximum overall occurrences count.\n\n"
