The input grid appears to be transformed into a modified output grid. The primary colors involved are red (2), green (3), and white (0). The transformation seems to involve some form of rearrangement or duplication of rows. The output appears to preserve some structures and also invert some structures from the bottom.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Copy the white region (next 4 rows) to the output\n4. **Mirror the top:** Reverse rows from the top of the input and copy it to the bottom of the output.\n\nIn summary, the top part of the grid containing colors is preserved, the next part is preserved and the bottom part of the grid contains a reflection of the upper colored part, in reverse order.\n"
