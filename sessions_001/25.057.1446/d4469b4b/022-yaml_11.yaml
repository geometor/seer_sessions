facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    size: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    size: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: blue_pixels
    color: blue (1)
    location: variable within input_grid
  - object: gray_pixels
    color: gray (5)
    location: variable within output_grid, corresponds to 3x3 regions in input_grid
  - action: map_regions
    input: 3x3 overlapping regions of input_grid
    output: corresponding single pixel in output_grid
    rule: "If a 3x3 region in the input_grid contains one or more blue pixels, the corresponding output pixel is gray. Otherwise, it's white. The mapping of the 3x3 region is determined by the output pixel's location"
