## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 0 2
2 0 0 2 0
0 0 0 2 2
0 0 2 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x786C5497D8D0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 5 0
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C54709F50>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 5x5 grid of pixels, with values primarily being 0 (white) and 2 (red).
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid of pixels, with values primarily being 5 (gray) and 0 (white).
*   **Transformation:** It seems like the output grid is somehow derived from the input grid, possibly by analyzing 2x2 subgrids within the input. The central 3x3 subgrid seems important. The output values are a condensation of the input.
* **Colors:** the output uses only colors that are present in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2]  # white, red
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [0, 5]  # white, gray

actions:
  - name: condense
    input: 2x2 subgrid
    output: single pixel
    description:  A 2x2 section of the input grid is converted to a single pixel in the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid corresponds to the central 3x3 region of the input grid.
  - type: conditional
    description: If a 2x2 subgrid in the input has a red (2) pixel, the corresponding output pixel becomes gray, and if 2x2 subgrids only has white, the pixel remains white.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus:** Consider the central 3x3 region of the input grid.
2. **Subgrids:** iterate the four 2 x 2 subgrids, starting at these corners:
   * top-left: (0,0)
   * top-right: (0,1)
   * bottom-left: (1,0)
   * bottom-right: (1,1)

3.  **Condensation Rule:**
    *   For each 2x2 subgrid in the input, check all pixels.
    *   If any pixel within the 2x2 subgrid is red (value 2), set the corresponding output pixel to gray (value 5).
    *   If all pixels within the 2x2 subgrid are white (value 0), set the corresponding output pixel to white (value 0).
4. construct a new 3 x 3 output grid of the pixels from processing the 2 x 2 subgrids.

Essentially, the program scans the input grid, looking for red pixels within 2x2 regions. If red is found in any of these, it "flags" the corresponding output pixel as gray. The result is a 3x3 grid representing the original with grey where a red pixel was present.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
