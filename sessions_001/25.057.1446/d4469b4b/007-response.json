There's a seemingly irregular shape formed by the blue pixels.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid containing pixels of two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The gray pixels seem to correspond to the \"filled\" areas of the blue shape in the input, and appear in a cross/plus-sign shape. The output dimensions appear to be related to a bounding box around the shape in the input.\n* **Transformation**: Reduction in grid, color and shape, a color change is happening,\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case it is 3x3.\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** Generate a new, empty grid with the dimensions of the bounding box.\n4. **Map input to output**: Map the input grid 3x3 central region on to the output grid\n5.  **Color Mapping:**\n    *   If an input pixel within the bounding box is blue (1), set the corresponding output pixel to gray (5).\n    *   If an input pixel within the bounding box  is white (0), set the corresponding output pixel to white(0).\n\nEssentially, the program finds the core shape, extracts its bounding box region and translate this region to the output grid, mapping the blue to gray and leaving white as it is.\n"
