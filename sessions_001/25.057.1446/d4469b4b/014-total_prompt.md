## Example 3

**input:**
```
3 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 3
0 3 3 0 0
0 3 0 3 0
3 0 3 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x786C5474AB50>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 0 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C544994D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 5x5 grid containing integer values representing colors. The dominant colors are white (0) and green (3).
*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid, also containing integer values. The colors are white (0) and gray (5).
*   **Size Reduction:** The grid dimensions are reduced from 5x5 to 3x3.
*   **Color Change:** Green (3) in the input becomes gray (5) in the output. White (0) remains white (0).
*   **Object Identification:** The green pixels (3) in the input grid appear to be the primary subject of the transformation.
* The output seems to represent a simplified or abstracted version for the input, keeping the information.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
    dominant_colors: [0, 3]
    description: The original grid containing the data to be transformed.

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    dominant_colors: [0, 5]
    description: The transformed grid, smaller in size and with modified color values.

  - action: size_reduction
    from: 5x5
    to: 3x3
    description: The dimensions of the grid are reduced.

  - action: color_transformation
    input_color: 3
    output_color: 5
    description: Green (3) pixels are changed to gray (5).

  - action: white_preservation
    color: 0
    description: all white (0) remain the same
  
  - relationship: green_to_gray
    subject: input_grid green pixels
    object: output_grid gray pixels
    description: Green pixels in the input correspond to gray pixels in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with the value 3 (green).
2.  **Determine Output Grid Center:** Take the floor average of the x and y coordinates of the green (3) value and create new center coordinates for the output.
3.  **Create a Sub-Grid**: Create a 3x3 output, populate the position represented by the x, y coordinates with the gray color.
4. **Populate Output Grid:** Copy a 3x3 subgrid around that center into the output, and make non zero to 5 (gray).

In simpler term, the transformation extracts the 3x3 subgrid that is centered by the green in the input grid and changes those value to 5.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
