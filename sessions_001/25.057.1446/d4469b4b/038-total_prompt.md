## Example 7

**input:**
```
0 3 0 3 0
3 3 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0
3 3 3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x786C5449A750>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 0 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C54499A50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (5x5) of colored pixels into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and green (3). The output grid contains two colors: white (0) and grey (5). The transformation seems to involve a reduction in size and a change in color of specific areas. There's a spatial correspondence, but it isn't a direct 1:1 mapping of cells. It appears to be a process of summarizing or abstracting regions of the input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    colors:
      - white (0)
      - green (3)
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      - white (0)
      - grey (5)
  - observation: output_size_reduction
    description: The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
  - observation: color_change
    description: Green (3) in the input becomes grey (5) in the output, white remains white.
  - observation: spatial_correspondence
    description:  The bottom-right 3x3 section of the input may influence the output, though direct mapping requires checking. Green regions influence output.
  - observation: bottom_left_green
    description:  The bottom left 3x3 area of the input has a green L shape
  - observation: all_green_is_five
    description: All of the original green in the input is five in the output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus Area:** Consider the bottom-right 3x3 sub-grid of the 5x5 input grid.
2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   If a cell within the focused 3x3 area of the input is green (3), the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid is gray (5).
    *   If a cell within the 3x3 focused input is white (0), map it to the output to the correponding cell as white (0).

Essentially, the output grid is a 3x3 representation of the bottom-right 3x3 section of the input grid, with a color substitution of green to grey.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
