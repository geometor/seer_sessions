The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and green (3). The output grid contains two colors: white (0) and grey (5). The transformation seems to involve a reduction in size and a change in color of specific areas. There's a spatial correspondence, but it isn't a direct 1:1 mapping of cells. It appears to be a process of summarizing or abstracting regions of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
