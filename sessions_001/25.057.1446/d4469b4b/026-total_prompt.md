## Example 5

**input:**
```
2 0 2 0 2
2 0 0 0 2
2 2 0 0 0
2 0 0 2 2
2 2 2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x786C546CB6D0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 5 0
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C546CB2D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 5x5 grid with cells colored either red (2) or white (0). The red cells appear to form a cross or plus-shape.
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid. Some cells are gray (5), and others are white (0). The gray cells also appear to form a plus shape, but it is rotated by 45 degrees.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements:
      - color: red
        value: 2
      - color: white
        value: 0
    description: "The input grid contains a cross shape made of red cells."

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: gray
        value: 5
      - color: white
        value: 0
    description: "Output is a shrunken cross in gray"

  - relation: input_output

  - action: shrink
    type: spatial
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    description: the shape is reduce to the smallest possible representation

  - action: rotation
    type: spatial
    source: red_cross
    target: gray_cross
    description: "Implicit 45-degree rotation as part of cross extraction."

  - action: color_change
    type: visual
    source: red
    target: gray
    description: "Red cells in the input become gray cells in the output."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "Cross":** Locate the contiguous red (2) cells in the input grid that form a plus-shape or cross.
2.  **Extract Core:** Determine the smallest possible sub grid that contains the cross shape, reducing empty space around and within the cross.
3. **Translate and Change:**
      - Color red in the minimal cross representation gray (5)
    - Any other color is white (0)
4.  **Output:** Create a new grid representing the cross shape from gray.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the "essence" of the red cross shape, shrinks, and represents it using gray cells in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
