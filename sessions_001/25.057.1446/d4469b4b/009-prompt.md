Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Shape:** Locate the contiguous region of blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Find Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that completely encloses the blue shape. In this case it is 3x3.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Generate a new, empty grid with the dimensions of the bounding box.
4. **Map input to output**: Map the input grid 3x3 central region on to the output grid
5.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   If an input pixel within the bounding box is blue (1), set the corresponding output pixel to gray (5).
    *   If an input pixel within the bounding box  is white (0), set the corresponding output pixel to white(0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
