The input grid contains only two colors: blue (1) and white (0). The output grid contains white (0) and gray (5).  The output grid appears to be a condensed or summarized version of the input grid. The positions of the gray pixels in the output seem to correlate with regions of high blue pixel density in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The centers of these 3x3 regions are one pixel move from each other forming a grid of 3x3 center pixels.\n2.  **Check for Blue:** For each 3x3 region in the input:\n    *   If the 3x3 region contains any blue (1) pixels, set the corresponding pixel in the 3x3 output grid to gray (5).\n    *   If a region contains only white pixels, set the pixel in output to be white (0)\n3.  **Output Result:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation checks 3x3 overlapping sections of the input grid. If a section contains at least one blue pixel, the corresponding pixel in the smaller output grid is gray; otherwise, it's white. This effectively summarizes the presence of blue pixels within larger regions of the input.\n"
