      input_objects:
        - color: blue (1)
          shape: single pixel

      output_objects:
        - color: gray (5)
          shape: single pixel
          position: (1,1)
      transformation: "A single blue pixel in the input 3x3 sub-grid centered at (1,1) results in a gray pixel at the corresponding location in the output."

  - example_2:
    input_size: 5x5
    output_size: 3x3
    input_objects:
      - color: blue (1)
        shape: vertical line

      - color: gray(5)
        shape: vertical line
        position: Column 1 (0-indexed)
        height: 3
    transformation: "A vertical line of blue pixels in the input, specifically when occupying the central column of 3x3 regions, results in a vertical line of gray at the central column."
  - example_3:
      input_size: 5x5
      output_size: 3x3
      input_objects:

      transformation: "Two non-connected blue pixels, in the positions, results in the corners to become gray"
