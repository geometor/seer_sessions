## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x786C5474AB50>

**output:**
```
0 5 0
5 5 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C54499FD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 5x5 grid containing pixels of two colors: white (0) and blue (1). There's a seemingly irregular shape formed by the blue pixels.
*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid containing pixels of two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The gray pixels seem to correspond to the "filled" areas of the blue shape in the input, and appear in a cross/plus-sign shape. The output dimensions appear to be related to a bounding box around the shape in the input.
* **Transformation**: Reduction in grid, color and shape, a color change is happening,

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: [0, 1]  # white, blue
    properties:
      - contains_shape: True

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 5]  # white, gray
    properties:
      - simplified_representation: True

  - name: blue_shape
    type: shape
    color: 1 # Blue
    properties:
        - enclosed: true #it may be important

actions:
  - name: simplify
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Reduces the input grid to a smaller representation, focusing on filled areas.
    parameters:
      - color_mapping: {1: 5, 0: 0}

relationships:
  - type: bounding_box_reduction
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The output grid represents a reduced, simplified version of the area occupied by the shape.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Shape:** Locate the contiguous region of blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Find Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that completely encloses the blue shape. In this case it is 3x3.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Generate a new, empty grid with the dimensions of the bounding box.
4. **Map input to output**: Map the input grid 3x3 central region on to the output grid
5.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   If an input pixel within the bounding box is blue (1), set the corresponding output pixel to gray (5).
    *   If an input pixel within the bounding box  is white (0), set the corresponding output pixel to white(0).

Essentially, the program finds the core shape, extracts its bounding box region and translate this region to the output grid, mapping the blue to gray and leaving white as it is.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
