The input is a single row of pixels, and the output is a rectangular grid. The colors in the input grid seem to be related to the colors of the output. Specifically, the red color (value 2) in the input seems to determine the shape created in the output. The white color(0) remains white.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Make the number of rows to the power of number of red cells. In this case only one, therefore result will be 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2. Only 4 first red cells are counted.\n3.  **Create a new grid.** For this example, we can expect 4x8 as shape.\n4.  **Replicate the red pixels** downwards and to the right, forming a square. The size of the square corresponds to the input. It will be formed by the top left corner.\n5. **Fill the rest of cells** outside the red with the white color.\n\n"
