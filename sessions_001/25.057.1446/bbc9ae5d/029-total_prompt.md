Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples and the initial code execution results to refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focused on the presence and location of orange (7) pixels. The execution results confirm this is a key element of the transformation.  The examples show a consistent pattern: a single orange pixel in the input expands into a 3x3 block of orange pixels in the output, with the original orange pixel's location serving as the "seed" or starting point for the expansion to the right,and down. The size of the output seems related to the input row that contained the orange, but adding rows below to make at total of 3 rows of orange.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** We need to precisely define the "seed" object (the single orange pixel in the input) and the "expanded" object (the 3x3 orange block in the output).
2.  **Pinpoint the Transformation Rule:** The core rule seems to be an expansion. The initial orange pixel's row and column determine where the 3x3 block will appear in the output.
3.    **Consider Edge Cases:** examine how the rule is impacted when orange is at the edge, corner, near other colors, etc.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution Analysis):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, incorporating code execution results (already provided, but re-stated here for clarity):

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input shape: (3, 6), Output shape: (3, 6)
    *   Input colors: \[0, 7], Output colors: \[0, 7]
    *   Input orange pixels count: 1 locations: \[(1, 1)]
    *   Output orange pixels count: 9 locations: \[(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
        *note: output orange is a 2 x 3, not a 3 x 3*
*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input shape: (3, 8), Output shape: (3, 8)
    *   Input colors: \[0, 7], Output colors: \[0, 7]
    *   Input orange pixels count: 1 locations: \[(0, 5)]
    *   Output orange pixels count: 9 locations: \[(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)]
*   **Example 3:**

    *   Input shape: (3, 10), Output shape: (3, 10)
    *   Input colors: \[0, 7], Output colors: \[0, 7]
    *   Input orange pixels count: 1 locations: \[(2, 4)]
    *   Output orange pixels count: 9 locations: \[(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: seed_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    input_count: 1
    output_count: 0
    properties:
      - location: (row, col)  # Varies per example

  - object: expanded_block
    type: pixel_block
    color: orange (7)
    input_count: 0
    output_count: 9
    properties:
      - dimensions: (3, 3) # rows, cols
      - top_left_corner: varies  # Determined by seed_pixel location
      - note: appears to actually be variable by the example data, needs additional review.

  - transformation: expansion
    description: The seed_pixel determines the location of the expanded_block.
    details: >
      The expanded_block is a block of orange pixels added to the output.
      If the seed_pixel is in row `r`, the expanded orange region consists of 3
      rows. The expansion start at the seed_pixels column `c` and includes 2
      columns to the right, `c+1` and `c+2`.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Seed:** Find the single orange (7) pixel in the input grid. Note its row (`r`) and column (`c`).
2.  **Create the Expanded Block:** Create a 3x3, 2x3, or 1x3 block of orange (7) pixels in the output grid.
3. **Determine if more rows are needed:** if the seed pixel is not on row 0 or 1, add rows above, so the output is 3 rows.
4.  **Position the Expanded Block:** The expanded blocks first orange pixel column will match the seed pixel's column (`c`). Add two additional orange pixels to the right, at `c+1` and `c+2`
5.  **Preserve Non-Orange Pixels:** This part is implicit, but crucial. All other pixels in the input grid that are *not* the seed orange pixel should remain unchanged in the output grid (their color and position stay the same). Since all the examples only have black and orange, the code should assume this and change later if needed.

This refined natural language program provides a more precise and complete description of the transformation, taking into account the observations from all three training examples. It clarifies the relationship between the seed pixel and the expanded block, and the implicit preservation of other pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
