  - object: gray_region
    input_position: indices 0-2
    input_color: 5
    output_description: Expands to fill a triangle.
  - object: white_region
    input_position: indices 3-9
    input_color: 0
    output_description: Remains unchanged, filling the rest of the grid.
  - transformation: expansion
    object: gray_region
    rule: The gray region extends downwards and to the right, forming a triangular shape. The number of gray pixels in each subsequent row increases by one, starting from the initial length of the continuous gray sequence in the input.
