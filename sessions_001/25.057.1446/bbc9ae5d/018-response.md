"""
1.  **Identify Input:** Observe the input grid.  Measure its width and height.
2.  **Measure Gray Region:** In the *first row* of the input grid, count the number of contiguous gray (5) pixels starting from the left. This is the `start_length` of the gray region.
3.  **Determine Output Height:** Also, in the *first row* of the input grid, count the number of contiguous white (0) pixels. Add the number of white pixels to the `start_length` of the gray region, calculated above.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same width as the input grid and the height calculated in the previous step.
5.  **Copy First Row:** Copy the *first row* of the input grid to the first row of the output grid.
6.  **Expand Gray Region:** For each subsequent row in the output grid:
    *   Increase the length of the gray region by one.
    *   Fill the cells from the left with gray (5) pixels, up to the calculated length for that row.
7.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with white (0) pixels.
