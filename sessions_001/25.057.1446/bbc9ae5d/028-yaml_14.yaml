    description: The seed_pixel determines the location of the expanded_block.
    details: >
      The expanded_block is a block of orange pixels added to the output.
      If the seed_pixel is in row `r`, the expanded orange region consists of 3
      rows. The expansion start at the seed_pixels column `c` and includes 2
      columns to the right, `c+1` and `c+2`.
