objects:
  - color: red (2)
    initial_arrangement: scattered throughout the input row
    final_arrangement: forms a contiguous block at the beginning of the output row
    count_preservation: true # The number of red pixels remains the same.
    shape: varies # Initially individual pixels, finally a block.
  - color: white (0)
    initial_arrangement: scattered throughout the input row
    final_arrangement: fills the remaining space after the red block in the output row
