The input grid consists of four azure (8) pixels followed by two white (0) pixels. The output grid expands on this pattern. The azure pixels seem to propagate downwards, while the white pixels seem to only propagate some of their instances, always in the bottom-most row.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
