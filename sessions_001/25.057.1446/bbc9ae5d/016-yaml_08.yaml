observations:
  - object: gray_region
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      shape: contiguous horizontal line
      start_position: [0, 0]  # Row 0, Column 0
    actions:
      - name: extend_vertically
        description: >
          The gray region extends downwards, creating new rows. The number of new rows is determined by the initial length
          of the gray region in the input's first row. Specifically, the number of 5s in each new row equals the row index.
  - object: non_gray_region
    properties:
      color: varies (not gray)
      shape: contiguous horizontal line (following gray region)
    actions:
      - name: copy_to_new_rows
        description: The non-gray region is copied to the newly created rows below the original row.

  - task: extend_gray_region
    description: The task is to extend a contiguous gray region vertically.
    parameters:
      - name: gray_length
        description: length of contiguous gray pixels in input first row
      - name: input_height
        description: the number of rows in the input
    rules:
      output_width: same as input width
      output_height:  gray_length + input_height - 1
      row_extension: The number of 5's in each added row is equal to the row index
