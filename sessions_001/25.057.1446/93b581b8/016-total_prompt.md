Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves identifying a 2x2 central block in the input grid and mirroring/reflecting it to the four corner 2x2 blocks of the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def get_central_block(grid):
    """Extracts the 2x2 central block from the input grid."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    center_row = rows // 2
    center_col = cols // 2
    return grid[center_row-1:center_row+1, center_col-1:center_col+1]

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule."""
    # Initialize output grid with zeros
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Get the central 2x2 block
    central_block = get_central_block(input_grid)

    # Get the dimensions of the input grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    center_row = rows // 2
    center_col = cols // 2
    
    # set the center 2x2 block to be same
    output_grid[center_row-1:center_row+1, center_col-1:center_col+1] = central_block
    
    # Mirror/reflect the central block to the four corners
    output_grid[0:2, 0:2] = np.array([[central_block[1,1], central_block[1,0]], [central_block[0,1], central_block[0,0]]]) # Top-left
    output_grid[0:2, cols-2:cols] = np.array([[central_block[1,1], central_block[1,0]], [central_block[0,1], central_block[0,0]]]) #top right
    output_grid[rows-2:rows, 0:2] = np.array([[central_block[1,1], central_block[1,0]], [central_block[0,1], central_block[0,0]]])  # Bottom-left
    output_grid[rows-2:rows, cols-2:cols] = np.array([[central_block[1,1], central_block[1,0]], [central_block[0,1], central_block[0,0]]]) # Bottom-right

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of mirroring a 2x2 central block to the four corners. While this worked for the first example, it's clear from the subsequent tests that this rule is not universally applicable. The core issue is that the transformation isn't solely about mirroring the central block; it also involves selectively placing this mirrored block in specific locations and, crucially, *preserving* the original central block. Furthermore, the mirroring operation isn't a simple reflection, but a series of 90 degree rotations. The code also doesn't make use of the color prior.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** We need to go beyond just identifying the "central 2x2 block." We should consider the entire input grid, and the central block as distinct regions.
2.  **Re-evaluate the Transformation:** Instead of simple mirroring, consider a combination of copying, rotating 90 degreees clockwise and positioning.
3.  **Iterative Improvement:** Test the updated natural language program and code against *all* training examples, not just the first one.

**Metrics and Observations (using imagined code execution - as no environment available):**

Let's assume we have functions `get_dimensions`, `count_colors`, `compare_grids` to help. Since no code execution is available here, the metrics are approximated based on visual inspection of example results, which is not the best approach.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 6x6
    *   Output Dimensions: 6x6
    *   Input Colors: {blue, red}
    *   Output Colors: {blue, red}
    *   Grid Comparison: Initially thought to be correct, now known to be coincidentally so. The original code places the rotated block in all corners.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 10x10
    *   Output Dimensions: 10x10
    *   Input Colors: {gray, green}
    *   Output Colors: {gray, green}
    *   Grid Comparison: Incorrect. Central block is preserved, but corners are incorrectly filled.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 14x14
    *   Output Dimensions: 14x14
    *   Input Colors: {yellow, black}
    *   Output Colors: {yellow, black}
    *   Grid Comparison: Incorrect. Central block is preserved, but corners are incorrectly filled.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - colors: variable (2 colors)
      - central_block: 2x2 block at center of grid
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - colors: same as input_grid
    transformation_elements:
      - object: central_2x2_block
        actions:
          - copy: to same location in output_grid
          - rotate: 90 degrees clockwise x1
          - place: at all 2x2 corners of the output grid.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Central Block:** Locate the 2x2 block in the center of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve the Central Block:** Copy the central 2x2 block to the same location in the output grid.
3.  **Rotate and Place:** Rotate the 2x2 central block 90 degrees clockwise.
4. **Place in Corners:** Copy the rotated 2x2 block into each of the four 2x2 corner regions of the output grid.

This natural language program is more accurate than the previous version because it specifies: the copying of the center block, the rotation of center block prior to the copy, the location of the copy, and does not perform operations on the original grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
