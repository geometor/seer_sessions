Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate all non-zero colored pixels within the input grid. Consider the blue object (integer value '1') to be special, or the origin.
2.  **Replicate at origin:** copy the origin to row 0, col 0.
3.  **Mirror Object Creation:** Using the original blue object as a "pivot point" or center of a reflected "quadrant", create copies, reflections or transformations.
4. Mirror the yellow and magenta above and to the right of the blue pixel. Mirror the red to above and to the left of blue
5. Mirror the yellow and magenta again on the row equal to 2x the distance to the blue origin.
6.  **Background:** All other cells in the output grid remain unchanged (value 0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
