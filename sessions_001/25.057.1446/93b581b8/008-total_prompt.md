## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 4 6 0 0 0
0 2 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x786C54B02350>

**output:**
```
1 0 0 2 2 0
0 4 6 0 0 0
0 2 1 0 0 0
6 0 0 4 4 0
6 0 0 4 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x786C54B112D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid (matrix) of single-digit integers, where each integer represents a color. The input grid transforms into a different output grid. The core of the task seems to involve identifying specific colored objects in the input, and potentially replicating or moving them in some way within the output grid, perhaps altering the original configuration. There's also an element of creating new color patterns in the output that were not present in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    input_shape: [6, 6]
    output_shape: [6, 6]

  - object: colored_pixels
    type: individual cells
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer value
      - location: (row, column) coordinates

  - observation: new_shapes_created
      description: areas of color are created in the output grid, mirroring existing shapes and colors

  - observation: symmetry
      description: output seems to create a mirror, but not a perfect reflection, and only of certain colors.

  - action: replicate
    description: original colored squares are replicated, but maybe with a new origin point

  - action: move
    description: It looks like the origin of the mirroring is the blue square.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate all non-zero colored pixels within the input grid. Consider the blue object (integer value '1') to be special, or the origin.
2.  **Replicate at origin:** copy the origin to row 0, col 0.
3.  **Mirror Object Creation:** Using the original blue object as a "pivot point" or center of a reflected "quadrant", create copies, reflections or transformations.
4. Mirror the yellow and magenta above and to the right of the blue pixel. Mirror the red to above and to the left of blue
5. Mirror the yellow and magenta again on the row equal to 2x the distance to the blue origin.
6.  **Background:** All other cells in the output grid remain unchanged (value 0).

In simpler terms, the transformation seems to involve using the '1'/blue color as the center of a new 2x2 area and performing some kind of partial mirroring/quadrant replication of existing objects above and the right, and to the left.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
