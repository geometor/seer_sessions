            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of mirroring a 2x2 central block to the four corners. While this worked for the first example, it's clear from the subsequent tests that this rule is not universally applicable. The core issue is that the transformation isn't solely about mirroring the central block; it also involves selectively placing this mirrored block in specific locations and, crucially, *preserving* the original central block. Furthermore, the mirroring operation isn't a simple reflection, but a series of 90 degree rotations. The code also doesn't make use of the color prior.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** We need to go beyond just identifying the \"central 2x2 block.\" We should consider the entire input grid, and the central block as distinct regions.\n2.  **Re-evaluate the Transformation:** Instead of simple mirroring, consider a combination of copying, rotating 90 degreees clockwise and positioning.\n3.  **Iterative Improvement:** Test the updated natural language program and code against *all* training examples, not just the first one.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using imagined code execution - as no environment available):**\n\nLet's assume we have functions `get_dimensions`, `count_colors`, `compare_grids` to help. Since no code execution is available here, the metrics are approximated based on visual inspection of example results, which is not the best approach.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 6x6\n    *   Output Dimensions: 6x6\n    *   Input Colors: {blue, red}\n    *   Output Colors: {blue, red}\n    *   Grid Comparison: Initially thought to be correct, now known to be coincidentally so. The original code places the rotated block in all corners.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 10x10\n    *   Output Dimensions: 10x10\n    *   Input Colors: {gray, green}\n    *   Output Colors: {gray, green}\n    *   Grid Comparison: Incorrect. Central block is preserved, but corners are incorrectly filled.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 14x14\n    *   Output Dimensions: 14x14\n    *   Input Colors: {yellow, black}\n    *   Output Colors: {yellow, black}\n    *   Grid Comparison: Incorrect. Central block is preserved, but corners are incorrectly filled.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: variable\n      - colors: variable (2 colors)\n      - central_block: 2x2 block at center of grid\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: same as input_grid\n      - colors: same as input_grid\n    transformation_elements:\n      - object: central_2x2_block\n        actions:\n          - copy: to same location in output_grid\n          - rotate: 90 degrees clockwise x1\n          - place: at all 2x2 corners of the output grid.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Central Block:** Locate the 2x2 block in the center of the input grid.\n2.  **Preserve the Central Block:** Copy the central 2x2 block to the same location in the output grid.\n3.  **Rotate and Place:** Rotate the 2x2 central block 90 degrees clockwise.\n4. **Place in Corners:** Copy the rotated 2x2 block into each of the four 2x2 corner regions of the output grid.\n\nThis natural language program is more accurate than the previous version because it specifies: the copying of the center block, the rotation of center block prior to the copy, the location of the copy, and does not perform operations on the original grid.\n"
