The input grid appears to have a central 2x2 block of non-zero (colored) pixels, surrounded by zero-value (white) pixels. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, where the 2x2 central block is retained, and specific mirroring operations related to axes occur with repeated colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This 2x2 block will remain in its original position and values in the output grid.\n2.  **Mirror Top and Bottom:**\n    *   The values in the last column of the 2 x 2 block are extended vertically upwards, creating a 2-wide column of duplicated color.\n    *   The values in the first column of the 2 x 2 block are extended vertically downwards, creating a 2-wide column of duplicated color.\n3.  **Mirror Left and Right:**\n    *   The values in the bottom row of the 2 x 2 block are extended horizontally to the right, creating a 2-high row of duplicated color.\n    *   The values on the top row of the 2 x 2 block are extended horizontally to the left, creating a 2-high row of duplicated color.\n\nIn essence, the transformation involves preserving the central 2x2 block and selectively mirroring its colored edges outward, based on the last/first columns of the core.\n"
