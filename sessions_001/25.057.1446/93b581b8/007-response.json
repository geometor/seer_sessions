The input grid transforms into a different output grid. The core of the task seems to involve identifying specific colored objects in the input, and potentially replicating or moving them in some way within the output grid, perhaps altering the original configuration. There's also an element of creating new color patterns in the output that were not present in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
