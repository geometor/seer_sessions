Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, represented by integers. The input grid appears to have a central 2x2 block of non-zero (colored) pixels, surrounded by zero-value (white) pixels. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, where the 2x2 central block is retained, and specific mirroring operations related to axes occur with repeated colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 6x6 grid of integers, representing colored pixels.
  - objects:
      - name: central_block
        type: rectangle
        description: |
          A 2x2 block of non-zero pixels in the center of the grid.
        properties:
          - position: (row 3, column 3) to (row 4, column 4) in the input.
          - colors: [9 (maroon), 3 (green), 7 (orange), 8 (azure)]
      - name: mirrored_blocks
        type: set
        description: |
          A group of colored blocks appearing at opposite ends of the output grid.
        properties:
            - colors: The colors of the blocks in input, except rotated.
  - actions:
    - type: mirroring
      description: |
          Duplication of specific colors from the central block across the mirrored positions.
  - relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: |
        The central block remains unchanged. The other blocks are mirrored and repeated around.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the 2x2 block of non-zero pixels in the center of the input grid. This 2x2 block will remain in its original position and values in the output grid.
2.  **Mirror Top and Bottom:**
    *   The values in the last column of the 2 x 2 block are extended vertically upwards, creating a 2-wide column of duplicated color.
    *   The values in the first column of the 2 x 2 block are extended vertically downwards, creating a 2-wide column of duplicated color.
3.  **Mirror Left and Right:**
    *   The values in the bottom row of the 2 x 2 block are extended horizontally to the right, creating a 2-high row of duplicated color.
    *   The values on the top row of the 2 x 2 block are extended horizontally to the left, creating a 2-high row of duplicated color.

In essence, the transformation involves preserving the central 2x2 block and selectively mirroring its colored edges outward, based on the last/first columns of the core.
