facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    input_shape: [6, 6]
    output_shape: [6, 6]

  - object: colored_pixels
    type: individual cells
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer value
      - location: (row, column) coordinates

  - observation: new_shapes_created
      description: areas of color are created in the output grid, mirroring existing shapes and colors

  - observation: symmetry
      description: output seems to create a mirror, but not a perfect reflection, and only of certain colors.

  - action: replicate
    description: original colored squares are replicated, but maybe with a new origin point

  - action: move
    description: It looks like the origin of the mirroring is the blue square.
