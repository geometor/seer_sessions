The primary colors involved here seem to be white (0), gray (5), green (3), red (2), and azure (8).\n*   **Objects**: Contiguous blocks of single color can be considered objects, for instance, the two gray(5) pixels at `[0,0]` and `[5,0]`\n* **Change in color**: green (3) becomes azure (8)\n* **Relative location**: The locations of the green (3) pixels that change to azure(8) are always adjacent to a red(2) pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
