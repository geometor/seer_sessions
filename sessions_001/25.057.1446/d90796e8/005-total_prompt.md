Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Examine Top Row:** Inspect the top row of the input grid.
2.  **Locate Non-Zero:** Identify any non-zero numbers within the top row, noting their positions and values.
3. **If 2 Non-Zero Elements**: add them together
4.  **Calculate Result:** If there are non-zero numbers in top row, multiply the *first* non-zero number by 2, unless a sum has occurred. If there are *no* non-zero numbers, the result is 0.
5.  **Replace First Non-Zero:** In the top row, replace the first non-zero number encountered (scanning from left to right) with the calculated result.
6.  **Clear Others:** Set all *other* non-zero numbers in the top row to 0.
7.  **Preserve Rest:** All other rows in the grid remain unchanged.
8.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
