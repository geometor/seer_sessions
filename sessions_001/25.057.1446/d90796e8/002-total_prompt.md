## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 2 0
0 0 0
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C546CAE50>

**output:**
```
8 0 0
0 0 0
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C546CBBD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid based on a specific rule involving the non-zero numbers in the top row. The number 5, which isn't on the top row, is not directly involved with the transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: cell
        properties:
          value: integer (0-9)
          color: mapped from value (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
  - type: number
    properties:
      value: integer
      location: grid coordinates (row, col)

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: changes values of top row non-zero numbers, according to the given rule
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - element-of: (cell, grid)
  - top_row: cells at (0,0) (0,1) and (0,2)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Locate the non-zero numbers in the top row of the input grid.
2. **Sum**: Calculate sum of those numbers.
3.  **Replace**: Replace the first non-zero number in the top row (scanning left-to-right) with the result calculated in the previous step.
4. **Clear**: Set all other numbers in top row to 0.
5. **Preserve**: Keep every number not in the top row as in the original input
6.  **Output**: The modified grid is the output.

In this specific example, the non-zero numbers on the top row of the input grid are 3 and 2. Their sum is 3 + 2 = 5. The transformation is completed when cell (0, 0) that was a '3' is replaced by '8', and cell (0,1) that was '2' becomes 0. The '5' in cell (2,1) remains unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
