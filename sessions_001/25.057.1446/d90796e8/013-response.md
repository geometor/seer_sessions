Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements**

*   **Grids:** Both input and output are 7x7 grids.
*   **Colors:** Multiple colors are present, corresponding to the digits 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon).
*   **Objects:** We can consider contiguous blocks of the same color as distinct objects. Some objects are single pixels, while others span multiple pixels.
*   **Transformations:** The transformation seems selective. Not all pixels/objects change, and the changes are not simple color swaps.
* **Blank Space:** large regions of 0 (white) as the background

**YAML Fact Block**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 7x7 grids.
  - type: colors
    description: Cells can have values from 0-9, representing different colors.
  - type: objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.
  - observation: positional_changes
    description: The position and potentially the color of some objects change in the output grid.
  - type: object
    color: green
    input_position: (1,0), (5,0)
    output_position: (1,0), (5,0)
  - type: object
    color: gray
    input_position: (2,0), (6,3)
    output_position: (2,0), (6,3)
  - type: object
    color: red
    input_position: (0,5), (5,1), (2,2)
    output_position: (0,5), (5,5), (2,3)
  - type: object
    color: red
    input_value: 2
    changed_to: azure, 8
  - observation: selective_replacement
    description: Some of red objects are replaced by azure objects where 2 connected horizontally or vertically to green or gray objects.
```



**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Treat each contiguous block of non-zero pixels as an object. Note value.
2.  **Locate Red and Azure:**
    *   Red (2) cells in input horizontally or vertically adjacent to green (3) or gray (5)
    *   Replace with azure (8)

3. Leave other pixels as they are.

In other words, find the red(2) which are adjacent to the green(3) and the gray(5) and change them to azure (8). If red pixels are isolated, no changes.
