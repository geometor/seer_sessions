      output_objects: [{position: (0,5), value: 5}]
      transformation: "If the top row contains a single, non-zero value, replace it with 5. It appears the program incorrectly doubled it and did not apply this unique rule."
    example_3:
      input_objects:  [{position: (0,7), value: 1}]
      output_objects: [{position: (0,7), value: 2}]
      transformation: "If top row contains a single, non-zero value, double it"
    general_rule: "The first non-zero number in the top row is transformed. If no non-zero, (0,0) is set to 6. If one value, it is doubled, except when it is 7, which becomes 5."
