Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid based on a specific rule involving the non-zero numbers in the top row. The number 5, which isn't on the top row, is not directly involved with the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
