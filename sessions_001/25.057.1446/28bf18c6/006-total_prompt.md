Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are colored azure (8).
2.  **Group:** Organize the azure pixels into contiguous blocks.  Two azure pixels are considered contiguous if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
3.  **Construct:** Create a new output grid that is 3 rows by 6 columns, filled with black (0) pixels.
4.  **Rearrange:** Transfer the azure pixels to the output grid, maintaining the shape and relative positions of the contiguous blocks, fitting them within the 3x6 output.
    - Preserve the relative horizontal and vertical positions. If block A is above block B in the input, it should generally be above or on the same level as block B in the output. If block A is to the left of block B, it should also be to the left (or in the same column) in the output.
    - The internal shape of each contiguous block must be preserved exactly.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The code correctly identifies and groups contiguous azure (8) pixels and attempts to place them in a 3x6 output grid. However, the placement logic is very simplistic (adjacent placement) and doesn't generalize well to other examples, specifically when blocks need more complex layout. The primary issue is determining the positioning of the blocks in the output. The strategy will involve improving the logic to better handle the relative positioning and arrangement of the blocks while taking into account the input-output relationship.

**Example and Result Analysis**

To better understand the positioning, let's examine each example and its result. We'll focus on the input's azure block arrangement and how it maps to the output. I will execute the existing code to make sure I have the same results as the test.

```python

        for prev_pixel in current_block:
            if (abs(pixels[i][0] - prev_pixel[0]) == 1 and pixels[i][1] == prev_pixel[1]) or \
               (abs(pixels[i][1] - prev_pixel[1]) == 1 and pixels[i][0] == prev_pixel[0]):
               is_contiguous = True
               break

        if is_contiguous:
          current_block.append(pixels[i])

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Blocks:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are colored azure (8).
2.  **Group Contiguous Blocks:** Group the azure pixels into contiguous blocks. Two azure pixels are contiguous if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
3.  **Output Grid:** Create a new output grid that is 3 rows by 6 columns, filled with black (0) pixels.
4.  **Transfer and Arrange Blocks:** Iterate through the contiguous blocks found in the input.  For each block:
    *   Maintain its original shape and size.
    *   Place the block into the output grid, prioritizing the top-left corner.
        * If the block will fit by placing the top-left of the object in the (0,0) of the grid, use that location
        * If not, find the next empty space from left-to-right, top-to-bottom where placing the top-left corner of the block will still allow the entire block to fit in the output grid.
5.  **Output:** The output grid is the result.

This improved natural language program provides a more complete description of the transformation and addresses all three training examples. It clarifies the block placement logic and handles cases of overlapping placement better.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
