Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Extract:** Isolate the azure pixels from the input grid, disregarding their original positions.
3. **Determine Output size**: The size of the compact shape formed by azure pixels are 3 x 6
4.  **Construct:** Create a new grid with the output size.
5.  **Arrange:** Fill the new grid with the extracted azure pixels.
    - Start with the top row. If there were azure pixels touching the top, copy them to the output in similar locations.
    - Next consider the pixels in the input grid that are in a row beneath the top row of azure pixels.
    - Place these pixels in the output grid in a row at the bottom.
    - If any azure pixels remain, place these in the row between the top and bottom rows that you just created.
    - If the azure pixels are not contiguous, ensure that adjacency of any groups of azure pixels in the input is preserved in the output.
6.  The shape of the azure colored pixels is a compact rectangle.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
