Both grids are of the same dimensions (3x13). The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), gray (5), and green (3). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the gray (5) and white(0) pixels to green (3).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
