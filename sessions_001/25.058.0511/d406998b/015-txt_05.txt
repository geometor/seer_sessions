Example 1:
  Input shape: (10, 10), Output shape: (10, 10)
  Differences between predicted and actual output: 0
  Changes between input and output:3
Example 2:
  Input shape: (10, 10), Output shape: (10, 10)
  Differences between predicted and actual output: 2
  Changes between input and output:5
Example 3:
  Input shape: (11, 11), Output shape: (11, 11)
  Differences between predicted and actual output: 4
  Changes between input and output:4
