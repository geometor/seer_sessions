Previous Code:
```python
"""
Replaces some white (0) pixels with green (3) pixels in a grid, while keeping gray (5) pixels unchanged. The replacement pattern for white pixels involves alternating replacements, starting with the first encountered white pixel in each row.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions and values as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each row of the grid.
    for r in range(rows):
        # Keep track of whether to replace the next white pixel.
        replace_next_white = True
        # Iterate through each column of the current row.
        for c in range(cols):
            # Check if the current pixel is white (0).
            if output_grid[r, c] == 0:
                # If we should replace this white pixel, change it to green (3).
                if replace_next_white:
                    output_grid[r, c] = 3
                # Toggle the replacement flag.
                replace_next_white = not replace_next_white

    # Return the modified grid.
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved alternating replacements of white (0) pixels with green (3) pixels in each row. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule is not universally applicable. Specifically, some examples involve different replacement patterns, and the presence of gray (5) pixels adds complexity. The error is related to the alternating replacement. Looking closer we can see we only need to replace the first 0 with 3.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input-output pair, focusing on:
    *   The location of white pixels (0).
    *   The location of green pixels (3) in the output.
    *  The location of any gray (5) pixels.
    *   Identifying any consistent patterns relating the above.
2.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Modify the natural language program to accommodate the observed variations.
3.  **Code Adjustment:** Update the Python code to reflect the refined understanding.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, I will write code to verify the number of pixels replaced.

```python
import numpy as np

def count_replaced_pixels(input_grid, output_grid):
    return np.sum((input_grid == 0) & (output_grid == 3))

def analyze_examples(task_data):
    results = []
    for example in task_data['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        replaced_count = count_replaced_pixels(input_grid, output_grid)
        results.append({
            'replaced_count': replaced_count,
            'input_white_count': np.sum(input_grid == 0),
            'output_green_count': np.sum(output_grid == 3)

        })
    return results
```

```tool_code
task_data = {
    "train": [
        {
            "input": [[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]],
            "output": [[5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]
        },
        {
            "input": [[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[3, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]]
        },
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[3, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]]
        },
                {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[3, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]]
        }
    ]
}
analysis = analyze_examples(task_data)
print(analysis)

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
