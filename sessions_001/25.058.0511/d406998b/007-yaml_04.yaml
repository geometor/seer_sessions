facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x12
      elements: integers (0-9)
      pattern: alternating gray(5) and white(0) in checkerboard
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x12
      elements: integers (0-9)
      pattern: retains gray(5) from input, replaces some white(0) with green(3)
  - action: transformation
    description: replace white pixels with green ones, in locations determined to the existing pattern.
  - relationship: element_correspondence
    description: some white pixels transform to green, while gray pixels remain the same, dimensions remain constant
