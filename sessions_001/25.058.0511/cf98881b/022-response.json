            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code (which is not shown, but we have the results of its execution) seems to be based on a simplistic interpretation of the first training example. The results across all three examples show that it's not a universally applicable rule. The differences between expected and actual outputs highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the transformation. The initial strategy likely focused on extracting specific colored pixels without considering their spatial relationships or broader context. Our strategy now is to:\n\n1.  **Identify Common Elements and Differences:** Analyze what aspects of the transformation are consistent across examples and where they diverge.\n2.  **Focus on Spatial Relationships:** Pay close attention to how the positions of pixels change (or don't change) between input and output.\n3.  **Object-Oriented Approach:** Think of contiguous blocks of color as objects and consider how these objects are manipulated.\n4.  Analyze shapes and sizes of the outputs.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using a conceptual `analyze_results` function output):**\n\nI will describe hypothetically what running `analyze_results` *would* show, as I cannot directly execute code here. I will infer the results from my review of the inputs, the correct outputs, and the code example's description of the `analyze_results` function.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 10)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 4)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (Hypothesized to be different, possibly (3,3) or something derived from taking only unique input colors)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Difference: Shows discrepancies highlighting that simply extracting colors is incorrect. The actual output likely contains only `[4, 2, 8, 9]` and may also include incorrect counts or repetitions and a likely incorrect arrangement.\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 10)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (6, 4)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (Hypothesized, likely very different)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Difference: Indicates the actual output doesn't capture the two vertical `7`s and the padding of `0`s. It likely only got the `[7, 0]` and probably incorrect counts or repetition.\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 10)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 4)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (Hypothesized, likely very different)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Difference: Would show that the algorithm didn't correctly extract the central 4x5 block of `5`s. It likely contains `[6, 5]` and incorrect repetition.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: 3\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 4\n        shape: single_pixel\n        count: 1\n      - color: 2\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 2\n      - color: 8\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 9\n        shape: single_pixel\n        count: 1\n    output_objects:\n      - color: 4\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 2\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n      - color: 9\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 3\n\n    transformations:\n      - action: select_columns\n        criteria: color_present_in_all_rows\n        selected_colors: [4, 2, 9] #columns containing these colors\n    notes: >\n      Output grid contains vertical lines of colors that appeared in every row of the input.\n      The width of the output grid corresponds to the number of colors present in all input rows.\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - color: 0\n        shape: background\n      - color: 7\n        shape: vertical_line\n        count: 2\n    output_objects:\n      - color: 7\n        shape: rectangle\n        width: 2\n        height: 6\n      - color: 0\n        shape: rectangle\n        width: 2\n        height: 6\n\n    transformations:\n      - action: select_columns\n        criteria: color_present_in_all_rows\n        selected_colors: [7,0] #columns containing 7 and 0\n    notes: >\n      Two vertical lines of color 7, padded with zeros to make it the height-1 of the original input\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_objects:\n      - color: 6\n        shape: border\n      - color: 5\n        shape: rectangle\n        height: 5\n        width: 4\n        interior: true\n    output_objects:\n      - color: 5\n        shape: rectangle\n        height: 5\n        width: 4\n    transformations:\n        - action: select_inner_rectangle\n\n    notes: >\n      The output isolates a contiguous 4x5 block of color 5, found in all rows of the original image\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Columns/Pixels:** Find the colors that appear in *every* row of the input grid.\n2.  **Select Columns:** Extract the *entire* columns from the input grid that contain the key colors identified in step 1.\n3. **Assemble:** Construct the new grid by including each selected column once, preserving the height of the columns, and including only the identified columns.\n\nFor example 2: It appears we select two lines of `7`, and pad by two columns of zeros, to make the height one less than the input height.\nFor example 3: there is an inner rectangle of color `5` - the selected pixels are a rectangle of that size.\n\nThe initial version was likely only performing step 1 and incorrectly assembling the output. This revised program emphasizes the column-wise extraction and preservation of spatial information (height of the columns). The key difference is the understanding that we're selecting *columns* based on the *presence of specific colors in all rows*, not just collecting the colors themselves. Also, sometimes we select all pixels of a specific color, if it forms a rectangle.\n"
