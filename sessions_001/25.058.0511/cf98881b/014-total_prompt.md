## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 4 4 0 2 9 9 0 9 2 0 1 0 1
0 4 0 4 2 0 0 9 0 2 0 1 0 0
0 4 0 4 2 0 0 9 9 2 1 0 0 1
4 0 4 4 2 9 9 9 0 2 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7B1DDE6E04D0>

**output:**
```
4 4 4 9
0 4 9 4
1 4 9 4
4 9 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7B1DE5E262D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a rectangular grid of colored pixels into a smaller rectangular grid. The colors in the input grid seem to be reduced to a subset in the output grid. Specifically, yellow (4), maroon (9), white(0), and blue(1) appear in the output, while red(2) is gone. The output grid appears to be a condensed or summarized version of the input. It's not a simple sub-region selection, as elements from different input regions are combined. There is a change in structure. The size is significantly smaller, specifically the input is 4x15 and the output is 4x4. The relationship is unclear.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [4, 15]
  colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 9]
  shape: rectangle
output_grid:
  dimensions: [4, 4]
  colors: [0, 1, 4, 9]
  shape: rectangle
color_mapping:
  0: white
  1: blue
  2: red
  4: yellow
  9: maroon
transformation_type: condensation # Placeholder - needs refinement
spatial_relationship: unclear  # Need to figure out the mapping between input and output positions
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Repeating Sub-grids:** Observe an approximate vertical partition into subgrids of size approximately n, where n = input_grid.width / output_grid.width = 15/4. In the provided images, each partition has different width due to different colors. We may be looking at an approximation and the transformation considers multiple partitions.

2.  **Color Priority within Partitions:** Within each subgrid, some colors win. It is necessary to derive which.
    From observation:
    -   Yellow (4) appears to always be present.
    -   Maroon (9) appears related to yellow (4).
    - White(0) and blue(1) may be related somehow, at least they both win against red(2).
   The color preservation rule is unclear.

3. **Build the Output** Scan each vertical slice of size approximately n and determine a value to preserve and write to the output.
Repeat until done.

The core challenge is in figuring out exactly *how* the input grid's spatial information and colors map to the output grid's cells. It's neither a simple cropping nor a direct color-for-color substitution. There is spatial compression/summarization. The selection rule seems to combine spatial and color information.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
