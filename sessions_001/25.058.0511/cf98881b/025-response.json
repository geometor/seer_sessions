The transformation significantly reduces the size of the grid. Colors other than yellow (4) seem to be removed, with the arrangement of yellow pixels being the primary feature retained. It seems to be a form of simplification or extraction of the core yellow structure. Blue and White on the border is preserved.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
