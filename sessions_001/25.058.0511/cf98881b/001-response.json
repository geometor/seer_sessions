The transformation seems to involve selecting specific colors and possibly a spatial relationship or pattern. It's not a simple cropping or scaling. Certain colors appear to be filtered or prioritized, while others are omitted. The relative positioning of some colors *seems* relevant.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
