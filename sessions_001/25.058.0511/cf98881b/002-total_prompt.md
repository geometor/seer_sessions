## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 4 0 4 2 9 9 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0 2 0 0 9 9 2 0 1 0 0
4 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 0
4 4 4 4 2 9 0 9 0 2 1 1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7B1DDE90B7D0>

**output:**
```
9 4 0 4
0 4 9 9
4 1 1 0
4 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7B1DDE7399D0>
Here's my analysis of the provided example, outlining my perception, documented facts in YAML format, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid. The transformation seems to involve selecting specific colors and possibly a spatial relationship or pattern. It's not a simple cropping or scaling. Certain colors appear to be filtered or prioritized, while others are omitted. The relative positioning of some colors *seems* relevant.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 14 columns wide and 4 rows high.
  - observation: Output grid is 4 columns wide and 4 rows high.
  - observation: Input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), yellow (4), red (2), maroon (9), and blue (1).
  - observation: Output grid contains pixels of colors white (0), yellow (4), maroon (9), and blue (1).
  - observation: Red (2) pixels are present in the input but not in the output.
  - object: Input Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 14x4
      colors: [0, 4, 2, 9, 1]
  - object: Output Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      colors: [0, 4, 9, 1]
  - relationship: Some colors in the input grid are omitted in output
  - action: Color Filtering - Color 2 eliminated
  - action: Selection/Extraction - Specific regions based on color and maybe position

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The output grid retains only the colors yellow (4), maroon (9), blue (1) and white (0).
2.  **Color Elimination:** Remove all red (2) pixels from the input.
3. **Spatial Selection**:
    *   The first column is the top-left yellow, top maroon (if they exists at the first column of the input).
    *   The second column appears to be the leftmost section of continuous yellow (4) starting from the left.
    * The third column is composed of 0, 9, 1, 4 from the input where 0 are to the left of 9, 9 are above another 9, and 1 are above another 1, and 4 are under 1.
    * The forth column seems to take the last column of the largest continuous yellow section (at the forth row).

The rule is highly specific to color and spatial arrangement of color.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
