Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another, smaller grid of colored pixels. The colors appear to be selectively extracted and repositioned. The input grid seems to contain more variety of colors than the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: [4, 14]
        elements: [0, 1, 2, 4, 9]  # Unique colors present
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: [4, 4]
        elements: [0, 1, 4, 9] # Unique colors present
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
        mapping: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 4: yellow, 9: maroon}
      - position: [row, column]

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Selects specific pixels from the input_grid.
  - type: repositioning
    description: Places the selected pixels into the output_grid at new locations.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains multiple pixel objects.
  - output_grid contains a subset of pixel colors from the input_grid.
  - pixel colors determine their visual representation.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The output grid consists of pixels with colors 4 (yellow), 0 (white), 1 (blue) and 9 (maroon).

2.  **Column Selection:** From the original image, select columns that begins, at the top (row 1), with the target colors.

3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid, filling each column, from top to bottom, with all the values of the selected columns.

4.  **Result:** The transformed output is created.
