Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a single example and, as expected, doesn't generalize well to the other examples in the training set. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis was too specific. The provided `transform` function isn't included in the code, but from the results, it is doing *something*. We need to discern what the actual transformation rule is by looking at *all* examples, not just the first one. The provided `get_objects` and `analyze_results` are very helpful for debugging. It reveals the need for a more robust rule that accounts for various object configurations and colors. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Examine all examples:** Carefully analyze the input and output grids for each example, paying close attention to the object analysis provided by the existing code.
2.  **Identify common patterns:** Look for consistent relationships between input and output objects, considering color, position, size, and arrangement.
3.  **Formulate a general rule:** Develop a natural language description of the transformation that applies to all examples.
4.  **Prepare for coding:** Use the YAML block to capture specific observations that will help translate the natural language program into Python code.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using the provided analysis output):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: A yellow rectangle (color 4) and a maroon pixel (color 9).
    *   Output: A 4x2 grid with alternating yellow and black pixels.
    *   Accuracy: (8 / 16) or 50%. Large number of differences.
    *   *Objects: Input - 1 yellow, 1 maroon; Output - 2 yellow*
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: A horizontal yellow line (color 4) and a maroon pixel (color 9).
    *   Output: A 4x2 grid of alternating yellow and black. Note, one column of yellow pixels in the ouput has a black pixel at the bottom.
    *   Accuracy: (7 / 16) - 43.75%. Many differences.
    *   *Objects: Input - 1 yellow, 1 maroon; Output - 2 yellow*

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Two vertical yellow lines (color 4).
    *   Output: A 4x2 grid with alternating yellow and black pixels.
    *   Accuracy (6/16) - 37.5%. Many differences.
    *   *Objects: Input - 1 yellow, 1 maroon; Output - 2 yellow*

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: A horizontal yellow line (color 4) and three vertical blue pixels at top left.
    *   Output: Contains 2 blue and some yellow.
    *   Accuracy (5/16) - 31.25%. Many differences.
    *   *Objects: Input - 1 yellow, 1 blue; Output - 1 yellow, 1 blue*

*   **Example 5:**
    *   Input: all maroon (color 9)
    *   Output: All Black (color 0)
    *   Accuracy (16/64) 25%. Many differences
    *   *Objects: Input - 1 maroon, output - 1 white*

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
observations:
  - example: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: 4  # Yellow
        shape: rectangle
        count: 1
      - color: 9  # Maroon
        shape: single pixel
        count: 1
    output_objects:
      - color: 4 #yellow
        count: 2
        shape: vertical line segment
    notes: "Output is a 4x4 grid with alternating yellow and black columns, starting with yellow. The output size is always the same 4x4. Input sizes vary"

  - example: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: 4
        shape: horizontal line
        count: 1
      - color: 9
        shape: single pixel
        count: 1
    output_objects:
      - color: 4
        count: 2
        shape: vertical line segments
    notes: "Output is 4x4, alternating yellow and black columns, starting with yellow, last row is black"

  - example: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: 4
        shape: two vertical lines
        count: 1
      - color: 9
        shape: none
        count: 0
    output_objects:
     - color: 4 #yellow
       count: 2
       shape: vertical line segment
    notes: "Output is 4x4, alternating yellow/black columns, starting with yellow."

  - example: 4
    input_objects:
      - color: 1  # Blue
        shape: vertical line
        count: 1
      - color: 4  # Yellow
        shape: horizontal line
        count: 1
      - color: 9
        shape: none
        count: 0
    output_objects:
        - color: 4
          count: 1
        - color: 1
          count: 1
    notes: "Output is 4x4. Two blue cells in the 3rd column"

  - example: 5
    input_objects:
      - color: 9
        shape: rectangle
        count: 1
    output_objects:
      - color: 0
        count: 1
    notes: all black output, 4x4
general:
  output_size: "4x4"
  colors:
    present_in_all: [0]
    sometimes_present: [1,4,9]

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Fixed Output Size:** The output grid is always 4x4.
2.  **Default Background:** The output grid is filled with black (color 0) by default.
3.  **Yellow Columns:** If there's a yellow (color 4) object in the input, create two columns in the output grid. The first column is at index 1, the second at index 3.
4.  **Blue Overlay:** If there's a blue (color 1) object in the *top left* of the input, place two blue pixels vertically starting at the top of column 2 in the output grid.

This program attempts to capture the common pattern of the alternating yellow columns while handling the special case of the blue pixels in Example 4 and all black in example 5.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
