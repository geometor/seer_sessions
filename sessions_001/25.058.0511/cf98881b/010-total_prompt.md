Previous Code:
```python

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program focused on extracting columns starting with specific colors (yellow, white, blue, and maroon).  While this worked for the first training example, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex rule. The core issue is that the transformation isn't *just* about selecting columns based on the top pixel's color. The output dimensions and structure aren't solely determined by the presence of those colors. It appears the height of the extracted subgrids plays an essential part of the transformation. It's not about extracting *entire* columns.

My strategy is as follows:

1. **Detailed Example Analysis:**  I'll use code execution to get the dimensions of each input and output grid, and I will carefully examine the pixel values in each example, particularly where the provided code's logic fails.
2. **Identify the True Rule:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll formulate a more accurate description of the transformation, likely involving identifying sub-grids within columns that begin with the specified colors. The height of the subgrids from the examples will be the key factor.
3. **Refine the Natural Language Program:**  I'll update the natural language program to reflect the corrected transformation logic, ensuring it's clear, concise, and accurately captures the input-to-output relationship.
4. **Fact Documentation:** Organize observations into the requested YAML format.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I'll use `code_execution` to gather information about each input/output pair.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    output_shape = output_grid.shape
    
    # Check the colors in first row of the input
    first_row_colors = input_grid[0, :].tolist()
    
    # Target colors: 4, 0, 1, 9
    
    print(f"Input shape: {input_shape}, Output shape: {output_shape}")
    print(f"Colors in the first row of input: {first_row_colors}")

examples = [
    ([[4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 4, 1],
      [4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 5, 4, 8, 6],
      [8, 5, 8, 7, 5, 7, 4, 6, 9],
      [6, 8, 5, 8, 2, 5, 3, 5, 7],
      [5, 2, 3, 7, 9, 1, 9, 8, 6]],
     [[4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 4, 1],
      [4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 5, 4, 8, 6]]),
      
    ([[0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 8, 0, 5, 7, 7],
      [7, 5, 7, 7, 3, 7, 9, 6, 2, 9],
      [8, 6, 2, 4, 4, 7, 5, 2, 8, 5],
      [3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 4, 8, 4, 2, 5],
      [2, 8, 4, 1, 1, 4, 6, 4, 5, 9],
      [0, 1, 8, 7, 7, 1, 7, 5, 3, 7],
      [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 4, 2, 4, 0],
      [7, 7, 5, 1, 8, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2]],
     [[0, 0, 0],
      [7, 9, 2]]),
    
    ([[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
     [2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9],
     [7, 7, 5, 4, 0, 8, 2, 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 4, 2, 3, 8],
     [6, 3, 9, 6, 4, 7, 8, 6, 8, 5, 7, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]],
    [[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
     [2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9]])
]

for i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"--- Example {i+1} ---")
    analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
