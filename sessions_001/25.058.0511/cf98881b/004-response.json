            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a single example and, as expected, doesn't generalize well to the other examples in the training set. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis was too specific. The provided `transform` function isn't included in the code, but from the results, it is doing *something*. We need to discern what the actual transformation rule is by looking at *all* examples, not just the first one. The provided `get_objects` and `analyze_results` are very helpful for debugging. It reveals the need for a more robust rule that accounts for various object configurations and colors. The strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Examine all examples:** Carefully analyze the input and output grids for each example, paying close attention to the object analysis provided by the existing code.\n2.  **Identify common patterns:** Look for consistent relationships between input and output objects, considering color, position, size, and arrangement.\n3.  **Formulate a general rule:** Develop a natural language description of the transformation that applies to all examples.\n4.  **Prepare for coding:** Use the YAML block to capture specific observations that will help translate the natural language program into Python code.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using the provided analysis output):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: A yellow rectangle (color 4) and a maroon pixel (color 9).\n    *   Output: A 4x2 grid with alternating yellow and black pixels.\n    *   Accuracy: (8 / 16) or 50%. Large number of differences.\n    *   *Objects: Input - 1 yellow, 1 maroon; Output - 2 yellow*\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: A horizontal yellow line (color 4) and a maroon pixel (color 9).\n    *   Output: A 4x2 grid of alternating yellow and black. Note, one column of yellow pixels in the ouput has a black pixel at the bottom.\n    *   Accuracy: (7 / 16) - 43.75%. Many differences.\n    *   *Objects: Input - 1 yellow, 1 maroon; Output - 2 yellow*\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Two vertical yellow lines (color 4).\n    *   Output: A 4x2 grid with alternating yellow and black pixels.\n    *   Accuracy (6/16) - 37.5%. Many differences.\n    *   *Objects: Input - 1 yellow, 1 maroon; Output - 2 yellow*\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: A horizontal yellow line (color 4) and three vertical blue pixels at top left.\n    *   Output: Contains 2 blue and some yellow.\n    *   Accuracy (5/16) - 31.25%. Many differences.\n    *   *Objects: Input - 1 yellow, 1 blue; Output - 1 yellow, 1 blue*\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input: all maroon (color 9)\n    *   Output: All Black (color 0)\n    *   Accuracy (16/64) 25%. Many differences\n    *   *Objects: Input - 1 maroon, output - 1 white*\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: 4  # Yellow\n        shape: rectangle\n        count: 1\n      - color: 9  # Maroon\n        shape: single pixel\n        count: 1\n    output_objects:\n      - color: 4 #yellow\n        count: 2\n        shape: vertical line segment\n    notes: \"Output is a 4x4 grid with alternating yellow and black columns, starting with yellow.

The first column is at index 1, the second at index 3.\n4.  **Blue Overlay:** If there's a blue (color 1) object in the *top left* of the input, place two blue pixels vertically starting at the top of column 2 in the output grid.\n\nThis program attempts to capture the common pattern of the alternating yellow columns while handling the special case of the blue pixels in Example 4 and all black in example 5.\n"
