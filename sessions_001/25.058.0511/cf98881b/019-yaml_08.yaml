  - actions:
      - type: column_selection
        description: A subset of columns from the input grid is selected.
      - type: color_preservation
        description: Only specific colors from input are retained; the others are discarded.
      - type: rearrangement
        description: objects are rearranged
  - relationships:
      - input_to_output: "Many-to-one, as the output grid is smaller and contains a subset of the input grid's elements."
      - spatial: The output seems to represent a "zoomed-in" or cropped and rearranged view of a section of the input grid.
