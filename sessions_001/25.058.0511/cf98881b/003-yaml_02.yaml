task:
  name: "Color and Spatial Pattern Extraction"
  overall_strategy: "Determine a consistent rule set for extracting and arranging specific colors and patterns into a 4x4 grid."
  observations:
    - The output grid is always 4x4.
    - Only colors 0, 1, 4, and 9 are present in the output.
    - Red (2) is always eliminated.
    - Column 1:
        - Contains a 4 if yellow exists in input, 9 if there is maroon in the first column of input and 0 otherwise.
    - Column 2:
        -  Contains 4 in every row where there is a horizontal line of yellow in the input. Otherwise 0.
    - Column 3:
        - If there's a configuration in the input where a 0 is immediately to the left of a 9, the output at [0,2] is 0.
        - If there is a 9 above 9, the output in [1,2] is 9.
        - If there is a 1 above 1, the output in [2,2] is 1.
        - If there is 4 under 1, the output in [3,2] is 4
    - Column 4:
        - Contains 4 if there is a line of at least one yellow in the fourth row of the input, at that row. Otherwise 0.
