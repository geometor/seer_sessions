Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** find the minimum bounding rectangle, this means finding the top-most, left-most, bottom-most and right most yellow pixels.
3.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Extract the region defined by top-most, left-most, bottom-most and right-most rows and columns.
4. return the cropped grid

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert input grid to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Find coordinates of all yellow pixels (value 4)
    yellow_pixels = np.argwhere(input_array == 4)

    # If no yellow pixels are found, return an empty grid or handle appropriately
    if yellow_pixels.size == 0:
        return np.zeros((0, 0), dtype=int).tolist()

    # Determine the bounding box
    min_row = yellow_pixels[:, 0].min()
    max_row = yellow_pixels[:, 0].max()
    min_col = yellow_pixels[:, 1].min()
    max_col = yellow_pixels[:, 1].max()

    output_array = input_array[min_row:max_row+1, min_col:max_col+1]

    return output_array.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focuses on identifying yellow pixels and extracting a bounding box around them. This approach works for the first training example but fails on the others. The other examples suggest a more complex transformation rule is at play, possibly involving other colors or spatial relationships beyond just the yellow pixels. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis (bounding box around yellow) is too specific and doesn't generalize.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Broaden Observation:** We need to shift from focusing solely on yellow pixels to observing all colors and their spatial relationships within the input and output grids.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** Compare each input-output pair meticulously. Look for patterns in how *all* colors change, not just yellow. Are there consistent shifts, replacements, or movements?
3.  **Object Identification:** Try to identify "objects" based on contiguous blocks of the same color. Do these objects move, change color, or interact?
4.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Develop a new natural language program that accounts for the observed patterns across *all* training examples, not just the first.
5. **Consider Edge Cases:** Notice some return empty grids. Be sure to document those observations.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To get accurate information, I will make observation notes on each example.

**Example 0:**

*   Input: 10x10 grid. Yellow pixels present. Other colors include blue, red, green and black.
*   Output: 4x6 subgrid containing only the yellow pixels, cropping the original.
*   Code Result: Correct. The bounding box around yellow pixels matches the output.
*   **Observation Notes:** Looks like a crop to a bounding box around the yellow pixels.

**Example 1:**

*   Input: 18x18 grid. Yellow pixels in two separated, same size regions. Other colors: gray.
*   Output: 3x5 subgrid, the left most yellow region, same size as the other region.
*   Code Result: Incorrect. Extracts a 6x11 subgrid including *both* yellow regions.
*   **Observation Notes**: There are two distinct yellow regions of the same size, and only the left region is present in the output.

**Example 2:**

*   Input: 13x18 grid. Yellow Pixels exist as 2 1x2 rectangles, Other colors: blue.
*   Output: 0x0 empty grid
*   Code Result: Incorrect. Returns a 1x5 block including both sets of yellow pixels.
*   **Observation Notes**: Should return an empty grid.

**Example 3:**

*   Input: 11x11 grid. Yellow Pixels exist as one 1x2 rectangle, one 1x3 rectangle, one 3x1 rectangle. Other Colors: red, black
*   Output: 0x0 empty grid
*   Code Result: Incorrect. Returns the bounding box, 3x6, around all of the yellow pixels.
*   **Observation Notes**: Should return an empty grid.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Yellow Regions:** Locate all distinct regions of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. A region is defined as a contiguous block of yellow pixels.
2. **Count Yellow Regions:**
    * If the number of distinct yellow regions is greater than 1, the output will be a 0x0 empty grid.
    * If there is only one yellow region in the input, extract the minimum bounding box containing all the yellow pixels.
3.  **Return:** The extracted sub-grid or empty grid, as appropriate.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
